The services proposed by Clonaid were manifestly contrary to Swiss public order. The court further observed that criminal complaints had been filed against the Raelian Movement alleging the existence of sexual practices that were intended to systematically corrupt young teenagers. The content of the works on \u201cgeniocracy\u201d and \u201csensual meditation\u201d could lead certain adults to sexually abuse children, the child being described in certain works as a \u201cprivileged sexual object\u201d.

Firstly, the [applicant] association\u2019s website contains a link to that of Clonaid, via which this company offers specific cloning-related services to the general public and announced, in early 2003, the birth of cloned babies. Cloning is prohibited under Swiss law, pursuant to Art.\u00a0119 of the Constitution and to the Medically-Assisted Reproduction Act (RS 814.90).

In the Chamber\u2019s view, such interference was prescribed by law and pursued the legitimate aims of prevention of crime, protection of health and morals and protection of the rights of others. Turning then to the necessity of the interference, the Chamber, after noting that it found itself confronted for the first time with the question whether the domestic authorities should allow an association, by making public space available to it, to disseminate its ideas through a poster campaign, emphasised that whilst it was not in dispute that the poster in question contained nothing unlawful or shocking, either in its text or in its illustrations, it had displayed the applicant association\u2019s website address. Taking into account the general context of the poster, and in particular the ideas imparted by the website and the links to other sites from that website, the Chamber pointed out that this modern means of conveying information and the fact that it was accessible to everyone, including minors, would have multiplied the impact of the poster campaign. Observing that the Swiss courts had carefully reasoned their decisions, and also taking into account the limited scope of the impugned ban, which did not extend to the association itself or to its website, the Chamber took the view that the competent authorities had not overstepped the wide margin of appreciation afforded to them as regards regulation of the extended use of public space. The Chamber thus held that there had been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention.",

Portugal (no. 31276/05, 3 February 2009), where the Court had criticised a ban on disseminating ideas contrary to those of the majority.

The applicant association argued that it found itself in a situation where it was prevented from disseminating its ideas through posters on the ground that there were other means of communication it could use, in particular the Internet, but when it displayed the address of its website on a poster, it was prohibited from doing so on the pretext that this created a link with its ideas, which were allegedly dangerous for the public.

Ireland, no.\u00a044179/98, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2003IX). In that connection, the Government criticised the dissenting opinion annexed to the Chamber judgment, considering that it placed too much weight on the distinction between positive and negative obligations in determining the extent of the margin of appreciation. In the Government\u2019s submission, the present case fell into the category of cases where the characterisation of the obligation as negative or positive depended on how the question was formulated: whether the authorities were criticised for having done something or for failing to do something. They admitted that it would be different if, unlike the situation in the present case, access to public space were not subjected to any restriction or authorisation.",

Accordingly, in the present case it might perhaps have been disproportionate to ban the association itself or its website on the basis of the above-mentioned factors (see, in this connection, Association Rhino and Others v. , no. 48848/07, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67, 11 October 2011). To limit the scope of the impugned restriction to the display of posters in public places was thus a way of ensuring the minimum impairment of the applicant association\u2019s rights. The Court reiterates in this connection that the authorities are required, when they decide to restrict fundamental rights, to choose the means that cause the least possible prejudice to the rights in question (see Women On Waves, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041). In view of the fact that the applicant association is able to continue to disseminate its ideas through its website, and through other means at its disposal such as the distribution of leaflets in the street or in letter-boxes, the impugned measure cannot be said to be disproportionate.",

Nevertheless, there are elements in the case which suggest that it was the positive obligations of the State which were primarily at stake. In this regard, I consider it to be of importance that the applicant\u2019s complaint relates not to a general restriction imposed on the association\u2019s activities or on its freedom to disseminate or impart information to the general public about its existence or its aims and beliefs. This, as is pointed out in the judgment, the association remained free to do by displaying its posters on private property or by distributing leaflets or by using other means of publicity, such as the print or broadcast media or through the medium of the association\u2019s own internet website. The complaint is a much more specific one, namely the refusal of the municipal authorities to authorise, in the exercise of its regulatory powers, the use by the association of public billboards in the city to display a particular poster for a specified period as part of an extensive poster campaign. In this respect the case has certain similarities to that of Appleby and Others v. the United Kingdom (no. 44306/98, ECHR 2003-VI), in which the restriction on the applicants\u2019 ability to communicate their views was limited to the entrance areas and passageways of a shopping mall and in which the Court\u2019s conclusion that the State was not in breach of its positive obligations under Article 10 was in part founded on the fact that the applicants had not been prevented from disseminating those views in other parts of the town or by other means. It is true that, in the Appleby case, the mall in question belonged to a private company, while the billboards in the present case were erected in public areas within the exclusive control of the municipality. Nevertheless, Article 10 cannot in my view be interpreted as imposing an obligation on national authorities to provide unconditional and unrestricted access to the use of public facilities to impart information or ideas. The case of Women on Waves and Others v. Portugal (no. 31276/05, 3\u00a0February 2009), on which reliance is placed by the applicant association, is no authority to the contrary, involving as it did the extreme measure of a general prohibition on a ship entering the State\u2019s territorial waters, a space which was, as the Court found in that case, \u201cpublic and open by its very nature\u201d.",

I do not agree. I find nothing contradictory in a decision to refuse permission for public facilities to be used for the purposes of advertising a website, while at the same time taking no steps to close down or restrict access to the website. Like the majority of the Court, I consider that the limited nature of the measures in question served, if anything, to confirm the proportionality of the measures. I am similarly unpersuaded by the applicant\u2019s argument that the lack of necessity of the measures is demonstrated by the fact that in other States, and even other regions of Switzerland, the poster campaign was accepted by the authorities - an argument which has, as noted in paragraph 64 of the judgment, been rejected by the Court in its previous case-law.",

In addition, certain passages in the works of the founder of the association on the practice of \u201csensual meditation\u201d which could be downloaded from the website could lead adults to commit acts of sexual abuse against children, a fact which the Federal Court found had not been disputed by the association itself.

In the present case \u2013 and this is essential in our view \u2013 the facts set out by the Federal Court were not regarded by the domestic authorities as capable of justifying the banning of the applicant association itself. In those circumstances, it may be questioned whether there was a \u201cpressing social need\u201d to ban a poster campaign without at the same time banning the applicant association, which had existed since 1977, especially where the prevention of particularly serious criminal offences, such as those against children, was at stake. The reasons put forward in this connection by the domestic courts, whilst probably being \u201crelevant\u201d, do not however appear \u201csufficient\u201d to justify the impugned interference with the applicant association\u2019s freedom of expression; the Federal Court indeed failed to explain how, why and to what extent that ban was proportionate to and necessary for the legitimate aim of preventing crime. Moreover, neither in the reasons given by the domestic courts, nor in the Government\u2019s observations before the Court, do we find any indication that there was a clear and imminent danger which justified the impugned interference (see G\u00fcl and Others v. , no. 4870/02, \u00a7 42, 8 June 2010, and K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 and Eren v. , no. 43807/07, \u00a7 29, 29\u00a0November 2011).",

In itself, we obviously do not find that this situation raises any issue. Our Court has acknowledged that sensitivities may legitimately differ within a single State, even if this should entail diversified policies in terms of restrictions on fundamental rights. In the Court\u2019s view, \u201c[w]here there are disparate cultural communities residing within the same State, it may well be that different requirement[s], both moral and social, will face the governing authorities\u201d. This idea of a \u201cfederal margin of appreciation\u201d, as it could be called, was used for example in Handyside to explain and justify the variable nature of the proceedings brought against the publisher of the Little Red Schoolbook in different parts of the United Kingdom. It can also be perceived as an underlying idea in M\u00fcller v. Switzerland and Otto-Preminger-Institut v.\u00a0.

It is certainly necessary to combat the dangers and excesses of sects and a State may have to ban associations that seriously contravene democratic values. However, it is difficult to accept that a lawful association, with a website that has not been prohibited, should be prevented from promoting its ideas through posters that are not unlawful in themselves. As to the argument whereby, in accepting a poster campaign in public space, the municipal authorities would be endorsing or tolerating the opinions at issue, we find this not only rather unrealistic in relation to the current role of such authorities, but also dangerous. That would be tantamount to arguing, a contrario, that freedom of expression in public space could be restricted solely for the reason that the authorities disagree with the ideas conveyed.

The Court\u2019s case-law is scarce but enlightening in this regard. In Appleby and Others v. the United Kingdom, where the applicants had been refused permission to collect signatures for a petition in a private shopping centre, the Court found that it could not be inferred from Article\u00a010 of the European Convention on Human Rights that the State had a positive obligation to create rights of entry to private property or even to all publicly owned property, such as government offices and ministries, in order to assert the right to freedom of expression, if there were alternative and effective means for those concerned to convey their message. The Court did not exclude that such a positive obligation could arise, however, where the bar on access to property had the effect of preventing the effective exercise of freedom of expression or where it could be said that the essence of this right had been destroyed. In Murphy v.\u00a0Ireland the Court accepted that a provision which allowed the filtering by the State or any organ designated by it, on a case-by-case basis, of unacceptable or excessive religious advertising would be difficult to apply fairly, objectively and coherently. Thus, State action in this regard should be \u201cimpartial, neutral and balanced\u201d. In Women On Waves and Others v.\u00a0Portugal, the Court dealt with an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression in the respondent State\u2019s territorial waters, which were open by their very nature, with the consequence that any interference with freedom of expression within such space should be exceptional. Moreover, the Court reaffirmed that Article 10 protected not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they were conveyed.",

                        "content": "This question has, however, been examined for some time by the United States Supreme Court, which has construed the public-forum doctrine under the First Amendment to the US Federal Constitution. The public-forum doctrine has been refined over the years, culminating in Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Association, where the Supreme Court established a three-tier categorisation of public fora. The first category is the traditional public forum, which includes places which by long tradition or by government fiat have been devoted to assembly and debate. In a traditional public forum, the State may not restrict speech based on content, unless it can show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling State interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The second category is the limited public forum, defined as public property which the State has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity. Although the State need not indefinitely keep a limited public forum open to the public, while the forum is open any State restriction of speech in that forum will be under the same rules as those applicable to a traditional public forum. The third category is the non-public forum, which, by tradition or design, is not an appropriate platform for unrestrained communication. Here the State is granted much greater latitude in regulating freedom of expression. In addition to applying time, place and manner regulations, the State may reserve the forum for its intended purposes, as long as the regulation of speech is reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker\u2019s view. Thus, \u201cthe existence of a right of access to public property and the standard by which limitations upon such a right must be evaluated differ depending on the character of the property at issue\u201d. In the particular case of billboards, the Supreme Court decided that an ordinance which permitted on-site commercial advertising (a sign advertising goods or services available on the property where the sign was located), but forbade other commercial advertising and non-commercial advertising using fixed-structure signs, unless permitted by specified exceptions, such as temporary political-campaign signs, breached the freedom of expression of companies that were engaged in the outdoor advertising business.",

In the specific case of billboards and posters, the Supreme Court censured as unconstitutional the absolute prohibition of postering on public property and affirmed the right to post political advertisements on the sides of buses belonging to the public transportation system.",

The freedom of expression that Women On Waves guaranteed in the open maritime space of a State should also be acknowledged in its public space on land. The instant case provided an occasion to affirm that principle explicitly. In fact, the Court has constantly recognised that Article 10 \u00a7 2 leaves to the Contracting States a margin of appreciation, which is afforded both to the domestic legislature and to the bodies, judicial amongst others, that are called upon to interpret and apply the laws in force. However, this margin goes hand in hand with a European supervision. The Court has to satisfy itself that the interference in issue is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, that is to say, that it corresponds to a \u201cpressing social need\u201d and is \u201cproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued\u201d, the reasons given by the national authorities to justify the interference therefore being \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention. Thus, the interference with freedom of expression is justified if it complies with a two-tier test: the test of necessity and the test of proportionality. The test of necessity assesses whether the interference with the right or freedom adequately advances the \u201csocial need\u201d (social interests and rights and freedoms of others) pursued and reaches no further than necessary to meet said \u201csocial need\u201d. The test of proportionality evaluates whether a fair balancing of the competing rights, freedoms and interests has been achieved, whilst ensuring that the essence (or minimum core) of the right or freedom is respected. The formal characterisation of a place as a public forum in view of its principal function does not per se resolve the matter, but it is certainly a valuable element, among others, to ascertain the prevailing right, freedom or interest. In addition to this space element, the balancing also takes into consideration the nature, form and timing of the speech, the status of the speaker, the nature and degree of the interference and the nature of the social need to be met. Subject to the restrictions imposed by the social interests and \u201crights and freedoms of others\u201d foreseen in Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, freedom of expression in a public forum is applicable not only to ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the majority. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. To use the words of George Orwell, \u201cIf liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear\u201d.",

The State had to approve the content of every single book, every single piece of creative work, every single speech communicated in the public space.

If streets and parks of a city are the historical quintessential public fora, the Internet is today\u2019s global marketplace of ideas.

This principle of Internet neutrality imposes on both public and private Internet stakeholders (access providers, content-sharing platforms, search engines) an obligation not to refuse, provide or terminate in a discriminatory manner access to the Internet, with governments having the additional duty to ensure that all stakeholders are held accountable for violations of their users\u2019 freedom of expression and information.

One thing is clear: the speech of the Movement falls outside the commercial context, in which members of the public are induced to buy a particular product. Three reasons can be put forward to support this assessment. Firstly, profit was not a relevant purpose, let alone the main purpose, of the message of the Movement displayed on the poster or in its website. What was at stake in this communication was not the applicant association\u2019s \u201cpurely commercial\u201d interest. In fact, the applicant association does not even have a statutory profit-making purpose, since it is a non-profit association (association \u00e0 but non lucratif, according to Article\u00a01 of its Constitution, statuts r\u00e9vis\u00e9s de la religion ra\u00eblienne en Suisse). In addition, no sale was proposed on the poster and the products which were proposed for sale on the website, such as books, had an informational function, in accordance with the alleged pedagogical purpose (renseigner le grand public) of the Movement foreseen in Article 2 of the same Constitution. Secondly, the fact that the applicant association paid for the poster to be posted on the public billboards of the City of Neuch\u00e2tel is immaterial. Expression does not lose Convention protection to which it would otherwise be entitled simply because it appears in the form of a paid advertisement. Thirdly, the linking to the Clonaid website is also irrelevant, since the applicant association and Clonaid were at the material time \u2013 and still are \u2013 different legal entities. No evidence whatsoever was provided to the Court that the applicant association ever gained or even could have gained any profit from the cloning services made available by a third party.",

If in addition one takes into consideration, as did the domestic courts, the references on the applicant association\u2019s website to geniocracy and the campaign for women\u2019s rights, the speech in issue also takes on a clear political connotation, which is reinforced by a general criticism of the present-day model of social, political and economic structures of Western societies. Regardless of the intrinsic philosophical value of the speech, which is obviously not under the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, it is undeniable that it portrays a \u201cgeneral perspective of the world\u201d, a Weltanschauung.

The freedom of thought, conscience and religion guaranteed by the Convention entails freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion. The State may not unduly suppress or restrict free communication of all believers, agnostics, atheists and sceptics, under the guise of respecting the religious sentiment of the majority. Consequently, freedom of expression allows for criticism of religion, churches, religious institutions and the clergy, as long as it does not derail into defamation (i.e., deliberate insult of persons and institutions), or hate speech (i.e., promotion of hatred against a religious group) or blasphemous speech (i.e., wilful deprecation of a particular religion by denigrating its doctrine or its deities). The line between criticism in religious matters and blasphemy is a very thin one, as European history has shown. In drawing that line, the Court departs from a civil libertarian doctrine, according to which freedom of expression should always prevail over freedom of religion, as well as from an opposite State-centred view, which would defer to public authorities unlimited power to regulate expression in public space according to the religious sentiment of the majority. Neither one nor the other extreme view is in accordance with the spirit of tolerance which is a feature of a democratic society. Only an approach that seeks to balance free speech and the freedom of others to hold religious beliefs is compatible with the Convention. Indeed, the Court has frequently emphasised the State\u2019s fundamental role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and has stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. It also considers that the State\u2019s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State\u2019s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed.

In addition, even if the applicant association\u2019s message was restricted to its religious aspects and its website was considered a mere religious advertisement, Murphy would still not be applicable to the current case, since a website is not analogous to broadcasting.

The mere fact that public authorities choose to interfere with a limited means of communication does not excuse them from having to provide a convincing argument to support the pressing social need for the interference. Moreover, since the poster ban was based on the content of the website, the applicant association can legitimately fear that questions concerning the legality of the site itself will arise later on and that this alleged alternative will be suppressed in the near future. This places the applicant association in a situation of uncertainty that is hardly compatible with the spirit of Article 10 of the Convention. It would thus suffice for a city or a State to decide that it did not wish its name to be associated with certain non-majority but lawful ideas in order to justify a systematic denial and oppose the expression of such ideas in public on a permanent basis.

Prior to these rejections of 2001 and 2004, a request to publish on a billboard in the public space of Neuch\u00e2tel had already been refused in 1999. These facts show an inadmissible pattern of content-based discriminatory conduct of public authorities towards a minority. The systematic prohibition of any expression through billboards and posters in a public area casts strong doubt on the objectiveness and impartiality of the State conduct. And where there is no objective or impartial judgment, there is no proportionality assessment, but rather arbitrariness. Content-based expression control ends up as pure speaker-based discrimination.
