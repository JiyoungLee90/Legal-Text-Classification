The Constitutional Court also ruled that, given the significance of the question raised by the Itoiz dam's construction, which could not simply be ignored, it was justifiable that the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Autonomous Community law of 1996 specifically mentioned the aim and means of environmental protection in the peripheral protection zones around the three above-mentioned nature reserves.",

Greece (9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-B) and Papageorgiou v. Greece (22 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VI), the Constitutional Court examined whether the impossibility of executing the Supreme Court's judgment as a consequence of the enactment of the Autonomous Community law of 1996 was justified in view of the values and assets protected by the Constitution. Having held that environmental protection was enshrined in the Constitution, the Constitutional Court examined whether the prejudice arising from the failure to execute the judgment in issue was proportionate to the protected or disputed interests or was on the other hand purposeless, excessive or the cause of a clear imbalance between the interests at stake. It found that both the Supreme Court's judgment of 14 July 1997 and the new Autonomous Community law of 1996 were intended to guarantee the existence of a peripheral protection zone around the three nature reserves affected by the dam's construction. The Constitutional Court further noted that the system of peripheral protection zones introduced by this new law had not in itself been considered arbitrary in the Audiencia Nacional's decision; nor had the zones' new boundaries been held responsible for the serious deterioration of the environment. Accordingly, it held that the balance of general interests had been respected and that there was no clear lack of proportion between the conflicting interests. Consequently, the impugned provisions could not be held to be contrary to Article 24 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.",

In addition, they submitted that, as members of the Coordinadora de Itoiz association since its formation in 1988, they had taken part in the proceedings with that association as their intermediary. They stressed the indisputable direct link between them and the damage that would be sustained from the dam's construction, and submitted that the remedy used was the only one which, if successful, would have allowed for the definitive protection of their civil rights and interests. In this connection, they stressed that they would have been acting unreasonably had each of them brought a separate individual appeal against the proposed dam and thus entered long and costly proceedings with the same final outcome as that achieved by the association. Moreover, it was clear that, from the outset, they had entrusted the association with the defence of their civil rights and interests.

The Court notes at the outset that the question of victim status, for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention, is, in the instant case, closely linked to the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies contained in Article 35 \u00a7 1. As regards the last point, it reiterates that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see, among other authorities, Cardot v. France, judgment of 19\u00a0March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, \u00a7 34). The Court has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 40, p. 18, \u00a7 35). This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned, but also of the context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him to exhaust domestic remedies (see, mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16\u00a0September 1996, Reports 1996-IV, p. 1211, \u00a7 69; Aksoy v. Turkey, 18\u00a0December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2276, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54; and Baumann v.

In addition, the proceedings before the domestic courts, through the intermediary of the association, concerned not only a dispute over the lawfulness of the ministerial decree authorising the relevant work in the light of the applicable legislation on the construction of dams, but also emphasised the project's impact on the property rights and lifestyles of the association's members due to the change in their place of residence. In its appeals, the applicant association, acting on behalf of its members, repeatedly emphasised that the dam's construction would lead to the flooding of several small villages, including the hamlet of Itoiz, where the applicants had their family homes. From this perspective, it is undeniable that the public-works project, with all that it entailed (expropriation of property, population displacement) had direct and far-reaching consequences both on the applicants' property rights and on their families' lifestyles (see, mutatis mutandis, Association des amis de Saint-Rapha\u00ebl et de Fr\u00e9jus and Others, cited above, p. 131). Admittedly, the applicants were not parties to the impugned proceedings in their own name, but through the intermediary of the association which they had set up with a view to defending their interests. However, like the other provisions of the Convention, the term \u201cvictim\u201d in Article 34 must also be interpreted in an evolutive manner in the light of conditions in contemporary society. And indeed, in modern-day societies, when citizens are confronted with particularly complex administrative decisions, recourse to collective bodies such as associations is one of the accessible means, sometimes the only means, available to them whereby they can defend their particular interests effectively. Moreover, the standing of associations to bring legal proceedings in defence of their members' interests is recognised by the legislation of most European countries. That is precisely the situation that obtained in the present case. The Court cannot disregard that fact when interpreting the concept of \u201cvictim\u201d. Any other, excessively formalistic, interpretation of that concept would make protection of the rights guaranteed by the Convention ineffectual and illusory.",

Moreover, the general scope of the law had been expressly recognised by both the Audiencia Nacional and the Constitutional Court.

In their opinion, the civil rights of the association's members had been at stake from the outset of the proceedings, in that their possessions and lifestyles were likely to be decisively affected by the proposed dam. Thus, in the memorial filed by the association against the ministerial decree of 2 November 1990, it was clearly stated that construction of the dam would entail the expropriation of a whole series of farming and other properties as well as displacement of the population concerned. Those consequences, in terms of the assets and individuals affected by the dam's construction, were pointed out on numerous occasions by the applicant association in the course of the various proceedings.

Admittedly, it cannot be ruled out that some form of consultation took place between those State authorities which submitted their observations to the Constitutional Court. However, a major difference between the instant case and Ruiz-Mateos lies in the fact that all the memorials filed by the applicants through the applicant association in support of their arguments as to the unconstitutionality of the Autonomous Community law of 1996 (memorials dating from September 1997 to January 2000) were forwarded by the Audiencia Nacional to the Constitutional Court, which formally joined them to the case file before ruling on the question of constitutionality. Another distinguishing feature between the two cases is that, in the earlier case, the Ruiz-Mateos family asked the Constitutional Court for leave to take part in the proceedings, a request that was dismissed by that court (see Ruiz-Mateos, p. 13, \u00a7\u00a7 17-18).

Where administrative authorities refuse or fail to comply, or even delay doing so, the guarantees enjoyed under Article 6 by a litigant during the judicial phase of the proceedings are rendered devoid of purpose (see Antonetto v. Italy, no. 15918/89, \u00a7 28, 20 July 2000).

In the instant case, the enactment of the Autonomous Community law of 1996 was certainly not intended to remove jurisdiction from those Spanish courts called upon to examine the lawfulness of the dam project. Admittedly, the explanatory memorandum referred specifically to the peripheral protection zones around the nature reserves affected by the dam and to the law's objective. Nevertheless, the disputed law concerned all of Navarre's protected nature reserves and natural sites, and not only the area affected by construction of the dam. Its general application is not open to doubt. In addition, the parliament of Navarre did not enact legislation with retrospective effect, as was proved by the fact that, notwithstanding the enactment of the Autonomous Community law on 17 June 1996, the Supreme Court, a few weeks after adoption of the law, delivered a judgment which partly but definitively cancelled the original dam project. Whilst it is undeniable that the parliament of Navarre's enactment of the law in question was ultimately unfavourable for the arguments put forward by the applicants, it cannot be said that the text was approved for the purpose of circumventing the principle of the rule of law. In any event, once the Autonomous Community law had been enacted, the applicants' request for a preliminary ruling by the Constitutional Court on the constitutionality of some of its provisions was granted, and that court ruled on the merits of their complaints. Before the Constitutional Court, the applicants' arguments were examined on the same footing as those submitted by the government and the parliament of Navarre.
