In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7\u00a028, ECHR 1999I). In the present cases, there is nothing in the case file indicating that the courts lacked impartiality or that the proceedings were otherwise unfair. Moreover, in the absence of any elements of arbitrariness, the Court is satisfied that the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 or any other provision of the Convention were not impaired. These complaints are therefore manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3, and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",
