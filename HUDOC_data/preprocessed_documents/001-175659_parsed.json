Consequently, the applicant was also depressed, had suicidal thoughts and avoided contact with members of her family and friends.

In respect of pecuniary damage, the Lisbon Administrative Court awarded her EUR\u00a092,000, of which EUR 16,000 was for the services of a maid the applicant had had to hire to help her with household tasks.",

On the contrary, it had been based on the fact that the Supreme Administrative Court had considered that the medical intervention had not been the only cause of the physical and psychological damage which the applicant had complained of. In that regard the Government emphasised that the amount awarded by the Supreme Administrative Court had been attributable to the fact that the applicant\u2019s gynaecological problem had developed a long time earlier, that she had already been treated unsuccessfully several times and that she had already been suffering unbearable pain and symptoms of depression before the operation.

These included any life-threatening risks; the number of medical procedures plaintiffs had undergone; the kind of treatment (the degree of pain) applied; whether the injuries caused by the medical error could be reversed; and the degree of loss of autonomy and subsequent dependence on others in the essential tasks of everyday life.

Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a difference in treatment (see, inter alia, Biao v.

The notion of discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 also includes cases where a person or group is treated, without proper justification, less favourably than another, even though the more favourable treatment is not called for by the Convention (see Khamtokhu and Aksenchik v.

It lists specific grounds which constitute \u201cstatus\u201d including, inter alia, sex, race and property. The words \u201cother status\u201d have generally been given a wide meaning, and their interpretation has not been limited to characteristics which are personal in the sense that they are innate or inherent (see Carson and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 70, ECHR 2010, and Clift v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 7205/07, \u00a7\u00a7 56-58, 13 July 2010). In this regard, the Court has recognised that age might constitute \u201cother status\u201d for the purposes of Article 14 of the Convention (see, for example, Schwizgebel v.\u00a0Switzerland, no.\u00a025762/07, \u00a7 85, ECHR 2010 (extracts)), although it has not, to date, suggested that discrimination on grounds of age should be equated with other \u201csuspect\u201d grounds of discrimination (British Gurkha Welfare Society and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 44818/11, \u00a7 88, 15\u00a0September 2016).",

Switzerland, 24 June 1993, \u00a7 67, Series A no. 263). In particular, references to traditions, general assumptions or prevailing social attitudes in a particular country are insufficient justification for a difference in treatment on the grounds of sex. For example, in a case concerning the bearing of a woman\u2019s maiden name after marriage, it considered that the importance attached to the principle of non-discrimination prevented States from imposing traditions that derive from the man\u2019s primordial role and the woman\u2019s secondary role in the family (see \u00dcnal Tekeli v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a029865/96, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2004X (extracts)).

The national authorities are thus, in principle, better placed than an international court to evaluate what is adequate compensation for the specific damage suffered by an individual.

The question at issue here is not considerations of age or sex as such, but rather the assumption that sexuality is not as important for a fifty-year-old woman and mother of two children as for someone of a younger age. That assumption reflects a traditional idea of female sexuality as being essentially linked to child-bearing purposes and thus ignores its physical and psychological relevance for the self-fulfilment of women as people. Apart from being, in a way, judgmental, it omitted to take into consideration other dimensions of women\u2019s sexuality in the specific case of the applicant. In other words, in the instant case the Supreme Administrative Court made a general assumption without attempting to look at its validity in the specific case of the applicant herself, who was fifty at the time of the operation at issue (see, mutatis mutandis, Schuler-Zgraggen, cited above, \u00a7 67).",

It is true that in lowering the amount the Supreme Administrative Court also took it for granted that the pain suffered by the applicant was not new. Nevertheless, the applicant\u2019s age and sex appear to have been decisive factors in the final decision, introducing a difference of treatment based on those grounds (see, mutatis mutandis, Salgueiro da Silva Mouta v. Portugal, no. 33290/96, \u00a7 35, ECHR 1999IX; Schuler-Zgraggen, cited above, \u00a7 67; and, conversely, Sousa Goucha, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 64-65). This approach is also reflected in the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court to lower the amount awarded to the applicant in respect of the costs of a maid on the grounds that she \u201cprobably only needed to take care of her husband\u201d given her children\u2019s age at the material time (see paragraph 16 above).",

The Supreme Court of Justice found in those cases that the fact that the men could no longer have normal sexual relations had affected their self-esteem and resulted in a \u201ctremendous blow\u201d and \u201csevere mental trauma\u201d (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). In view of its findings, the Supreme Court of Justice awarded EUR\u00a0224,459 and EUR\u00a0100,000 to the two male plaintiffs respectively. It follows from those cases that the domestic courts took into consideration the fact that the men could not have sexual relations and how that had affected them, regardless of their age. Contrary to the applicant\u2019s case, the Supreme Court of Justice did not take account of whether the plaintiffs already had children or not, or look at any other factors. In particular, in the judgment of 4 March 2008, it found that the fact that the impugned surgical procedure had left the plaintiff impotent and incontinent was enough to consider that non-pecuniary damage had been caused.",

In order for an issue to arise under Article\u00a014 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations. Although the list of potential discriminations is long, not every difference in treatment will amount to a violation of Article 14. It must be established that other persons in an analogous or relevantly similar situation enjoy preferential treatment and that this distinction is discriminatory (see Konstantin Markin v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a030078/06, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2012). It is moreover obvious that discrimination is prohibited only if it is related to certain protected grounds. Such difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2010).",

The question arises whether it is really necessary to identify these two categories of cases or whether it is not sufficient only to identify the case-law relating to men and to compare the amounts granted to men in general to those obtained by the applicant, and if these are lower, to find a difference in treatment. Such a simplified approach seems to be inadequate: if there is a set of judgments that show that men are granted sums in a certain range and that in the applicant\u2019s individual case, the amount is lower, this is the result of an erroneous judgment, departing from a more or less well-established case-law. It is admittedly difficult to make a clear-cut separation between an erroneous and a discriminatory application of a given legal provision to an individual case. At any rate, to find discrimination there has to be more than an individual departure from the case law \u2013 to be fixed by the domestic courts, as the European Court would engage in a fourth-instance exercise if it addressed such discrepancy \u2013 namely the evidence that such treatment flows from the application of general discriminatory behaviour (the terms of Konstantin Markin, cited above, \u00a7 125, should be recalled here). The distinction probably has to be made upon careful scrutiny of the reasoning underlying the domestic judgment to be examined. At any rate, however, it flows from the points developed below that in the present case there is not even a category of persons enjoying a certain preferential treatment to which the applicant, taken individually, could be compared. Moreover, a corrective to the absence of categories can be found in stereotyped reasoning amounting to discrimination, an issue dealt with below.",

That being said, it is necessary, in principle, to identify two sets of case-law, to compare them and to verify whether women are in general treated in a less favourable way than men. In this context, it is important to have a close look at the concept of case-law or \u201cjurisprudence\u201d, i.e. a series of judgments that provide the same or a similar answer to a certain legal problem. These judgments should be given by or under the surveillance of the same court, at the top of the hierarchy, and establish or confirm legal principles. Whereas a relatively small number of judgments is necessary to establish case-law as far as legal issues are concerned, at least if they emanate from superior courts, when it comes to looking at case-law concerning factual issues, e.g. the amount generally granted for a certain type of damage (e.g. the loss of a child), there has to be a much larger number of judgments in order to enable the detection of a general attitude by the courts.",

In this respect, the impugned judgment cites two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice that were given in 2008 and 2014 respectively (see paragraphs 25 and 26 of the judgment) relating to damages granted to two men.

There were consequently, in the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s view, two mitigating factors in respect of the overall compensation to be granted to the victim: her condition prior to the intervention and her age. The court added the element relating to the victim\u2019s age and to which, as can be seen from the wording of the judgment, it gave less weight than the causation issue: \u201cAdditionally, it should not be forgotten...\u201d.",

The majority do not address the age question but only concentrate on the gender issue. The argument about the gender stereotype used by the majority does not fit in the present case, simply because the impugned judgment does not use a language that points in such a direction; in its criticised part, the judgment only speaks about age. The situation would of course have been completely different, and there would have been a use of stereotype, if the domestic judgment had stated that women\u2019s sexual life is less important than that of men. However, the content of the impugned judgment can even be seen to indicate the contrary: the judgment quotes from the domestic judgments of 2008 and 2014 to the effect \u201cthat the fact that the men could no longer have normal sexual relations had affected their self-esteem and resulted in a \u2018tremendous shock\u2019 and \u2018strong mental shock\u2019\u201d. In the criticised judgment, the court underlines, inter alia, that the physical disabilities suffered had \u201c...limited her sexual activity, making her feel diminished as a woman\u201d and that she \u201c...felt deep disgust and frustration with the situation in which she finds herself, which has turned her into a very unhappy person ...\u201d.
