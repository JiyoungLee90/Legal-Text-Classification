In this regard, it is incumbent upon the relevant domestic authorities to ensure, in particular, that diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate (see Hummatov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, \u00a7 115, 29 November 2007; Melnik v.

No parcels, utensils, food, bottles of water or anything else were allowed. Furthermore, under point 28 of the Instruction, any food or beverage consumed by a detainee shall be provided by the detention facility only. However, due to his severe gastroenterological diseases and liver malfunction, and the lack of special diet food provided by the SIZO, the applicant usually consumed food delivered by his family while in the SIZO. Point 23 of the Instruction strictly prohibited any parcels or other deliveries to detainees in court. Moreover, under section 7 of the Law on Preliminary Detention any parcel for a detainee was to be delivered to the detention centre at designated times only, and was subject to monitoring by the authorities.
