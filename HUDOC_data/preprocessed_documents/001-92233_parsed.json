According to the decision, the enforcement inquiry was necessary because the applicant had debts amounting to FIM\u00a09.7\u00a0million subject to debt recovery.

The concealing of property, the reporting of liabilities that are false [or based on a sham transaction], and the giving of other false or misleading information are established as criminal offences in Chapter 39, Articles 2-5, of the Penal Code. The purpose of the powers of enforcement authorities to oblige the debtor to provide an account of his property, and of the coercive means available to ensure compliance with this obligation, is to make enforcement more efficient. Although it is possible to impose a threat of a fine to secure compliance with the obligation to give the information requested in connection with the enforcement inquiry, and a sentence may be ordered on a person concealing information or giving false information, the debtor is not, when complying with his or her obligation to give information on his or her property for the purposes of enforcement, a person charged with a criminal offence within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention, to whom the rights of the accused would apply.",

In his personal bankruptcy proceedings A. concealed those assets which he had received through aiding and abetting in the said offence. The Supreme Court held that the obligation of debtors to provide information exclusively served the interests of the enforcement procedure and was necessary for the purposes of protecting the interests of creditors. The purpose was that the administrator of the bankruptcy estate and the creditors got, through the debtor\u2019s cooperation, as reliable a picture as possible of the estate\u2019s assets and debts. The provision of information was not as such related to any criminal case or to the search for evidence relating to a suspected offence, and nor was the debtor providing information in the capacity of a suspect of an offence. Accordingly, the debtor had no right to conceal assets of the bankruptcy estate in the bankruptcy proceedings on the ground that he believed that by declaring the assets, he would have revealed that he had committed an offence relating to the origin of the assets or some other offence. A. had not therefore had any right not to declare the said assets in the bankruptcy procedure and he was accordingly convicted of debtor\u2019s fraud.",

Greece, judgment of 19 March 1997, application no. 18357/91, \u00a7 40). An enforcement inquiry was carried out when the enforcement of a judgment was not successful due to the debtor\u2019s unwillingness to comply with it. It was the creditor\u2019s right in a democratic society to request enforcement and the authorities\u2019 obligation to secure this right. In case the debtor was not compelled to co-cooperate, the execution was put at risk. It could therefore be argued that the obligation to give an overall account of one\u2019s assets and other financial means for the purposes of enforcement was to be regarded as forming part of normal civic duties in a democratic society. Consequently, the enforcement inquiry in the instant case could not be regarded as falling within the scope of Article 6 under its civil head which was thus not applicable.",

Enforcement again was a civil law procedure and did not imply any criminal suspicion against the debtor. The fine attached to the enforcement inquiry was of an administrative nature and the enforcement inquiry in no way amounted to a disguised form of criminal proceedings. The obligation to disclose income and capital for the purposes of the calculation and assessment of tax fell outside the scope of Article 6 as it would be difficult to envisage the Contracting States functioning effectively without it. The obligation to disclose income and capital for the purposes of the calculation of seizable assets in order to enforce the payment of debts formed an integral part of the execution of a judgment. The interests of a creditor to have a judgment executed were not less important in a democratic society than the interests of the tax authorities (the State) in obtaining appropriate information for taxation purposes.",

However, the debtor enjoyed effective protection against criminal charges that may be related to such information. The applicant had not alleged that any incriminating information had been used against him in criminal proceedings. The question is whether the present case concerned the use of compulsion for the purpose of obtaining information which might incriminate the person concerned in pending or anticipated criminal proceedings against him (see Weh v. Austria, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-44). An enforcement inquiry had no connection to criminal proceedings. This was also evident from the legislation hindering the use of information gathered in connection with an enforcement inquiry for any other purpose. The use of information obtained within enforcement procedures was prohibited in another context or for a purpose other than that serving the enforcement. Firstly, it resulted from the explicit provisions of the Enforcement Act that an enforcement inquiry may only be carried out to obtain the necessary information for the purpose of enforcement. The principle according to which any measures must be related to their purpose had also in other respects been applied to enforcement. In accordance with this principle, the Bailiff may only use his powers for their intended purpose. Secondly, his right to transmit information to other authorities, such as investigative authorities, was restricted by Chapter 3, section 34(g), of the Enforcement Act. This meant that the Bailiff could not disclose to prosecuting or investigative authorities information received from the debtor in an enforcement inquiry where the debtor could refuse to give such information in criminal proceedings due to a risk of criminal charges (compare and contrast Shannon v. United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40) where it had been open to the investigators to forward information to the police. Thirdly, the minutes from the enforcement inquiry was a confidential document. However, creditors who had applied for enforcement had, as parties to the debt recovery procedure, the right of access to the minutes. Section 23 of the Openness of Government Activities Act, however, meant that the creditor could use such information, for example for the purpose of instituting action for the recovery of assets, but it could not be used for the purpose of bringing charges against the debtor. It must be emphasised that the applicant had not been present when the enforcement inquiry was to be made. Thus, he gave no information whatsoever and consequently, no such information could be used against him. The mere fact that the applicant failed to arrive at the Bailiff\u2019s office, thus not replying to any possible questions - whether or not allegedly having any relevance to the present examination - motivated the administrative fine (see Allen v. the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom (dec.), no. 76574/01, ECHR 2002VIII). The Supreme Court noted in its judgment that the applicant alleged that the information from the enforcement inquiry would be used against him in the criminal investigation. The Supreme Court, however, found that this would be against the law, noting that according to the Bailiff, the inquiry would solely serve the purpose defined in the Enforcement Act. There had been no use of compulsion for the purposes of obtaining information which might incriminate the applicant in pending or anticipated criminal proceedings.",

Their rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities, thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6. The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resorting to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. In this sense the right in question is closely linked to the presumption of innocence contained in Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Saunders v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 68).",

Denmark, application no.\u00a013156/87, Commission decision of 1 July 1992, Decisions and Reports 73, p. 5), the Court notes that this principle has been refined in certain circumstances. In the case of Allenet de Ribemont v. France (10\u00a0February\u00a01995, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 308) the Court explained this refinement, pointing out that the Convention must be interpreted in such a way as to guarantee rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and illusory. Applying this approach to the present case, the Court observes that, if the applicant were unable to rely on Article 6, the waiving of charges or his acquittal in the substantive proceedings would exclude any consideration under Article 6 of his complaint that he had already been punished for having defended what he considered to be his rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention. The Court points out that in previous cases it has expressly found that there is no requirement for allegedly incriminating evidence obtained by coercion to be actually used in criminal proceedings before the right not to incriminate oneself applies. In particular, in the case of Heaney and McGuinness v. Ireland (no. 34720/97, \u00a7\u00a7 43-46, ECHR 2000XII) it found that the applicants could rely on Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 in respect of their conviction and imprisonment for failing to reply to questions, even though they were subsequently acquitted of the underlying offence. Indeed, in the case of Funke v. France (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a039-40), the Court found a violation of the right not to incriminate oneself even though no underlying proceedings were brought, and by the time of the Strasbourg proceedings none could be.",

The Court also finds that the friendly settlement reached with the creditors lacks relevance to the present case (see paragraph 17 above). It notes that the settlement only concerned the applicant\u2019s situation with respect to the creditors and had no bearing on his requirement to pay the fine which had been imposed on him by the District Court as a result of his refusal to co-operate.

The mechanism introduced by a subsequent amendment to the legislation prohibiting the use of incriminating information in order to circumvent provisions on testimony or in order to have the debtor charged with a criminal offence, came too late for the applicant (see paragraph 34 above).",
