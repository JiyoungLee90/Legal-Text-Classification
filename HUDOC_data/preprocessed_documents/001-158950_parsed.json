The judge was an associate professor and performed administrative duties for which he received income from the university. On these grounds, it must be deemed that the judge had had regular, close and remunerated professional relations with the university while performing his duties as a judge of Santa Cruz de Tenerife Audiencia Provincial. In the Court\u2019s view, these circumstances serve objectively to justify the applicant\u2019s apprehension that Judge Sa. lacked the requisite impartiality (see Pescador Valero, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027-28).",
