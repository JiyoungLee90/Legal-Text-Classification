The provision in question did not set any statutory time-limit for extending the detention measure.

Referring to other grounds for extraordinary extensions of pre-trial detention under Article 263 \u00a7 4, namely suspension of criminal proceedings, prolonged psychiatric observation of the accused, the prolonged preparation of an expert opinion, evidence gathering in a particularly complex case or a foreign country, and the intentional protraction of the proceedings by the accused, the Constitutional Court stated that although those criteria were to some extent vague as well, their constitutionality could be secured through their precise definition formulated through practice and by reference, inter alia, to the settled caselaw of the European Court as regards violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",

As in other numerous similar detention cases, the authorities did not justify the applicant\u2019s continued detention by relevant and sufficient reasons (see paragraph 49 above). Moreover, as demonstrated by the ever increasing number of judgments in which the Court has found Poland to be in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of applicants involved in organised crime, the present case is by no means an isolated example of the imposition of unjustifiably lengthy detention but a confirmation of a practice found to be contrary to the Convention (see, among many other examples, Celejewski v. Poland, cited above; K\u0105kol v.\u00a0Poland, no. 3994/03, 6 September 2007; Malikowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a015154/03, 16 October 2007; and also Hilgartner v. Poland, no.\u00a037976/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046-48, 3 March 2009). Consequently, the Court sees no reason to diverge from its findings in Kauczor as to the existence of a structural problem and the need for the  to adopt measures to remedy the situation (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62).",
