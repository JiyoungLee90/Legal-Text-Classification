She considered that as the period for which the authorisation had been granted had in the meantime lapsed, the applicant no longer had an interest in the appeal and it therefore ought to be declared inadmissible in accordance with the established case-law of the Supreme Court. Nevertheless, with a view to developing the law, the Advocate-General addressed the merits of the appeal. Reference was made to the Court\u2019s judgments and decision in the following cases: Sanchez-Reisse v. Switzerland (21 October 1986, Series A no. 107); E. v. Norway (29 August 1990, Series A no. 181A); Van der Velden v. the Netherlands ((dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006XV); Navarra v. France (23 November 1993, Series A no. 273B); and Bouamar v. Belgium (29 February 1988, Series A no. 129). The Advocate-General noted that the period between 17 October 2003, the date on which the appeal to the Court of Appeal had been lodged, and the hearing before that court on 11 December 2003 had already lasted 54 days, and that a further 8\u00a0days had elapsed until the decision of 19 December 2003. However, the entire procedure \u2013 from the first request for extension of the authorisation until the decision taken on appeal \u2013 had lasted from 1 August 2003 to 19\u00a0December 2003, that is a period of 141 days. As to other circumstances that had to be taken into consideration, such as the complexity of the case and the applicant\u2019s behaviour, the Advocate-General pointed out that the extension at issue was based on reports that had been issued before the start of the proceedings in question and that the only delay that could be attributed to the applicant concerned the time that had elapsed between the decision of the Juvenile Judge of 17 September 2003 and the lodging of the appeal on 17 October 2003. The Advocate-General concluded that, in her opinion, the decision of the Court of Appeal had not been taken speedily within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",
