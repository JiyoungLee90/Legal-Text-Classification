Furthermore, the fact that the municipality failed to stop the building work raises issues. It is therefore necessary to ascertain whether a permit was issued for the building\u2019s shallow foundations, which were, in fact, incompatible with the blueprint as from the first storey. If such a permit was issued, it is necessary to identify the persons working for the municipality who approved that permit and whether or not an occupancy permit was granted by the \u00c7\u0131narc\u0131k municipality. If so, it is necessary to establish the identities of the signatories of that occupancy permit. It is possible that other blocks have been built without inspection by the \u00c7\u0131narc\u0131k municipality.

V.G. stated that he had been working in the real estate field for nine years and that he had constructed numerous buildings with his partnership, the company V.G., and with the company G. Arsa. He agreed to shoulder responsibility for the shortcomings in the buildings which he had erected himself, but not for the defects relating to other buildings in which individuals had died during the earthquake and which he had merely sold. He also submitted that the buildings located on allotment 1927/15-1, plot 1, section D, allotment 1649/15-1, section C, and allotment 1649/15-1, plot 3, section D, had been constructed by \u0130.K. and Z.C. He did not know who had constructed the buildings in the \u00c7aml\u0131k estate which had collapsed. He added that he was neither a construction engineer nor an architect, and that was why he called on the services of persons with expert knowledge of these fields, who should, in his view, be held responsible.",

It transpired from the indictment that several site sections \u2013 section E on allotment\u00a01927, sections C and D on allotment 1649, and sections A, C, D and E on allotment\u00a01648 \u2013 had been built in \u00c7\u0131narc\u0131k, on \u00c7aml\u0131k square, and that three buildings, which had totally collapsed, had been erected in the Kocadere estate, on Hanburnu square, on allotments 1256 and 1258. It also transpired from the indictment that the experts who had taken samples from the collapsed buildings had, in particular, found as follows: in the buildings in question, the iron brackets had not been tightened at the interstice between the beams and the columns; mussel shells had been found in the concrete, resulting in low resistance owing to the use of sea sand and sea gravel; the distance between the columns and the beam brackets was 40\u00a0cm\u00a0in places; and there was insufficient iron in some of the columns.",

Mr \u00c7ak\u0131r, Mrs Y\u00fcce (Erg\u00fcden), Mrs Akan, Mr\u00a0\u00d6zel and Mr and Mrs\u00a0Erdo\u011fan were mentioned as third parties to the proceedings. Mr and Mrs K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 were mentioned as complainants. In its statement of reasons the Assize Court pointed out that the buildings in \u00c7\u0131narc\u0131k had been destroyed by the earthquake, but that it had transpired from the inspections carried out both during the preliminary investigation and during the proceedings that the buildings which had collapsed had been constructed in breach of numerous legal obligations. The Assize Court further emphasised the following: even though the stricken zone was classified as a level-one earthquake hazard area, the buildings had been constructed without any prior soil testing; the construction material used had been low-quality and the concrete had not been solid; the buildings erected had been destroyed under the impact of the earthquake; the accused had acted negligently, which had contributed to the destructive events; and there was a direct causal link between the destruction and the loss of life. The Assize Court further held that the provisions relating to the concurrence of offences were applicable to the case, that each building project implemented in accordance with a building permit had constituted an offence and that the instant case concerned five permits, namely allotment\u00a01927, plot\u00a01, allotment 1649, plot 3, and allotment 1648, plot 7 in \u00c7aml\u0131k, and allotment\u00a01258, plot 1 and allotment 1256, plot 5 in Kocadere. It was also noted that no proceedings concerning allotment 1257, plot 1 had been brought before the Assize Court. As regards the lists drawn up by the Governor of \u00c7\u0131narc\u0131k District and Kocadere Municipality, the Assize Court explained that eleven\u00a0persons had lost their lives on allotment 1927, plot 1 (1st section), twenty-eight on allotment 1649, plot 3 (2nd section), seventy-six on allotment 1648, plot 7 (3rd section) and two on allotment 1256, plot 5 (blocks A and B). It pointed out that it had been impossible to establish whether any deaths had occurred on the other plots, but that it had been established that the dwellings on those plots had been inhabited, thus placing the inhabitants in mortal danger. The Assize Court also noted the following: the V.G. Arsa Ofisi\u00a0 company had been responsible for all the buildings constructed on those plots; at the material time V.G. and C.G. had been partners in that company and Z.C. had been involved in obtaining the permits for the buildings; even though permits had been issued for the buildings in question, none of them had been covered by an occupancy permit, such that the building company and the various partners held criminal responsibility for the events.",

The Criminal Court considered the 1997 adoption by the Municipal Council of a decision setting aside the aforementioned 13\u00a0October 1995 decision before it could be enforced as a mitigating circumstance: it changed the penalties imposed on the Mayor to six months\u2019 imprisonment, under Article\u00a0240/2 of the Penal Code, and a TRL 300,000 fine. In view of the Mayor\u2019s behaviour during the proceedings, those penalties were reduced to five months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of TRL 250,000. The Mayor was also found guilty of having abused his authority by once again altering the planning schemes in breach of procedure, under a Municipal Council decision of 14 February 1996, and he was therefore sentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment pursuant to Article 240 of the Penal Code and fined TRL 300,000, which penalties were then reduced to ten months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of TRL 250,000. He was also found guilty of having failed to enforce the fines imposed pursuant to Article 42 of Law No. 3194, as ordered by the Municipal Council on 22 May 1996. Furthermore, he was sentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment and fined TRL 420,000 for having failed to ensure the destruction of the unlawful worksites, which penalties were then reduced to ten months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of TRL 350,000.",

The applicants submitted that the proceedings, which related to a serious infringement of the right to life, raised the issues not only of major negligence on the part of the property developer and his partners, but also of major negligence on the part of the authorities, but that despite all their efforts not all those responsible had been prosecuted. They further stated that the area where the earthquake had occurred had, many years previously, been declared a disaster zone, which meant that any buildings constructed there were subject to special regulations. Flouting those regulations and the requirements of the urban development and architectural plans, municipal the authorities had issued permits for buildings of five storeys and more, which were then erected illegally. Whereas those building should have been constructed in conformity with the specific features of the zone (closely-spaced iron brackets and two storeys underground), that had not been the case in the buildings in which the applicants\u2019 relatives had lost their lives. Moreover, they complained that the municipal authorities had failed to conduct the requisite inspections to check the conformity of the buildings with the relevant standards or to prevent their construction, and considered that those shortcomings amounted to gross negligence which had contributed to causing the deaths of their relatives.",

However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective.

Turkey, no. 53489/99, \u00a7\u00a032, 6\u00a0July 2006). The Court further emphasises that no compensation could be awarded under the remedy in question. The Court reiterates that where one remedy has been used, it is not necessary to exercise another remedy with virtually the same aim (see Riad and Idiab v.\u00a0Belgium, nos. 29787/03 and 29810/03, \u00a7 84, 24 January 2008). In the present case it notes from the case file and other information available to it that Mrs\u00a0Akan and Mr \u00d6zel attempted to bring an action for damages before the administrative courts (see paragraphs 104-106). Furthermore, they applied to the civil courts for compensation for the pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage resulting from their relative\u2019s death (see paragraphs\u00a0110120). The Court notes that Mrs Y\u00fcce (Erg\u00fcden) and Mr\u00a0\u00c7ak\u0131r also brought an action for damages (see paragraphs\u00a0121131 above).

In such cases, the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness and must of their own motion initiate investigations capable of, firstly, ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and any shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory system and, secondly, identifying the State officials or authorities involved in whatever capacity in the chain of events in issue (ibid., \u00a7 142).",

In the instant case, however, the Court can only note that those applicants who sought to use the civil compensation remedies had to wait between eight and twelve years (see paragraphs 110-131 above) for the civil courts to deliver their judgments. The Court also emphasises the modesty of the amounts awarded to the applicants in question in respect of the non-pecuniary damage caused by the loss of their relatives, in the light of its own case-law in such matters. It therefore concludes that in the particular circumstances of the present case, the civil compensation remedy was not an effective legal remedy and accordingly rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection in that respect.",
