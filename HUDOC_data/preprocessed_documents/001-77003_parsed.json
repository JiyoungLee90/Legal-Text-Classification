It reiterates that the concept of \u201cpossessions\u201d in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 has an autonomous meaning which is certainly not limited to ownership of physical goods: certain other rights and interests constituting assets can also be regarded as \u201cproperty rights\u201d, and thus as \u201cpossessions\u201d for the purposes of this provision (see Gasus Dosier- und F\u00f6rdertechnik GmbH v. the Netherlands, 23 February 1995, \u00a7 53, Series A no. 306-B, and Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999-II). The right of perpetual emphyteusis, which entails the obligation to pay the annual ground rent and the right to use the property or, in the case of a lease, to receive a rent, constitutes such a \u201cpossession\u201d. The Court also underlines that the domestic courts with constitutional jurisdiction saw no obstacle to the applicability of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the kind of right asserted by the applicants. Therefore, even assuming that the applicants were emphyteutae, rather than owners, of the building in question, this provision would in any event be applicable.",
