The case originated in an aplication (no. 73002/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mrs Bożena Kijewska (“the aplicant”), on 13 June 2001.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged, in particular that she had been deprived of her right of access to a court, contrary to Article 6 of the Convention.
On 13 January 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the aplication to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the aplication at the same time as its admissibility.
The aplicant was born in 1943 and lives in .
On 29 November 1999 the aplicant lodged a claim for rectification of an entry in a local land register with the  (Sąd Okręgowy). She sought to be considered as the sole owner of the real estate that she had inherited from her late father and which had been erroneously recorded as the joint property of the applicant and her husband. On an unknown date she made an aplication for an exemption from court fees required from her to take the proceedings (PLN 7,500). On 15 December 1999 the  dismissed her application.
The aplicant lodged an interlocutory apeal against that decision.
On 30 December 1999 the Wrocław Court of Apeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) dismissed her appeal. As she had failed to pay the court fees her claim was returned to her on an unknown later date.
The applicant subsequently lodged a second claim for rectification of the entry in the local land register. On 10 February 2000 the  ordered the aplicant to pay, within seven days, a court fee of PLN 9,750.
On 15 February 2000 the aplicant made an aplication to be exempted from court fees. The aplicant maintained that she received a monthly disability pension of PLN 1,075. In addition, she had some extra income as she was a selfemployed lawyer. However, she had a loan to pay off and a household to suport since she was divorced. She further claimed that her income only allowed her to suport herself and her daughter and that she had not been able to put money aside for court fees.
On 13 March 2000 the  dismissed her aplication. The court held that the aplicant's financial situation was sound since she received a monthly disability pension of PLN 1,075. In addition, the income from her law firm in November amounted to PLN 19,563. The court further held that the aplicant could not be considered indigent since she was a practising lawyer. Lastly, the applicant should have set aside money for the litigation.
On 24 March 2000 the aplicant filed an interlocutory apeal against this decision. The aplicant submitted that the PLN 19,563 mentioned in her tax return constituted her gross income for the period of eleven months. She further claimed that having to pay the full amount of court fees would entail a substantial reduction in her standard of living. Lastly, she argued that Article 113 of the Civil Procedure Code provided a possibility for an exemption from court fees for a person who could demonstrate that payment of such fees would entail a substantial reduction in his or her standard of living. This exemption was not only applicable to the less well-off.
On 26 May 2000 the Wrocław Court of Apeal dismissed the aplicant's apeal. The court held that while the aplicant's gross income from her law firm in November amounted to PLN 19,563 her net income in that month had been PLN 2,664. Considering the fact that she also received a monthly disability pension, she could have put aside money for the payment of court fees.
On 26 May 2000 the court ordered the aplicant to pay court fees of PLN 9,750, failing which her claim would be rejected. The aplicant again asked to be exempted from court fees, repeating her earlier arguments.
On 31 August 2000 the  dismissed her aplication. The court held that the aplicant received a monthly disability pension of PLN 1,320 and also at least PLN 1,000 net income from her law firm. Further, in view of the aplicant's profession she could not be considered indigent. In addition, the applicant should have set aside the money for the litigation. Lastly, the court stressed that:
“[the amount of] lawyers' incomes are widely known”.
The aplicant apealed against this decision.
On 19 December 2000 the  returned the statement of claim to the aplicant as she had failed to pay the required court fees. According to the applicant, the decision was served on her on 22 December 2000.
On 21 April 2004 the aplicant for the third time lodged a statement of claim with the  for the rectification of the entry in the local land register. On 12 May 2004 the court ordered her to pay PLN 5,490 [approx. EUR 1,370] in court fees failing which her statement of claim would be returned to her. The applicant did not ask to be exempted from the fees. On 21 May 2004 she paid the fees.
On 24 September 2004 the court gave judgment and dismissed the applicant's claim. On 28 October 2004 the applicant appealed. On an unspecified date the court ordered her to pay PLN 5,490 in court fees on pain of her appeal being rejected. The applicant again failed to ask for an exemption from the court fee. On 16 November 2004 the applicant paid the requested fee. On 12 January 2005 the  gave judgment and dismissed the applicant's claim. The judgment is final.
The legal provisions aplicable at the material time and questions of practice are set out in paragraphs 23-33 of the judgment delivered by the Court on 19 June 2001 in the case of Kreuz v. Poland (no. 28249/95, ECHR 2001-VI; see also Jedamski and Jedamska v. Poland, no. 73547/01), §§ 299).
