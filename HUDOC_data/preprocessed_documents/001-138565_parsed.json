On the same date the Pozna\u0144 Regional Military Court remanded him in custody on suspicion of heading an organised criminal gang and having committed multiple counts of fraud, embezzlement, uttering threats and accepting bribes. The case was registered under case number So\u00a020/06. The reasons given for the decision to detain the applicant were the strong evidence against him, the severity of the penalty which could be imposed and the risk that he would attempt to induce the witnesses to give false testimony or to otherwise obstruct the proceedings. The latter risk was considered of the utmost importance in the light of the fact that the case involved a great number of alleged accomplices. The applicant challenged this decision. His appeal was dismissed on 8 March 2006. On 25 April 2006 the Pozna\u0144 Regional Military Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention for a further three months. The court referred to concrete pieces of evidence which, in the court\u2019s view, supported the suspicion against the applicant, including the testimonies given by numerous other suspects, both those who had acknowledged their involvement in the fraud scheme and those who continued to deny it. It further noted that the case was very complex as it concerned many charges brought against numerous suspects. In noted that in the light of the evidence gathered up till that moment it was likely that new circumstances concerning the alleged fraud scheme, and in particular the applicant\u2019s alleged role in it, would come to light.",

At a court session held on 9 January 2008 the applicant\u2019s wife agreed that her and her husband\u2019s property would serve as security.

Practical considerations relating to the running of the courts and the completion of administrative formalities by the prison administration mean that the execution of such a court order may take time, which, nevertheless, should be kept to a minimum and, in any event, not exceed several hours (see Quinn, cited above, \u00a7\u00a042; Giulia Manzoni, cited above, \u00a7 25; Labita, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0171; and Nikolov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a082).
