In 1993 the first-instance court scheduled three appointments for DNA tests, but the defendant did not attend any of those appointments. Later on, he refused four times to have the DNA test made. However, the Court notes that no arguments were advanced by the Government to show that under domestic law the courts were obliged to obtain that conclusive evidence and, therefore, to wait for the defendant's consent. On the contrary, the case-law of the Supreme Court adopted a principle according to which the courts should critically assess, in the light of all evidence available in the case, the refusal of the alleged father to undergo these tests.

It was argued that the courts had committed serious errors as to the law in that the defendant's repeated refusals to undergo the DNA tests should have been assessed in a more critical manner.
