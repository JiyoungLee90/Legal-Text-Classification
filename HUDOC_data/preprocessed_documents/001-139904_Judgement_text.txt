The case originated in an application (no. 7070/04) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by 53 Ukrainian nationals, (“the applicants”), on 3 January 2004. The personal details of the applicants are listed in the annexed table.
The applicants were represented by Mr V.N. Bychkovskiy.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Yuriy Zaytsev.
On 2 March 2009 the application was communicated to the Government.
On 18 May 2009 the applicants’ representative informed the Court that the applicants listed in the annexed table under nos. 2, 5, 6, 10, 31, 33, 41 and 43 had died and that their next of kin (Ms Boltova, Ms Buchnyeva, Ms Gaydar, Mr Izosin, Ms Poterpeyeva, Ms Selivestrova, Mr Sysoyev and Ms Russu) expressed the wish to maintain the application on their behalf.
On 2 October 2012 the Government also informed the Court that the applicants Mr Grosberg, Ms Izosina, Mr Kochubey, Mr Lantsov, Ms Litvinova, Ms Shilepina, Mr Tarasov, Mr Tikhonov, Mr Tokarev, Ms Voronaya, Mr Yevdokimov, Ms Zmiyevskaya and Ms Zolotoverkhova (listed in the annexed table under nos. 9, 11, 15, 19, 23, 38, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52 and 53) had died. The Government invited the Court to strike the application insofar as lodged by those applicants from its list of cases.
In the period from 1998 to 2002 (the exact dates are listed in the appended table) the Krasnyy Luch Court delivered decisions according to which the State-owned coal mine “Almaznaya” was obliged to pay the applicants or their next of kin heating coal, to which they were entitled under the domestic law. The decisions became final and enforceable. However, the applicants were unable to obtain the enforcement of the decisions in due time.
