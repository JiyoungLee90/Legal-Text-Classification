Claiming that the parcels in question had been in their families' possession for many years, the applicants further requested that the land be registered in their name. They were all represented by the same lawyer. The first-instance court examined the claims under various files and delivered its initial judgments on different dates between 1989 and 1991 in the presence of the representatives of both parties, which were then either upheld or quashed by the Court of Cassation on various dates between 2003 and 2005. For those judgments that had been quashed, the domestic court continued the proceedings by holding numerous on-site visits, hearing witnesses and requesting expert reports, whilst collecting information. The proceedings ended in the applicants' favour on various dates between 2005 and 2007, after being examined at two levels of jurisdiction, which delivered up to six judgments. The final decisions for files nos. 2005/152, 2005/72, 2005/55, 2005/54 and 2005/49 were served on the applicants on 18 July 2006.",

It also takes into consideration the number of applicants, the nature of the violation found and the need to determine the amount in such a way that the overall sum is compatible with the relevant case-law and is reasonable in the light of what was at stake in the proceedings in question. In the light of the Kakamoukas and Others v. Greece case and the above background, the Court considers that all the applicants must be awarded the same amount , irrespective of the number of domestic proceedings brought for different plots (see, mutatis mutandis, Kakamoukas and Others v. Greece [GC], no.\u00a038311/02, \u00a7 48, 15 February 2008; and Karata\u015f and Y\u0131ld\u0131z and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, cited above). Consequently, irrespective of the number of sets of proceedings concerned, it awards each of the applicants EUR 5,000 for non-pecuniary damage, except Mehmet Ata\u00e7 and Mehmet Azak (see paragraph 9 above) as well as Mehmet Ko\u00e7han and Mehmet Zeki Karata\u015f (see paragraph 18 above). Consequently, ruling on an equitable basis, it awards each of the thirty applicants whose complaints have been declared admissible the full sum claimed under the non-pecuniary damage head (EUR 5,000).",
