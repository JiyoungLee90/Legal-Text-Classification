While the need to ensure a fair trial may, in certain circumstances, require a judge to discharge an individual juror or an entire jury it must also be acknowledged that this may not always be the only means to achieve this aim.

In respect of the retired police officer juror, counsel made it clear that he would advise the applicant that the presence of a police officer juror, even a serving one, did not raise concerns provided that the officer juror had no knowledge of the case, the parties or the police officer involved in it (see paragraph 8 above). He was given the opportunity to investigate the retired police officer\u2019s connections with the case and following adjournment did not challenge the continued presence of the juror (see paragraph 10 above). As regards the serving police officer juror, defence counsel addressed the judge and was given the opportunity to clarify the exact nature of the information he required as to the juror\u2019s connection with the case and the officer in the courtroom (see paragraph 13 above). He was informed of the list of questions then drawn up and did not seek to modify or add to them (see paragraph 15 above). Following the juror\u2019s questioning, defence counsel confirmed that he was \u201cquite happy that the juror may continue to serve\u201d (see paragraph 16 above). It is clear from the transparent inquiries into the two police officer jurors that the defence had every opportunity to object to the continued presence of the men on the jury but chose not to do so.",

There was no suggestion at any stage that the retired police officer was acquainted with any other person involved in the trial proceedings or in the courtroom (see paragraph 8 above). The serving police officer recognised a man sitting in the courtroom, but did not know why he was present and was wholly unaware of his involvement as the officer in the case (see paragraph 12 above). He was shown a list of the police officer witnesses and confirmed that he knew none of them (see paragraphs 14-15 above). This is not a case where a police officer who was personally acquainted with a police officer witness giving relevant evidence was a member of the jury (compare and contrast Hanif and Khan, cited above).",

Indeed, this was confirmed by his own counsel (see paragraph 9 above). He admitted that he had killed the victim and the only question for the jury was whether he had acted in self-defence (see paragraphs 6-7 above). In these circumstances, and despite the applicant\u2019s claim to the contrary (see paragraph 29 above), it cannot be said that there was an important conflict or a clear dispute regarding police evidence in the case (compare and contrast Hanif and Khan, cited above, \u00a7 146).",
