The note stated that the applicant himself, in an interview with the SSD, had acknowledged that some of them might be able to put pressure on him. It further stated that when filling in the questionnaire the applicant had not disclosed that he knew some of these individuals and had failed to mention certain occasions when he had met them, which he had later claimed to have forgotten.

In accordance with the case-law of the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph 37 below), such an interim document could not be contested before a court, but arguments against it could be presented when contesting the final decision refusing to issue security clearance. The court further stated that the applicant had applied for security clearance as a Deputy Speaker but had since resigned from that office and had not applied for security clearance on any other grounds. Accordingly, the Speaker\u2019s refusal to issue him with security clearance no longer created any legal consequences for him and thus could not be contested before a court either.",

It reiterated that the SSD note had been an interim document which had not created any legal consequences for the applicant and thus could not be contested before a court. As for the complaint against the Speaker, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court\u2019s conclusion but adopted different reasoning. It emphasised that the administrative courts had the authority to examine decisions adopted by the Speaker only when those decisions constituted acts of public administration (see paragraph 35 below); it was for the claimant to demonstrate that the contested acts fell within the scope of public administration. The Supreme Administrative Court pointed out that, in his claim, the applicant had not asked the courts to annul a decision refusing to issue him with security clearance, but had asked them to order the Speaker to issue him with such clearance. It ruled that the latter request did not concern acts of public administration and thus the administrative courts could not examine it.",

A-858-2894/2012 the Supreme Administrative Court examined a complaint by a member of the Seimas against the decision of the Speaker revoking his security clearance. That decision had been taken following a finding by the SSD that the claimant\u2019s actions, which had been found by the Constitutional Court to constitute a breach of his oath and a gross violation of the Constitution, had given grounds to doubt his trustworthiness. The Supreme Administrative Court examined the grounds provided in the Speaker\u2019s decision and in the SSD\u2019s findings. It found them to be sufficient to cast doubt on the claimant\u2019s trustworthiness as defined in the Law on State and Service Secrets, and upheld the Speaker\u2019s decision.",

The court examined whether the information provided by those entities, including classified information, constituted sufficient grounds to doubt the claimants\u2019 trustworthiness and to refuse or revoke their security clearance. In some cases the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the decisions adopted by the ministries had been lawful and based on sufficient grounds (decision of 4\u00a0October 2010 in case no.

The first-instance and appellate courts refused to accept the complaint for examination, holding that the SSD note had been drafted in accordance with the Law on Operational Activities and that complaints concerning operational activities had to be lodged with the Seimas\u2019 Ombudsperson. The Supreme Court quashed those decisions and remitted the case for examination to the first-instance court. It held that the Seimas\u2019 Ombudsperson did not have the authority to adopt binding decisions and that therefore a complaint to the Ombudsperson did not constitute an effective remedy with regard to the right to reputation. The Supreme Court stated that the right of access to a court required that the complaint concerning the alleged damage to the claimant\u2019s reputation by the SSD be examined on the merits by the courts.",

In such proceedings, courts have the right to access classified information (see paragraph 34 above; see also Regner v.\u00a0the Czech Republic [GC], no.\u00a035289/11, \u00a7\u00a7 152 and 161, 19 September 2017). They examine whether the information on which the impugned decision was based, including the information contained in interim documents, constitutes sufficient grounds for refusing or revoking the claimant\u2019s security clearance, and have the authority to annul those decisions (see paragraph 39 above). Accordingly, the Court is satisfied that lodging a complaint before the administrative courts against the decision refusing to issue security clearance offered the applicant a sufficient possibility of presenting arguments against the findings contained in an interim document adopted by the SSD and of having those arguments duly considered by the courts.",

Nonetheless, they were in agreement that such an obligation existed (see paragraphs\u00a056 and 61 above).

Furthermore, the Court has no reason to believe that at the time of his resignation the applicant was not aware that no official decision refusing to issue him with security clearance had been adopted. It therefore considers that he chose of his own free will to resign from the office of Deputy Speaker without waiting for the Speaker to adopt a decision on his security clearance.",
