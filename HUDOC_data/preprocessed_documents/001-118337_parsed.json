The Court therefore considers that the present application, lodged on 6 November 2009, was introduced in conformity with the six-month time-limit. As regards the Government\u2019s objection that the applicant failed to exhaust domestic remedies, the Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected the Government\u2019s preliminary objections in similar cases (see, in particular, Atalay v. Turkey, no. 1249/03, \u00a7 29, 18 September 2008). It reaffirms its earlier conclusions that the remedies referred to by the Government cannot be regarded as sufficient for a Contracting State\u2019s obligations under Article\u00a03 of the Convention. The Court therefore finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from its previous findings.

However, the ensuing criminal proceedings against the police officers concerned lasted for a period of almost five years, a delay that runs contrary to the promptness required to punish those responsible. There is no indication that the police officers were suspended from duty during that period or that the authorities took disciplinary action against them. What is more, at the end of the criminal proceedings, the Istanbul Criminal Court suspended the pronouncement of the judgment whereby it had sentenced two police officers for the ill-treatment they had inflicted upon the applicant (see paragraph 13 above). According to the Court\u2019s case-law, suspension of such sentences undeniably falls into the category of the \u201cmeasures\u201d which are unacceptable, as its effect is to render convictions ineffective (see Eski, cited above \u00a7 36; Taylan v. , no. 32051/09, \u00a7 46, 3 July 2012; Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78; and Zeynep \u00d6zcan v. Turkey, no. 45906/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04046, 20 February 2007). In this respect, the Court notes that the suspension of pronouncement of a judgment, regulated by Article 231 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Law no.\u00a05271), has a more far-reaching effect than the deferral of the execution of a sentence and results in impunity for the perpetrators. The difference arises because the use of the former measure removes the judgment with all its legal consequences, including the sentence, provided that the offender abides by the suspension order (see paragraph 18 above), whereas upon use of the latter measure, neither the sentence nor the judgment cease to exist. The Court therefore considers that the impugned court decision suggests that the judges exercised their discretion more in order to minimise the consequences of a serious unlawful act than to show that such acts could in no way be tolerated.",
