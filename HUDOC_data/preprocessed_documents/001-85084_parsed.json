The reference to an \u201caccumulation of anomalies\u201d was found not to be related to the person in charge of the judicial investigation but to the anomalies identified in the case file and strongly conveyed the dissatisfaction of the civil parties.

As regards the use of prudent and dispassionate language, the court, in view of the blatant antagonism between the civil parties and the investigating judges, remarked upon the vehemence of the comments, but considered that the journalist had taken the necessary distance by using the conditional tense in the only passage recognised as defamatory.

Denmark ([GC], no. 49017/99, ECHR 2004-XI), the Government referred to the Court\u2019s finding that the stronger the criticism, the stricter the obligation of scrutiny had to be. In assessing the necessity of a limit to freedom of expression, the Court had also taken into account the scope of the debate referred to in the article in question and the capacity of the victim.

Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, ECHR 2001-III), to make a distinction between politicians, who inevitably and knowingly laid themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and civil servants, who should not be treated on an equal footing with politicians when it came to criticism of their conduct.",

They pointed out that the journalist, in addition to the fact that she had made mistakes in dates, had not even tried to make contact with one of the investigating judges or a member of the public prosecutor\u2019s office, and that in reporting comments by a representative of the union she had distorted them, had not struck the requisite balance between the different positions and had not carried out any research into the facts. Contrary to the applicants\u2019 assertions, the Court did not exempt journalists from that duty of verification, since it had described this as an \u201cordinary\u201d or \u201cusual\u201d obligation from which the media could be dispensed only on \u201cspecial grounds\u201d (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, \u00a7 78), and had found that the more serious the allegation, the more solid the factual basis had to be. In this connection, it was appropriate to point out that the definition of \u201cpartialit\u00e9\u201d (bias), according to the Petit Robert dictionary, indicated about a person that they took a position for or against someone or something without any concern for justice or truth, and that the use of the term \u201crocambolesque\u201d referred to a character described as \u201cvillainous\u201d by the Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis. In the Government\u2019s submission, the applicants had wrongly claimed that French case-law on interviews would be applicable, firstly because the offending article was not an interview but a report, and secondly because the case-law cited (Court of Cassation, Second Civil Division, 27 March 2003), concerning the prudence required of journalists reporting remarks by third parties, was pertinent only for journalists who were not actually the authors of the reported remark. It remained the case that a newspaper was not entitled to publish all kinds of remarks on the ground that they had been made by a third party, as the person liable for defamation under French law was the publication director or editor \u2013 in other words the person disseminating the defamatory statement. In those circumstances the case-law in Thoma (cited above) was not pertinent because the person prosecuted in that case was a journalist \u2013 the principal for the offence under Luxembourg law being the author of the offending article \u2013 and the Court had found a violation of Article 10 because the journalist had not been, and had not purported to be, the author of the statement. It could not be argued, as the applicants had done, that when any comment whatsoever had been made by a third party and reported with basic textual precautions, such as the use of inverted commas or the conditional tense, it was not reprehensible. Such reasoning would render paragraph 2 of Article 10 meaningless. In any event, the Government took the view that the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration \u2013 contrary to other daily newspapers, such as Le Monde, from which they produced an article of 16 May 2000 \u2013 had not complied with the requirements of good faith or with the rules of ethics in journalism, by using bold type for the word \u201cpartialit\u00e9\u201d and thus deliberately drawing attention to the defamatory statement.",

They observed that the Government had not shown how the penalty imposed had met a pressing social need, and submitted that the Pedersen and Baadsgaard case-law had little to do with the present dispute, but in fact allowed the violation of Article 10 to be characterised. They explained that, in the present case, the domestic courts had not taken into account the nature of the document in question \u2013 a press report \u2013 or the field with which the article was concerned, namely the role and operation of fundamental State institutions. They pointed out that the journalist and the publication director had not espoused the offending expressions as their own, and had not sought to convince the reader of the veracity of the criticisms, but had simply reported on the existence of the latter. They submitted that the journalist had distanced herself in her report by using the conditional tense and inverted commas, and by referring to each of the sources without emphasising certain accusations.",

The journalist had duly reproduced the most significant terms used in the press conference, thus conveying the tone of the event. The case did not therefore concern the dissemination of inaccurate information, as in Radio France and Others v. France (no. 53984/00, ECHR 2004-II), but the existence of the journalist\u2019s freedom of expression, without even entailing a need for her to use a degree of exaggeration or provocation, as permitted by the Court\u2019s case-law. In finding otherwise, the domestic courts, which were not to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists, according to the case-law (Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298), had breached the Convention. On that point, as Article 10 protected both the content and the form of the expression, it was shocking for the applicants that the Court of Appeal had seen fit to judge the use of discretion as to the most appropriate journalistic form by concluding that the author of the press article had \u201cpreferred not to report on the subject in the form of an interview\u201d. Moreover, they observed that the journalist, even though she had a deadline to meet, had nevertheless sought to obtain the reaction of the Ministry and of Judge Le Loire, but that the Court of Appeal, unlike the court below, had refused to take this into consideration, on the ground that an investigating judge\u2019s assistant had \u201cstated that she [could] not remember any call from the journalist\u201d, further requiring that she should have gathered information before the conference and, if appropriate, should have afforded the criticised parties the right to reply in the following days. They claimed that the offending articles had not been directed at the private lives of public figures but at their conduct and attitudes in the performance of their duties. The press conference had been held by the civil parties and the individuals who had expressed themselves on that occasion had been seeking to make public the questions and criticisms about the manner in which the case was being handled. Three months later, moreover, the investigating judges had been withdrawn from the case. The facts described by the participants could not therefore be regarded as untrue. Lastly, the applicants claimed that neither the domestic courts nor the Court had made any distinction between the conviction of a journalist and that of the person disseminating the statement, because the good faith of the author entailed that of the principal.",

To be more precise, the first of the guiding principles in the appendix to that Recommendation states that the public are entitled to receive information about the activities of judicial authorities and police services through the media, which means that journalists must be able to report and comment freely on the functioning of the criminal-justice system. The questions of public interest reported by the press thus undoubtedly include those concerning the functioning of the system of justice, an institution that is essential for any democratic society (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24 February 1997, \u00a7 37, Reports 1997-I). The press is one of the means by which politicians and public opinion can verify that judges are discharging their heavy responsibilities in a manner that is in conformity with the aim which is the basis of the task entrusted to them (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 313).",

It is thus appropriate to grant them full reimbursement of the said sums that they had to pay, by way of redress for their pecuniary damage, for a total of EUR 7,500. Moreover, the Court does not rule out the possibility that the first applicant may have sustained, on account of the violation of Article 10, some non-pecuniary damage. It considers, however, that in the circumstances of the case the finding of a violation in this judgment constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction (see Paturel v.
