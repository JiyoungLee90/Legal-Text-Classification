The case originated in an application (no. 53372/99) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovakian national, D.K. (“the applicant”), on 25 July 1999. The applicant requested that his identity be not disclosed.
The Slovakian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Vršanský.
On 14 May 2002 the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
On 15 January 1996 the applicant filed an action for protection of his good name and reputation with the Košice I District Court. He sued a limited liability company on the ground that a newspaper published by the latter contained articles alleging that the applicant had been an agent of the former secret police.
On 9 January 1997 the District Court dismissed the action. On 7 March 1997 the applicant appealed. He further requested that he should be exempted from the obligation to pay court fees. The District Court dismissed the request on 24 July 1997. On 20 August 1997 the applicant appealed against this decision.
The case file and the applicant’s above two appeals were transmitted to the Košice Regional Court on 9 September 1997. As the applicant’s brother was a judge of that court the Supreme Court ordered, on 25 November 1997, that the case should be dealt with by the Prešov Regional Court.
On 11 February 1998 the Supreme Court excluded the Regional Court’s judge at the latter’s request. The case was assigned to a different judge on 26 February 1998.
In March and in May 1998 the Regional Court requested the Košice I District Court to submit a judgment and the file concerning a different case in which the applicant was a plaintiff. The Regional Court received the judgment in question on 15 May 1998.
On 20 January 1999 the applicant amended his action in that he reduced the amount of the compensation claimed.
On 16 March 1999 the Regional Court accepted the applicant’s request for the action to be amended and discontinued the proceedings in respect of the claim which the applicant had withdrawn. On the same day the Regional Court quashed the remaining part of the District Court’s judgment of 9 January 1997 and sent the case back to the first instance court. It also upheld the District Court’s above decision of 24 July 1997.
On 13 October 1999 the Constitutional Court found that the Prešov Regional Court had violated the applicant’s constitutional right to have his case examined without undue delays. In its finding the Constitutional Court found that the case was not complex and that no delays could be imputed to the applicant. The Constitutional Court further held that the Prešov Regional Court had not effectively proceeded with the case between 18 May 1998 and 16 March 1999.
On 9 February 2000 the applicant filed a new petition to the Constitutional Court in which he complained about delays in the proceedings before the Košice I District Court. On 28 June 2000 the Constitutional Court delivered a decision in which it held that the above Constitutional Court’s finding of 13 October 1999 covered the overall length of the proceedings before the general courts to the date of its delivery. The Constitutional Court found no undue delays in the proceedings in the subsequent period, that is between 13 October 1999 and 28 June 2000.
In the meantime, on 15 March 2000 the Košice I District Court heard the parties, and on 30 March 2000 it dismissed the applicant’s action. The judgment with reasons was served on the applicant on 4 May 2000. On 10 May 2000 he filed an appeal. On 12 May 2000 the applicant also appealed against a decision of the District Court of 26 April 2000 concerning the court fees.
On 14 July 2000 the applicant was informed that the proceedings concerning his action were stayed as bankruptcy proceedings had been brought against the defendant company.
On 21 February 2002 the Košice I District Court dismissed the applicant’s request for waiver of court fees. On 25 March 2002 the applicant appealed against this decision. He further requested that the proceedings concerning his action be resumed.
According to a letter signed by the President of the Košice I District Court on 28 October 2002, the proceedings have been pending before the Prešov Regional Court since 17 September 2002.
On 22 October 2002 the applicant filed a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution alleging a violation of his right to a hearing without undue delay. The proceedings are pending before the Constitutional Court.
Article 48 (2) of the Constitution provides, inter alia, that every person has the right to have his or her case tried without unjustified delay.
Pursuant to Article 130 (3) of the Constitution, as in force until 30 June 2001, the Constitutional Court could commence proceedings upon the petition (podnet) presented by any individual or a corporation claiming that their rights have been violated.
According to its case-law under the former Article 130 (3) of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court lacked jurisdiction to draw legal consequences from a violation of a petitioner’s rights under Article 48 (2) of the Constitution. It could neither grant damages to the person concerned nor impose a sanction on the public authority liable for the violation found. In the Constitutional Court’s view, it was therefore for the authority concerned to provide redress to the person whose rights were violated.
As from 1 January 2002, the Constitution has been amended in that, inter alia, individuals and legal persons can complain about a violation of their fundamental rights and freedoms pursuant to Article 127. Under this provision the Constitutional Court has the power, in case that it founds a violation of Article 48 (2) of the Constitution, to order the authority concerned to proceed with the case without delay. It may also grant adequate financial satisfaction to the person whose constitutional right was violated as a result of excessive length of proceedings (for further details see, e.g., Andrášik and Others v. Slovakia (dec.), nos. 57984/00, 60237/00, 60242/00, 60679/00, 60680/00, 68563/01, 60226/00, 22 October 2002).
Under Section 79a (2) of the Constitutional Court Act, as in force since 20 March 2002, the Constitutional Court shall reject a complaint which is substantially the same as another matter on which it has already decided.
According to an explanatory letter by the President of the Constitutional Court of 6 June 2002, nothing has prevented the Constitutional Court from dealing with complaints about length of proceedings in cases in which proceedings have also been instituted before the European Court of Human Rights provided that the domestic proceedings complained of are still pending at the moment when the constitutional complaint is filed. The letter further states that where the Constitutional Court earlier found a violation of Article 48 (2) of the Constitution, a further complaint about delays in the same proceedings can be entertained only to the extent that it relates to the period after the delivery of the first finding of the Constitutional Court. However, when deciding on such cases the Constitutional Court will, as a rule, take into account that the ordinary courts have failed to proceed with the case without undue delays following its finding of a violation of Article 48 (2) of the Constitution.
