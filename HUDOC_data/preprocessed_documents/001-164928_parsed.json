In particular, he was accused of having, between 2000 and 2006, devised a scheme involving the importation of liquefied gas from Kazakhstan and Ukraine, as a result of which the company had sustained major financial losses. According to the accusation, instead of purchasing gas directly from the producers, he had called on the services of intermediary companies, resulting in a significant increase in the price of the gas. Those intermediary companies also had ties with his sons. Later, when his company was faced with a court claim from the intermediary companies amounting to 594,067\u00a0United States\u00a0dollars plus penalties, he had acknowledged that debt in court proceedings.",

Therefore, it was impossible for his company to purchase the amounts of gas needed directly from the producers. Moreover, the producers only accepted 100% pre-payment and his company did not have the available funds. He submitted that all national gas importers used the same method of importing gas and that the price of the gas purchased by his company was lower than that on the free national market. He further argued that the difference in price between that of the producers and that paid by his company was explained by transportation costs, certification, handling, insurance and other factors.

At the same time he was acquitted of thirteen other charges brought against him and was found guilty on one count, namely that of having illegally sold liquefied gas which had been seized by a bailiff, for which he was sentenced to a fine of 20,000 Moldovan lei (approximately 1,000 euros).

When the detention is considered not to fall under the above permitted exception the judicial officer must have the power to release (McKay, cited above, \u00a7 40).

It is true that in some instances the Court has held that \u201c[t]hese two limbs confer distinct rights and are not on their face logically or temporally linked\u201d (see, most notably, McKay, cited above, \u00a7 31; and Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, \u00a7\u00a0119, ECHR 2010 \u2013 the latter being concerned only with the first limb). However, it should be noted that in each context the period will start to run from the time of arrest, and that the judicial authority authorising the detention is required to determine whether there are reasons to justify detention and to order release if there are no such reasons. Thus, in practice, it would often be the case that the application of the guarantees under the second limb would to some extent overlap with those of the first limb, typically in situations where the judicial authority which authorises detention under the first limb at the same time orders detention on remand subject to the guarantees of the second limb. In such situations, the first appearance of the suspect before the judge constitutes the \u201ccrossroads\u201d where the two sets of guarantees meet and where the second set succeeds the first. And yet, the question of when the second applies to its full extent, in the sense that further relevant and sufficient reasons additional to reasonable suspicion are required, is left to depend on the rather vague notion of \u201ca certain lapse of time\u201d.",

Therefore, when faced with a choice between imprisonment in a detention facility and house arrest, as in the present case, most individuals would normally opt for the latter.",

It further reiterates that in Lavents (cited above), where the Court was called upon to examine the relevance and sufficiency of reasons for depriving the applicant of liberty pending trial for a considerable period of time, the respondent Government had unsuccessfully argued that different criteria ought to apply to the assessment of the reasons for the impugned restriction on liberty as the applicant had been detained not only in prison but also been held in house arrest and in hospital. The Court dismissed the argument, stating that Article 5 did not regulate the conditions of detention, referring to the approach previously adopted in Mancini (cited above) and other cases cited therein. The Court went on to specify that the notions of \u201cdegree\u201d and \u201cintensity\u201d in the case-law, as criteria for the applicability of Article 5, referred only to the degree of restrictions to the liberty of movement, not to the differences in comfort or in the internal regime in different places of detention. Thus, the Court proceeded to apply the same criteria for the entire period of deprivation of liberty, irrespective of the place where the applicant was detained.",

Such justifications should, on the contrary, be assessed according to criteria that are practical and effective in maintaining an adequate level of protection under the Article 5 without running a risk of diluting that protection. In short, the Court finds it appropriate to follow the same approach as in Lavents for its examination of the present case.",

In such circumstances, the Court sees no merit whatsoever in this argument. Furthermore, it notes that the Court of Appeal failed to give an answer to this objection raised by the applicant. There is no indication in the judgments that the courts took into account such an important factor as the applicant\u2019s behaviour, between the beginning of the investigation in July 2006 and the moment when first ordering his remand in custody.",

This time the courts invoked other reasons, namely the danger of absconding and the risk of influencing witnesses and tampering with evidence (see paragraphs 20 and 25 above). In this regard, the Court notes that these were the same reasons as had been invoked by the prosecutor in the initial application for placing the applicant in detention on remand but which both the first-instance court and the Court of Appeal had dismissed as being unsubstantiated and improbable (see paragraphs 15 and 17 above). There is no explanation in the court decisions prolonging the applicant\u2019s detention as to why those reasons became relevant and sufficient only later (see, for instance, Koutalidis v. Greece, no. 18785/13, \u00a7 51, 27\u00a0November 2014), for instance whether anything in the applicant\u2019s behaviour had prompted the change.

Governments should be able to rely in good faith on the Court\u2019s clear indications as to the Convention issues to be addressed by them, without fear of being estopped from raising relevant objections if and when further Convention issues, outside the Court\u2019s indications, are later introduced into the case.",

For the reasons that follow, this assumption is neither based on sound doctrinal or legal principles, nor does it have any basis in the Court\u2019s existing case-law.

For the question to arise whether a person can waive his right to liberty, one must exclude those situations where the person in question is not, de facto, detained within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1. A homeless person or a vagrant who walks into a police station asking for a place to sleep, his wishes being met by placing him in a prison cell, is not deprived of his liberty if he can leave whenever he so chooses. Thus, by definition, deprivation of liberty arises where such a measure by a public authority, for example detention in prison or house arrest, is imposed on an unwilling person, thus limiting his or her personal autonomy and physical integrity. It is only in those situations where the question of his or her possible acquiescence arises, and consequently if and to what extent the acceptance of being detained can have a bearing on the protections afforded under Article 5 of the Convention.",

Or does it mean that the State is no longer under an obligation to bring the suspect promptly before a judge under Article 5 \u00a7 3 or to provide the detainee with the procedural safeguards of having the detention reviewed by a court under Article 5 \u00a7 4 in order to examine whether it is still based on relevant and sufficient grounds?",

Also, and not surprisingly, this has been the consistent position of the Court until today. In its settled case-law, the Court has proclaimed that the right to liberty is too important in a \u201cdemocratic society\u201d, within the meaning of the Convention, for a person to lose the benefit of the protection of the Convention for the single reason that he gives himself up to be taken into detention. Detention may violate Article\u00a05 even though the person concerned has agreed to it (see Venskut\u0117 v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 10645/08, \u00a7 72, 11 December 2012, with further references, and Storck v. Germany, no. 61603/00, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2005-V). Also, as to the Court\u2019s important supervisory role in this regard, the Court proclaimed as early as in the Belgian Vagrancy Case of 1971 (De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, 18 June 1971, \u00a7 65, Series A no. 12) that \u201cwhen the matter is one which concerns ordre public within the Council of Europe, a scrupulous supervision by the organs of the Convention of all measures capable of violating the rights and freedoms which it guarantees are necessary in every case\u201d.",
