The same paragraphs, taken together, require the Contracting States to take positive steps to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him, such measures being part of the diligence the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see Sadak and Others v. , nos.\u00a029900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR 2001VIII). However, the use in evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected (see Sa\u00efdi v. France, judgment of 20 September 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0261C, p.\u00a056, \u00a7\u00a043, and A.M. v. , no.\u00a037019/97, \u00a7\u00a025, ECHR 1999IX). If there has been no negligence on the part of the authorities, the impossibility of securing the appearance of a witness at the trial does not in itself make it necessary to halt the prosecution (see Artner v. Austria, judgment of 28 August 1992, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0242A, \u00a7\u00a021). The rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the requirements of Article 6 if the conviction is based solely, or to a decisive extent, on the depositions of a witness whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined either during the investigation or at trial (see Delta v. France, judgment of 19 December 1990, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0191A, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a037; Isgr\u00f2 v. Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0194A, p.\u00a013, \u00a7\u00a035). Finally, Article 6 does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court and it is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a witness (see, among many other authorities, Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0158, p.\u00a031, \u00a7\u00a089).",

During the retrial, despite the clear indication of the court of appeal, the trial court again failed to summon S. to its hearings and was satisfied with the reading out of his statements. It did not give any reasons as to why his attendance was not or could not have been secured (see paragraph 15 above). The appellate court upheld that judgment referring to the fact that S. had been serving his prison sentence in another town (see paragraph 17 above).",
