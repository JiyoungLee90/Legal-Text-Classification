Apessos and Ms K. Paraskevopoulou, Senior Advisers at the State Legal Council, and Ms Z. Chatzipavlou, Legal Assistant at the State Legal Council.
On 11 May 2010 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. In accordance with Protocol No. 14, the application was allocated to a Committee of three Judges.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in .
On 28 November 2000 the Ministry of Finance imposed a fine of 51,693,912 drachmas (GRD) (deficit: GRD 34,501,041 + default interest: GRD 17,192,871, i.e. 93,012.21 euros (EUR)) on the applicant for his alleged responsibility in the creation of a budget deficit in the Department of Urban Planning at the city of Chania, where he was posted (act no. 5654/28.11.2000).
On 22 March 2001, the applicant lodged an appeal with the State Audit Council (Ελεγκτικό Συνέδριο) challenging act no. 5654/28.11.2000.
A hearing took place on 6 May 2003 and 20 April 2004.
By judgment dated 29 June 2004 the State Audit Council partially accepted the applicant’s appeal. The act was annulled only regarding the part ordering the applicant to pay default interest. As the court observed, the applicant had, among other functions, accounting responsibilities within the Planning Department and, under domestic law in case of public deficit, liability was incurred. Further, it was noted that, as it appeared from the evidence submitted, the applicant had been acting unlawfully in the performance of his duties. He was found to be liable for the payment of sums greater than those determined as wages and, also, certain amounts had been paid to persons not eligible to receive them. Moreover, it was admitted that the applicant had previously been questioned by the inspector in charge, put forward his views on the matter and had also been invited to restore the deficit in question (judgment no. 1502/2004). The judgment was served on the applicant on 2 October 2004.
On 23 September 2005 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law and a hearing took place on 7 November 2007.
On 4 June 2008 the Plenary of the State Audit Council upheld judgment no. 1502/2004, after having concluded that the first instance court’s judgment was right and sufficiently reasoned (judgment no. 1456/2008). The applicant was served with the decision on 21 August 2008.
