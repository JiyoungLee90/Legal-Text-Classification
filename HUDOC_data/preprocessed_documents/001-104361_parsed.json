Nevertheless the experts noticed that A had been influenced by the applicant, who had enlisted him in a\u00a0coalition against his mother and expected absolute loyalty from him.

The child lived with him, in breach of the domestic decision of 22 November 2004 and the subsequent divorce decree of 30 June 2006, which had ordered A's residence with his mother. The\u00a0authorities were only able to enforce the residence order in July 2007, when the child was placed in the care of his mother. It appears that this reunion was not successful and the child twice ran away from home to his father (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above). On 1 April 2008 A permanently moved in with his father, with whom he has been living ever since. The\u00a0domestic court legalised this situation and ordered the child's residence with the applicant on 15 February 2010.",

Likewise, para.\u00a051: \u201cIn family law cases (for example parentage, custody, parental abduction), courts should exercise exceptional diligence to avoid any risk of adverse consequences on the family relations.\u201d Sometimes, however, one tends to miss the wood for the trees.",

The child, A, had been with the applicant since 3 August 2003; by the time the request was made on 8 April 2008, A was old enough (11 and a half years) to be able to express his views, as he in fact did to the prosecutor who was conducting the criminal proceedings against the applicant (para. 21 of the judgment); he\u00a0twice ran away from his mother's residence (paras. 22 and 23). In short, contrary to what is stated in para.\u00a058, the case presented no particular complexity or difficulty  unless one considers the inevitable conflict between the parents in any custody case as \u201ccomplexity\u201d. Being a child custody case, the court seized of the application of 8 April 2008 was expected to have all the important facts in hand before or at most by the first hearing, to be able then to deal with the application using \u201cexceptional diligence\u201d. Instead it proceeded to deal with the case as if it were an ordinary case, receiving a little bit of evidence at every hearing (as seems to be the practice in ). Suffice it to point out \u2013 and this is what really makes the case almost surreal as to the length of time it took to decide the application of 8\u00a0April 2008 \u2013 that the court guardian visited the applicant and A on 10\u00a0April 2008, but it was not before 27 April 2009 that A was heard by the court, and it was only on 11\u00a0August 2009 that the court commissioned an expert opinion. Again, this expert opinion only stated the obvious, even as regards the applicant's influence on A's views \u201cabout the family and the world\u201d (para.\u00a032). It is also to be observed that, contrary to what is recommended in paragraph 52 of the Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on child friendly justice, already mentioned above, the District Court on three occasions refused also to make an interim order (paras. 26, 29 and 31).",
