The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 59, 31 March 2016).",

That said, the Court notes that the applicant had complained about the manner in which the confrontation had been conducted, alleging that some of his questions had not been properly recorded and his complaints had remained unanswered (see paragraph 17 above).
