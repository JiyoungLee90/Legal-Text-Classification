He had been admitted to the hospital on 1 April 2000 because he had attempted to commit suicide. The fact that her son had been able to leave the hospital premises on 27 April 2000 during his hospitalisation had led the applicant to conclude that the hospital staff had acted negligently in the performance of their duties. Because of his suicide attempts and mental condition, her son should have been under medical supervision and the hospital staff should have prevented him from leaving the hospital premises. She further claimed that the HSC should have erected fencing around the boundaries of its premises in order to prevent patients from leaving. The fact that those duties had not been complied with reflected the poor organisation of the HSC services. Lastly, she argued that the HSC lacked a mechanism for checking the presence of patients and an emergency procedure capable of detecting a patient\u2019s absence, which would allow the hospital to take the measures required to ensure that patients returned safely.",

If found that although her son had been suffering from a mental disorder, there was no causal link between his wholly unexpected suicide and an alleged violation of the hospital staff\u2019s duty of care. It noted, in particular, that the applicant\u2019s son had been suffering from a psychiatric disorder which had never been properly diagnosed, either because the symptoms were complex or because he had been addicted to alcohol and drugs. In this regard, it pointed out that over the years the applicant\u2019s son had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. However, only after his death and as a consequence of an expert opinion requested from the Medical Association during the proceedings (see paragraph 23 above) was there an agreement that he had been suffering from a severe personality disorder. The court established that he had last been admitted to hospital after a suicide attempt. However, it considered that despite the possibility that people diagnosed with mental diseases such as that of the applicant\u2019s son might commit suicide, during the last days before his death he had not shown any behaviour or mood which could have led the hospital staff to suspect that 27 April 2000 would be different from the preceding days. The court thus concluded that the hospital staff could not have foreseen the suicide of the applicant\u2019s son and that his behaviour had been absolutely unexpected and unpredictable. With regard to the applicant\u2019s argument that the hospital should have supervised her son more effectively and erected fences or other barriers around the hospital premises, the court pointed out that the current paradigm in the treatment of mentally ill patients was to encourage social interaction. The existence of fencing would lead to the stigmatisation and isolation of mentally disabled patients. In the same way, any supervision of patients had to be carried out discreetly. The HSC had a surveillance procedure in place which consisted of verifying the patients\u2019 presence at meal and medication times; this was in compliance with the most recent psychiatric science and respected the patients\u2019 right to privacy. With regard to the applicant\u2019s argument that the emergency procedure was non-existent, the court noted that it consisted in alerting the police and the patient\u2019s family. Therefore, the court found that there had been no omission in the duty of care on the part of the hospital.",

In their opinion, given that A.J.\u2019s medical record stated that he had attempted to commit suicide on different occasions and considering that he had last been admitted to hospital because of a suicide attempt, a new attempt to commit suicide was likely and should have been foreseen. They noted that the hospital had failed to implement a supervision regime capable of preventing the applicant\u2019s son from leaving the hospital premises. They also argued that the increased monitoring of the patient was part of the hospital\u2019s duty of care and did not detract from the \u201copen door\u201d regime.

The Supreme Court took into account that during previous periods of hospitalisation the applicant\u2019s son had also left the hospital premises, and that no link had been established between those \u201cescapes\u201d and a particular risk of suicide in so far as they had only been able to establish the existence of a single suicide attempt, on 1 April 2000. The Supreme Court considered that the counting of patients at meal and medication times was sufficient and had allowed the hospital staff to verify A.J.\u2019s attendance during lunch and the afternoon snack on 27 April 2000. It concluded that there had been no anomaly in the functioning of the HSC, nor could any anomaly be attributed to either the lack of security fences or walls, or the method of counting patients.",

However, in the particular circumstances of the danger of self-harm, the Court has held that for a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the relevant time that the life of the person concerned was at real and immediate risk and that they had not taken measures which could reasonably have been expected of them (see Hiller v.\u00a0Austria, no. 1967/14, \u00a7\u00a7 52-53, 22 November 2016, and Keenan, cited above, \u00a7 93). Such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (compare with Tanr\u0131bilir v. Turkey, no. 21422/93, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, 16 November 2000, and Keenan, cited above, \u00a7 90). At the same time, the Court reiterates that the very essence of the Convention is respect for human dignity and human freedom. In this regard, authorities must discharge their duties in a manner compatible with the rights and freedoms of the individual concerned and in such a way as to diminish the opportunities for self-harm, without infringing personal autonomy (see, mutatis mutandis, Miti\u0107 v.

Above all, they must also operate effectively in practice within a time-span such that the courts can complete their examination of the merits of each individual case; this requires a prompt examination of the case without unnecessary delays (see \u0160ilih v.

The parties\u2019 views differ, however, when it comes to the question of the foreseeability of A.J.\u2019s suicide and the hospital\u2019s duty to prevent him from escaping and taking his own life by further monitoring him and erecting some kind of protective fencing around the hospital premises so that it would not be so easy for patients to leave the hospital.",

According to the last clinical observation made on 25 April 2000, A.J.\u2019s \u201cdepressive episodes and recurrent suicide attempts\u201d were known to the health services (see paragraph 11 above). Moreover, the Court notes that when A.J. was admitted to hospital in December 1999, the doctor gave instructions for him not to leave the unit in which he had been hospitalised and in September 1999, the doctors recommended that the applicant seek a judicial order to have her son confined (see paragraph 7 above). The Court cannot speculate as to what the doctors\u2019 reasons could have been to justify such instructions and recommendation. It considers, however, that a risk of harm to him or to others must have existed. The Court also observes that according to the expert report submitted to the proceedings at the request of the Coimbra Administrative Court, \u201cthe clinical history [of the applicant\u2019s son] and the psychopathological framework [quadro psicopatol\u00f3gico] ...would predict future suicidal behaviour\u201d and the fact that he had wandered around the hospital without endangering his life should not be understood as meaning that the risk of suicide was negligible (see paragraph 23 above).

France (cited above), the Court found a violation of Article 2 because the authorities had known from a previous suicide attempt that the applicant\u2019s brother was suffering from an acute psychotic disorder capable of resulting in self-harm and did not take the required preventive operational measures to protect his life. The case of Reynolds v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (cited above) concerned a voluntary in-patient who had killed himself by breaking and jumping out of a sixth-floor window. The applicant\u2019s son had no history of self-harm or attempted suicide but had heard voices ordering him to kill himself and his condition was known to the hospital staff. The Court held that the applicant had an arguable claim that an operational duty under Article 2 had arisen to take reasonable steps to protect her son from a real and immediate risk of suicide and that that duty had not been fulfilled. In the case of Keenan, on the other hand, the Court found no violation of Article 2 because there had been no reason for the authorities to have been alerted on the day of the inmate\u2019s death that he was in a disturbed state of mind, rendering a suicide attempt likely, even though he had voiced such thoughts. In finding that there had been no violation of Article 2 of the Convention, the Court had regard, in particular, to the fact that the authorities had \u201cresponded in a reasonable way to Mark Keenan\u2019s conduct, placing him in hospital care and under watch when he evidenced suicidal tendencies\u201d (see Keenan, cited above, \u00a7 96).",

Moreover, A.J. had previously escaped from the hospital premises on different occasions; another escape attempt should therefore have been foreseen by the hospital staff with the possibility of a fatal outcome in the light of his diagnosis (see, mutatis mutandis, Reynolds, cited above, \u00a7 61, and Renolde, cited above, \u00a7 89).",

It\u00a0considers, however, that treatment under an \u201copen door\u201d regime cannot exempt the State from its obligations to protect mentally ill patients from the risks they pose to themselves, in particular when there are specific indications that such patients might commit suicide. Accordingly, a fair balance must be struck between the State\u2019s obligations under Article 2 of the Convention and the need to provide medical care in an \u201copen door\u201d regime, having in account the individual needs of special monitoring of suicidal patients. The Court notes in this regard that the Government contended that the applicant had never requested A.J.\u2019s compulsory confinement. It considers, however, that in this balancing exercise, a difference should not be made as to the nature of a patient\u2019s hospitalisation: regardless of whether the hospitalisation was of a voluntary or an involuntary nature, and in so far as a voluntary in-patient is under the care and supervision of the hospital, the State\u2019s obligations should be the same.

In the present case, A.J. was last seen after 4 p.m., during the afternoon snack, which he seems to have attended and which, according to the hospital guidelines, took place at around 4.45 p.m. He died at 5.37 p.m. when he jumped in front of a train, fifteen to twenty minutes\u2019 walking distance from the HSC. His absence was not observed until around 7 p.m. because he had not shown up for dinner. Thus A.J. was already dead when the emergency procedure was activated. The above-mentioned procedures were thus ineffective in preventing his escape from the hospital and, ultimately, his suicide. The Court further notes that the risk was exacerbated by the open and unrestricted access from the hospital grounds to the railway platform (see paragraphs 34-36 above).",

Furthermore, it might also have been expected that the authorities would have monitored A.J. on a more regular basis. In this regard, the instant case is distinguishable from Hiller, cited above, in which there were no signs in the hospital records of any suicidal thought or attempt; for that reason the Court considered that in the mentioned case the hospital staff could not have had any reason to expect the suicide and, therefore, had not acted negligently in allowing the mentally ill-patient to take walks on his own.",
