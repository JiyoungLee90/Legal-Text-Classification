The Government have offered no explanation for this. It cannot be said that during these periods of inactivity the investigation was dormant to the extent that the applicant should have realised that the investigation was going to be ineffective \u2013 on the contrary, the supervising prosecutor\u2019s instructions of 18 July 2003 (see paragraph 17 above) would have suggested that the investigation\u2019s conclusion was finally in sight. Moreover, there was no formal remedy to speed up the investigation as this was entirely in the hands of the authorities. The Court further notes that when the public prosecutor officially terminated the proceedings on the ground of the extinctive prescription of the criminal action, the applicant immediately contested the decision (and was initially successful \u2013 see paragraph 19 above). The general conduct of the investigation by the authorities thus allowed the statutory limitation period to lapse.",

Had the applicant complained before the Court at that time, there is a reasonable chance that his application would have been declared inadmissible both on account of the fact that the events took place before ratification of the Convention and on account of the Court\u2019s view that the Convention did not guarantee any right to criminal proceedings against third parties.",

By that time the development of the Court\u2019s views on the State obligation to investigate had already been triggered in its case-law of the late 1990s. However, he failed to join the criminal proceedings either as a civil party or as a private prosecutor and/or to request steps for their timely and proper conduct, with the exception of his mother\u2019s complaints in the period 1991-1994 (resulting in the prosecutor\u2019s order that they be completed \u201cwithout delay\u201d) and his lawyer\u2019s request in 2003 (resulting in an order that they be completed in thirty days).

By that time the applicant was clearly aware of the ineffectiveness of the criminal investigation and must have become aware that the reduction of the charges against the perpetrators in 1996 entailed the risk of an earlier time-bar for their prosecution. However, he failed to challenge that reclassification at the time, as he could have, and demonstrated no further interest in the proceedings for the next three years. In these circumstances I am not inclined to believe that the discontinuation of the proceedings as being timebarred took the applicant by surprise and I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s views that his appeal against the discontinuation of the proceedings in 2006 can be seen as an \u201cimmediate\u201d reaction (see paragraph\u00a051). Mr Shopov did not complain that he had no access to or opportunities for other action, as the majority appears to have assumed (see paragraph 51 in fine) in view of the absence of formal remedies at his disposal. Although undertaken between long intervals of complete inactivity, his attempts while the proceedings were still open did trigger a reaction, while the last one was undertaken when it was already too late. Thus, neither the applicant nor the investigating authorities took reasonable steps for the proper conduct and conclusion of the investigation in the meantime.",

The applicant provided no explanation as to why he had failed to bring his complaints under the Convention in the period before 2003, once he became aware of the ineffectiveness of the investigation, or after the expiry of the thirty-day time-limit for concluding it (see paragraph 17), but instead waited for three more years before lodging his application with the Court in 2007.",

Relying rigorously on all the new standards resulting from this subsequent development, the conclusions of the majority on the merits of the complaints appear to attach considerable significance to the ex officio nature of the positive obligation to investigate ill-treatment by private parties, while failing to subject to reasonable scrutiny the applicant\u2019s own conduct for the purposes of their admissibility. In this regard I find it difficult to agree that such an emphasis will meaningfully serve the purposes for which the ex officio nature of the obligation to investigate was initially developed, namely to impose a duty to establish and disclose the circumstances of wilful ill-treatment by State agents so as to safeguard the public interest in their accountability.",
