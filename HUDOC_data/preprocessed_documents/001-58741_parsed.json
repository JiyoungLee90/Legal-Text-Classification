In the applicant's case there was a conflict of evidence and the court needed to assess which evidence it would accept and which it would not. The new President of the District Court of Limassol had neither seen nor heard any of the witnesses and, as a result, he could not assess the evidence which had already been given. It followed that the President was not able to issue the reserved judgment on his own or together with the second member of the Full Court which had reserved the judgment. Nor was the President able to give directions to the second member of that Full Court to issue the reserved judgment on her own even though she had heard and seen all the witnesses. In these circumstances, the President of the District Court of Limassol decided that the applicant's case should be reheard from the beginning (de novo) and fixed a hearing date for 11 February 1998.",

To be present at all fifteen hearings during the first set of proceedings, he had to take annual leave from his work. All his annual holidays were taken up by the hearings and he was obliged to take some extra days off. This created extreme pressure and difficulties for him in his new job. During the second set of proceedings, every hearing was an ordeal for him because the defendants already knew his testimony and had prepared themselves to answer with lies most of the time. Financially, he had great difficulties to meet the fees of his solicitors and if it were not for their sympathetic understanding, most likely he would have stopped the proceedings for financial reasons. The extremely long delay caused him continuous anxiety, which affected his well being and overall behaviour. It put an enormous strain on his family and his relations suffered badly. He claimed 5,000\u00a0Cypriot pounds (CYP) in this respect.",
