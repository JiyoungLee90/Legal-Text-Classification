Such a position is absolutely incompatible with the obligations resulting from Article 3 of the Convention, given the extreme seriousness of the crime of torture. Together with the other shortcomings mentioned in paragraphs 72-76 above, this confirms the failure of the Moldovan authorities to fully denounce the practice of ill-treatment by the law-enforcement agencies and adds to the impression that the legislation adopted to prevent and punish acts of ill-treatment is not given full preventive effect. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that A.P. continues to work for the police and by the very small amount of damages which he has had to pay, in instalments, despite the lack of any evidence that the bailiff attempted to find any property which A.P. may own. As such, the case gives the impression not of preventing any future similar violations, but of being an example of virtually total impunity for ill-treatment by the law-enforcement agencies.",
