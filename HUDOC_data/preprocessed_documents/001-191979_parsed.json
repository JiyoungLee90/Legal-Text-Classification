The court considered that the testimony of witnesses in the case, identification reports, expert conclusions, and other data such as information from the authorities of Poland and Russia, were sufficient to hold that the applicant might have committed the criminal offences of which he was suspected. The court noted that it could only impose arrest if it was impossible to achieve the objectives of Article 119 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, namely to ensure that the suspect, the accused or the convicted person participated in the proceedings, to prevent interference with the pre-trial investigation or with the examination of the case before the court, or with the execution of the sentence, and to prevent the commission of further criminal acts by other, less restrictive measures. The court considered that the applicant was suspected of having committed deliberate criminal offences categorised as serious and very serious, and one crime of medium severity, which could lead to imprisonment of more than one year, which was enough to justify measures being taken against the risk of absconding. Also, some of the offences the applicant was suspected of could lead to life imprisonment. The risk of absconding was strengthened by the fact that the applicant had connections in European Union countries, Russia, Ukraine, and the United States, and had planned and committed crimes outside the territory of Lithuania. Moreover, he had already been found guilty of criminal offences in Lithuania and Germany, and it was possible that he would commit new ones. Lastly, the court noted that the pre-trial investigation was still ongoing, was very complex, and the applicant\u2019s detention was necessary to ensure his attendance during the proceedings.",

For example, on 18 April 2013 the Vilnius City District Court noted that even though the applicant was married and had a family and a permanent place of residence, these circumstances were not enough to ensure that the applicant would not abscond. On 17 July 2013 the Vilnius Regional Court held that the factual information, including the testimony of witnesses in the case, identification reports, restrictive measures, expert conclusions, items necessary for the investigation, and information received from the authorities of Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and Russia, were sufficient to hold that the applicant might have committed the criminal offences of which he was suspected. Also, the case was complex and wide-ranging; there were over forty suspects in the case; the offences had been committed in the territories of Lithuania, European Union member States, Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia; legal cooperation requests had been sent to Russia, Ukraine, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Also, numerous investigative actions had been taken since the last extension of the applicant\u2019s detention: existing suspects had been further questioned; new suspects had been arrested and questioned; restrictive measures had been either imposed or extended; expert conclusions had been received; large-scale replies had been received from the authorities of Russia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom; these replies had been translated into Lithuanian; and searches had been carried out, as well as other investigative actions. On 13\u00a0August 2013 the Court of Appeal observed that the pre-trial investigation was intense; its length depended on the objective circumstances and complexity of the case. On 21\u00a0October 2013 the Vilnius Regional Court noted that on 16 May 2013 another pre-trial investigation had been joined to the current one. On 15\u00a0November 2013 the Court of Appeal decided to strike the ground that the applicant might abscond out of the list of grounds on which the applicant had been detained. The court added that the applicant had some health issues but that medical assistance was available for him in the Prison Hospital, which he had already received. The court also considered that in the case at hand the criminal offences had been committed over a period of at least four years by a criminal organisation, the most serious form of complicity, and had involved the territories of multiple countries. Many procedural actions had been carried out, including the sending of legal assistance requests to Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the suspects and witnesses had been questioned again, eyewitnesses had been identified, new suspects had been arrested and questioned, recognitions had taken place, authorities of Russia and the United Kingdom had been addressed, the Vilnius City District Court had been approached with requests for searches, tasks to examine certain items had been resourced, and expert conclusions received. On 21 January and 17 April 2017 and the Vilnius Regional Court observed that additional information had been received from Spain and several legal assistance requests had been sent to Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.",

The courts constantly held that this measure was not too strict in the circumstances of the present case. The courts considered that bail, requested by the applicant, would not remove the threat to the criminal process or to the interests of society, the State, or to other people. They also indicated that the case file kept growing, and that by January 2016 it had reached over 130 volumes. On 16 May 2016 the Court of Appeal noted that the length of the pre-trial detention could not exceed two-thirds of the most serious sentence a person risked incurring. In the present case this requirement had not been breached.",

The court referred to the Court\u2019s practice and held that the persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested had committed an offence was a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer sufficed. Formal arguments that a person might abscond, commit new offences or interfere with the execution of justice were not enough to extend detention. Prolonged detention could only be possible in exceptional cases when other less restrictive measures were not enough. In the present case, the applicant was arrested on 22\u00a0January 2013; at this time his detention had lasted for three years and six months. In 2016 for objective reasons only three hearings had taken place in the criminal case, and other hearings had been scheduled for 25\u00a0October, 29 November, and 13, 21 and 22 December 2016. A further extension of the applicant\u2019s detention could therefore be assessed as a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. The court took into account the fact that EUR 30,000 had been paid as bail. It ordered his documents to be confiscated and placed him under intense supervision by ordering him to wear an electronic ankle bracelet. The applicant was also prohibited from leaving his home for six months unless related to the court hearings. The applicant was released immediately.",

The court observed that the lower court had not examined whether the grounds to detain the applicant had disappeared. The court held that although the applicant had a family (he married for a second time while detained), a place of residence, and sufficient income, he had been found guilty of an offence in the past, which was a negative character trait. Moreover, the nature and scale of the alleged criminal activities allowed for the conclusion that the applicant had connections abroad. There was therefore a risk that he might abscond. Taking into account the nature of the offences, there was a risk that the applicant might commit further crimes. Although the court acknowledged that the applicant had been detained for a very long time (more than three years and six months), it reiterated that the public interest outweighed the right to individual liberty. The scope of the case (thirteen accused and 139 volumes of material) and the complexity of the investigation justified the applicant\u2019s continued detention. The court noted that examination of the criminal case had not continued after the previous hearing on 29 February 2016 and that the break in proceedings was scheduled to last until 25\u00a0October 2016. However, a hearing due on 16 June 2016 had not taken place, because two of the accused had not been present, while the state of health of another two accused had caused another break. The court further observed that twenty-four hearings had taken place in 2015, and concluded that the examination of the case had been intensive. The court ordered the applicant\u2019s detention for three months from the date of his arrest.",

The court held that the examination of the case was speedy, but that the process had been protracted for reasons unconnected with the work of the court, such as delay in expert reports and illnesses of the accused. The court also indicated that a search for L.P., who was one of the accused, had been announced. From then on the applicant\u2019s detention was extended every three months. The last decision, by which the applicant\u2019s detention was extended for three months, was adopted on 3 November 2017 by the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court. The courts observed the growing volume of the case material, the need to order psychiatric examinations for several of the accused, and the international element of the case. On 12 June 2017 the Court of Appeal disagreed with the arguments of the applicant\u2019s lawyer that examination of the criminal case had become protracted because of the ineffective organisation of the trial court\u2019s work. The court held that the hearings had been scheduled in advance and that examination of the case had become protracted for objective reasons (some hearings had not taken place because of the state of health of the accused, requests from the accused and their lawyers, and the additional questioning of witnesses). The court noted that none of the hearings had been cancelled or postponed because of negligence or inaction on the part of the judges. The court was of the view that the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court had examined the criminal case with sufficient due diligence. Finally, the court held that the Court\u2019s judgment in Lisovskij v.\u00a0Lithuania (no. 36249/14, 2 May 2017) was not final and could be changed by the Grand Chamber.\u00a0\u00a0On 30 August 2017 the Court of Appeal found that although for thirty-three months in total there had been no hearings, the breaks had taken place for reasons unconnected with the work of the courts, and it had not been possible to speed up the proceedings. The court observed that during the hearing of 2 December 2015 it had been announced that the next hearing would take place on 29\u00a0February 2016 because there needed to be a psychiatric examination of two of the accused. On 19\u00a0January 2016 the results of the psychiatric examination were received but it had been decided that the court\u2019s questions could not be answered, and a new psychiatric examination was ordered by a decision of the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court of 29 February 2016. The results were received on 8 and 15 June 2016. The criminal case had not been examined in the hearings that took place on 16 June and 25 October 2016 because some of the accused and their lawyers had failed to appear. On 29 November 2016 the examination of the evidence had continued. The court considered that the breaks in the proceedings had taken place because of both justified and unjustified failure of the parties to the proceedings to appear, prior commitments of the court, or of the parties to the proceedings, and other circumstances. Nevertheless, the court considered that the hearings had been scheduled at regular intervals and the length of the proceedings was justifiable. The court referred to Lisovskij (cited above) but stated that the factual circumstances of that case and the present one were different. Finally, the court held that the examination of the evidence in the criminal case was now complete, and that the case was at the stage of closing statements, however, new circumstances could be revealed at that stage and there was a necessity to further extend the applicant\u2019s detention. On 11\u00a0December 2017 the Court of Appeal indicated that a search for one of the accused, L.P. had been announced in 2016 and that he had been found and transferred from Sweden to Lithuania on 18 January 2017.",

The court noted that the issue of the length of the applicant\u2019s detention had been examined by the Court. The court further noted that because of the length of the examination of the criminal case the sentence imposed was lower than the average for such offences. The court also stated that according to the practice of the Court, a more lenient sentence could be imposed to compensate for the length of a restrictive measure, and this would deprive a person of his or her victim status. The court did not, however, further elaborate on that issue and did not refer to any cases of the Court.",

The last decision to extend the applicant\u2019s detention at the pre-trial stage was taken on 17 April 2014. The courts when extending the applicant\u2019s detention relied on various reasons. They noted that although the applicant had a permanent place of residence, children, and a family, these circumstances did not render it unnecessary to keep him in detention. And the applicant had previous convictions: this was a negative character trait and showed that he was not keen on following the laws and general ethical norms. The courts also relied on the complexity of the case and the investigative actions that needed to be performed. On 13 August 2013 the Court of Appeal decided to remove the ground that the applicant might interfere with the proceedings if released. On 21 October 2013 the Vilnius Regional Court noted that the offences had been well planned and had been committed not only in Lithuania but also in other countries. On 19\u00a0November 2013 the Court of Appeal observed that on 16 May\u00a02013 another pre-trial investigation was joined to the present one. On 20\u00a0January\u00a02014 the Vilnius Regional Court held that there were over fifty suspects in the case, and that legal cooperation requests had been sent to Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The circle of suspects and the offences were continuing to increase. Also, numerous investigative actions had been taken since the applicant\u2019s detention had last been extended: suspects had been further questioned, new suspects had been arrested and questioned, witnesses had been questioned, searches of several suspects had been announced and carried out, restrictive measures had been imposed or extended, searches had been performed, items necessary for the investigation had been taken, tasks for experts had been appointed, some expert conclusions had been received, and wide-ranging replies on some of the issues had been received from the authorities of Russia and Spain.",

The last decision to extend the applicant\u2019s detention was adopted on 3 November 2017 by the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court. The courts constantly underlined the complexity of the case and its international element. On 12 June 2017 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. The court held that Lisovskij (cited above), referred to by the applicant, was not final and could still be changed. The court stated that the criminal case was extremely complex, had 147 volumes, and the offences had been committed in Lithuania, other European Union member States, and also third States. Hearings had been scheduled on 11, 12, and 25\u00a0November and 9 December 2014; 19 and 20 January, 24 February, 16,\u00a018,\u00a030, and 31 March, 1 and 13 April, 3, 4, 5, and 19 May, 1 and\u00a02\u00a0June, 13 and 14 July, 16 and 19 October, 10 and 11\u00a0November, and 1\u00a0and\u00a02\u00a0December 2015; 29 February, 16 June, 25\u00a0October and 29\u00a0November 2016; 17 February, 17 March, 3 and 11\u00a0April, and 3\u00a0and\u00a016\u00a0May 2017; and had also been scheduled on 30 June and 3,\u00a011\u00a0and\u00a012\u00a0July\u00a02017. The court held that some of the hearings had been adjourned for reasons unconnected with its work: on 16\u00a0March 2015 the victim, A.P., had failed to appear, and had subsequently been placed under arrest for one month in order to ensure his attendance. On 2 April 2015 the court had ordered that seven witnesses be brought to the hearing, while an adjournment had taken place on 14 and 15 April 2015 because of the state of health of one of the accused. On 3 June 2015 the court had ordered one witness to pay a fine and ordered the authorities to bring him to the hearing. A hearing due on 16 October 2015 had not taken place because the applicant was ill. During a hearing on 19 October 2015 one of the accused had been questioned but it had been found that he had experienced a head injury the month before. Another accused\u2019s health was also questionable, thus an expert opinion had been ordered by the court on 20 October 2015. Another expert report had been ordered on 29 February 2016. The hearing set for 25 October 2016 was postponed because one of the accused, L.P., had breached the requirements of his restrictive measure and had been arrested in Sweden, while two other accused had health issues. The other hearings had taken place in accordance with the schedule. On 30 August 2017 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. The court dismissed the arguments of the applicant\u2019s lawyer that the applicant\u2019s detention had been extended on identical grounds to those given by the courts. The court stated that the mere fact that the arguments given by the courts had been similar or identical did not mean that the reasons to extend the detention had been arbitrary. The court considered that the first-instance court had complied with the requirement of requisite diligence, and made a reasoned conclusion. Moreover, the case was extremely complex, and had 150 volumes of material at that time. The examination of the accused had been protracted for reasons unconnected with the work of the court: the necessity to carry out certain investigative actions; failure of the parties to the proceedings to appear, for both justified and unjustified reasons; and prior commitments on the part of the parties to the proceedings and the court. The regional court had taken the necessary measures (fines, summons, and other measures) to ensure that the proceedings were not protracted. The court referred to the case-law of the Court, and observed that the exceptional circumstances could justify the length of the pre-trial detention. Such circumstances in the present case were: the danger presented by the applicant, his supposed role in the offences of which he was accused, and the nature of the offences. As mentioned by the other courts, the applicant was accused of setting up a criminal organisation using firearms that had committed offences designated as both very serious and serious within the territories of several States. The applicant\u2019s detention was thus justified. On 22 November 2017 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. The court observed that the argument of the applicant\u2019s lawyer, that the applicant was never the cause of cancellation or adjournment of the hearings, was not justified, because on 16\u00a0October 2015 the hearing did not take place because the applicant refused to attend because of the conditions of detention in custody. Also, the court noted that the next hearing was scheduled for 7\u00a0December 2017 and the closing statements would be pronounced at that hearing, which meant that the case would be determined soon.",

On 6 February 2017 the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Administrative Court dismissed the part of the applicant\u2019s complaint covering the period between 31 October and 5\u00a0November 2008 because he had missed a three-year limitation period. The court held that no long-stay visits were allowed for remand detainees under domestic law but that the applicant had received forty-three short visits between 24 January 2013 and 17 August 2015. However, in compensation for inadequate conditions of detention the applicant had received EUR\u00a05,800 for 671 days of insufficient personal space at his disposal and other material conditions of detention. On 14 March 2018 the Supreme Administrative Court referred to the case of Varnas v.\u00a0Lithuania (no.\u00a042615/06, 9 July 2013) and held that the applicant\u2019s rights had been breached with regard to the authorities\u2019 refusal to allow him long-stay visits. The court increased the compensation to EUR 7,300.",

The last decision to extend the applicant\u2019s detention was adopted on 3 November 2017 by the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court. The courts relied on the complexity of the case and the international element, and noted that the court examining the criminal case on the merits had put maximum efforts into ensuring that the examination of the case was speedy; despite this the process had been protracted for unconnected reasons.

It reiterated the reasons given by the Court of Appeal on 12 June 2017 in the second applicant\u2019s case (see paragraph 29 above).

The court did not agree that the proceedings in the criminal case had been conducted passively: the hearings had been scheduled in advance and the schedule had been intense. The breaks in the proceedings had been announced because of failure of the parties to the proceedings to appear, because of absconding, and because of the necessity to carry out special investigations.",

He had also been diagnosed with Hepatitis C, but none of these circumstances meant that he could not be detained.",

The fact that the applicant had a child was not sufficient to hold that the applicant would not abscond; nor were the applicant\u2019s health issues. If medical treatment was necessary, the applicant would have to approach the prison authorities, who were obliged to ensure the proper provision of medical services. Also, the applicant was suspected of committing wellorganised crimes that had an international element. He was suspected of being one of the leaders of a criminal organisation. It was also suspected that the applicant had been receiving income from his criminal activities, because although he had several business certificates he had not been engaging in any activity in that respect, and had not received income from them.",

From then on, the applicant\u2019s detention was regularly extended every three months. The last decision on that matter was adopted by the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court on 3\u00a0November 2017. On 12 June 2017 the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant. The court analysed the requisite diligence criteria established in Lisovskij (cited above), which was referred to by the applicant\u2019s lawyer. The court held that while very long periods of detention did not automatically violate Article 5 \u00a7 3, exceptional circumstances were usually required to justify them. In the case at hand, those special circumstances were the dangerousness of the applicant\u2019s character, the nature and extent of the criminal offences, the fact that the offences had been committed by a criminal organisation that possessed firearms, and the fact that the offences had an international element. The court examining the criminal case had taken all the necessary measures to ensure that there were no unjustified delays in the criminal proceedings. Although no hearings had taken place from 2\u00a0December 2015 to 29 November 2016 there had been objective reasons for this: it had been announced during the hearing on 20\u00a0October 2015 that no hearing would take place on 19 January 2016 because one of the judges had a hearing in another case; on 2 December 2015 the court had announced that there would be a break until 29\u00a0February\u00a02016 because there was to be a psychiatric examination of two of the accused on 19 January 2016; an additional expert report was commissioned for the same two accused on 29\u00a0February 2016; and there was a further adjournment (the results of the expert report were received on 8\u00a0and 17 June 2016); the hearing on 16 June 2016 did not take place because one of the accused was sick and another had been arrested in Sweden; and there was no hearing on 25\u00a0November 2016 because three of the accused had failed to appear (one of them had been arrested in Sweden and his transfer to Lithuania was to take place on 18 January 2017). Further hearings had been scheduled for 30 June 2017, while the questioning of two\u00a0witnesses and closing speeches had been scheduled for 3,\u00a011\u00a0and\u00a012\u00a0July\u00a02017. The court concluded that the examination of the criminal case had not been unreasonably protracted. On 30 August 2017 the Court of Appeal held that the absence of close social ties, the number of offences committed, their international element, their severity, their nature, and the fact that the applicant risked a very severe sentence, all increased the risk of absconding. It was also probable that the applicant would commit new crimes if released. Also, the court held that the closing speeches had already commenced in the criminal case, and the court examining the case was obliged to make sure that the case was examined as quickly as possible.",

Consequently, the Government are estopped from raising their preliminary objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies or alleged prematurity of the examination of the applicants\u2019 complaint, which objection must therefore be dismissed (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).",

The Government noted the broad scope of the case: it had involved fifty suspects, thirteen of whom were charged, eighty-five witnesses, six victims, and a large number of investigative actions. As regards the decisions on detention, they had not been adopted automatically but had been based on careful consideration of each individual case and were well reasoned. More specifically, the decisions had been based on the strong likelihood that the applicants had committed the offences at issue. The decisions had also been based on relevant and sufficient reasons \u2013 the risk they would abscond, the risk they would reoffend, and the risk they would obstruct the course of the proceedings. The courts referred to the specific facts of the case and the circumstances related to the applicants\u2019 personalities, and did not use arguments that were general and abstract.

The only longer breaks were those between 14 July and 16 October 2015; between 2\u00a0December 2015 and 16 June 2016; between 16 June and 29 November 2016; and between 29 November 2016 and 17 February 2017. However, these breaks were because of the refusal of some of the co-accused to give statements; the need to obtain an expert opinion on the mental state of two of the coaccused; the medical examination needed for one of the accused; and the absence of the accused L.P., who had had to be brought back to Lithuania under the European Arrest Warrant. The Government submitted that only eleven out of fifty scheduled court hearings in the criminal case had not taken place, for reasons attributable to the court or national authorities. It was the Government\u2019s view that the court had taken all the necessary measures to speed up the proceedings: for example, the case against L.P., who had fled to Sweden, was separated from the applicants\u2019 case. Also, the remand measures for the co-accused who had failed to appear at hearings had been replaced with more severe ones; one witness was questioned using audio and visual measures; and fines or attendance at a court hearing were imposed on the witnesses who had failed to appear. Finally, after all the coaccused, witnesses and victims had given their testimony, the judgment had been adopted in less than six months, which could be considered a short period of time considering the complexity of the case. The Government referred to the case of Lisovskij (cited above) and argued that unlike that case, in the applicant\u2019s case the authorities had taken appropriate measures to schedule the hearings more efficiently and to ensure shorter intervals between them.",

Although the applicants argued to the contrary, the Court reiterates that \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d requires the presence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence (see Gusinskiy v. Russia, no. 70276/01, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2004IV, and the cases cited therein) and the facts which raise a suspicion justifying arrest under Article 5 of the Convention do not need to be of the same level as those necessary to bring charges or secure a conviction (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 300A, and \u015eahin Alpay v.

The reasons relied upon by the domestic courts cannot be said to have been stated in abstracto. They included some of the reasons which, according to the Court\u2019s caselaw, may justify pre-trial detention (see Buzadji, cited above, \u00a7\u00a088) as well as other reasons which are relevant for the assessment of the duration of the period in detention (see Lisovskij, cited above, \u00a7 80, and the references therein). It cannot be said that they ordered or extended the applicants\u2019 detention on identical or stereotypical grounds, using a preexisting template or formalistic and abstract language (see Lisovskij, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077, and the references therein; compare and contrast Trifkovi\u0107 v.

Thus, the Court is satisfied that the domestic courts did not use \u201cgeneral and abstract\u201d arguments for the applicants\u2019 continued detention, and that their reasons were relevant and sufficient. However, the assessment of the \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons cannot be detached from the actual length of pre-trial detention. Accordingly, it remains to be ascertained whether the judicial authorities displayed requisite diligence in the conduct of the proceedings (see G\u00e1bor Nagy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077).",

The length of this period raises a concern in itself. It is true that during the pre-trial investigation, which lasted for almost a year and six months after the applicants\u2019 arrest (see paragraph 71 above), the authorities carried out a number of investigative measures, including multiple requests for legal assistance from foreign countries (see paragraph 71 above). During that period, in their decisions to extend the applicants\u2019 detention on remand the domestic courts also relied on the need to carry out additional investigative actions (see paragraphs 10, 24, 39 and 57 above). In that connection, the Court notes that the applicants did not elaborate on the issue of the length of their detention on remand during the pre-trial investigation. Having regard to that and the fact that the pre-trial investigation concerned multiple criminal offences allegedly committed by a criminal organisation, and was thus of considerable complexity and involved an international element, the Court is of the view that the actions of the domestic authorities during that period could be considered as falling within the standard of requisite diligence under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. Accordingly, it remains to be ascertained whether the judicial authorities exercised requisite diligence in the conduct of the criminal proceedings against the applicants and whether the domestic courts duly assessed the course of these proceedings.",

The hearings were scheduled on a monthly (or nearly monthly) basis, or even more frequently (see paragraph 72 above). However, bearing in mind that at the start of the court proceedings the applicants had already been detained for one and a half years, the Court is not convinced that the scheduling of hearings displayed sufficient diligence on the part of the authorities (see Lisovskij, cited above, \u00a7\u00a079, and the references therein).",

As a result of repeated adjournments or cancellations, there were several long periods when no hearings were held: although the case was transferred for examination on the merits on 2 July 2014, the first hearing only took place on 11 November 2014; there was a break between 14 July and 19 October 2015; between 2 December 2015 and 29 November 2016; between 29\u00a0November 2016 and 17 February 2017; and between 12 July and 6\u00a0October 2017. In that connection, the Court notes that the Government\u2019s submissions on the breaks in the proceedings are not accurate and contradict the information in the Court\u2019s possession (see paragraphs 72 and 90 above). The Court further observes that although some of the shorter breaks in the proceedings could be justified by various procedural reasons (see paragraph 72 above), the period between 2 December 2015 and 29 November 2016, when no hearings took place, raises particular concern and the Government have hardly provided any reasons to justify the absence of the hearings during that period.",

The Court also accepts that the investigation was additionally complicated by the need to obtain evidence from abroad, since the criminal organisation had operated in a number of countries (see \u0141aszkiewicz v. Poland, no. 28481/03, \u00a7\u00a061, 15\u00a0January 2008; Ereren v.\u00a0Germany, no. 67522/09, \u00a7 62, 6 November 2014; Mer\u010dep v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a012301/12, \u00a7 110, 26 April 2016). However, it does not appear that any measures were taken to speed up the proceedings, considering the gaps between the hearings (see paragraph 72 above). The Court observes that hearings were adjourned or cancelled mainly because of the need to carry out investigations of the state of health of several of the co-accused or because of the absences of some of the co-accused, their lawyers, or sometimes the applicants themselves. The Court acknowledges that in certain circumstances this could be justified; however, in the present case the Government have not provided any information of the attempts on the part of the domestic authorities to fix a tighter and more efficient hearing schedule in order to avoid repeated adjournments or cancellations (see Lisovskij, cited above, \u00a7\u00a080).
