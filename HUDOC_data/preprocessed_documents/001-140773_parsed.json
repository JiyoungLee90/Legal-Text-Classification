Nor was there any evidence to support the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant was predisposed to commit offences. On the contrary, he was unknown to the police and had not been in possession of any drugs when the police officers had sought them from him; accordingly, he had only been able to supply them through an acquaintance who had obtained them from a dealer whose identity remained unknown. Although Mr Teixeira de Castro had potentially been predisposed to commit an offence, there was no objective evidence to suggest that he had initiated a criminal act before the police officers\u2019 intervention.

Accordingly, since the applicant accused C. of having incited the commission of the offence, it is necessary to examine the manner in which the domestic courts analysed C.\u2019s conduct in the present case.

Accordingly, he had had no reason to visit the applicant\u2019s office and to ask for vaccination documents. The pet passport which was included in the file concerned a dog of a different breed than that initially indicated by C. in his report to the police. Moreover, according to the applicant, and not disputed by the Government, that document mentioned the dog as belonging to another person, rather than to C. (see paragraph 18 above).",

Indeed, if C. provided false information to the police about having a dog and needing to obtain papers for it, his credibility in respect of the alleged soliciting of a bribe by the applicant would also be shaken.

Although in the present case the domestic courts had reason to suspect that there was an entrapment, they did not analyse the relevant factual and legal elements which would have helped them to distinguish entrapment from a legitimate form of investigative activity (see, for instance, Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, \u00a7 137, ECHR 2006XII (extracts)). In view of the above, and of the use of evidence obtained through C.\u2019s active involvement under police supervision to convict the applicant, his trial was deprived of the fairness required by Article 6 of the Convention.",
