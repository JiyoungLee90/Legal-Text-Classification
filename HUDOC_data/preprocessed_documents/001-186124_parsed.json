Since he had been dealing with that case, he had decided to ask him some questions. Levon Gulyan had been tired and irritated, so he had decided to change the subject and had asked some unrelated questions concerning his restaurant. Levon Gulyan had then asked for permission to smoke and later for some water. There had been no water or bottle in the office. He had gone to a nearby office to fetch water but had then heard the sound of a window opening and a \u201cboom\u201d. He had run back to the office but there had been no one. The window had been open so he had immediately understood that Levon Gulyan had escaped. He had quickly run to the courtyard and had seen Levon Gulyan lying on his back, with blood around his head. There had been no one there, but later the members of his unit had arrived. A.M. submitted that he could not give their names as he had been in a state of shock.",

They had been caused by severe blunt force trauma and could, as stated, have been caused by a fall from a height. The distribution of the lesions and the position of the body at the scene suggested that the deceased had hit the ground with the head and the upper part of the body first, and that he might have hit an object on the way down, possibly the pipe seen on the outside of the building under the window. There were no lesions that could not be explained by a fall from a height. On the other hand, it could not be ruled out that a few of the smaller bruises and abrasions could have been caused by another impact (such as a punch or blow) prior to the fall. The experts, having examined the scene of the incident, found no indentations or other indications of a person having hit the shed. They did not examine the gas pipe.",

At the PDCI he had been taken to the office of the head of the Homicide Unit G.T., who had had a talk with him for about thirty minutes, during which Levon Gulyan had provided the nickname of one of the persons who had been involved in the argument with S.V. G.T. had then left the office in order to report this new piece of information, while Levon Gulyan had remained with the deputy head of the Homicide Unit A.M., with whom he had had a talk of a general nature. During their conversation Levon Gulyan had found out that M.G. had also been invited to the PDCI. Realising the imminence of a face-to-face confrontation with her, during which he would not have been able to conceal the identity of those involved in the argument, including that of the murderer, he had decided to escape. For that purpose he had asked Officer A.M. for some water. After A.M. had gone out to fetch some water, Levon Gulyan had tried to escape through the window but had fallen from a height of about 7 m and had died on the spot. Taking into account that Levon Gulyan had not been subjected to violence, threats, or inhuman or degrading treatment during his stay at the PDCI, and the fact that his escape had been motivated by his intention to conceal the identity of the offenders and his death had been the result of a fall, there was no corpus delicti in the actions of the police officers. Nor was there a criminal element in A.M.\u2019s actions, specifically the fact that he had left Levon Gulyan alone in the office, because Levon Gulyan had had only the status of a witness as opposed to that of a suspect or accused.",

In its decision, reasoned in detail, the District Court found, inter alia, that: (a)\u00a0the investigating authority had failed to determine the lawfulness of taking Levon Gulyan and others between 10 and 12 May 2007 to the law-enforcement agencies and keeping them there for extended periods of time; (b) the allegations raised in the press and by some of the witnesses, including barman H.M., that Levon Gulyan had been ill-treated with the purpose of coercing a confession during his stays at the law-enforcement agencies had not been investigated, including the allegation that such acts had been committed in G.T.\u2019s office and had led to his being thrown out of the window; (c) not all reasonable steps had been taken to secure evidence, including questioning police officers, to prevent their possible collusion and preserve the scene of the incident; (d) no proper assessment had been made of the fact that Levon Gulyan had neither been summoned nor gone voluntarily to the PDCI; (e) the events preceding the incident had not been properly clarified, in view of the multiple discrepancies in the statements made by the police officers, which also cast doubt on their credibility and the validity of the conclusions reached by the investigating authority on the basis of those statements; (f) no proper assessment had been made of the alleged behaviour of the deputy head of the Homicide Unit, A.M., upon his return to G.T.\u2019s office, specifically his reaction to the open window; (g) it had not been clarified whether Levon Gulyan had been able to move about freely while at the PDCI; (h) no investigation had been carried out into the fact that his shoe laces had been missing at the time of the incident and had been found in his trouser pockets; (i) no convincing evidence had been obtained concerning Levon\u00a0Gulyan\u2019s fall and the preceding events; the investigating authority from the very outset had carried out the investigation on the premise that Levon Gulyan had attempted to escape and had died as a result of a fall, but had failed to carry out a complete and objective investigation into his motives, including the fact that he had only been a witness and that the window had been more than 7 m high and there had been numerous obstacles in the police building; (j) while, according to the official version, Levon Gulyan had hit an obstacle or obstacles during the fall, which could have been the gas pipe, no explanation had been provided for the absence of any particles on his clothes and under his fingernails of the pipe in question or any other possible obstacle, such as the entresol shed, or vice versa; nor had it been clarified whose fibres had been discovered on Levon Gulyan\u2019s clothes and no samples had been taken in that connection from police officers; (k) no explanation had been provided or samples taken from police officers in relation to the palm print found on the window, which had not belonged to Levon Gulyan; (l) the investigation had not clarified the mechanics of Levon Gulyan\u2019s fall and had not carried out in that connection an investigative experiment because of the absence of a suitable dummy, despite the fact that such an experiment had been ordered by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office; no measures had been taken to obtain such a dummy from the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of Russia within the framework of inter-State legal assistance; (m) no investigation had been carried out in connection with the findings of foreign experts concerning the other injuries found on Levon Gulyan\u2019s body, such as small bruises and scratches; (n) it had not been clarified how a lock of hair belonging to Levon Gulyan had been found lying at a distance from his body; (o) the applicant and other victims in the criminal case had not been involved in any investigative or other procedural measures and had had no possibility to pose questions to the police officers or the experts; and (p) the remains of a cigarette found in the ashtray in G.T.\u2019s office had not been seized and examined to determine whether it had been Levon Gulyan who had smoked it.",

Furthermore, the explanation provided for that sole premise was farfetched and the investigating authority, having showed a one-sided approach to the assessment of the collected evidence, had failed to carry out an impartial, objective and full investigation in that connection, thereby reaching inaccurate conclusions. The investigating authority had failed to explain and assess why Levon Gulyan, who had already been questioned, had been \u201cinvited\u201d and then, having been de facto deprived of his liberty, transferred to the PDCI in order to carry out \u201cinvestigative measures, including a cross-examination\u201d by officials who had had no authority to do so, which had violated his right to liberty and resulted in his demise. There had been no instruction from the investigator to carry out a face-to-face confrontation and, moreover, by taking Levon Gulyan to an alleged confrontation, the PDCI officers had violated Article 206 \u00a7 2 of the CCP, pursuant to which a witness had had to be questioned at the location where the investigation had been in train or, if necessary, where he or she had been located, whereas the PDCI could not be considered to have been either of those. The assessment of evidence had not been objective since the investigating authority had given preference to the statements of the police officers without a proper evaluation of other evidence in the case. The resulting decision, which had been taken in violation of the Constitution and Article 2 of the Convention, had amounted to a two-page document which had failed to make even a single reference to any evidence.",

The Court of Cassation stated at the outset that the authorities were required under Article\u00a02 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation with the aim of providing a convincing explanation for the death of Levon\u00a0Gulyan who, at the material time, had been under the supervision of the PDCI officers. It further held that not all measures had been taken yet for the authorities to be considered to have fulfilled this requirement. In particular, no investigative experiment had been performed to determine the mechanics of Levon Gulyan\u2019s fall, whereas the necessity of such an experiment had been confirmed by the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan, the investigating authority and the supervising prosecutor. The investigating authority was still reasonably capable of taking measures to obtain the necessary dummy, since it could be ordered from the same company which provided dummies to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of Russia. However, the investigating authority had not taken any measures in that connection in the four months following the letter of 1 December 2008. It was therefore necessary to obtain the dummy in question, carry out the experiment, compare its results with the other evidence and, if necessary, carry out other investigative measures. The Court of Cassation held that a conclusive finding on the fulfilment of the procedural obligation of Article 2 of the Convention would be possible only following the implementation of the experiment in question and, if necessary, of the resulting other measures. A global assessment of the effectiveness of the investigation would be possible after taking into account all such evidence. Therefore, the questions raised by the applicant in his appeal could be answered only after the investigation had been completed.",

The applicant pointed to the fact that Levon Gulyan had been involved in the case only as a witness and had never tried to avoid appearing before the investigating authority.

It had also lacked logic, taking into account the height of the second-floor window and the fact that there had been no unimpeded exit from the police building\u2019s courtyard. No convincing motives had been put forward for his alleged escape, while the one put forward had not been supported by any evidence, including any proof of Levon Gulyan\u2019s interview on that day or of a face-to-face confrontation that had been due to take place between him and M.G.

It was suspicious that, after having been transferred to the PDCI under the control of two officers, Levon Gulyan had been left alone in the office without any supervision. The investigation had failed to take all the necessary measures to establish the identity of the person to whom the palm print had belonged and to investigate the origin of the injuries on Levon Gulyan\u2019s body which had been sustained while alive or of the foreign natural and chemical fibers found on his clothes and under his fingernails, which may have suggested very close contact with another person and could not have ruled out the possibility of resistance. The investigating authority had failed to carry out the relevant investigative experiment to establish the mechanics of Levon Gulyan\u2019s fall or to try to give any explanation for the absence of his shoe lace, the fact that his body had been found at a distance of 5.8 m from the building and the question as to how he could have fallen out of a window which had been only 40 cm wide. The numerous discrepancies in the police officers\u2019 statements had not been duly addressed. Not all the identities of those involved in the incident had been disclosed and nobody had been charged or punished. His rights as a victim had not been duly ensured, since he had encountered obstacles when trying to obtain information and he had not been notified of the decision of 8 February 2012, as a result not being able to contest it. The investigation had not been independent because on each occasion when the courts had ordered its resumption it had been assigned to the same SIS investigator.

They argued that Levon Gulyan could have had an interest in concealing the circumstances of S.V.\u2019s death, since it had been established that he had been involved in the argument with S.V. and a friend of a friend had been implicated in his shooting. Furthermore, the motive of Levon Gulyan\u2019s attempted escape from the building of the police headquarters had been established, specifically to avoid an imminent confrontation with waitress M.G., of which he had learned not long before his attempted escape. Medical report no. 418 had also proved the fact that Levon Gulyan had died as a result of a fall as opposed to any ill-treatment, since it had established that there had been no lesions on his body which could not be explained by a fall. This fact had also been confirmed by the statements of the police officers. Moreover, the presence of fibres did not necessarily suggest any resistance, as claimed by the applicant. The fact of Levon Gulyan\u2019s attempted escape had been further supported by a number of examinations, which had confirmed the presence of his fingerprints on the window frame and of smears on the windowsill which had had the same generic origin as the samples taken from the soles of his shoes. Furthermore, the window from which Levon Gulyan had tried to escape had been only 40 cm wide and it was difficult to imagine that he \u2013 with a height of 178 cm and weighing 95\u00a0kg \u2013 could have been thrown out of that window without any signs of violence on his body.",

Firstly, the investigative measures taken had been adequate and prompt: on the very day of the incident the scene had been immediately examined, criminal proceedings had been instituted, a forensic medical examination had been ordered, statements had been taken from Officers G.T. and A.M., who had also been questioned as witnesses, thereby effectively preventing their collusion, and samples had been taken from Levon Gulyan\u2019s hair and fingernails. Between 13 and 15 May 2007 a number of other examinations had been ordered. Later a number of other witnesses had been questioned, including PDCI Officers V.G. and S.M., and further examinations had been ordered. The marks found on the window had been examined and been found neither to belong to Officers G.T. and A.M. nor to the cleaning lady. Following the decision of the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan of 6 June 2008, the investigating authority had taken measures to eliminate the deficiencies of the investigation mentioned in that decision. In particular, additional interviews had been conducted with a number of police officers in order to clarify the discrepancies between their statements, as well as with Levon Gulyan\u2019s wife and the cleaning lady. An enquiry had been sent to the PDCI to find out whether there had been any eyewitnesses to Levon Gulyan\u2019s fall. As regards the investigative experiment, the investigating authority had acted diligently by trying to obtain the necessary dummy after the investigation had been resumed on 8 September 2011, by sending enquiries to various State bodies, none of whom unfortunately had had the required dummy. The Government argued that the failure to conduct the investigative experiment in question could not have had a significant impact on the adequacy of the investigation. They further argued that the applicant had been closely involved in the proceedings, having been recognised as the victim and informed of his rights two days after the incident. He had been properly familiarised with all the decisions taken during the investigation, had lodged various requests during the investigation which had been taken into account and decided upon with proper reasoning and had participated in interviews of witnesses and posed questions. Lastly, the investigation had been conducted firstly by the Yerevan prosecutor\u2019s office and then the SIS, both of which had been separate bodies from the Armenian police with no institutional or hierarchical connection. Moreover, an independent forensic medical examination had been carried out by German and Danish experts.",

The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of an individual in custody is particularly stringent where that individual dies. In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see, among other authorities, Salman v.

The obligation to conduct an effective investigation is an obligation not of result but of means: the authorities must take the reasonable measures available to them to secure evidence concerning the incident at issue, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death.

Not only was that version of events based entirely on the statements of Police Officers G.T. and A.M., who appear to have been involved in the events of that day and who could not be considered impartial witnesses, but it was not supported by any evidence either. Thus, there is no proof whatsoever that Levon Gulyan was summoned to the PDCI for a confrontation with another witness, M.G., which he then allegedly tried to avoid by escaping. Moreover, such a motive for his alleged escape appears to have been provided for the first time at a rather advanced stage of the investigation (see paragraph 37 above). The investigating authority failed to clarify as to why Levon Gulyan, who had been involved in the case only as a witness, had been taken to the PDCI by police officers as opposed to being summoned as required by law (see paragraph 70 above) or why he had been taken to the PDCI in the first place, in violation of the law, given that the investigation into S.V.\u2019s murder had been conducted by another authority, namely the prosecutor\u2019s office (see paragraph 71 above). Furthermore, there is no evidence that Levon Gulyan was questioned at the PDCI before the incident and the nature of the so called \u201coperative talk\u201d remains unclear and unexplained.",

Firstly, the investigating authority failed to clarify to whom the palm print and the fingerprint found on the window had belonged and limited itself to examining the fingerprints of Officers G.T. and A.M. and the cleaning lady (see paragraphs 30 and 32 above), whereas it could not be ruled out that other employees of the PDCI had also been involved in the events of that day. Secondly, no sufficient measures were taken to clarify the origin of the natural and chemical fibres found on Levon Gulyan\u2019s clothes and under his fingernails (see paragraph 31 above). Thirdly, no investigation was carried out to clarify the origin of the injuries recorded by the medical examiner which had been sustained by Levon Gulyan while still alive and whether they could have resulted from any ill-treatment (see paragraph 20 above). Fourthly, the investigative experiment, which was supposed to clarify the mechanics of Levon Gulyan\u2019s fall, was not carried out because of the absence of a suitable dummy (see paragraph 34 above). Fifthly, no attempt was made to explain why Levon Gulyan\u2019s shoelaces had been found in his pocket. As already indicated above, these and a number of other shortcomings of the investigation were confirmed by the domestic courts. Even assuming that it had been possible to remedy the shortcomings in question following the resumption of the investigation, there was nothing to suggest that any serious attempts were made or meaningful measures were taken in that connection after the courts ordered a reopening of the investigation (see paragraphs 43-48 above). Moreover, not only was the above-mentioned investigative experiment never carried out despite the repeated instructions of the domestic courts but its effectiveness and necessity were questioned by the investigating authority despite having been emphasised by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 54, 57, 60 and 67 above).",
