The court supported its reasoning by referring to the findings of the RODK and other social and psychological studies. In particular, the court highlighted that the RODK report had stated that A wished to remain in Poland. The RODK had also stated that M.K. was closer to A and more attentive to her particular needs than the applicant. It was found that although the applicant was also an important person in A\u2019s life, the child saw her actions as going against her own wishes and placing her in uncomfortable situations.",

Secondly, the court explained that the purpose of a ruling under the Hague Convention was the prompt return of a child to the country of his or her habitual residence. A decision to return a child or a decision to refuse such a return under Articles 12, 13 and 20 of the Hague Convention could not be understood as containing a ruling on matters of custody or parental responsibility. The reasons for a decision not to return a child under Article 13 (b) were factual in nature and could not create a new custodial right. That had also been set out in Article 10 of the Hague Convention. Thirdly, the exception allowing for a refusal to enforce a judgment provided for in Article 23 (e) of the Brussels II bis Regulation required the existence of a later and contradictory ruling relating to parental responsibility. The decision of 18 December 2009 issued under Article\u00a013 (b) of the Hague Convention could not be considered as such a ruling.",

The report also stated that firm arrangements should be put in place by the court for the time that A was to spend in her mother\u2019s care and for the father\u2019s access during those times since, if there was room for parental discretion, the time allocated was likely to be reduced.

However, in the present case it is not merely the excessive length of civil proceedings which is at issue, but the question of whether in the circumstances of the case seen as a whole, the State can be said to have complied with its positive obligations under Article 8 (see Kijowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a033829/07, \u00a7\u00a044, 5\u00a0April 2011 and, as regards Article 2 of the Convention, Mojsiejew v.\u00a0Poland, no. 11818/02, \u00a7\u00a042, 24 March 2009). The Court reiterates that in cases of this kind the adequacy of measures taken by the authorities is also to be judged by the swiftness of their implementation; they require urgent handling as the passage of time and change of circumstances can have irreparable consequences for relations between the children and the parent who does not live with them (see Ignaccolo-Zenide v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a031679/96, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2000-I).",

Her allegations under Article 8 of the Convention are directed against all those proceedings and concern not only their length but also the way the Polish authorities handled the matter by, for instance, refusing to enforce the Irish court orders and ruling on custody matters independently of the Irish authorities (see paragraphs 20, 23, 39, and 52 above).",

The Court is mindful of the fact that contact and residence disputes are by their very nature extremely sensitive for all the parties concerned, and it is not necessarily an easy task for the domestic authorities to ensure enforcement of a court order where one or both parents\u2019 behaviour is far from constructive (see Krasicki v. Poland, no. 17254/11, \u00a7\u00a090, 15\u00a0April 2014).",

Without overlooking the fact that enforcement proceedings have to protect the rights of all those involved, with the interests of the child being of paramount importance, the Court notes that it is in the nature of such proceedings that a lapse of time risks compromising the position of the nonresident parent irretrievably (see M.A., cited above, \u00a7 136). Moreover, as long as the return decision remains in force, the presumption stands that return is also in the interests of the child (see X v. Latvia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09697).",
