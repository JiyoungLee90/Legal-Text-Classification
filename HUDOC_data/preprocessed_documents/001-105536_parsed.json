At the same time, the provisions of Sections 2 and 3 of the VAT Act indicated that the applicant\u2019s operations were subject to VAT. The court therefore concluded that the VAT Act did not make any exemptions for private entrepreneurs covered by the simplified taxation regime. Moreover, having regard to paragraph 1 of the Presidential Decree, which laid down the criteria for registering under a simplified system of taxation, the court found that that system provided VAT exemption with respect to sales operations only and did not cover import operations.",

The general system of taxation was regulated by the Law \u201cOn the System of Taxation\u201d of 25 June 1991 and by the laws dealing with particular taxes and duties. The simplified system of taxation was regulated by the Presidential Decree and the Small Business Act.

As regards the inflation losses, the Court reiterates that the adequacy of compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value (see, for example, Wasserman v.  (no. 2), no. 21071/05, \u00a7\u00a071, 10 April 2008). The Court notes that the applicant presented a detailed calculation of inflation losses based on the official tables, and that the Government submitted no objections to the applicant\u2019s claim or the method of calculation. The Court finds these calculations reasonable (see Skaloukhov and Others v. , nos. 8107/06, 8473/06, 8475/06, 15941/06 and 32116/06, \u00a7 37, 19 November 2009).
