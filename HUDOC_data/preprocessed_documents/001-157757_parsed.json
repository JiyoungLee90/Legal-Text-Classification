The applicant company did not attempt to bring such proceedings following the prosecutor\u2019s refusal of its request for return of the impounded property. The Court finds that this omission is of no consequence in the circumstances of the case, given that the applicant company\u2019s complaint before the Court was about the lorry\u2019s forfeiture which had been imposed with a final act at the end of the criminal proceedings against its driver. The legal possibility referred to by the Government might have only achieved the temporary release of the seized lorry to the applicant company, while the criminal proceedings were pending, but would not have affected the result of the criminal proceedings against the driver about which the applicant company complains. Those proceedings ended with a court-approved plea bargain agreement under the terms of which the lorry was forfeited with reference to the applicable criminal-law provision, Article 242 \u00a7 8 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, an appeal against the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to release the property while the proceedings were pending cannot be considered an effective remedy in this case.",

Those proceedings were unsuccessful as the driver had no assets at the time. In any event, the Court notes that even in situations where the State confiscates the tools or proceeds of a crime, it can only deprive someone of their property in accordance with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, which include requisite procedural guarantees (see AGOSI v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, \u00a7 55 and \u00a7 62, Series A no. 108, where the Court held that the applicable domestic procedures had to ensure either that reasonable account was taken of the behaviour of the applicant company or to afford it a reasonable opportunity to put its case; see also Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no. 41087/98, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2001VII, and Grayson and Barnham v. the United Kingdom, nos. 19955/05 and 15085/06, \u00a7\u00a045, 23 September 2008). In the present case the State was at the origin of the confiscation and domestic law and practice did not provide for any procedure through which the applicant company could have its property rights defended. Consequently, the Court finds that the State cannot relieve itself of its responsibility under the Convention to provide for such a procedure by asking the person who was not tried for the criminal offence leading to the confiscation to seek recovery of their property from a third party.",

The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that States are entitled to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to enforce laws to secure, among other things, the payment of penalties. The Court has repeatedly held that the second and third rules must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among many authorities, AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, \u00a7\u00a048, Series A no. 108; Air Canada v. the United Kingdom, 5 May 1995, \u00a7\u00a030, Series A no. 316A; Bowler International Unit v.

Where possessions which have been used unlawfully are confiscated, such a balance depends on many factors, which include the property owner\u2019s behaviour (see Yildirim v. Italy (dec.), no. 38602/02, 10 April 2003). In such cases the national authorities are called upon to consider the property owner\u2019s degree of fault or care, or at least the relationship between his or her conduct and the offence (see Yildirim, cited above). In addition, although Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 contains no explicit procedural requirement, it has been construed to necessitate that persons affected by a measure interfering with their possessions be afforded a reasonable opportunity to put their case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging those measures, pleading, as the case might be, illegality or arbitrary and unreasonable conduct (see Yildirim, cited above; see also AGOSI, cited above, pp. 18-19, \u00a7\u00a7 54-55, and pp. 20-21, \u00a7\u00a7 58-60, and Air\u00a0Canada, cited above, p. 18, \u00a7 46; see also, mutatis mutandis, Arcuri and\u00a0Others v.

France, no. 1946/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04445, 23 July 2009; Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, \u00a7 45, ECHR\u00a02002IV; Denisova and Moiseyeva v. Russia, no. 16903/03, \u00a7 59, 1\u00a0April 2010). The requisite balance will not be found if the person concerned has had to bear an individual and excessive burden (see Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v.

Nor did they examine the conduct of the confiscated lorry\u2019s owner or the relationship between the conduct of the latter and the offence. There is no evidence before this Court suggesting that the owner could or should have known of an offence being committed and the owner was clearly not given an opportunity to put its case. Indeed, a possibility for such an examination was not provided for in domestic law, yet it was necessary under the Convention so that the authorities could assess the proportionality of the confiscation (see paragraph 38 above). Consequently, the absence of such an analysis by virtue of the applicable law did not allow to strike a \u201cfair balance\u201d between the different interests involved.",

Since the applicant company was not a victim of the offence, but a third party affected by the criminal proceedings against the driver, there was no basis for it to intervene in those proceedings. The Court considers that forfeiture would only have complied with the Convention requirements if it were carried out in accordance with a procedure offering appropriate safeguards against arbitrariness (compare and contrast the present case with Phillips, cited above, \u00a7 43, where the Court found that the confiscation order procedure was compatible with the Convention requirements of \u201cfair trial\u201d and \u201cpeaceful enjoyment of possessions\u201d as it was decided by a court in judicial proceedings which included a public hearing, advance disclosure of the prosecution\u2019s case and an opportunity for the applicant to adduce documentary and oral evidence; contrast it also with AGOSI, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062, where the Court held that the British system ensured that reasonable account was taken of the behaviour of the applicant company and afforded it a reasonable opportunity to put its case). The Court refers in this connection also to its conclusion in Hentrich, cited above, \u00a7 49, where it found that the applicant \u201cbore an individual and excessive burden which could have been rendered legitimate only if she had had the possibility \u2013 which was refused to her \u2013 of effectively challenging the measure taken against her ... and that the fair balance which should be struck between the protection of the right of property and the requirements of the general interest was therefore upset\u201d. As pointed out above, in the present case there was no procedure available domestically to the applicant company to put its case before the relevant authorities.",
