The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking account of both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a025551/05, ECHR 2010). Thus, the absence of any such disadvantage can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant (see Adrian Mihai Ionescu v.\u00a0Romania (dec.) no. 36659/04, \u00a7 34, 1 June 2010; Rinck v. France (dec.), no.\u00a018774/09, 19 October 2010; and Kiousi v. Greece (dec.), no. 52036/09, 20\u00a0September 2011). Moreover, a violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage without affecting pecuniary interests (see Korolev (dec.), cited above).",
