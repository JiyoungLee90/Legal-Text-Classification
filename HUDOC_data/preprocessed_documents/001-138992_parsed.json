In its reasoning, noting that the Australian courts had established that the applicant and T. exercised joint parental responsibility, the court held, firstly, that the Latvian courts could neither reverse that decision, nor interpret and apply the Australian law. It further held that, in application of Articles\u00a01 and 14 of the Hague Convention, the Latvian courts did not have jurisdiction to rule on T.\u2019s parental responsibility for the child, but only on the child\u2019s departure from Australia and her possible return. It considered that the child\u2019s removal had been wrongful and had been carried out without T.\u2019s consent. As to the application of Article 13 of the Hague Convention, it held, in the light of photographs and copies of e-mails between the applicant and T.\u2019s relatives, that he had cared for the child prior to her departure for Latvia. While noting that witness statements referred to arguments between the parties and to the fact that T. had behaved irascibly towards the applicant and the child, it held that this did not enable it to conclude that T. had not taken care of the child.

It appears from this report that, in order to discourage the possibility for the abducting parent to have his or her action recognised as lawful in the State to which the child has been taken, the Convention enshrines, in addition to its preventive aspect, the restoration of the status quo, by an order for immediate return of the child, which would make it possible to restore the situation that had been unilaterally and wrongfully changed. Compliance with custody rights is almost entirely absent from the scope of this Convention, as this matter is to be discussed before the relevant courts in the State of the child\u2019s habitual residence prior to removal. The philosophy of the Hague Convention is to fight against the multiplication of international abductions, based always on a wish to protect children by acting as interpreter of their real interests. Accordingly, the objective of prevention and immediate return corresponds to a specific conception of \u201cthe child\u2019s best interests\u201d. However, as the child\u2019s removal may be justified for objective reasons which have to do either with his or her person, or with the environment with which he or she is most closely connected, the Convention allows for certain exceptions to the general obligations on the States to ensure an immediate return (\u00a7 25). Since the return of the child is the basic principle of the Convention, the exceptions to the general duty to secure it form an important element in understanding the exact extent of this duty, and it is possible to distinguish exceptions which derive their justification from three different principles (\u00a7 27). Firstly, the authorities of the requested State are not bound to order the return of the child if the person requesting the return was not actually exercising custody rights or where his or her behaviour shows acceptance of the new situation (\u00a7 28). Secondly, the first paragraph, (b), and second paragraph of Article\u00a013 contain exceptions which clearly derive from a consideration of the interests of the child, to which the Convention gives a definite content. Thus, the interest of the child in not being removed from his or her habitual residence without sufficient guarantees of stability in the new environment gives way before the primary interest of any person in not being exposed to physical or psychological danger or being placed in an intolerable situation (\u00a7 29). Lastly, there is no obligation to return a child when, in terms of Article 20, his or her return \u201cwould not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms\u201d (\u00a7 31). The explanatory report, which sets out those exceptions, also emphasises the margin of appreciation inherent in the judicial function.",

Although primarily intended for the new Contracting States and without binding effect, especially in respect of the judicial authorities, this document seeks to facilitate the Convention\u2019s implementation by proposing numerous recommendations and clarifications. The Guide repeatedly emphasises the importance of the Explanatory Report to the 1980 Convention, known as the P\u00e9rez-Vera Report, in helping to interpret coherently and understand the 1980 Convention (see, for example, points 3.3.2 \u201cImplications of the transformation approach\u201d and 8.1 \u201cExplanatory Report on the Convention: the P\u00e9rez-Vera Report\u201d). In particular, it emphasises that the judicial and administrative authorities are under an obligation, inter alia, to process return applications expeditiously, including on appeal (point 1.5 \u201cExpeditious procedures\u201d). Expeditious procedures should be viewed as procedures which are both fast and efficient: prompt decision-making under the Convention serves the best interests of children (point 6.4 \u201cCase management\u201d). The Guide to Good Practice specifies that delays in enforcement of return orders, or their non-enforcement, in certain Contracting States are matters of serious concern, and recommends that States Parties ensure that there are simple and effective mechanisms to enforce orders for the return of children within their domestic systems, noting that the return must actually be effected and not just ordered (point\u00a06.7 \u201cEnforcement\u201d).",

As those States who were party to both the Convention and the Hague Convention were required to comply with their obligations in respect of both of these texts, they required consistent interpretation and application which reconciled them, it being noted that the Brussels II bis Regulation was even stricter than the Hague Convention.

It is the parent who opposes the return who must, in the first place, adduce sufficient evidence to this effect. In the instant case, it was therefore for the applicant to provide sufficient evidence to substantiate her allegations, which, moreover, had to concern the existence of a risk specifically described as \u201cgrave\u201d by Article 13, first paragraph, (b). Furthermore, the Court notes that while the latter provision is not restrictive as to the exact nature of the \u201cgrave risk\u201d \u2013 which could entail not only \u201cphysical or psychological harm\u201d but also \u201can intolerable situation\u201d \u2013 it cannot be read, in the light of Article 8 of the Convention, as including all of the inconveniences necessarily linked to the experience of return: the exception provided for in Article 13, first paragraph, (b) concerns only the situations which go beyond what a child might reasonably bear. The applicant fulfilled her obligation by submitting a psychologist\u2019s certificate concluding that there existed a risk of trauma for the child in the event of immediate separation from her mother. Furthermore, she had also submitted that T. had criminal convictions and referred to instances of ill-treatment by him. It was therefore for the Latvian courts to carry out meaningful checks, enabling them to either confirm or exclude the existence of a \u201cgrave risk\u201d (see B. v. Belgium, no. 4320/11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-72, 10 July 2012).",

The non-adversarial nature of the psychological report did not suffice to absolve the courts from their obligation to examine it effectively, especially as the Regional Court\u2019s judicial powers would have enabled it to submit the document for cross-examination by the parties, or even to order a second expert report of its own motion, as permitted by Latvian law (see paragraph 45 above). The issue of whether it was possible for the mother to follow her daughter to Australia and to maintain contact with her should also have been dealt with.

These positive obligations must be interpreted in the light of the Hague Convention, all the more so where the respondent State is also a party to that instrument. Thus, the Court has committed itself to the Hague Convention\u2019s philosophy of restoring the child\u2019s situation as it existed before the abduction took place. Accordingly, the court in the host country must order the child\u2019s return to his or her country of habitual residence, except when one of the grounds for refusal of return provided for in Articles 13 and 20 of the Hague Convention exists, whilst the court in the country of habitual residence has sole competence in deciding on the merits of the custody dispute. Although return proceedings are urgent and return orders are to be rapidly enforced, the granting of return orders in international child-abduction cases requires a detailed or in-depth assessment of the entire family situation by the court in the host country in the specific context of the return application. When the decision-making process of the court in the host country or the resulting assessment is deficient, the granting of a return order under the Hague Convention may violate the Convention, since the interference with the child\u2019s right to family life with the abducting parent may not be necessary in a democratic society.",

Only those issues directly related to the child\u2019s abduction raised by the return application may be addressed by the court in the host country, and then only in so far as they relate to the urgent and provisional decision on the child\u2019s immediate future. This was and remains the Neulinger and Shuruk test. No less, no more. The detailed examination by the court in the host country does not imply any change of jurisdiction over parental responsibility, which remains in the State of the child\u2019s habitual residence.

Whenever a child under the age of 16 is unlawfully removed from his or her country of habitual residence by one of the parents, the Hague mechanism purports to restore, as soon as possible, the status quo prior to the removal. Three objective conditions are required to establish the unlawfulness of the removal: (1) the existence of custodial rights in respect of the left-behind parent immediately prior to the removal; (2) the effective exercise of these rights prior to the removal; and (3) the determination of the child\u2019s habitual residence at the time of removal. No additional subjective element, such as the mens rea of the abducting parent, is required. In these circumstances, the child\u2019s return to the country of habitual residence is to be ordered by the court in the host country. The return application may be rejected if one of the three conditions referred to above for application of the Hague Convention is not met. The application may also be rejected if the left-behind parent consented to removal or subsequently acquiesces to the removal, or if certain circumstances related to the child\u2019s welfare exist, namely if (1) there is a grave risk that the child\u2019s return would expose him or her to physical or psychological danger or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation; (2) a child who has attained a certain degree of maturity objects; (3) the child has settled in the host country and a year has elapsed between the removal and the commencement of the judicial return proceedings; or (4) the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of the child\u2019s human rights would not permit it.",

For instance, an unmarried parent who in fact takes care of the child may nonetheless be denied custodial rights. The evaluation of legal and factual issues, such as rights of custody and habitual residence or allegations of grave risk of harm, is a matter for the court or other competent authority deciding upon the return application. Other than as provided for by Article 30 of the Hague Convention, each Contracting Party to the Hague Convention determines its own rules of evidence in return proceedings. The burden of proof in the case in chief for return is on the left-behind parent and in respect of the defences to return it is on the abducting parent; in some countries, however, different burdens of proof are required depending upon the defence proffered. Although the evidence admitted in return proceedings is not bound by strict criteria, the taking and admission of evidence should be governed by the necessity for speed and the importance of limiting the enquiry to the matters in dispute which are directly relevant to the issue of return.",

Under the Convention, the abduction of a child triggers the application of a rebuttable presumption that it is in the best interests of the child to be returned as soon as possible to the country of habitual residence. That presumption must be applied unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that the human rights of the child, including his or her Article 8 rights, would be endangered in the event of return.

Reality has proved this risk to be very real. The bitter consequence of this institutional weakness is clear to see: there is little room for progress where such wide discrepancies occur in the functioning of the international mechanism and national authorities are free to give foreign precedent little weight, or no weight at all, for the purpose of interpreting the Hague Convention. In the absence of any meaningful supranational review of the way in which the Contracting States implement, interpret and apply the Hague Convention, courts of Contracting States do as they please, sometimes ostensibly and one-sidedly ruling in favour of the national party. This inherent weakness in the Hague mechanism is magnified by the ambiguous and undefined legal terminology utilised in the Hague Convention and the lack of procedural rules on the conduct of judicial return proceedings, such as on evidentiary hearing, discovery, burden of proof, appeals, stay of orders pending appeals and interim measures. The damaging effect of differing, contradictory and confusing national case-law is further amplified by the fact that the enforcement stage of the return order is not regulated at all in the Hague Convention, and more specifically no legal basis is provided for stipulations, conditions or undertakings imposed on the parties or a system of judicial cooperation for the implementation of \u201cmirror orders\u201d.",
