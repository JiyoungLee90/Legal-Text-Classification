Accordingly, it is incorrect to speak of a refusal to accept service if the document was never transmitted to the competent authority. In this connection the Supreme Court stressed that, conversely, it would not be sufficient, in order to institute legal proceedings, for an action against the Republic of Austria to be received by the Foreign Ministry if, for whatever reason, it was not forwarded to the Attorney-General\u2019s Office as the competent authority representing the State in such matters.

As the appellate court explained in detail in its decision 8\u00a0Ra 23/00t, cited above, service of process on a foreign State is (also) based on section 11(2) of the Service Act. Hence, for the purpose of performing it, recourse is to be had in any event to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the basis of this provision, which takes precedence, service via any means other than the diplomatic channels to which it refers \u2013 for instance, on a court-appointed representative \u2013 is ruled out. In view of the principle whereby a remedy against a refusal to comply with a request for legal assistance, which flows from the sovereign power of the foreign State, can be sought only through diplomatic channels (see SZ 36/26, EvBl 1963/210; for a critical perspective, see Schreuer, Die Durchsetzung zivilrechtlicher Anspr\u00fcche gegen ausl\u00e4ndische Staaten, \u00d6JZ 1991, 41 et seq. [49]), the impugned decision lacks any legal basis.\u201d",

In the absence of such agreement the generally recognised rules of international law (Article 9 of the Federal Constitution), together with section IX of the Introductory Act to the Austrian Jurisdictional Statute (EGJN) and the principles developed in this connection by the case-law and by legal commentators, must apply. On that basis it is unanimously agreed that foreign States enjoy immunity in the exercise of their sovereign powers and are to that extent exempt from the jurisdiction of the domestic courts (see, among other authorities, SZ 23/143; Herndl, JBl 1962, 15; JBl 1962, 43; He\u00df, JBl 1989, 285; ZfRV 1990, 300 [Seidl-Hohenveldern]; Schreuer, \u00d6JZ 1991, 41; Fischer, NZ 1991, 154; DRdA 1991/53 [Simotta]; Neuhold/Hummer/Schreuer, \u00d6sterreichisches Handbuch des V\u00f6lkerrechts Bd 1\u00b3 para. 834, 837; Seidl-Hohenveldern, V\u00f6lkerrecht 9\u00a0paras. 1462 et seq.; Matscher, loc. cit, Art IX EGJN para. 2, 115 et seq., 196 et seq.; Mayr in Rechberger, ZPO\u00b2 Art IX EGJN para. 3 et seq.). The service of process abroad, as a sovereign act, amounts \u2013 in the absence of an agreement between the States concerned governing the relevant procedure \u2013 to interference with the sovereign rights of the foreign State in question. For that reason it is a requirement in such cases to have recourse to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which maintains close contact with the milieu concerned and is competent to take account of the relevant international-law considerations (RV 162 BlgNR XV.GP 10), as the appellant correctly points out. However, contrary to her assertion, exclusive recourse to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not merely recommended, but is required by statute (the mandatory \u201cshall\u201d in section 32(3) of the Jurisdictional Statute and section\u00a011(2) of the Service Act). The service of documents by any other means would be in breach of the law (Walter/Mayer, op. cit., section 11 Service Act, footnote\u00a015).",

The legislature has not taken any action to date. It should further be observed that the strict approach to diplomatic immunity can be traced back to the Jurisdictional Statute, according to which the violation of immunity renders the proceedings in question null and void, in a manner which cannot be remedied even by the parties (except by a waiver of immunity) (\u00a7 42 JN; Ballon, op. cit., \u00a7 42 JN para. 3, 14 et seq.; Mayr, op. cit., \u00a7 42 JN para. 2, 7).",

It is not disputed that, under American Federal law, the United States is represented by the Department of Justice in matters which are to be regarded as acta iure gestionis (compare 9 ObA 244/90 = SZ 63/206 with further references concerning the employment contract between the claimant and the defendant).

According to these principles (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, ECHR 2007II, \u00a7 62), two conditions must be fulfilled in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on an applicant\u2019s status as civil servant in excluding him or her from the protection embodied in Article 6. Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest.",
