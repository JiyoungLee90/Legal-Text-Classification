She could not, therefore, claim that additional amount from the defendant herself in the future as her claim had passed to the Insurance Institution in this respect. Moreover, having regard to the fact that the applicant had already in the past received social security benefits, the court found that the applicant had failed to provide sufficient evidence that she still had a claim herself for the period of time preceding 1\u00a0June 2001, despite the court's repeated invitations to do so.
