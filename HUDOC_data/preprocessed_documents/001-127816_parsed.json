However, the facts outlined in the statement of charges concerned acts allegedly committed by several other persons, but not by the applicant. They stated that the applicant had been charged with an attempt to overthrow the State order of his home country and therefore his criminal prosecution was politically motivated. Finally, referring to the Court\u2019s extensive case-law on the matter and various reports by international observers, the defence stressed that the use of torture and ill-treatment against detainees in Uzbekistan was systematic and went unpunished by the law-enforcement and security authorities, and that the applicant ran an individualised risk of ill-treatment in the event of extradition.",

After the defeat of the Andijan uprising the importing of Islamic literature had been proscribed. The Uzbekistan leadership had an expressed intention to fine and put in jail individuals who worshipped outside the areas designated for that purpose. The Uzbek authorities considered that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and Akromiya, a branch of Hizb-ut-Tahrir, had actively participated in the Andijan events of 2005, and criminal proceedings against 121\u00a0persons, including ten members of Akromiya, were underway. Turning to the applicant\u2019s case, the FMS noted that the applicant had failed to apply for asylum in due time after his arrival in Russia and had referred to his poor command in Russian to justify that failure. However, the migration authority noted that, first, the applicant had performed military service in Sakhalin, Russia, in 1990-1992, which would have been impossible without an adequate knowledge of Russian, and second, he had received a temporary resident permit for Russia in July 2009.

His allegations of persecution for attending a mosque were ill-founded, given that the majority of the population of the destination country freely practised Islam. In addition, the court noted that the destination country had signed various international human rights treaties concerning, in particular, the protection of refugees.

Having analysed the relevant provisions of the CCrP governing house arrest and detention, taken together, as well as the nature of the restrictions applied to an individual in the case of house arrest, the Constitutional Court found, in particular, that house arrest, like detention on remand, implied the compulsory isolation of an accused or a suspect from society, in a limited space, and the prevention of the person from working, moving freely and communicating with other persons. Thus, in view of the restrictions suffered, house arrest involved a direct restriction of a person\u2019s right to physical liberty and security.

They found it alarming that the applicant had not telephoned his lawyer after his release, as agreed, and suggested that his freedom of movement and communication must have been restricted. Furthermore, they pointed to several circumstances indicating that he had not travelled to Uzbekistan voluntarily: the plane tickets had been bought in Tashkent using the applicant\u2019s old passport; it would have been impossible for him to travel from Nizhniy Novgorod to Moscow, since at the time of the events he was on the wanted list, and therefore would have been stopped by the authorities if he had attempted to buy any kind of travel ticket from an airline or railway company. Furthermore, he had been released from detention without any money or winter clothes.

His release had been under the total control of the State agents, and the authorities had organised it in a deviation from the ordinary procedure and had deliberately prevented the lawyer\u2019s attendance on the day of the applicant\u2019s disappearance. Furthermore, as regards the events at Domodedovo Airport, it was clear that the applicant could not have crossed the State border freely and unaccompanied. He had been on the Interpol wanted list, and the search for him in Russia had not been discontinued; furthermore, he was a foreign national against whom criminal proceedings were pending in Russia. Any of these factors, taken alone, would prompt the authorities to arrest the applicant or at least to stop him for a further check in the normal course of events. Furthermore, they stated, with reference to the Registrar\u2019s letter of 25\u00a0January 2012 and the Government\u2019s reply thereto, that all competent authorities, including the border control services, had been well aware of the risks faced by the applicant, and his crossing the Russian border should have alerted the competent authorities to stop the applicant for a further check. They concluded that either the authorities had knowingly let the applicant through the border without applying the required formalities, or he had been taken on board a plane to Uzbekistan without complying with the regular formalities.",

The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case. Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Article\u00a03 of the Convention, the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place (see, with further references, El Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0155).",

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article\u00a019 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, with further references, Nachova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], nos.\u00a043577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0147, ECHR 2005VII; Iskandarov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a017185/05, \u00a7\u00a0107, 23\u00a0September 2010; and El Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0151).",

In the absence of any further clarifications, the Court finds no reason to doubt that information and considers it established that on the date of the applicant\u2019s release from custody and journey to Uzbekistan on 2\u00a0November 2012 his name was still on the cross-border wanted list, and the search for him in Russia on the basis of the valid arrest warrant of the Uzbek authorities had not been discontinued.",

However, this information was in contradiction with the findings made at a later stage in the domestic proceedings \u2013 and not disputed by the Government at that point \u2013 that the plane ticket for the applicant had been issued in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on the basis of the form no.\u00a01 for Uzbek nationals originating from the Zhalokudukskiy District Department of the Interior of the Andijan Region (see paragraph\u00a095 above). The Government did not address the apparent contradiction between the two versions. In any event, if the second one is accepted, and even bearing in mind that a copy of the impugned form no.\u00a01 was available both to the Russian authorities and the representatives (see paragraph\u00a017 above), the Government have failed to explain how the applicant, a detainee in Russia until the early morning of 2\u00a0November 2012, could possibly have bought the tickets in Tashkent using that form, an internal questionnaire for the passport exchange and, moreover, done so on the basis of his old passport, which had expired in 2007 and had been returned by him to the Uzbek authorities in exchange for the current one (see paragraph\u00a09 above). Similarly, if the Government\u2019s initial submission is accepted, it remains unclear how the applicant could have bought tickets for an international flight immediately after his release on the basis of his current passport while having no money (see paragraphs\u00a075 and 85 above) and without being identified by the police at the time of the purchase of the tickets (see paragraph\u00a0166 above). Taking the foregoing into account, the Court is inclined to accept the representatives\u2019 submissions that the plane tickets were not bought by the applicant. That circumstance, taken alone, already casts doubt on the consistency of the Government\u2019s account of the events.",

Instead, the Government confined themselves to stating that the applicant\u2019s name was not in the \u201cSearchHighway\u201d database. The Court notes with concern that the Government failed to submit any document in support of their statement. Moreover, that submission proves all the more surprising given that, as submitted by the Government in one of the earlier cases before the Court (see paragraph\u00a0147 above), the \u201cSearch-Highway\u201d system was conceived specifically to facilitate discovery of those suspected of criminal offences whose names were on the wanted persons\u2019 list. In those circumstances, an admission that the applicant\u2019s name for some reason was not present in the database at the time of the events \u2013 a hypothesis favourable to the Government \u2013 cannot but raise further suspicions as regards the circumstances of the incident of 2\u00a0November 2012. Furthermore, it appears that the question of how the applicant had travelled from Nizhniy Novgorod to Domodedovo Airport was not addressed by the investigators at the domestic level. Again, the Court attaches great importance to \u2013 and draws inferences from \u2013 the authorities\u2019 continued failure to clarify the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s journey to Moscow.",

The Court does not discern any reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Indeed, it cannot be disputed that any airport serving international flights is subject to heightened security measures, remaining under the permanent control of the respondent State\u2019s authorities and notably, the State border service (see Savriddin Dzhurayev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0201-02, with further references).

It is sufficient to mention that the first request for the footage of the airport\u2019s video surveillance cameras was made by the investigators on 29\u00a0December 2012, that is, manifestly outside the thirty-day storage timelimit (see paragraph\u00a0114 above), and that the airport officers on duty in a busy international airport made their submissions about the events of 2\u00a0November 2012 almost three months after the impugned incident (see paragraphs\u00a0120 and 121 above).

As a result, the applicant had been arrested and detained incommunicado in Uzbekistan and ran a particularly serious risk of illtreatment there. Furthermore, they argued, the authorities were responsible for the failure to conduct an effective investigation into the matter. The authorities in charge of the inquiry had failed to secure valuable evidence which would have been capable of shedding light on the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s disappearance (for example, the video footage of the surveillance cameras at the remand facility and Domodedovo airport). The investigators had omitted to follow such obvious lines of inquiry as, for instance, establishing whether the applicant had been met by anyone on his release from the detention facility; where the plane tickets to Tashkent had actually been bought; and how the applicant had got to Moscow on the date of his disappearance. The investigation had lacked transparency since the representatives had only been granted delayed and limited access to the material gathered in the inquiry.

Among other things, he claimed that the Uzbek law-enforcement authorities systematically resorted to the use of torture and ill-treatment against detainees, and stressed that persons accused of membership of proscribed religious organisations that were considered extremist, as well as those suspected of crimes against State security, ran an increased risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of Article\u00a03.

The Court observes that, in any event, the main thrust of the applicant\u2019s grievance was his persecution by the Uzbek authorities in connection with charges of serious criminal offences punishable by long prison terms, and a risk of illtreatment in custody. The Court reiterates in this connection that, whilst a person\u2019s failure to seek asylum immediately after arrival in another country may be relevant for the assessment of the credibility of his or her allegations, it is not possible to weigh the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons put forward for the expulsion (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 30471/08, \u00a7\u00a091, 22\u00a0September 2009).

The above constituted the basis for the extradition request in respect of the applicant and the arrest warrant issued in respect of him. It shows that his situation is similar to that of those Muslims who, because they practised their religion outside official institutions and guidelines, were charged with religious extremism or membership of banned religious organisations and, on this account, as noted in the reports and the Court\u2019s judgments cited above, were at an increased risk of ill-treatment (see and Abdulkhakov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0145). The Court also takes into account that the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees found that the applicant\u2019s fear of being persecuted and ill-treated if extradited to Uzbekistan was well-founded and granted him protection under its mandate (see paragraph\u00a035 above).",

For instance, the applicant\u2019s early release from detention \u2013 an issue entirely within the authorities\u2019 competence \u2013 has remained unexplained (see paragraph\u00a0171 above). At no point did the investigators address the circumstances of applicant\u2019s journey from Nizhniy Novgorod to Moscow. There is nothing in the case file to suggest that any request for the logs of, for instance, local transport companies was made (see paragraph\u00a0173 above). Similarly, the contradictory information on the purchase of the plane tickets for the applicant\u2019s flight to Tashkent has remained without any assessment (see paragraph\u00a0168 above). Further, the applicant\u2019s flight number was known to the authorities, and it would have been possible to obtain witness statements from the crew members on the flight by which the applicant left Moscow for Tashkent on the date of his disappearance. However, the need to interview the crew members was mentioned for the first time in the Government\u2019s submissions of 3\u00a0May 2013, that is, six months after the events. Further, even the exact date of the applicant\u2019s arrest in Uzbekistan remains unknown. These considerations lead the Court to conclude that the investigation has been ineffective in that it failed to promptly follow several obvious lines of inquiry to an extent which undermined its ability to establish the circumstances of the case, and that the authorities have thus failed to carry out a thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all relevant elements (see Tsechoyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a039358/05, \u00a7\u00a0153, 15\u00a0March 2011)",

Therefore, and in the absence of any comments by the parties on the matter, the Court accepts that the applicant\u2019s house arrest amounted to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article\u00a05 of the Convention (see Vachev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a042987/98, \u00a7\u00a062, ECHR 2004VIII (extracts); Nikolova v.\u00a0Bulgaria (no.\u00a02), no. 40896/98, \u00a7\u00a060, 30\u00a0September 2004; N.C. v.\u00a0Italy, no. 24952/94, \u00a7\u00a033, 11\u00a0January 2001; and B\u00e1rk\u00e1nyi v.

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to convince the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress directly in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been discharged, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Mooren v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a011364/03, \u00a7\u00a0118, 9\u00a0July 2009, with further references). The existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile is not a valid reason for failing to exhaust domestic remedies (see Sejdovic v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a056581/00, \u00a7\u00a045, ECHR 2006II, with further references).",

Article\u00a0108\u00a0\u00a7\u00a011 of the CCrP provides that a judge\u2019s decision on detention is amenable to appeal before a higher court within three days of its delivery date. The appeal against the house arrest order was to be examined by the regional court, a judicial body within the meaning of Article\u00a05 (see E. v.\u00a0Norway, 29\u00a0August 1990, \u00a7\u00a050, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0181 A). Article\u00a0378\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01, constituting a part of the CCrP chapter dealing with the cassation appeal procedure in force at the material time, clearly provided that the appeal court was competent not only to quash a judicial decision and remit the case for fresh examination to the first-instance court (as in the case of V., cited by the applicant) but also either to purely quash the judicial decision or amend it. In particular, the judicial decision could be quashed or amended in the event of a violation of the law of criminal procedure, which appears to be the crux of the applicant\u2019s complaint about his placement under house arrest. The appeal court was competent to verify the lawfulness, validity and fairness of the decision taken by the first-instance court and to examine evidence, including additional material submitted (see paragraph\u00a0141 above). Finally, Article\u00a0108\u00a0\u00a7\u00a011 of the CCrP, applicable to the case of house arrest, provided, in clear and unambiguous terms, that the second-instance court\u2019s decision to annul the preventive measure was to be executed immediately. It is not disputed that the suggested remedy was directly accessible to the applicant and was not dependent on the exercise of discretion by an intermediary.",

Thus, the Government have discharged the burden upon them of proving the availability to the applicant of a remedy capable of providing redress in respect of his complaint and offering reasonable prospects of success. On the contrary, the applicant did not explain why an ordinary appeal against the decision to place him under house arrest had to be considered obviously futile, nor did he point to any specific circumstances precluding him from making such an appeal.

In this connection, Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f) provides a different level of protection from Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c): all that is required under sub-paragraph\u00a0(f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d (see Saadi v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013229/03, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 2008). Turning to the present case, the Court notes that all the extensions of the applicant\u2019s detention were ordered by courts, including the extension until 14\u00a0November 2010 granted by the Nizhniy Novgorod Regional Court on 8\u00a0July 2010. The Court cannot overlook the fact that on 8\u00a0July 2010 the Kanavinskiy District court issued yet another decision authorising an extension of the applicant\u2019s detention for a month. The Court considers such an overlap between two domestic rulings regrettable. Nonetheless, both decisions clearly provided that the applicant was to be remanded in custody. In any event, there is nothing to suggest that the domestic courts, including the Regional Court on 8\u00a0July 2010, did not have competence to decide on the matter, or acted in bad faith, or that they neglected to apply the relevant legislation correctly. The extension orders contained specific time-limits, in compliance with Article\u00a0109 of the CCrP. The offences the applicant was charged with in Uzbekistan were regarded as \u201cparticularly serious\u201d under Russian law, on which basis his detention was extended to eighteen months, in accordance with Article\u00a0109\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the CCrP (see paragraph\u00a0136 above). The lawfulness of the detention was reviewed and confirmed by appellate courts on several occasions (as regards the scope of review of the extension order of 8\u00a0July 2010, that issue will be addressed under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 below).",

Indeed, the extradition proceedings were temporarily suspended pursuant to the request made by the Court under Rule\u00a039 of the Rules of Court and were, nevertheless, in progress (see, for a similar approach, Umirov, cited above, with further references). However, the implementation of an interim measure does not in itself have any bearing on whether the deprivation of liberty to which that individual may be subjected complies with Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01.

The Court reiterates that Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention entitles detained persons to institute proceedings for a review of compliance with the procedural and substantive conditions which are essential for the \u201clawfulness\u201d of their deprivation of liberty (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a03455/05, \u00a7\u00a0202, 19\u00a0February 2009, with further references).When the decision is made by a court at the close of judicial proceedings, the supervision required by Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 is incorporated in the decision (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v.\u00a0Belgium, 18\u00a0June 1971, \u00a7\u00a076, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a012).

In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the supervision required by Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 was incorporated in the judicial decision of 13\u00a0May 2011. Furthermore, during that period the applicant chose to apply to a prosecutor on 17\u00a0May 2011, that is, within a very short period \u2013 three days \u2013 of the initial house arrest order, requesting him to petition a domestic court to discontinue the house arrest (see paragraph\u00a064 above). That period cannot be said to be reasonable, especially given that the applicant could have raised exactly the same issue of formal lawfulness in respect of the house arrest \u2013 the argument advanced by him in his petition to the prosecutor \u2013 before the appeal court competent to deal with the matter, but failed to do so (see paragraphs\u00a0241-242 above). Instead, he decided to use a procedure which was not directly accessible to him but was clearly dependent on the discretion of a prosecutor, and, furthermore, he did not appeal against the first-instance court\u2019s decision of 7\u00a0July 2011 on the lawfulness of the refusal to deal with his request (see paragraph\u00a069 above). Taking into account these specific circumstances, notably the relatively short overall duration of the impugned preventive measure and the absence of a final decision concerning the house arrest in any of the sets of proceedings, the Court finds that it does not have sufficient material at its disposal to enable it to draw a conclusion regarding the absence of a procedure by which the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s house arrest in the present case could be reviewed.",

The review should, however, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the detention of a person to be \u201clawful\u201d according to Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01. The reviewing \u201ccourt\u201d must have the competence to \u201cdecide\u201d the \u201clawfulness\u201d of the detention and to order release if the detention is unlawful (see A. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 202). Although it is not always necessary that an Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 procedure be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article\u00a06, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the type of deprivation of liberty in question (see A. and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0203). Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention. Nevertheless, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to the detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Svipsta v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a066820/01, \u00a7\u00a0129, ECHR 2006III, with further references). Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 does not impose an obligation to address every argument contained in the detainee\u2019s submissions. The judge examining appeals against detention must take into account concrete facts invoked by the detainee and capable of putting in doubt the existence of the conditions essential for the \u201clawfulness\u201d, in the sense of the Convention, of the deprivation of liberty (see Nikolova v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 1999II).",

The Court observes at the outset that, as can be seen from the first-instance hearing record, the defence did not raise that argument on 2\u00a0November 2010, insisting rather on the need to change the preventive measure in respect of the applicant in the light of the alleged prospects of his case before the Court (see paragraph\u00a057 above), and they only advanced the impugned reasoning on appeal (see paragraph\u00a059 above). In any event, on 2\u00a0November 2010 the first instancecourt examined the arguments actually submitted by the applicant and rejected them by a reasoned decision. In particular, the Regional Court noted that the extradition proceedings had been suspended pursuant to the application of Rule\u00a039 (see paragraph\u00a058 above). The appeal court endorsed that reasoning, finding that the first-instance court had carried out a thorough examination of the case on the basis of the available material (see paragraph\u00a060 above).

It is not excluded that a system of automatic periodic review of the lawfulness of detention by a court may ensure compliance with the requirements of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 (see Megyeri v.\u00a0Germany, 12\u00a0May 1992, \u00a7\u00a022, Series A no.\u00a0237A).

The question of whether periods comply with the requirement must be determined in the light of the circumstances of each case (see Sanchez-Reisse v.\u00a0Switzerland, 21\u00a0October 1986, \u00a7\u00a055, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0107, and Oldham v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a036273/97, \u00a7\u00a031, ECHR\u00a02000-X). The Court must, in particular, examine whether any new relevant factors arisen in the interval between periodic reviews were assessed, without unreasonable delay, by a court having jurisdiction to decide whether or not the detention has become \u201cunlawful\u201d in the light of these new factors (see Abdulkhakov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0215). For instance, in two Russian cases the Court has found that intervals between periodic reviews of detention ranging from two to four months were compatible with the requirements of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 (see Soliyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a062400/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a057-62, 5\u00a0June 2012, and Khodzhamberdiyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a064809/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0108-14, 5\u00a0June 2012). In Abdulkhakov the Court has considered that the efficiency of the system of automatic periodic judicial review was undermined by the fact that a new relevant factor arisen in the interval between reviews and capable of affecting the lawfulness of his detention \u2013 that is, the fact that the extradition order in respect of the applicant had become final \u2013 was assessed by a reviewing court only three months later (see Abdulkhakov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0216-17).",

Throughout the entire period of detention authorised on 2\u00a0November 2010 the extradition proceedings were temporarily suspended pursuant to the application of the interim measure (see further, in so far as relevant, the Court\u2019s findings in paragraph\u00a0252 above).

The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument. While the measures taken to stay the extradition may be indicative of the Government\u2019s initial willingness to comply with the interim measures, they cannot, in the Court\u2019s view, relieve the State of its responsibility for subsequent events in the applicant\u2019s case. Nor can the Government legitimately pretend, as their argument may suggest, that the applicant\u2019s forcible return to Uzbekistan was not prevented by the interim measures which were formulated by the Court in the present case.",

The Court has already found the Russian authorities responsible for the failure to protect the applicant against his exposure to a real and immediate risk of torture and ill-treatment in Uzbekistan which made possible his forced repatriation (see paragraphs\u00a0218-22 above). This leads the Court to conclude that the responsibility for the breach of the interim measure also lies with the Russian authorities. Indeed, the Court cannot conceive of allowing the respondent State to circumvent an interim measure such as the one indicated in the present case by using another domestic procedure for the applicant\u2019s removal to the country of destination or, even more alarming, by allowing him to be arbitrarily removed to that country in an unlawful manner (see Savriddin Dzhurayev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0217).",

Against this background, the Court is struck by the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s absence from the Russian Federation did not adversely affect the proceedings before the Court. The fact that the Court has been able to examine a case does not prevent an issue from arising under Article\u00a034 (see Shamayev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0517). Moreover, it is not disputed that the applicant was unable, at the time of the parties\u2019 exchange of their additional observations pursuant to the recommunication of the case, to give his account of the incident of 2\u00a0November 2012. As a result, the gathering of evidence in respect of the circumstances of applicant\u2019s disappearance has proved more complex. It is also undisputed that he was unable to give instructions to the representatives in the proceedings before this Court after 2\u00a0November 2012. Therefore, the applicant has been hindered in the effective exercise of his right of individual application guaranteed by Article\u00a034 of the Convention (see Labsi v.\u00a0Slovakia, no. 33809/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0149-50, 15 May 2012).",
