As can be seen from the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure cited in the Domestic Law part, there is a limited number of situations in which the legal representation of the suspect is obligatory. One of the grounds for obligatory representation is the seriousness of the crime of which a person is suspected, and hence the possibility of life imprisonment as a punishment. In the present case the law-enforcement authorities, investigating the violent death of a person, initiated criminal proceedings for infliction of grievous bodily harm causing death rather than for murder. The former was a less serious crime and therefore did not require the obligatory legal representation of a suspect. Immediately after the confession was obtained, the crime was reclassified as, and the applicant was charged with, murder.",

It may be recalled that the applicant had a lawyer in the existing criminal proceedings, yet waived his right to be represented during his questioning for another offence. These circumstances give rise to strong suspicion as to the existence of an ulterior purpose in the initial classification of the offence. The fact that the applicant made confessions without a lawyer being present and retracted them immediately in the lawyer\u2019s presence demonstrates the vulnerability of his position and the real need for appropriate legal assistance, which he was effectively denied on 1 February 2001 owing to the way in which the police investigator exercised his discretionary power concerning the classification of the investigated crime.",

In their opinion, therefore, the circumstances of the present case should be assessed in terms of whether the State had complied with Article 46 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which imposed on the Contracting State an obligation to abide by the final judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, and such an assessment was the prerogative of the Committee of Ministers.",

Having accepted the Court\u2019s finding that basing the applicant\u2019s conviction for Kh.\u2019s murder on a confession extracted from him in violation of his defence rights had constituted a breach of his right to fair proceedings, the Supreme Court found that the confessions obtained from the applicant by the investigator in the absence of a lawyer could not be regarded as admissible evidence to confirm his guilt. As a result, the Supreme Court had excluded that piece of evidence from the body of evidence of the applicant\u2019s guilt in Kh.\u2019s murder which had been referred to by the domestic courts in the course of the original proceedings. In deciding not to order a retrial, the Supreme Court had found that the remaining body of evidence was sufficient to consider reasonable the findings of the domestic courts in the original proceedings that the applicant\u2019s guilt had been established. In this regard, the Government stressed that the Supreme Court had acted within its competence and in accordance with the domestic law, in particular Articles 396 and 398 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 34 above).",

They therefore insisted that the assessment of evidence in the present case had been performed in the course of the original proceedings, when the domestic courts had assessed the evidence by questioning witnesses, examining relevant documents and exhibits during the hearings, analysing the parties\u2019 objections to the proceedings to any particular piece of evidence, and by comparing one piece of evidence to another. It was the findings made as a result of this examination that constituted the subject-matter of the cassation proceedings at the domestic level and, subsequently, the proceedings before the Court.",

According to the Government, the applicant had no grounds for stating that a retrial could result in an alteration of the substance and the body of evidence that had remained after the proceedings before the Supreme Court. They also submitted that this Court\u2019s findings of a violation of the applicant\u2019s procedural rights during the evidence gathering at the original proceedings concerned some of the evidence but not all of it (Yaremenko v. , no. 32092/02, \u00a7\u00a086, 12\u00a0June 2008).

Russia, no.\u00a074266/01, \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 57, 8 January 2009). The Court also found Article\u00a06 applicable to supervisory review proceedings in a case against Armenia (Stepanyan v. Armenia, no. 45081/04, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 32, 27 October 2009).

He argued that the exclusion of a piece of evidence, especially key evidence like in his case, would affect the body of evidence as a whole and its separate pieces, and therefore it was impossible to assess the sufficiency of the remaining body of evidence without a fresh assessment from the viewpoint of their \u201crelevance\u201d, \u201cadmissibility\u201d, \u201ccredibility\u201d and \u201csufficiency\u201d. The applicant disagreed with the Government\u2019s submissions that the body of evidence consisted of separately assessed pieces and that their weight and value did not change after some of them were excluded. As an example, he referred to the Court\u2019s findings in the judgment of 12 June 2008 concerning the testimonies made by him and his co-accused, in which the Court noted that the domestic courts had taken the high degree of consistency between the testimonies of the applicant and his co-accused as undeniable proof of their veracity, and had made them the basis for his conviction for the 1998 crime (Yaremenko v. , no. 32092/02, \u00a7\u00a079, 12 June 2008). The applicant submitted, therefore, that his testimonies had been one of the main elements determining the veracity of the testimonies of his co-accused. Thus, the exclusion of his testimonies by the Supreme Court had directly affected the veracity or, as the Government put it, the credibility of the testimonies of his co-accused, since the national courts had found that those testimonies, given their mutual consistency, supported each other. However, the Supreme Court, having excluded the testimonies of the applicant and, thus, having undermined the veracity of the testimonies of his co-accused, referred to the latter as one of the reasons for its conclusion that the remaining evidence was sufficient to establish the applicant\u2019s guilt.",

In fact, the Supreme Court made a rather critical assessment of the Court\u2019s findings in the applicant\u2019s previous case (cited above in paragraph 27), by accepting only one of the Court\u2019s conclusions under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) (see paragraph 31 above) and disagreeing, either openly or not, with the rest of them (see paragraph\u00a032 above). The Court recalls that in its partial decision as to admissibility of the present case, the Court considered that the disagreement with the Court\u2019s conclusions as to lack of effectiveness of the investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment was rather an issue for supervision of the execution of judgments by the Committee of Ministers (see Yaremenko v.

Russia, no. 53203/99, \u00a7 56, 15 December 2005, with further references). The Court considers that the Supreme Court when excluding the confession made by the applicant in absence of his lawyer from the body of evidence following the Court\u2019s previous judgment and reassessing the remainder of evidence to conclude that the applicant\u2019s conviction could stand, undertook a re-examination of the applicant\u2019s case. The legal situation in which the applicant found himself is similar to that of the applicant in the case of Bochan (no. 2). The Court concluded therein that Article 6 applied given that the Supreme Court conducted a \u201creconsideration\u201d of the applicant\u2019s claim on new and fresh grounds linked to its interpretation of the Court\u2019s judgment, albeit deciding not to change the outcome of the case and, in particular, not to order a full rehearing of the case by a lower court (see Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], cited above, \u00a7 54). Thus, the proceedings at issue concerned the determination of the applicant\u2019s guilt of a criminal offence within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. Such a re-examination constitutes relevant new information in the context of a fresh application which the Court can deal with.

These conclusions concerned not only the initial questioning of the applicant in the absence of his lawyer in which he confessed to the 1998 crime, but his further similar confessions during the reconstruction of events and further questioning. The Court had established that after the removal of lawyer Kh., the applicant was represented by two other lawyers but their services were of a \u201cnotional nature\u201d. The Court also found that the degree of consistency between the testimonies of the applicant and his co-accused raised suspicions that their accounts had been carefully coordinated and that nevertheless the domestic courts made them the basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction for the 1998 crime, despite the fact that they had been retracted and had not been supported by other evidence (see Yaremenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 79, 88 and 90; also cited above in paragraph 27).",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, this latter issue in itself would require a thorough examination of the evidence in the present case in a full retrial instead of the very limited review as carried out by the Supreme Court. The Court finds that the new decision rendered in the applicant\u2019s case was again based to a decisive extent on the same pieces of evidence which had been obtained in violation of the applicant\u2019s procedural rights and there had been serious allegations, never properly dispelled by the authorities, that all self-incriminatory statements had been extracted under duress and had constituted \u201cthe fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7 168, ECHR 2010). In particular, both the applicant and his co-defendant had denied any involvement in the 1998 crime and had complained that they had been forced to incriminate themselves. The exclusion of the applicant\u2019s initial confessions significantly undermined the Supreme Court\u2019s argument that his confessions and those of his co-defendant were consistent and supported each other. Moreover, they both retracted all their confessions during the trial. The remaining considerations advanced by the Supreme Court to uphold the applicant\u2019s conviction were in particular based on the results of forensic examinations and a single piece of material evidence ( toolbox), the relying on which appears not to have been decisive for the outcome. The Supreme Court\u2019s conviction of the applicant was thus based mainly on the use of evidence obtained in violation of the Convention as found in the previous Yaremenko judgment.",
