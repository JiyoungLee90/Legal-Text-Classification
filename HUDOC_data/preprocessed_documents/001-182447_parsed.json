In particular, in respect of the period during which he was detained in Korydallos prison, the applicant submitted that he should have been transferred to Korydallos prison hospital, where he would have had access to a special infrastructure adapted to his situation and would have been regularly monitored by a doctor. In respect of Larissa prison, the applicant claimed that he had not been provided with a special bed or toilet adapted to his needs and that he had not been regularly monitored by a doctor. The Court considers that, in so far as the complaints in the present case concern a lack of care administered in prison to the applicant as a disabled person and a lack of hospitalisation or detention in a place specifically adapted to his needs \u2212 problems affecting the person concerned personally \u2212 he should have made use of the remedies provided for by Article 572 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article 6 of the Penal Code \u2212 namely an application to the competent public prosecutor or to the prison council \u2212 and should have sought to obtain a solution to his problems from them (see, mutatis mutandis, Kordas v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a051574/14, \u00a7\u00a7 24 -27, 30 March 2017).

Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV). Illtreatment must, however, attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 162, Series A no. 25).",

In that connection, the Court notes that measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. Nevertheless, Article 3 requires the State to ensure that prisoners are detained in conditions that are compatible with respect for their human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject them to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention, and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, their health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kud\u0142a v.

Apart from the specific deficiencies concerning the applicants\u2019 detention in each of the above cases, particularly overcrowding, lack of outdoor space for walking, poor sanitary conditions and the poor quality of the food, the Court based its finding of a violation of Article 3 on the nature of the police stations per se, which are places designed to accommodate people for a short time. Imprisonment for between one and three months was thus deemed contrary to Article 3 (see Siasios and Others, \u00a7 32; Vafiadis, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36; Shuvaev, \u00a7 39; Tabesh, \u00a7\u00a043; Efremidi, \u00a7 41; Aslanis \u00a7 39; Adamantidis \u00a7 33; and Kavouris and Others, \u00a7\u00a038, all cited above).",

The Court further notes that the Government provided invoices from a private company which disinfected the premises in the prison. In respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint that the toilet had been similar to the one in Korydallos prison, the Court finds this allegation to be unsubstantiated, as the applicant did not provide any clarification of what he meant. In particular, the applicant did not specify how he was personally affected by the problems found by the CPT in that prison (see paragraph 30 above). The mere reference to an earlier judgment of the Court concerning Larissa prison and the CPT\u2019s report are not sufficient to refute the Government\u2019s specific assertions concerning the various aspects of the applicant\u2019s detention.
