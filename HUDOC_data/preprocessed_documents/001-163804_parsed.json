The domestic courts had not examined the main issue raised in the applicants\u2019 complaints, namely that the police had not had a valid reason to mount any of the undercover operations, and that they had wrongfully incited the applicants to sell drugs. The domestic courts had also not requested any evidence concerning the substance of the incriminating information from the police operation, and had simply accepted the uncorroborated statements of police officers to that effect (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 1819).",

The domestic courts in the present case did not consider the arguments which lay at the heart of the applicant\u2019s entrapment complaint, and, like the domestic courts in the cases of Lebedev and Others and Yeremtsov and Others (ibid.,), were not in a position to assess whether any violation of the applicant\u2019s Article 6 rights had occurred in the course of undercover operations. Thus, although the outcome of the reexamination of the applicant\u2019s case was favourable to him, it nevertheless fell short of the standards developed in the Court\u2019s caselaw, in the light of Article 6 of the Convention (see Lebedev and Others and Yeremtsov and Others, both cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 1216 and \u00a7\u00a7 1719, respectively).",

Mr Mamontov claimed that F. and Kh., who had overheard his conversation with an undercover police officer, had not been questioned in court. Mr Bachinskiy alleged that M. and G., who had bought drugs from him, had not been questioned in court. Ms Kardasheva claimed that the court had not questioned T., who had bought drugs from her. The applicants relied on Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention. The Government submitted no comments concerning the absent witnesses in Mr Mamontov\u2019s case. They further claimed that that one of the witnesses in Mr Bachinskiy\u2019s case had died, and submitted no comments concerning the other absent witness. Finally, they submitted that Ms Kardasheva had been able to question T. during pre-trial witness confrontation procedure.",
