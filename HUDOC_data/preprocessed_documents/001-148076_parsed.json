Even assuming that the applicant is dependent on outside help in order to cope with her daily life, this does not mean that she is necessarily dependent on her daughter who lives in Finland, or that care in Finland is the only option. As mentioned earlier, there are both private and public care institutions in Russia, and it is also possible to hire external help. Moreover, as noted by the Government, the applicant\u2019s daughter can support her financially and otherwise from Finland, in particular as her place of residence is not very far from the applicant\u2019s place of residence in Russia. With a view to the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court therefore considers that no such \u201cadditional factors of dependence other than normal ties of affection\u201d exist between the applicant and her daughter, and that there is thus no \u201cfamily life\u201d between them within the meaning of Article 8.

For this reason the fact that the applicable domestic law in the present case does not regard elderly parents in relation to their adult children as \u201cfamily members\u201d can neither bind the Court nor change its autonomous interpretation of the notion of \u201cfamily life\u201d and the circle of individuals entitled to rely on the protection of Article 8 of the Convention.",

In this regard they rightly contrasted the Court\u2019s views in Emonet and Others v. Switzerland with those in Kwakye-Nti and Dufie v. the Netherlands. In the first case the Court found Article 8 applicable to the relationship between an adult child with severe disabilities and her biological mother and mother\u2019s partner, who both provided loving care to her. In a situation similar to that of the present case, their relationship had been interrupted when the adult child had got married, but had been restored and maintained in the years after her divorce and serious illness. In Emonet and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 82) the Court thus indicated that the concept of \u201cfamily\u201d under Article 8 of the Convention was \u201cnot confined solely to marriage-based relationships but [might] also encompass other de facto \u2018family\u2019 ties\u201d, and that \u201cthe national authorities were under an obligation to take action to allow those family ties to develop\u201d. It went on to find (\u00a7 80) that \u201c[e]ven though the first applicant [was] an adult, she need[ed] care and emotional support\u201d. The Court further considered that in that setting there were \u201c\u2018additional factors of dependence, other than normal emotional ties\u2019 ... which exceptionally [brought] into play the guarantees that derive[d] from Article 8 between adults\u201d, in contrast to the Haas v. the Netherlands judgment (no. 36983/97, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2004I), where the Court held that no \u201cfamily life\u201d existed because the applicant had never lived with his son and had only ever had sporadic contact with him (see also, mutatis mutandis, S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck v.

We find ourselves unable to follow this rather formalistic approach in the absence of a proper in concreto analysis as to whether, despite separation for twenty years, the mother-child relationship and their life together over the past five years could be seen as sufficiently strong to attain the nature of a family-life relationship between the applicant and her daughter.",

We remain unconvinced by this argument, since in earlier cases the Court has held that family-life relationships can exist even where the status of one of the members has not been regularised under domestic law (see, as a recent authority, Jeunesse v. the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a012738/10, 3 October 2014). While the applicant\u2019s awareness of her irregular status may be of some importance for the determination of whether she could be said to be a \u201csettled migrant\u201d for the purposes of having her \u201cprivate life\u201d in the country, this appears to be irrelevant for the existence of emotional ties between her daughter and herself, as a dependent elderly parent, who \u201cdo[es] not belong to the core family\u201d.",

In our understanding this approach fails to take into account the entirety of the initially indicated applicable principle that \u201cthe existence of \u2018family life\u2019 cannot be relied on by applicants in relation to their elderly parents, adults who do not belong to the core family, unless the latter have been shown to be dependent on the members of their family (see Slivenko v. Latvia [GC], cited above, \u00a7 97)\u201d (see paragraph 55, emphasis added).",

These ties cannot be said to depend on the \u201cregular\u201d or \u201cirregular\u201d status of one or other member of the wider family circle, and often vary also in the different periods of their lives regardless of their place of residence. A time comes when elderly parents do need the loving care of their adult children and actually receive it as a matter of moral duty and preserved feelings of affection. To deny this is to hold that once an individual comes of age, the emotional ties with his or her parents are to be considered once and for all de facto and de jure severed and that for this reason neither a moral nor a legal duty to provide care may be said to exist between them. In our understanding this is incorrect in both legal and moral terms.",
