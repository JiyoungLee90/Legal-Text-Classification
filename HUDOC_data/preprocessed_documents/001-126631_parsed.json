In particular, witness D. was held in the same cells, though on different days during the period under examination, and her submissions concerning the physical conditions of detention were identical to those of the applicant.

He referred to the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Iwa\u0144czuk v. Poland, (no. 25196/94, 15 November 2001) and Van der Ven v. the Netherlands (no. 50901/99, ECHR 2003II).

They maintained that there was no evidence suggesting that the applicant had been ordered to undress completely, that he had been placed in a metal cage, pushed with truncheons, and required to stand against a wall and spread his buttocks. Yet the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s allegations lack an evidentiary basis precisely because the domestic authorities failed to take the necessary measures for the proper examination of the matter. The statements of the police officers provided by the Government are manifestly insufficient to disprove those allegations (compare Iwa\u0144czuk v. Poland, cited above \u00a7\u00a057). The Court therefore cannot attach much weight to the Government\u2019s argument in this regard. In any event, the Government have not substantiated the necessity to carry out regular strip searches twice a day during the whole period of the applicant\u2019s detention in the ITT, including those days when he had not even left the premises and had received no parcels from outside. There is no indication that such routine practice had sufficient justification in the particular case of the applicant.",
