The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission") and by the Belgian Government ("the Government") respectively on 9 September and 21 October 1994, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention.  It originated in an application (no. 17849/91) against the  lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by twenty-six applicants (see paragraph 6 below) on 4 January 1991.
The Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby  recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government's application referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48).  The object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).  
In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, twenty-five of the original twenty-six applicants before the Commission stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule 30).
On 27 February 1995 the lawyers so designated submitted a memorial on behalf of those applicants.  On 18 May 1995 they indicated that they had received no instructions from the sixth applicant.  
The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr J. De Meyer, the elected judge of Belgian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)).  On 24 September 1994, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mr N. Valticos, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha, Mr L. Wildhaber, Mr D. Gotchev and Mr U. Lohmus, (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Subsequently, Mr C. Russo, substitute judge, replaced Mr Valticos, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicants' lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38).  Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government's memorial and applicants' memorial on 24 and 27 February 1995 respectively.
In accordance with the President's decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, , on 22 May 1995.  The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.
There appeared before the Court:  
(a) for the Government  
(b) for the Commission  
(c) for the applicants  
The Court heard addresses by Mr Cabral Barreto, Mr Simont, Mr Dalcq and Mr Nelissen-Grade, and also their answers to its questions.  
The applicants are shipowners, mutual shipping insurance associations and, in one case, an insolvency administrator whose ships were involved in casualties in Belgian or  territorial waters prior to 17 September 1988.

24 January 1977: ship ran aground in the Scheldt estuary;  
21 January 1982: action brought by the applicant against the  in the Brussels Court of First Instance. 
The twenty-sixth applicant did not bring legal proceedings to challenge the Act of 30 August 1988.  
In March 1989 twenty-four of the applicants applied to the Court of Arbitration (Cour d'arbitrage) to have the Act of 30 August 1988 ("the 1988 Act") "amending the Act of 3 November 1967 on the piloting of sea-going vessels" declared void, in particular on the ground of its retrospective effect (see paragraph 18 below).
The court dismissed the applications on 5 July 1990, inter alia, for the following reasons: 
"The legislature is entitled to consider that the categories to whom the impugned Act is addressed are, principally on account of their involvement in shipping, sufficiently specific to warrant special rules concerning liability.  
In this instance the legislature gave the Act retrospective effect.  The retrospective component of the special rules on liability introduced for pilots infringes the fundamental principle of legal certainty, according to which the content of the law must in principle be foreseeable and accessible so that those subject to the law may foresee to a reasonable degree the consequences of a given action at the moment when that action is carried out.  
This violation of the principle is not, in the circumstances of the case, disproportionate in relation to the general objective underlying the contested legislation.  The legislature intended to preserve in the legislation on pilots the rules on liability which it had not wanted to amend in 1967 and which the case-law prior to 1983 and legal writing inferred from section 5 of the Pilots Act 1967 and sections 64 and 251 of the Shipping Act (Book II, Title II, of the Commercial Code).  Moreover it took into account the considerable financial implications that would result, in a way that could not have been foreseen, for the relevant public authorities from the reversal of the case-law.  
In the light of all these considerations, exempting from liability the organisers of a pilot service and limiting the personal liability of pilots cannot be regarded as a failure to comply with the requirements of Articles 6 and 6 bis of the Constitution, even having regard to the retrospective effect of the Act in question.  
...  
The applicants claim that the legislation in issue introduces an unjustified distinction between, on the one hand, disputes that have reached their conclusion (causae finitae), which fall outside the scope of the legislation, and, on the other, pending disputes (causae pendentes), which are covered by the Act.  
Attributing retrospective effect to a legal rule means in principle that that rule applies to legal relationships that came into being and were not definitively terminated before its entry into force; such a rule can therefore apply only to pending and future disputes and cannot bear in any way on disputes that have been concluded.  
According to a fundamental principle of our legal system, a judicial decision may be varied only on appeal.  By applying the contested distinction so as to limit the effect of the Act with regard to the past, the legislature sought to respect that principle and did not therefore operate a distinction contrary to Articles 6 and 6 bis of the Constitution.  
The applicants relied further on the violation of Article 11 of the Constitution and of Article 1 of the First Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights (P1-1).  
...  
By amending rules governing compensation for damage without calling into question the existence of debts arising from judicial decisions, the legislature did not introduce any unjustified distinction, as the protection guaranteed by the above-mentioned provisions extends only to property that has already been acquired."  
The twenty-fifth applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation against the judgment of 26 October 1988 whereby the Antwerp Court of Appeal dismissed, on the basis of the 1988 Act, its third-party application against the  (see paragraph 6 above).
On 26 January 1990 the Court of Cassation referred a question to the Court of Arbitration for a preliminary ruling on the constitutionality of the 1988 Act and in particular its retrospective effect.  On 22 November 1990 that court confirmed in substance its judgment of 5 July 1990 (see paragraph 7 above). 
Accordingly, on 19 April 1991, the Court of Cassation dismissed the twenty-fifth applicant's appeal on points of law.  Reproducing the reply given by the Court of Arbitration to its question for a preliminary ruling, it dismissed a first submission according to which the retrospective effect of the 1988 Act infringed the former Articles 6 and 6 bis of the Constitution.  It then declared inadmissible the submission based on an alleged violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), after noting that the twenty-fifth applicant had not invoked that provision (P1-1) in the Court of Appeal. Finally, it rejected the submission that, by taking effect in respect of proceedings that were in progress, the 1988 Act prevented the courts from deciding the disputes as brought before them, contrary to the principles of the independence of the courts and equality of arms between the parties.  The Court of Cassation held as follows:  
"The task and duty of a judge is to apply the law to the dispute before him; the fact that that is his task and his duty has no bearing on his independence.  A retrospective law applicable to pending disputes, even where the State is a party to the dispute, does not impair the judge's independence in carrying out his task and accomplishing his duty.  Any pressure brought to bear on a judge by such a law is no different from the pressure that all laws exert on him.  The fact that the judgment applies such a law does not constitute a violation of the right to a fair hearing of the case by an independent tribunal."  
In  the piloting of sea-going vessels is a public service organised by the State in the interests of shipping.  It is governed by the Act of 3 November 1967 on the piloting of sea-going vessels ("the 1967 Act").  In practice pilot services are provided either directly by the State itself, for maritime and river navigation, or by private companies acting under licence, such as the Brabo company, which has a monopoly of pilot services within the .
Pursuant to the 1967 Act and the treaties concluded between Belgium and the Netherlands, merchant ships that enter the Scheldt estuary must have on board a pilot with a licence issued by the Belgian or  authorities.  However, the only sanction that may be imposed on the master of a ship who fails to comply with this obligation is that he be required to pay the pilot's fee, which is payable in any event.
Under section 5 (1) of the 1967 Act:
"... piloting consists in the assistance given to the masters of sea-going vessels by pilots appointed by the Minister whose responsibilities include the pilot service.  The pilot shall advise the master.  The latter shall be in sole command as regards the course to be steered and the manoeuvres of the vessel."  
In relation to that provision the explanatory memorandum for the bill that formed the basis of the 1967 Act states as follows:
"Section 5 defines piloting and, accordingly, the nature of the role of the pilot in this operation.  It therefore settles an important legal question.  As the pilot's role is one of assistance, he does not replace the master, who remains in sole command of the steering of his ship and its manoeuvres.  The pilot simply advises on the route to be taken.  This is confirmation of the rule which is currently in force and which is to be found, inter alia, in a judgment [of the Court of Cassation] of 19 March 1896 ..."  
In its opinion on the draft, the Conseil d'Etat took the view that the latter instrument "gave express effect to a long-standing interpretation according to which the pilot acts merely as the master's adviser".  As the provision in the draft initially read "the master has sole responsibility for steering the ship and its manoeuvres", the Conseil d'Etat suggested that the word "responsibility" be replaced by the term "in command" since it seemed that "the Government's intention [was] not to depart in this provision from the general law of tort".
Section 64 of the Shipping Act (Book II, Title II, of the Commercial Code) provides that "the master is required to be present in person on board his ship when it enters or leaves ports, harbours or rivers".
According to section 251 of the Shipping Act:
"...  
If the collision is caused by the fault of one of the vessels, liability to make good the damages attaches to the one which has committed the fault. 
...  
The liability imposed by the preceding article[s] attaches in cases where the collision is caused by the fault of a pilot even when the pilot is carried by compulsion of law."  
According to two judgments delivered by the Court of Cassation respectively on 24 April 1840 (Pasicrisie, 1839-1840, I, 375) and 19 March 1896 (Pasicrisie, 1896, I, 132), the pilot was to be regarded as the agent (préposé) of the master, the owner or the charterer.  This meant that Article 1384 of the Civil Code was applicable to him.  That Article provides as follows:
"A person shall be liable not only for the damage caused by his own action, but also for that which is caused by the actions of those for whom he is responsible or by things which are in his care.  Fathers and mothers shall be liable for the damage caused by their minor children.  Masters and principals shall be liable for the damage caused by their servants and agents in the exercise of the duties for which they are employed.  
..."  
It followed that the State was not liable for the negligence of pilots.  Pilots were liable solely for negligent acts committed without the master's knowledge.  
By a judgment of 15 December 1983 the Court of Cassation (Pasicrisie, 1983, I, 418), endorsing the opinion of Mrs Liekendael, the advocate general, brought an end to this situation, holding, inter alia, in relation to the two above-mentioned paragraphs (see paragraph 15 above) of section 251 of the Shipping Act:
"It follows from these statutory provisions that, in the event of a collision caused by the negligence of a ship, the owner of that ship is required to make good the damage caused by that negligence to the victims of the collision.  It cannot, however, be inferred either from section 251 of the Shipping Act or from section 64 of that Act, according to which the master is required to be present in person on board his ship on entering and leaving ports, harbours and rivers, that the owner is precluded from instituting proceedings against third parties, who may have incurred liability under other statutory provisions, notably Articles 1382 or 1384 of the Civil Code.  
The master, who is in sole command of the ship's course and manoeuvres by virtue of section 5 of the Act of 3 November 1967 on the piloting of sea-going vessels, is not vested with any authority in regard to the pilot who, according to the same provision, acts as his adviser.  
In so far as it failed to examine whether the pilot of a ship that caused the collision had been negligent, however slightly, in a way which had contributed to occasioning the damage resulting from that collision, and excluded, in the event that that had been the case, the possibility that the State could have incurred liability, although the pilot belonged to a service organised by the State and was under the latter's exclusive authority, the judgment lacked a proper reasoning in law."  
It followed that the pilot could no longer be regarded as the master's agent and his acts were therefore capable of incurring his own liability and that of the organiser of the pilot service. 
This new case-law, which was confirmed shortly afterwards by a judgment of 17 May 1985 (Pasicrisie, 1985, I, 1159), followed the line taken in the "La Flandria" judgment of 5 November 1920 (Pasicrisie, 1920, I, 193), in which the Court of Cassation had recognised that the State and other public-law bodies were subject to the general law of tort.  
By an Act of 30 August 1988, published in the Moniteur belge on 17 September 1988, the legislature inserted in the 1967 Act section 3 bis, which reads as follows:
"para. 1. The organiser of a pilot service cannot be held directly or indirectly liable for damage sustained or caused by the ship under pilotage, where such damage is the result of the negligence of the organiser himself or one of his staff acting in the performance of his duties, irrespective of whether the negligence in question consists of an act or omission.  
Nor can the organiser of a pilot service be held directly or indirectly liable for damage caused by a malfunction or defect in the equipment owned or used by the pilot service for the purpose of supplying information or instructions to the sea-going vessels.  
For the purposes of the present Article, the following definitions shall apply:  
The ship shall be liable for the damage referred to in the first paragraph.  
A member of staff [of the pilot service] who, by his act or omission, caused the damage referred to in the first paragraph above shall be liable only in the event of a deliberately tortious act or gross negligence.  
The liability of a member of staff for damage caused by his gross negligence shall be limited to five hundred thousand francs for each incident giving rise to such damage.  The Crown may adjust that amount in the light of the economic situation.  
2. The foregoing subsection shall enter into force on the date of publication in the Moniteur belge.  It shall apply with retrospective effect for a period of thirty years from that date."
By virtue of Article 107 ter (as it was formerly, now Article 142) of the Constitution and sections 1 and 26 of the Special Act on the Court of Arbitration of 6 January 1989, that court has jurisdiction to hear:
(1) applications to have statutes, decrees or orders declared void for breach either of the rules governing the distribution of powers between the State, the communities and the regions, or of Articles 6 and 6 bis (as they were formerly, now Articles 10 and 11) of the Constitution, which provide for equality before the law and prohibit discrimination in the exercise of rights and freedoms; 
(2) requests for preliminary rulings on questions concerning the breach of the said rules or Articles by statutes, decrees or orders.  
The applicants lodged their application with the Commission on 4 January 1991.  They maintained that the rules governing liability introduced by the Act of 30 August 1988 infringed Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Article 6 para. 1 (P1-1, art. 6-1) of the Convention and Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1).
On 6 September 1993 the Commission declared the complaints concerning Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (P1-1, art. 6-1) admissible; it found the remainder of the application (no. 17849/91) inadmissible.  In its report of 4 July 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) (unanimously), but that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention (eleven votes to six), except as regards the second (fourteen votes to three) and twelfth applicants (sixteen votes to one).
The full text of the Commission's opinion and of the five separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an appendix to this judgment . 
In their memorial the Government asked the Court
"by way of primary submission, to declare application no. 17849/91 inadmissible and, in the alternative, to hold that the facts of the present case do not disclose any breach on the part of the  of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."  
The applicants invited the Court to
