The question whether the right to a speedy decision has been respected must be determined in the light of the circumstances of each case. There is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of a detention in cases where a trial is pending, as the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see, with further references, Idalov v.
