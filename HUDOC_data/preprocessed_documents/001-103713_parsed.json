France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII). Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or convincing argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present circumstances. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

In so far as this complaint may be understood to concern the assessment of the evidence and the result of the proceedings before the domestic courts, the Court reiterates that, according to Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.  [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I). In the present case, the Court finds that the applicant's submissions do not disclose any indication that the courts lacked impartiality, or that the proceedings were otherwise unfair. Moreover, the Court is satisfied that the courts' findings concerning the release of the medical files in question, and in particular that of the image of computer tomography, do not indicate any appearance of arbitrariness, especially in view of the fact that the applicant had never sought its release from the hospital where it had actually been taken. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 and must be rejected, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",
