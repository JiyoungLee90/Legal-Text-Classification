Using the same approach and making an assessment based on all the materials at its disposal, the Court estimates the pecuniary damage suffered at EUR 34,000 and decides to award this amount jointly to the applicants, while dismissing the remainder of their claim. It further decides to award each applicant EUR 6,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",
