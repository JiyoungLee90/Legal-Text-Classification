This incomplete information meant that the report, rather than implying that medical evidence could neither confirm nor deny the applicant\u2019s allegations, was instead cited as constituting definitive proof that he had not been raped. Moreover, the applicant had mentioned a certain aspect of his alleged abuse (namely that his abusers had shaved him around his anus). However, despite a specific question about that allegation which the proctologist had not answered in his report, the prosecutor did not find it necessary to obtain a clear answer. Indeed, the prosecutor did not find it important to interview that specialist until after the reopening of the investigation in 2013. The Government have not explained what prevented him from conducting such an interview in October 2012.

This applies, in particular, to cases in which Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is at stake and the Court must then exercise a certain power to review whether national law has been observed (see Baranowski v.

As such, it cannot be said that during the murder investigation that prosecutor became aware of separate offences allegedly committed by the applicant and that in reaction thereto he initiated new criminal investigations. Rather, the applicant was accused of committing, during the same set of events of 12 August 2012, three offences against P. The fact that shortly after the two new criminal investigations were started they were joined with the original one (see paragraph 8 above) only confirms that. Moreover, one of the two offences presented as separate ones (specifically, the burning of P.\u2019s car) had already been described in the original investigation as an action undertaken with the aim of hiding the evidence of that murder (see paragraph 7 above).",

Clearly, the prosecutor saw the alleged murder of P. as an important element to be taken into consideration by the judge when deciding whether to remand the applicant in custody in respect of the proceedings concerning the robbery of P. and the destruction of his property during the same set of events of 12 August 2012 (see paragraph 8 above).",

The Court has also held that justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities. When deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities are obliged to consider alternative means of ensuring his or her appearance at trial (ibid.; see also Buzadji, cited above, \u00a7 87).",
