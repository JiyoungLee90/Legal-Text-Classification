In particular, it established that when communicating the application to the Government on 3\u00a0September 2007, in question no. 3 attached to the Statement of Facts prepared by the Court\u2019s Registry, the Court had asked the Government to produce copies of the witness statements for the purpose of clarifying the evidentiary basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction. On 22\u00a0November 2007 the Government submitted their observations on the admissibility and merits of the application, enclosing a number of items from the applicant\u2019s criminal case file, but not including the witness depositions. They informed the Court that the requested documents would be submitted as soon as the Government had received them \u201cfrom the relevant bodies of the Russian Federation\u201d. The Court acknowledged receipt of the Government\u2019s observations, with the enclosures, in writing on 30 November 2007, and invited them \u201cto submit copies of the witness statements as soon as possible\u201d. The Government provided the Court with an English translation of their observations on 20\u00a0December 2007. There were no enclosures other than those submitted by the Government on 22\u00a0November 2007. Following receipt of the applicant\u2019s observations, in which he raised the issue of the Government\u2019s compliance with their obligations under Article\u00a038 of the Convention, on 13\u00a0February 2008 the Court notified the Government that it had still not received copies of the witness statements.

It stressed that on 30\u00a0November 2007, noting that the Government had not complied with the request to provide copies of the witness statements, it had asked them to send those documents as soon as possible.

Whereas the Court did not reply to this letter, it observed that the Government had formulated their reply in general terms and had not explicitly stated that the witness statements were included in the attachments.
