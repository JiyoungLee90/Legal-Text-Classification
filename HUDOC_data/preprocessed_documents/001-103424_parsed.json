It is for the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time: that is to say, that the remedy was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a024888/94, \u00a7 57, ECHR 1999-IX). Where a suggested remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, for example in the light of settled domestic case law, the fact that the applicant did not use it is not a bar to admissibility (Radio France and Others v. France (dec.), no. 53984/00, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR 2003-X (extracts)). Moreover, an applicant does not need to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature as to constitute a\u00a0remedy, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing the alleged breach (Yoyler v. Turkey (dec.), no. 26973/95, 13 January 1997). In addition, particular attention should be paid to, inter alia, the speediness of the remedial action itself, it not being excluded that the adequate nature of the remedy can be undermined by its excessive duration (Doran v. Ireland, no.\u00a050389/99, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2003X (extracts)). In the Czech context, the Court has held that applicants who wished to challenge the lawfulness of a winding-up resolution were not required to pursue, or await, constitutional proceedings on a set-aside decision (Kohlhofer and Minarik v.\u00a0the\u00a0Czech\u00a0Republic, cited above, \u00a7 79).",
