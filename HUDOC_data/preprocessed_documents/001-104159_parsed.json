That danger could not have been eliminated by any other means and the actions of the military officials in command of that operation had been appropriate in view of the resistance shown by the illegal fighters.

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.

Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69; Aksoy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54; and Tanr\u0131kulu v.

The Court reiterates that, in the case of a breach of Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention, compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage flowing from the breach should in principle be available as part of the range of redress (see Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2001V). However, the alleged violation of Article 2 of the Convention in cases of fatal assault by State agents cannot be remedied only by awarding damages to the relatives of the victims (see, among other authorities, Kaya v. Turkey, 19 February 1998, \u00a7\u00a0105, Reports 1998I, and Ya\u015fa v. Turkey, 2 September 1998, \u00a7 74, Reports 1998VI). This is so because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to such incidents to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough to prosecute and punish those responsible, this might result in wrongful use of lethal force by State agents who would be placed in a position of virtual impunity, and the protection of the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, despite its fundamental importance, would be rendered ineffective in practice. Accordingly, an effective investigation is required, in addition to adequate compensation, to provide sufficient redress to an applicant complaining of a violation of Article 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Nikolova and Velichkova v. , no.\u00a07888/03, \u00a7\u00a7 55 and 56, 20\u00a0December 2007).",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, the results of a large-scale attack involving federal aircraft should normally become known to the authorities immediately after such an attack. It falls to the State to ensure that State agents who participated in the attack duly report on it, and that the competent authorities, including those in charge of it, check its results without delay. The Court further notes the applicants\u2019 submissions to the effect that they met numerous federal servicemen in Kogi (Runnoye) when they returned to the village two days after the incident (see paragraphs 24-26 above) and that they started complaining to various State bodies shortly after the attack (see paragraph (a)\u00a0\u00a0The applicants\u2019 complaints to public bodies and information received by them",

The Court finds it striking that for more than two years the Russian authorities demonstrated such indifference towards an incident involving multiple deaths of civilians \u2013 minor children and women \u2013 and the devastation of a whole village as a result of the actions of the federal forces.

As regards this latter decision, the Court reiterates that, in principle, an appeal against a decision to discontinue criminal proceedings may offer a substantial safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power by the investigating authority, given a court\u2019s power to annul such a decision and indicate the defects to be addressed (see, mutatis mutandis, Trubnikov (dec.), cited above). Therefore, in the ordinary course of events such an appeal might be regarded as a possible remedy where the prosecution has decided not to investigate the claims. The Court, however, has strong doubts that this remedy would have been effective in the present case. It reiterates its above finding that it is reasonable to assume that the investigation was stayed and reopened on several occasions (see paragraph\u00a0 above). In such circumstances, the Court is not convinced that an appeal to a court, which could only have had the same effect, would have offered the applicants any redress. It considers, therefore, that such an appeal in the particular circumstances of the present case would be devoid of any purpose.

The situations where deprivation of life may be justified are exhaustive and must be narrowly interpreted. The use of force which may result in the deprivation of life must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a), (b) and (c).

Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims. In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 146-50, Series A no. 324; Andronicou and Constantinou v.

That award was based on Presidential Decree no. 898 of 5 September 1995, which provided for a lump-sum payment of a fixed amount to relatives of each individual killed as a result of the hostilities in the , without distinguishing between deaths inflicted by private individuals and those caused by State agents (see paragraph 86 above). When awarding compensation, the District Court clearly stated that its payment was not dependent on the establishment of a causal link between the damage caused and the State\u2019s actions.

Indeed, Article 1069 of the Russian Civil Code, which establishes the rules on compensation for damage inflicted by representatives of the State and which would have been applicable if the applicants had brought civil proceedings as suggested by the Government, provides that State agents are only liable for damage caused by their unlawful actions or failure to act (see paragraph\u00a0 above). In the circumstances of the present case, where, as mentioned by the Government, the investigation into the attack ended with a decision of 23 September 2005 stating that the federal servicemen\u2019s actions had been justified, the applicants\u2019 civil claim for damages would have been doomed to failure. In support of this finding, the Court also refers to the practice of the Russian courts, which have consistently refused to award any compensation for damage caused by the federal forces during the conflict in the Chechen Republic, stating, in particular, that the latter\u2019s actions had been lawful as the counter-terrorist operation in the region had been launched under relevant presidential and governmental decrees which had not been found to be unconstitutional (see paragraphs 89- above). With this in mind, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s argument that it was open to the applicants to file a civil claim for compensation in respect of their lost housing and property, as the right in question was illusory and devoid of substance. In sum, the Court finds the remedy under examination inadequate and ineffective, given that it was clearly incapable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible, or even to any financial award in the circumstances of the present case.",

It is also doubtful that Governmental Decree no. 404 of 4 July 2003, which afforded the right to compensation to permanent residents of the Chechen Republic (see paragraph 88 above), can be applied in the applicants\u2019 situation, given that after the attack most of them permanently left the region (see paragraph  above). In any event, even assuming that the applicants are entitled to extra-judicial compensation under this latter decree as suggested by the Government, it is clear from the relevant legal instrument that the compensation in question is paid without regard to the particular circumstances in which the property was lost, that is to say, irrespective of whether State agents were responsible for the destruction. Moreover, the value of the lost property is not taken into account either, since the overall amount paid for lost housing and other possessions cannot exceed RUB 350,000 (approximately EUR 9,000). In such circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that the compensation referred to by the Government can be regarded as an effective remedy for the violation alleged.",

Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of Protocols Nos. 1 and 4, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions and no derogation from it is permissible under Article\u00a015 even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see, among other authorities, Aksoy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article\u00a03. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 162).",

Turkey, 25 May 1998, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a013034, Reports 1998III), the same principle would not usually apply to situations where the person taken into custody has later been found dead (see, for example, Tanl\u0131 v.

In particular, in the case of Sel\u00e7uk and Asker the Court had regard to the manner in which the applicants\u2019 homes had been destroyed, and namely to the fact that the exercise had been premeditated and carried out contemptuously and without respect for the feelings of the applicants, whose protests had been ignored (see Sel\u00e7uk and Asker, cited above, \u00a7 77), and, with this in mind, found that the acts of the security forces had amounted to \u201cinhuman treatment\u201d within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. A similar line of reasoning appears to be implicit in the cases of Y\u00f6yler and Ayder and Others.

The Court accepts that the applicants may have suffered considerable distress as a result of the destruction of their homes and property in the attack of 12 September 1999. However, in the light of the foregoing, and also bearing in mind that it has already found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on that account, the Court is unable to find a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the circumstances of the present case, in so far as the applicants\u2019 complaint about the destruction of their homes and possessions is concerned.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, this situation is somewhat similar to that of applicants whose relatives have been found dead after having been taken into custody by State agents, where the Court has concluded that a finding of a violation of Article 2 of the Convention would suffice. Therefore, while having no doubt as to the profound suffering caused to the second, third, thirteenth and twenty-second applicants by the deaths of their relatives, the Court finds no violation of Article 3 on that account, given that it has already found a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive and procedural aspects.",

However, the Court has already noted above that these documents appear to have been based entirely on the applicants\u2019 own submissions and therefore cannot serve as reliable evidence in support of their claim in its relevant part. The applicants did not adduce any other documents, such as, for example, their tax returns, capable of confirming that their farming was at all profitable, and attesting the amount of any such profit. The Court recognises that it might be difficult in practice for the applicants to obtain documents relating to their farming activities before the attack. Nevertheless, in the absence of any reliable documents confirming that those activities brought the applicants profit, the Court considers that any award regarding their lost income would be speculative. It therefore dismisses this part of the applicants\u2019 claim (see Khamidov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0197).",
