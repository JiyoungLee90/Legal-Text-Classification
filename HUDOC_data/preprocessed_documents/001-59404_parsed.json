Moreover, by the time the fire broke out in the public prosecutor\u2019s office, the hearing of his appeal had already been delayed by one year and eight months. Moreover, there was an eleven-month delay between the first decision of the Court of Cassation and the adjournment by the Court of Appeal of the re-examination of the applicant\u2019s case. The applicant also argues that the Government cannot justify the delays by referring to the need to adjourn hearings because prosecution witnesses were not present. In addition there was a fifteen-month delay between the adjournment of 10 May 1995 and the re-examination of his case by the Court of Appeal. His second appeal in cassation was heard one year after the second judgment of the Court of Appeal. The lawyers\u2019 strike did not cause major delays if compared with the overall length of the proceedings. The applicant cannot be blamed for making use of available remedies.
