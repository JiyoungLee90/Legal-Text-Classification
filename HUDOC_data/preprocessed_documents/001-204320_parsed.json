She stressed that nothing confidential concerning N.G.\u2019s custody proceedings had been disclosed, as all the relevant information had already been disclosed to the public on a number of occasions. The applicant also submitted that her criminal conviction had been excessive, as the domestic authorities had had other means to ensure that she complied with the rule of confidentiality, such as warning her about what information they considered to be confidential. In addition, the domestic courts had failed to take into account the fact that she had never acted contrary to the interests of N.G. Referring to the Government\u2019s argument that her sentence could be erased from the criminal record (see paragraph 76 below), the applicant argued that her rehabilitation and the erasure of that criminal record had nothing to do with her conviction.

In the Government\u2019s view, although it was not possible to see in the television report who had showed the decision to the journalists, there could be no doubt that it had been the applicant, since she had had a pile of documents in front of her and had gone through those documents and pointed to something during the interview.

That person must be able \u2013 if need be with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice. A law which confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with the requirement of foreseeability, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (Ibid., \u00a7 94, and cases cited therein).",

When a particular piece of information has already become known to the public, the interest in maintaining its confidentiality might no longer constitute an overriding requirement (see Weber v. Switzerland, 22 May 1990, \u00a7\u00a7 49-51, Series A no. 177, and Aleksey Ovchinnikov v. Russia, no. 24061/04, \u00a7\u00a7 49-50, 16\u00a0December 2010, with further references). However, this fact will not necessarily remove the protection of Article 8 of the Convention, especially if information was neither revealed by a person concerned nor that person has consented to its disclosure (see, mutatis mutandis, Egeland and Hanseid v. Norway, no. 34438/04, \u00a7\u00a7 62-63, 16 April 2009, and Shabanov and Tren v. Russia, no. 5433/02, \u00a7\u00a7 44-55, 14 December 2006). Indeed, even with respect to a further dissemination of \u201cpublic information\u201d, the Court found that the interest in publication of that information had to be weighed against privacy considerations (see Von Hannover, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 74-75 and 77). This is so because privacy is not only about maintaining secrecy, but also about preventing intrusion (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 86-87 and 138, and Khadija Ismayilova v.

If proceedings are held in private, there may be a reasonable expectation that the information revealed in their course will be kept private (see paragraph 51, 54 and 56 above).

In the present case, the domestic courts dealing with the criminal charge brought against the applicant following a complaint by the child\u2019s uncle, whose continued custody of the child was the subject of the administrative proceedings in question (as well as court proceedings), convicted her without addressing these questions as required under the Court\u2019s established case-law.

The background of this case was that a person had been convicted of sexual abuse of his two minor children in criminal proceedings which had been declared confidential on the grounds of the need to protect the victims. The court\u2019s order entailed, inter alia, that both the casefile and the judgment were declared confidential apart from the operative part of the conviction. After his conviction, the defendant was interviewed on national television in a programme addressing issues relating to the rights of defence in criminal proceedings of this nature. In this context, his identity was not entirely concealed (he appeared with his face and with his forename disclosed). This prompted a criminal complaint by the victims, on the grounds that the convicted father, by discussing his prosecution and conviction in public, thereby also revealed, albeit indirectly, the identity of the children as victims. Charges were brought against the man as well as the journalists in charge of the TV show. In these proceedings, following a balancing exercise by the Supreme Court as the final instance, the defendants were convicted of dissemination of information violating the personal privacy of the victims. This case was precisely about the conflict between freedom of expression \u2013 of the convicted individual and the journalists who published his interview \u2013 and the Article 8 rights of the children, in this case victims of a serious crime, whose identity had not been expressly disclosed but whose privacy was compromised by the fact that their convicted father had chosen not to give his interview \u201cincognito\u201d. The balancing performed at the domestic level was subsequently endorsed by this Court, which dismissed the complaint as manifestly ill-founded. Thus, this case is an illustration from previous caselaw to the effect that it may be legitimate to enforce certain restrictions on the freedom of expression even in the context of a convicted person discussing his own case, on the grounds of the competing need to ensure protection for the privacy rights of the victims.",

The first is that, while it is obvious under the circumstances that the applicant must have provided the documents with which she appeared in the TV studio, it is a separate question how it actually came about that the child\u2019s name, as picked out from those documents, was displayed on the TV screen. It is difficult to see any justification for the fact that the role played by the journalists in charge of the programme, as the professionals in the field, was not addressed in this context. Instead, the applicant alone was prosecuted as a result of what took place in the course of the TV interview whereas the responsibility incumbent on the journalists was not taken into consideration. The second is that it is clear from the evidence that, before the television show in question (on 7 April 2010), the child\u2019s case had already been discussed in detail and the child\u2019s name given, including by the director of the K.

Without contesting the importance of the general principle that the best interests of the child must be taken into account, it is somewhat incongruous to focus on the requirements of the best interests of the child in a case where the core problem is that no other consideration was taken into account than the one which underlies the secrecy of the childcare proceedings, the breach of which led to the applicant\u2019s conviction. In the final analysis, these passages in the judgment are therefore plainly obiter dictum. This is, of course, even more so as the domestic criminal courts at no stage appear to have made any reference to having considered the best interest of the child in question whether as a primary consideration or at all.",

The judgment purports to assert a wholesale transposal into the ECHR framework of the tenet derived from the UNCRC according to which the best interests of the child must be taken as a primary consideration in any decision directly or indirectly concerning children (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a063, 97-99). The ECHR, however, is an instrument enshrining a specific set of human rights and fundamental freedoms, some of which are of an absolute character whereas others very often involve, according to wellestablished case-law, the assessment and balancing of various competing rights and interests. In the context of the Convention, therefore, it is not plausible to suggest, in such broad and sweeping terms, that whenever children are directly or even indirectly concerned, their best interests are a primary consideration which may \u201cnot be put on the same level as all other considerations\u201d (\u00a7 99). It cannot be argued, for instance, that in the context of the application of Articles\u00a02, 3, 5 or 7 the best interests of a child could operate as a limitation of someone else\u2019s rights under the said provisions which otherwise would not be permissible; the absolute nature of the rights involved may not be diluted although it might be in the best interests of a child to do so. For an illustration in concrete terms: in a G\u00e4fgen type of scenario, the consideration of the child\u2019s best interests did not then, and would not now, affect the application of Article 3 (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7 107, ECHR\u00a02010, where the Court held that the prohibition on ill-treatment of a person applies irrespective of the conduct of the victim or the motivation of the authorities to safe a child\u2019s life). Or, to take another example from the context of Article 7, a criminal court would not be justified in deviating from the principle of nullum crimen sine lege even if it were in the best interest of a child victim to do so. In the latter situation, the demand to accommodate the best interests of children would instead require a response by the legislator.",

In the present case, the secrecy obligation held to have been imposed on the applicant may indeed have been intended (though there is no evidence before this Court either way) to protect the interests of the child (as well as those of other family members). Yet we are unanimous in concluding that the grandmother\u2019s criminal conviction in the present circumstances gave rise to a violation of her rights under Article 10.",
