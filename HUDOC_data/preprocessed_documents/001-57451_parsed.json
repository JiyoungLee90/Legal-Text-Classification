What is more, by asserting on 27 August 1976 that the two dismissal notices of 30 September 1974 had not been served on him on the same day, Mr. Buchholz caused a prolongation of more than eight months, during which the Court took evidence from the witnesses called by the two parties on the issue of the disputed date (see paragraphs 26, 30, 31 and 32 above). At paragraph 108 of its report, the Commission also cited as an additional cause of delay the constitutional application of 21 September 1976. However, as was pointed out by the applicant and concerned by the Government, the Court of Appeal had fixed the date of the hearing of 11 January 1977 one month before the lodging of the constitutional complaint, which thus could have had no effect whatsoever on this decision (see paragraphs 26 and 28 above).",

It further observed that the decision taken on 3 May 1976 not to hold a hearing until 27 August likewise entailed a loss of time of several months (see paragraph 25 above).

In this context as well, the statistics furnished by the Government are revealing, for they show that very few of the cases handled by the relevant Chamber of the Court of Appeal in 1975 and 1976 gave rise to more than three hearings (see paragraph 39 above).",

One cannot, as did the Commission, criticise the Court of Appeal for having neglected to discuss with the parties a document already filed which might perhaps have disclosed the exact date of receipt; for, confronted with the applicant\u2019s assertions which were corroborated the same day by his wife, the Court of Appeal could reasonably have deemed it necessary also to call the defendants\u2019 witnesses.",

Whether these accusations were well-founded thus became a subsidiary issue; the need to go into the matter only arose once the impossibility of settling the action was established. The fact that at the third hearing the applicant subsequently denied having been served with the two dismissal notices on 30 September 1974 explains why the Court of Appeal should again have postponed seeking expert evidence: it was necessary to await the outcome of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.",

According to the Government, the Court of Appeal was, following the hearing on 9 October, expecting a reply - which in the event never materialised - by the defendants to the written pleading of 3 October. Without overlooking the difficulties involved in attempting to secure a friendly settlement, especially in view of the charges made by the applicant against the management of his former employers, the Court nonetheless finds cause for concern in the duration of this phase of the procedure, which was further extended by a five-week period of reply granted to the parties.",
