It remains unclear however, how this provision corresponds with the lawful activities of other actors of social life. In particular, neither this section nor any other provisions of domestic law specifically deal with the legitimate exceptions authorising interference with the professional secrecy of a lawyer by investigative bodies. Indeed, the Convention does not prohibit the imposition of certain obligations on lawyers which may affect their relationships with their clients (see Andr\u00e9 and Other v. France, no.\u00a018603/03, \u00a7 42, 24 July 2008; Jacquier v. France (dec.), no. 45827/07, 1\u00a0September 2009; and Xavier Da Silveira v. France, no. 43757/05, \u00a7 37, 21\u00a0January 2010). Accordingly, the absolute statutory ban, aimed at protecting the inviolability of the legal profession, could not be consistently applied without the introduction of further binding rules governing justified interference with privileged material. The current status of the domestic law thus afforded the authorities full discretion in determining how section\u00a010 of the Bar Act should be corresponded with the Code of Criminal Procedure and other legislative provisions in each particular case. In these circumstances the Court considers that the applicable domestic law did not meet the standard of foreseeability enshrined in the Convention (see Narinen v. , no. 45027/98, \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 36, 1 June 2004).",

An encroachment on professional secrecy may have repercussions for the proper administration of justice and hence for the rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention (Niemietz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037). Therefore the searching of lawyers\u2019 premises should be subject to particularly strict scrutiny. Appropriate safeguards, such as the presence and effective participation of an independent observer, must always be made available in the course of the search of a lawyer\u2019s office to ensure that material subject to legal professional privilege is not removed (see Andr\u00e9 and Other, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 44, 24 July 2008, and Aleksanyan v. , no. 46468/06, \u00a7 214, 22 December 2008).",

Nor do such observers have any appropriate means of preventing arbitrariness in the course of the search. Given such a legislative background, it is not surprising that in the present case the attesting witnesses, invited by the police, turned out to be two young students of a machine building academy without any relevant experience or legal qualification allowing them to play a role of meaningful guarantor against arbitrary interference with the material covered by lawyer-client privilege.

However, the Court has held in other contexts that this investigative procedure does not comply with the principles of an effective remedy because the enquiring officer can take only a limited number of procedural steps within that procedure at a point where victims have no formal status, thus excluding their effective participation in the procedure (see Davydov and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 17674/02 and 39081/02, \u00a7\u00a7 310-312, 1 July 2010).

In particular, despite repeated instructions, the prosecuting authorities were not effectively prevented from adopting multiple similar decisions refusing to open criminal proceedings. It is a matter of concern that the officials in charge of the \u201cpre-investigation\u201d enquiries were able to compromise the supervisory review in such a manner. It is a matter of even greater concern that the supervising authorities, while criticising the decisions of those officials, were prepared to tolerate their conduct indefinitely. The Court admits that a prosecutor must be vested with certain discretion as to whether the facts and evidence assembled justify a decision to open and pursue criminal proceedings. However, where the discretion is exercised arbitrarily or in bad faith, as it appears to have been in the present case, the effectiveness of the whole procedure is set at nought.",
