She did not direct the claim against the bailiffs and Ukrspetsyust and did not request in it that the District Court invalidate the public auction. It is true that, as indicated in the judgment of 23 March 2007 (see paragraph 24 above), during the hearing the applicant also asked the court to declare the auction invalid. However, in its decision of 30\u00a0October 2007 (see paragraph 25 above) the Court of Appeal concluded that it could not examine the validity of the auction, because the applicant had not lodged a claim for its invalidation in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. Indeed, the Court notes that the case file does not contain a claim (or increased claim) against the bailiffs and Ukrspetsyust for the invalidation of the auction, which the applicant could have lodged in accordance with the relevant procedure. Nor did she mention in her submissions before the Court that she had lodged such a claim (increased claim) in accordance with the relevant procedure or that she had been somehow barred from doing so.\u00a0Also, the Court notes that in her appeal in cassation against the decision of 30\u00a0October 2007 (see paragraph 26 above) the applicant did not contest as such the Court of Appeal\u2019s above conclusion. In turn, her failure to properly formulate and lodge a claim for the invalidation of the auction in accordance with the procedural rules prevented the courts from examining the lawfulness of the auction, specifically its compliance with the 1999 Regulation (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above). Lastly, as to the applicant\u2019s reference to Article 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Court observes again that the subject matter of, and the request made in, her claim was invalidation of the sale contract and not invalidation of the auction, such that the court could involve Ukrspetsyust and the bailiffs as co-respondents. Nor did she actually ask the court to involve them as co-respondents or complain in her appeals about its alleged failure to do so of its own motion. In sum, the Court concludes that the applicant did not exhaust the domestic remedies, as required by Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, for the purposes of her complaints under Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 about lawfulness of the auction.",

It further recalls that in the case of Irina Smirnova it noted that A.N. and his associates had eventually been prosecuted and sentenced to substantial prison terms and their property had been confiscated (including their share of the flat co-owned by the applicant). Although those measures effectively protected the applicant in that case from sharing the flat with her former attackers, it took the authorities over twelve years to resolve the matter, and no justification was given for such an extreme delay. The effectiveness of those proceedings was therefore significantly compromised and the applicant\u2019s rights set at naught for a considerable period of time (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a074, 76 and 91). Furthermore, the Court found that the domestic legal framework did not provide the applicant with procedural safeguards for protecting her right to respect for home and private life and that she did not have any meaningful forum in which to raise an argument that a duty to share her home with A.N. and others disproportionately affected her private life and enjoyment of her home (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 95-97 and 99). The Court thus found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 101).",

In particular, the Court notes that in its judgment of 12 October 2012 the District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s civil claim against A.N. in the part relating to the above complaint, stating that it fell outside the charges brought against A.N. The applicant did not appeal against the above judgment. Nor does it appear that she sued A.N. in civil courts for payment of charges. Furthermore, as regards the alleged thefts and spoilage in the applicant\u2019s flat, it appears that the applicant\u2019s relevant complaints were singled out into separate criminal proceedings, which were eventually discontinued by the prosecutors (see paragraph 20 above).
