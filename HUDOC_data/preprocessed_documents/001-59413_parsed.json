Letters sent to the applicant by the European Commission of Human Rights were opened by a prison officer in front of the applicant. Foreigners who did not speak Greek could not participate in the vocational training courses organised in Koridallos Prison.

According to the same witness, once the applicant became acquainted with the conditions of detention in the segregation unit, he asked for a transfer. He was then offered the possibility of going to the Delta wing, where drug addicts were being detained. Although Ms\u00a0Fragathula would not expressly admit that there were drugs in the Delta wing, she stated that the \u201cwing was problematic for someone who wanted to free himself from drugs\u201d. The Court considers that this implies that there were drugs illegally circulating in the Delta wing, a cause for serious concern. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant cannot be blamed for refusing to be moved from the segregation unit.

As regards ventilation, the Court notes that the delegates\u2019 findings do not correspond fully with those of the CPT, which visited Koridallos Prison in 1993 and submitted its report in 1994. However, the CPT\u2019s inspection took place in March, whereas the delegates went to Koridallos Prison in June, a period of the year when the climatic conditions are closer to those of the period of which the applicant complains. Furthermore, the Court takes into account the fact that the delegates investigated the applicant\u2019s complaints in depth, giving special attention, during their inspection, to the conditions in the very place where the applicant had been detained. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the findings of the Commission\u2019s delegates are reliable.",

Although the cell was designed for one person, the applicant had to share it with another inmate. This is one aspect in which the applicant\u2019s situation differed from the situation reviewed by the CPT in its 1994 report. Sharing the cell with another inmate meant that, for the best part of the period when the cell door was locked, the applicant was confined to his bed. Moreover, there was no ventilation in the cell, there being no opening other than a peephole in the door. The Court also notes that, during their visit to Koridallos, the delegates found that the cells in the segregation unit were exceedingly hot, although it was only June, a month when temperatures do not normally reach their peak in Greece. It is true that the delegates\u2019 visit took place in the afternoon, when the applicant would not normally be locked up in his cell. However, the Court recalls that the applicant was placed in the segregation unit during a period of the year when temperatures have the tendency to rise considerably in Greece, even in the evening and often at night. This was confirmed by Mr Papadimitriou, an inmate who shared the cell with the applicant and who testified that the latter was significantly physically affected by the heat and the lack of ventilation in the cell.",

In the Court\u2019s view, this omission denotes lack of respect for the applicant. The Court takes into account, in particular, that, for at least two months, the applicant had to spend a considerable part of each 24-hour period practically confined to his bed in a cell with no ventilation and no window, which would at times become unbearably hot. He also had to use the toilet in the presence of another inmate and be present while the toilet was being used by his cell-mate. The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s allegation that these conditions did not affect the applicant in a manner incompatible with Article 3. On the contrary, the Court is of the opinion that the prison conditions complained of diminished the applicant\u2019s human dignity and aroused in him feelings of anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him and possibly breaking his physical or moral resistance. In sum, the Court considers that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention in the segregation unit of the Delta wing of Koridallos Prison amounted to degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.",

The risk, adverted to by the Government, of Commission stationery being forged in order to smuggle prohibited material or messages into prison, is so negligible that it must be discounted\u201d [ibid., p. 22, \u00a7 62, second paragraph]. As already pointed out above, the applicant in the present case has been a drug addict and it is a commonplace that untreated drug addicts will do everything in order to get their drug. Therefore, whatever interference was caused by opening the letters in the applicant\u2019s presence \u2013 without reading them (reading would have been almost impossible anyway since very few prison officers knew sufficient English, according to the applicant\u2019s complaint [the applicant complained about lack of communication due to this fact; see paragraphs 32 and 46 of the Court\u2019s judgment]) \u2013 was justified.",

From all the above it follows that the opening of the letters (a)\u00a0was in accordance with the national law, that is, the Penitentiary Code, Article 51 \u00a7 2 [see paragraph 62 of the Court\u2019s judgment], (b) was effected for \u201cthe prevention of disorder or crime\u201d (that is, smuggling drugs into prison), and (c) was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d in the present case, contrary to the situation in Campbell and other older cases (see, for example, Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61; Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 April 1998, Series A no. 131; and McCallum v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series\u00a0A no. 183). In Campbell the possibility of \u201cCommission stationery being forged in order to smuggle prohibited material ... into prison\u201d [Campbell, cited above, p. 22, \u00a7 62, second paragraph] was negligible as Campbell was not an addict in an overcrowded prison but a \u201cman of violence\u201d [ibid., p. 8, \u00a7 8]. This conclusion is supported by both the facts of the present case and the case-law of this Court, which has recognised a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation to the States Parties in the imposition of restrictions (see, in particular, Silver and Others, cited above, pp. 37-38, \u00a7 97) [see also the partly dissenting opinions of Judges Sir John Freeland and Morenilla in Campbell].",
