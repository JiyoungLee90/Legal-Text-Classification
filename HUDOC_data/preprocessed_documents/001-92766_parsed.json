In fact the defendant\u2019s failure to attend court hearings on numerous occasions significantly protracted the proceedings at issue (see paragraphs\u00a09, 20 and 27 above). Although the courts had at their disposal ample machinery to ensure the defendant\u2019s presence in the courtroom, there is no indication that they took any measures to sanction the defendant\u2019s failure to appear or to consider the case in its absence (see, mutatis mutandis, Smirnova v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a036655/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a053 and 69, 8\u00a0November 2005).
