Moreover, in the case of Nazarov v.  (no. 13591/05, \u00a7\u00a077, 26\u00a0November 2009) the Court dealt with the Government\u2019s argument on the basis of the reference to the awards that had been made by the Russian courts in favour of a Mr D. and a Mr R. The Court noted that the problems arising from the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention had apparently been of a structural nature, for which no effective domestic remedy had been shown to exist, and that the cases to which the Government had referred did not concern detention in overcrowded cells but rather a detainee\u2019s infection with scabies and the authorities\u2019 failure to provide a detainee with food (see, for similar reasoning, Nedayborshch v.\u00a0Russia, no. 42255/04, \u00a7 21, 1 July 2010, and Arefyev, cited above, \u00a7 54). The Court sees no reason to depart from its previous findings in the present case. Accordingly, it dismisses the Government\u2019s objection as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. This conclusion is not altered by the Government\u2019s reference to two more judgments awarding compensation to former inmates. Both cases provide little evidentiary support for the Government\u2019s argument and have weak relevance to the present case (see, mutatis mutandis, Shilbergs v. , no.\u00a020075/03, \u00a7\u00a7 66-79, 17\u00a0December 2009).",

At the same time they did not refer to any original source of information on the basis of which their assertion could be verified. In this connection, the Court notes that on several previous occasions when the Government have failed to submit original records it has held that documents prepared after a considerable period of time cannot be viewed as sufficiently reliable, given the length of time that has elapsed (see, among recent authorities, Novinskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a011982/02, \u00a7\u00a0105, 10\u00a0February 2009, and Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7 91). The Court is of the view that these considerations hold true in the present case.

The Court also does not lose sight of the applicant\u2019s argument, as supported by the written statements of his fellow inmate, that the windows in the cells were covered with metal shutters. In these circumstances, the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument that the windows had given access to natural light and air. The metal construction on the windows, as described by the applicant, significantly reduced the amount of daylight that could penetrate into the cell, and cut off fresh air. It therefore appears that the applicant had to spend a considerable part of each day in the facility in a cramped cell with no window in the proper sense of the word (compare Peers v. Greece, no.\u00a028524/95, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2001III).\u00a0Furthermore, the Court notes that the fact that the applicant had access to a shower and could wash his linen and clothes only once a week raises serious concerns as to the conditions of hygiene and sanitation, given the acutely overcrowded accommodation in which he found himself (see, for similar reasoning, Melnik v. , no.\u00a072286/01, \u00a7\u00a0107, 28\u00a0March 2006). Lastly, the Court is particularly concerned with the authorities\u2019 failure to separate non-smoking detainees from smoking ones. On a number of occasions the Court has already treated exposure of a non-smoking detainee to environmental tobacco smoke in overcrowded cells as an additional aggravating circumstance (see, for instance, Pavalache v. , no. 38746/03, \u00a7 94, 18 October 2011).",
