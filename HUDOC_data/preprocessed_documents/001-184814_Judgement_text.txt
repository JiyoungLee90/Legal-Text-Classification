The case originated in an application (no. 50650/16) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Rustam Maykarimovich Shakirzyanov (“the applicant”), on 15 August 2016.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 3 April 2017 the complaint concerning the right to compensation for a period of unlawful detention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Kazan.
On 4 June 2002 he was convicted of disorderly acts and given a suspended two-year custodial sentence conditional on two years’ probation. On 14 November 2003 the court replaced the suspended sentence with an unconditional one because the applicant had failed to report to the probation authorities. On 16 December 2003 the Supreme Court of the Tatarstan Republic upheld that decision on appeal. The applicant subsequently served the full two years of the custodial sentence.
On 13 July 2016 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Tatarstan Republic quashed the decision of 14 November 2003 and the appeal decision of 16 December 2003, noting that the offence of disorderly acts had been decriminalised on 11 December 2003 and that the original sentence had been unenforceable. It held however that the applicant was not eligible for compensation for the unlawful detention because he had been initially found guilty and because the “right to the rehabilitation” did not cover the situations of ex post facto decriminalisation.
The relevant provisions of the domestic law are summarised in Stadnik v. Russia (no. 41509/06, §§ 13-14, 13 June 2017) and Abashev v. Russia (no. 9096/09, §§ 20-21, 27 June 2013).
