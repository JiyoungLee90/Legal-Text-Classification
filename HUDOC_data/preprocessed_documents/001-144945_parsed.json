Quashing of judgments because of newly-discovered circumstances is not by itself incompatible with this requirement, but the manner of its application may be (see Pravednaya v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a069529/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027\u201334, 18\u00a0November 2004). The Court notes from the domestic law provisions in force at the material time that newly-discovered circumstances were circumstances that existed during the trial, remained hidden from the court, and became known after trial. In the present case, the Constitutional Court provided its binding interpretation of the relevant domestic law provisions on 29\u00a0January 2004. The Court has already found in several cases that, since the interpretation of the relevant domestic law post-dated the initial judgment, it did not justify the quashing (see Yerogova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a033). Having regard to the facts of the present application, the Court sees no reason to distinguish it from the previous cases and finds that by granting the pension authority\u2019s request to set aside the final judgment of 10\u00a0June 2002 the Town Court failed to respect the principle of legal certainty.",
