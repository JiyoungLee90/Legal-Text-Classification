The applicant in that case had raised the issue before both the domestic courts and this Court under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01. However, the Court decided ex officio to communicate the complaint under Article 7 as well, and eventually found a violation of Article 7 and decided that it was not necessary to examine the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1. That judgment was made public in January 2013, and just after that judgment the applicant in the present case (who had lodged constitutional redress proceedings in 2010, relying on Article 6, as in Camilleri, cited above) attempted to amend his claim before the domestic constitutional jurisdictions to also include Article 7. His request was rejected; however, his claim about the same matter falling under Article 6 of the Convention was maintained and rejected summarily. The Court need not comment on the domestic courts\u2019 decision to reject the applicant\u2019s request, as in any event it considers that, in the present case, the complaint, whether under Article 6 or Article 7, arises out of the same facts and is based on the same arguments related to the risk of arbitrariness in the Attorney General\u2019s decision (see, mutatis mutandis, Gatt, cited above, \u00a7\u00a024).

However, the Court considers that the absence of such an example is not determinative, particularly in the light of the paucity of the examples put forward by the Government.

Thus, the law did not determine with any degree of precision the circumstances in which a particular punishment bracket applied. An insoluble problem was posed by fixing different minimum (and maximum) penalties. The Attorney General had in effect an unfettered discretion to decide which minimum (and maximum) penalty would be applicable with respect to the same offence. The decision was inevitably subjective and left room for arbitrariness, particularly given the lack of procedural safeguards. Such a decision could not be seen only or mainly in terms of abuse of power, even if \u2013 as the Government suggested, without substantiating their view \u2013 it might be subject to judicial review (see paragraph 38 above).",

Subsequently, following the judgment of the Court in Camilleri v. Malta (no. 42931/10, 22 January 2013), the applicant asked the courts to add a complaint under Article 7, claiming a lack of foreseeability. The national courts rejected the request to allow this additional complaint. This rejection was apparently based on Article 175 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure (Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta), according to which the power of a court to permit amendments to pleadings is limited to situations where such amendments do not affect the substance either of the action or of the defence on the merits of the case.",

In order to ensure the rational and fair conduct of proceedings, any reasonable legal system limits the possibilities of parties to modify or amend their claims. What is more, some legal systems expect claimants to specify the legal characterisation of their claims at the beginning of the proceedings, with the courts being bound by that legal characterisation. In itself, such an expectation is not incompatible with any Convention requirement. One should not forget that the facts of a case can never be entirely separated from the law and, vice versa, the law cannot be fully separated from the facts. When legally assessing a certain course of events over time, one has to identify the relevant facts in the light of the legal provisions. On the other hand, it is necessary to ascertain which legal provisions from the entire legal order might form the normative constituent elements of the case. In some instances this may prove to be a complicated operation, requiring gradual reflection on an event in the light of the legal provisions and vice versa. The normative constituent elements of the case and the relevant facts respectively form the premissa maior and premissa minor of the legal syllogism, allowing for a conclusion as to their correspondence.",

Only later, when all the pleadings of the parties had been concluded, did he seek leave to add a complaint alleging a lack of foreseeability. It is not unreasonable to consider this complaint to be a separate and new one, and therefore no longer permitted at such a late stage of the proceedings. On this point, it might be necessary to add that the applicant never complained that this particular refusal by the national courts violated any of his Convention rights. Furthermore, I do not believe that the national courts could be expected to address the issue of foreseeability in the Attorney General\u2019s discretion of their own motion, in the absence of the lack of a timely complaint by the applicant to that effect. In this connection, I would like to refer to a recent decision of our Court in the case of Caruana v. Malta (no. 56396/12, 15\u00a0May 2018). Since the applicant in that case had failed to submit that the legal provision in question was not precise or foreseeable, the Court held that there was no reason for it to delve further into the matter. If the Court, which frequently reiterates that it is master of the legal characterisation of the facts of a case, does not examine a particular issue from the point of view of foreseeability in the absence of a timely complaint by an applicant to that effect, I believe that no more should be expected from the national courts when examining the claims before them.",

In conclusion, I find it impossible to reject the Government\u2019s objection of nonexhaustion of domestic remedies.",

In this case the applicant could not have had any doubt that he would be tried by jury. Article 7 has to be applied to the concrete and particular circumstances of the case and not in a general way. Such cases of industrial-scale cultivation of drugs could even be considered as res ipsa loquitur cases, just like the crime of murder which is never tried summarily.

The applicant wrongly indicated that Mr Bonnici was tried before a Magistrate\u2019s Court, whereas in fact he was tried before the Criminal Court, and from that mistaken premise he deduced and claimed (under the heading \u201cJust Satisfaction\u201d) that he had spent four years and six months longer in detention than Mr Bonnici, who was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of seven years and six months, and accordingly claimed 85,000 euros. The applicant therefore alleged that it was the jurisdiction of the court which made the difference and wrongful use of the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. However, it is clear that both were judged by the Criminal Court and the difference concerned the quantity of the illegal substance and the fact that Mr Bonnici admitted the charges in the initial stages of the proceedings and not because of arbitrary use of the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. So it cannot be said, on the basis of the mistaken premise made by applicant, that there was a breach of Article 7.",
