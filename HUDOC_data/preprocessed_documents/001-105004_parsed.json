However, it considers it unnecessary further to examine this question for the following reason. In the recent judgment of S\u0142awomir Musia\u0142 v. Poland (no.\u00a028300/06, ECHR 2009... (extracts)), it held as follows: \u201cThe Court is also mindful of the fact that at the relevant time the governors of detention facilities, in which the applicant was held, acknowledged officially the existence of overcrowding and made decisions to reduce the statutory minimum standard of three square metres per person ... In these circumstances, it cannot be said that any attempt by the applicant to seek with the penitentiary authorities an improvement of the conditions of his detention would give sufficient prospects of a successful outcome\u201d (\u00a7\u00a075). In the present case, the authorities acknowledged that the Hungarian prisons were overcrowded and that in the material period the average rate of occupancy of Budapest Prison was 150% (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). Consequently, the Court observes that, in the circumstances of the present case, the remedies referred to by the Government were not capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint. Having regard to the above considerations, the Court dismisses the Government\u2019s preliminary objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court also considers that the instant complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention. It further finds that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.",

Furthermore, in considering whether treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a03, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3.

Measures depriving a person of his or her liberty may often involve such elements. Thus, under this provision, the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject the individual to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, the prisoner\u2019s health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kud\u0142a v.

It observes by contrast that the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cthe CPT\u201d) considers 4 m2 living space per inmate an acceptable minimum standard in multi-occupancy cells (see, for example, in respect of other Hungarian prisons, paragraphs 65 and 80 of the Report to the Hungarian Government on the visit to Hungary carried out by the CPT from 24 March to 2 April 2009). The Court therefore finds that the applicant\u2019s detention under cramped conditions at Budapest Prison failed to respect basic human dignity and must therefore have been prejudicial to his physical and mental state (see, mutatis mutandis, Savenkovas v. Lithuania, no. 871/02, \u00a7\u00a7 81-82, 18 November 2008).

In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.
