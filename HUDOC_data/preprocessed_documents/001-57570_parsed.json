If, as the Commission would appear to consider (paragraph 64 of the report), paragraph 2 of Article 6 (art. 6-2) merely laid down a guarantee to be respected by the courts in the conduct of legal proceedings, its requirements would in practice overlap with the duty of impartiality imposed in paragraph 1 (art. 6-1). Above all, the national legislature would be free to strip the trial court of any genuine power of assessment and deprive the presumption of innocence of its substance, if the words \"according to law\" were construed exclusively with reference to domestic law. Such a situation could not be reconciled with the object and purpose of Article 6 (art. 6), which, by protecting the right to a fair trial and in particular the right to be presumed innocent, is intended to enshrine the fundamental principle of the rule of law (see, inter alia, the Sunday Times judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 34, para. 55).",

Several decisions to which the Government referred concerned other provisions, principally Article 399 which covers \"persons with an interest in the offence\" and not \"persons in possession\" (see paragraph 19 above), or postdate the contested conviction. On the other hand, one of them concerns Article 392 para. 1 and dates from 11 October 1972. It confirms, in passing, the trial court\u2019s unfettered power of assessment with regard to \"evidence adduced by the parties before it\" (Court of Cassation, Criminal Chamber, Abadie, Bulletin no. 280, p. 723). The Court for its part would cite a judgment of 25 January 1982, also concerning Article 392 para. 1. Reference is made therein to the absence of \"a case of force majeure\" resulting from \"an event responsibility for which is not attributable to the perpetrator of the offence and which it was absolutely impossible for him to avoid\", such as \"the absolute impossibility ... of knowing the contents of [a] package\" (Court of Cassation, Criminal Chamber, Massamba Mikissi and Dzekissa, Gazette du Palais, 1982, jurisprudence, pp. 404-405). A similar formula may be found in the judgment which the Court of Cassation delivered in the present case on 21 February 1983 (see paragraph 15 above). The Paris Court of Appeal repeated it in its Guzman judgment of 12 July 1985, which was cited by the Government. More recently, it has held that \"the specific character of [customs] offences does not deprive ... the offender of every possibility of defence since ... the person in possession may exculpate himself by establishing a case of force majeure\" and, with regard to third parties with an interest in the offence, such \"interest ... cannot be imputed to a person who has acted out of necessity or as a result of unavoidable error\" (10 March 1986, Chen Man Ming and Others, Gazette du Palais, 1986, jurisprudence, pp. 442-444).",

This attitude appeared to the court to establish the applicant\u2019s \"bad faith\" and it considered that there were \"presumptions ... sufficiently serious, precise and concordant to justify a conviction\" (see paragraph 13 above). It is true that the Bobigny court tried the criminal offence stricto sensu (Articles L. 626, L. 627 and L. 630-1 of the Public Health Code) and the customs offence together, which somewhat reduces the relevance of this decision for the purposes of the present case.",

On the first head, it acquitted Mr Salabiaku, giving him the benefit of the doubt, and in so doing showed scrupulous respect for the presumption of innocence. On the other hand, as regards the second head, it upheld the conviction handed down by the Bobigny court, and did so without contradicting itself because the facts and the action incriminated under this head were different. It noted in particular that he \"went through customs with the trunk and declared to the customs officers that it was his property\". It added that he could not \"plead unavoidable error because he was warned by an Air Za\u00efre official ... not to take possession of the trunk unless he was sure that it belonged to him, particularly because he would have to open it in customs. Thus, before declaring himself to be the owner of the trunk and thereby affirming his possession within the meaning of the law, he could have checked it to ensure that it did not contain any prohibited goods\". The court inferred therefrom that \"by failing to do so and by having in his possession a trunk containing 10 kg of herbal and seed cannabis, he committed the customs offence of smuggling prohibited goods\" (see paragraph 14 above).",

They inferred from the \"fact of possession a presumption which was not subsequently rebutted by any evidence of an event responsibility for which could not be attributed to the perpetrator of the offence or which he would have been unable to avoid\" (see paragraph 15 above). Moreover, as the Government said, the national courts identified in the circumstances of the case a certain \"element of intent\", even though legally they were under no obligation to do so in order to convict the applicant.",

The Court therefore finds no ground for departing, on the basis of the general principle of a fair trial, from the conclusion which it has reached in considering specifically the presumption of innocence. For the rest, the evidence adduced does not in its view disclose any failure to comply with the various requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).
