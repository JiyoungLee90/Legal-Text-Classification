It noted that the County Court had examined the case in simplified proceedings (lihtmenetlus). In such circumstances, the Court of Appeal could only accept an appeal for examination if the County Court in its judgment had granted leave to appeal or a provision of substantive or procedural law had clearly been incorrectly applied or it was clear that the evidence had been wrongly assessed and this could have significantly influenced the court\u2019s ruling. The County Court had not granted leave to appeal. The Court of Appeal did not find that in the case at hand it could be said that the County Court had clearly incorrectly applied a provision of substantive or procedural law or clearly wrongly assessed the evidence or breached the right to be heard (\u00e4rakuulamise \u00f5igus). The County Court had examined the matter under Article 405 \u00a7 1 of the CCP in simplified proceedings. Pursuant to Article\u00a0405 \u00a7 1 of the CCP, in such proceedings the court had to guarantee that the fundamental rights and freedoms and the essential procedural rights of the parties were observed and that the parties were heard (kohus kuulab menetlusosalise \u00e4ra) if they so requested. However, for that it was not necessary for a court hearing (kohtuistung) to be conducted. On 8 July 2010 the County Court had ruled that the case was to be examined in written proceedings and had given the parties an opportunity to make written submissions. The applicant had thus been guaranteed an opportunity to present his position to the court. The Court of Appeal further noted that the applicant had not objected under Article 333 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the CCP to the County Court\u2019s decision of 8 July 2010 whereby the court had ordered that the case be examined in simplified proceedings and requested the applicant to make his submissions in writing. Pursuant to Article 333 \u00a7 3 and Article 652 \u00a7 6 of the CCP (see paragraphs 19 and 20 below) the Court of Appeal could not therefore consider these arguments in the appellate proceedings. The Court of Appeal concluded that there was no legal basis for it to accept the applicant\u2019s appeal for examination.",

The amount of the claim against the applicant was lower than 2,000 EUR and the court had therefore decided to examine it in simplified proceedings in accordance with Article 405 \u00a7 1 of the CCP. In simplified proceedings the courts did not have to observe all the procedural rules and could waive the holding of a court hearing under Article 405 \u00a7 1(7) of the CCP. The aim of Article 405 of the CCP was to bring about more effective administration of justice by simplifying and speeding up proceedings in cases involving claims for modest amounts. The Government pointed out that the domestic regulation of simplified proceedings had been drafted on the basis of European Parliament and Council Regulation No. 861/2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure (see paragraph 21 above).",

The court had decided not to summon the witnesses and had instructed the defendant to submit his additional submissions in writing. The Government explained that the court could also hear a person by way of written submissions, in particular in the context of simplified proceedings conducted in writing. In the present case the applicant\u2019s personal character and lifestyle were not relevant to the subject matter of the case. The only behavioural aspect to which the applicant had repeatedly referred in the course of the proceedings was his allegedly having acted in self-defence when committing the crime. The fact that Harju County Court had decided to adjudicate the case in written proceedings clearly reflected the court\u2019s belief that holding a hearing to ensure the personal appearance of the parties was not necessary. The exchange of procedural documents between the applicant and the plaintiff and the possibility granted to the applicant to make additional written submissions constituted hearing him (\u00e4rakuulamine). The Government pointed out that the applicant had not made any submissions within 30 days of receipt of the ruling of 8 July 2010, and after the deadline had passed the court was justified in presuming that the parties agreed to the use of the written procedure. The applicant had had the opportunity and obligation under Article 333 \u00a7\u00a01 of the CCP to submit an objection against the ruling with regard to the decision of Harju County Court of 8\u00a0July 2010 to continue adjudication of the case in written proceedings.

The Court recognises at the outset that member States may find it useful to introduce a simplified civil procedure for the adjudication of small claims. Such a simplified procedure may be in the interest of the parties as it facilitates access to justice, reduces the costs related to the proceedings and accelerates the resolution of disputes. The Court also accepts that member States may decide that such a simplified civil procedure should normally be conducted via written proceedings \u2013 unless an oral hearing is considered necessary by a court or a party requests it \u2013 and that the court may refuse such a request. Such a simplified civil procedure for the adjudication of small claims must of course comply with the principles of a fair trial as guaranteed in Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0 1. The domestic provisions and their application in the domestic courts must therefore ensure respect for the right to a fair trial, in particular when deciding on the necessity of an oral hearing, on the means of taking evidence, and the extent to which evidence is to be taken (see also recital 9 in the preamble to the European Parliament and Council regulation No.\u00a0861/2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure (see paragraph 21 above)). In this context the Court also reiterates the obligation under Article 6 \u00a7 1 for the domestic courts to give reasons not only for judgments but also for major procedural decisions issued in the course of the proceedings (see, among others, Suominen v. Finland, no. 37801/97, 1\u00a0July 2003, which concerned the reasoning underlying a decision not to admit certain evidence, and M\u00fa\u010dkov\u00e1 v.

Austria, no. 49616/06, \u00a7 19, 10 December 2009 and the case-law cited therein).

However, it does not appear that the domestic court considered other alternative procedural options (such as the use of modern communications technology) with a view to ensuring the applicant\u2019s right to be heard orally. Moreover, the domestic court apparently did not even explain to the applicant that it had decided to replace hearing him orally with allowing him the opportunity to make written submissions (see paragraph 16 above regarding the appellate court\u2019s explanation that for hearing the applicant no court hearing had to be conducted).",
