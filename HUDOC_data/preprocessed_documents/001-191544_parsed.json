Defence counsel argued, firstly, that the search had been conducted without a judicial warrant or the authorisation of a senior investigator, in violation of the relevant provisions of the CCP. In support of his argument he referred to the fact that the decision to conduct a personal search had not been duly signed by a senior investigator, had not indicated the exact time at which it had been issued, and had included detailed information about the identity of the applicant, including his name and address, and the type of narcotic substance, heroin, that he allegedly had on his person, facts which had become known to the police only after the arrest and search of the applicant. Moreover, he alleged that the decision had not been read out to the applicant before the search. Secondly, in his evidence before the first and secondinstance courts, U.K. had unequivocally claimed that he had not witnessed the personal search of the applicant and had been forced to sign certain documents at the police station. As for the second witness, L.Ts. had lied about his prior working experience with the police and was thus unreliable. In support of his arguments, the defence submitted a letter from the Ministry of the Interior, according to which L.Ts. had been working for the Ministry in 1996. Thirdly, the defence emphasised that the friends of the applicant had consistently maintained that the latter had not been searched at the place of his arrest. The defence thus requested that the search report be excluded as an inadmissible piece of evidence, in accordance with Article 111 of the CCP.",

Georgia, no. 37048/04, \u00a7 112, 13 January 2009, with further reference therein). Moreover, as disclosed by the case file, and as the applicant maintained and the Government did not dispute, the applicant was not served with the decision to conduct a personal search in urgent circumstances (see paragraphs 31 and 32 above). Consequently, he cannot be criticised for not appealing against it (see Giorgi Nikolaishvili, cited above, \u00a7 112; see also Baisuev and Anzorov v.

The Court notes, however, that the defence in its concluding remark before the trial court requested dismissal of the report as null and void (see paragraph 25 above). Furthermore, the inadmissibility request was duly voiced before the appellate court, which had full power to review the case on points of law and facts (see paragraph 31 above). Hence, the applicant could have reasonably expected that the alleged breach of his rights would be remedied. In this connection, the fact that the applicant failed to lodge a separate appeal against the decision of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal of 18 November 2005 (see paragraph 32 above) is irrelevant, given that the applicant\u2019s main grievance was duly brought to the attention of the Supreme Court in the appeal on points of law (see paragraph 34 above).",

Thus, the alleged negative impact of the above-mentioned judicial procedure remained unsubstantiated. In this connection, the Government again reiterated their inadmissibility argument, claiming that the applicant could have challenged the decision to conduct his personal search in urgent circumstances on the basis of Article 234 of the CCP, before the relevant court had legalised its results on 5 July 2004. Furthermore, according to the Government, the fact that the applicant had not been served with a copy of that decision prior to the personal search was irrelevant. Indeed, he had never voiced any grievances in this respect during the pre-trial investigation or before the first-instance court.",

The Court notes, however, that the decision, without referring to any relevant factual circumstances, simply consisted of a pre-typed text with the applicant\u2019s full name added by hand and a note that he was suspected of unlawful drugs possession (see paragraph 8 above). It explicitly identified the applicant by his name and address, whereas the police officers who conducted the search on the basis of that decision consistently claimed throughout the domestic proceedings that the operational information at their disposal before the search had simply stated that a certain person at a certain address had been under the influence of drugs (see paragraphs 22-28 above). Furthermore, the decision was not substantiated as it did not give the exigent circumstances that allegedly necessitated an urgent search without a prior judicial warrant (see in this respect Article 290 \u00a7\u00a03 of the CCP as cited paragraph 37 above). It appears that the concrete circumstances (information) triggering the urgent search of the applicant in the absence of a prior judicial warrant were not identified at a later stage either, as the criminal case file compiled against the applicant did not contain the relevant inquiry file and/or the operational information (see in this respect paragraphs 68 and 69 below). The relevant police officers also failed to shed light on the matter (see for their rather general and inconsistent statements paragraphs 12, 22 and 28 above).

Furthermore, the Court cannot but conclude that the review proceedings in substance appeared to be inadequate. All that the judge had at his disposal when deciding on the postfactum legalisation of the applicant\u2019s personal search was a handwritten note from one of the police officers, Sh.Sh., concerning the circumstances of the search, and the statements of the two attesting witnesses who allegedly attended the search (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above).

As to the police officers, the Court notes that they were at the origin of the proceedings against the applicant and belonged to the authority which initiated them, so they had an interest in the outcome of the prosecution. Their interest was particularly obvious in view of the applicant\u2019s allegation that they had planted the drugs on him. Nonetheless, their testimony was automatically taken as objective in contrast with, for example, that of the applicants\u2019 friends, which was dismissed as subjective and not credible (see paragraph 26 above). The Court notes that the statements of the police officers were at variance with the decision to order a search of the applicant without a judicial warrant (see paragraph 61 above). That discrepancy was, however, simply ignored by the domestic courts.",

The opposite is the case with respect to the fees of a representative who, without waiving them, has simply taken no steps to pursue their payment or has deferred it. The fees payable to a representative under a conditional-fee agreement are actually incurred only if that agreement is enforceable in the respective jurisdiction (see, Merabishvili v.
