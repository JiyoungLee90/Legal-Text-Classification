In the instant case, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation explicitly acknowledged that the applicant\u2019s right to have her case heard by an impartial court had been infringed, quashed the decisions taken in the case and referred the case to a court situated in a different region. Furthermore, it was not disputed that the subsequent proceedings fully complied with the guarantees of a fair trial. Therefore, having regard to the contents of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 7 October 2005, the Court finds that the national authorities have acknowledged, and then afforded redress for, the alleged breach of the Convention (see, for similar reasoning, Davidchuk v.

It is true that when the case was pending before the courts, it was examined without any major delays. However, the proceedings were delayed by the repeated referrals of the case for fresh examination to the first-instance court either by the appeal or the supervisory-review courts. Thus, the proceedings were split into several parts which were spread over almost seven years. In this respect the Court reiterates that the Convention and its Protocols must be interpreted as guaranteeing rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and illusory. The right to have one\u2019s claim examined within a reasonable time would be devoid of all sense if domestic courts examined a case numerous times, by shifting it from one court to another, even if at the end the accumulated length of proceedings did not appear particularly excessive. Therefore, the fact that in the present case the aggregated length of the proceedings does not appear very long at first glance does not absolve the domestic authorities of their responsibility to account for the reasonableness of the length of proceedings. The Court recalls that it is incumbent on respondent States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet the requirements of Article\u00a06 of the Convention, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, \u00a7 129, 8\u00a0June 2006).",

In that respect the Court notes that since the beginning of the proceedings the applicant had lodged several requests with the Supreme Court of the  in which she asked for her case to be referred to a different court to guarantee her right to have her case examined by an independent and impartial tribunal.

In the first of them, the courts held that the applicant had abused her rights when she refused all positions offered to her and on that ground they dismissed her claims. However, that decision was quashed by a supervisory review court which indicated that dismissal of the applicant had been unlawful and referred the case for a fresh examination to the first-instance court. In the new proceedings the first-instance court did not implement the instructions of the higher court and that failure resulted in another round of proceedings. Although the Court is not in a position to analyse the juridical quality of the domestic courts\u2019 decisions, it considers that, since the remittal of cases for re-examination is frequently ordered as a result of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings may disclose a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see Wierciszewska v.\u00a0Poland, no. 41431/98, \u00a7 46, 25 November 2003; Matica v.
