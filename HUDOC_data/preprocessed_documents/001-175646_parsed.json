Accordingly, the Court has held that the mere possibility of reopening a criminal case is prima facie compatible with the Convention (see Nikitin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 50178/99, \u00a7\u00a7 55-57, ECHR 2004VIII). However, it has emphasised that higher courts\u2019 power of review should only be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, and not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Bujni\u0163a v.

Spain [GC], no.\u00a030544/96, \u00a7 26, ECHR 1999I). Without requiring a detailed answer to every argument advanced by the complainant, this obligation presupposes that parties to judicial proceedings can expect to receive a specific and explicit reply to the arguments which are decisive for the outcome of those proceedings (see, among other authorities, Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30, Series A no. 303A, and Higgins and Others v. France, 19\u00a0February 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 42-43, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I). Moreover, in cases relating to interference with rights secured under the Convention, the Court seeks to establish whether the reasons provided for decisions given by the domestic courts are automatic or stereotypical (see, mutatis mutandis, Paradiso and Campanelli v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a025358/12, \u00a7\u00a0210, ECHR 2017). Furthermore, the Convention does not require jurors to give reasons for their decision and Article 6 does not preclude a defendant from being tried by a lay jury even where reasons are not given for the verdict. Nevertheless, for the requirements of a fair trial to be satisfied, the public, and above all the accused, must be able to understand the verdict that has been given (see Lhermitte v. Belgium [GC], no. 34238/09, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and\u00a067, ECHR 2016).",

As far as criminal proceedings are concerned, this is because, as paragraph 61 of the judgment expresses it, \u201cArticle\u00a06 is not applicable to applications to reopen proceedings, given that a person who, having been convicted with final effect, submits such an application is not \u2018charged with a criminal offence\u2019 within the meaning of that Article\u201d.

The Court, applying the principles stated a few months earlier in the Grand\u00a0Chamber judgment in Bochan (no. 2), confirmed its adhesion to the normal rule of exclusion of extraordinary review procedures from the ambit of Article 6, but noted that \u201cnew proceedings, after the reopening has been ordered, can be regarded as concerning the determination of a criminal charge\u201d (\u00a7 56 \u2013 emphasis added). The Ukrainian Supreme Court, by allowing the requests for review submitted by the applicant (in part) and the prosecutor (in full), and by excluding some evidence and then carrying out its own assessment of the remaining evidence, was considered by this Court to have been engaging in a full re-examination of the applicant\u2019s case, as in Bochan (no. 2), so as to lead to a new decision on the merits. Article 6 was held to be applicable by virtue of this fresh \u201cdetermination\u201d of the applicant\u2019s guilt on the basis of the evidence adduced (\u00a7\u00a7 55 and 56). One could re-phrase this finding by saying that, in accordance with the relevant domestic legislation, a retrial of the criminal case was carried out by the Ukrainian Supreme Court when adjudicating on the extraordinary appeal available to the applicant. The present judgment (at paragraph 63) is misleading insofar as it may be read as suggesting that it was \u201cthe upholding, after review proceedings, of a conviction which breached the right to a fair trial\u201d that made Article 6 applicable.",

The argument that Article\u00a0449 \u00a7 1 (g) has some traits in common with ordinary cassation appeals is not only exaggerated, but would apply generally to extraordinary review procedures in most countries empowering convicted defendants to seek the reopening of terminated criminal proceedings \u2013 thereby overturning by stealth the well-established existing case-law on this point.

This complicated issue is dealt with in the further complicating context of the non-execution of a Court\u2019s judgment which included a retrial clause.

This was known as the Gen\u00e7el clause. A similar stance was adopted under Article 41 in a case against Italy where the finding of a breach of the fairness guarantees contained in Article 6 was not related to the lack of independence or impartiality of the domestic courts, but to the infringement of his right to participate in his trial. Subsequently, the retrial clause was named as the Gen\u00e7el-Somogyi clause.

For example, in Lungoci, the Court ordered in the operative part that that the respondent State reopened the domestic proceedings within six months of the date on which the judgment becomes final, if the applicant so requested. In Maksimov, the Court held in the operative part that \u201cthe respondent State must take all measures to reopen the cassation appeal proceedings provided by the Transitional law\u201d In other cases, the Court ordered in the operative part not the reopening of the case, but already the legal effect intended as \u201cthe most appropriate form of redress\u201d, like for example the full restitution of the applicant\u2019s title to the flat and the annulment of her eviction order. In this type of cases, the Court imposed under Article 41 the revocation of the domestic courts\u2019 eviction order in conjunction with the award of damages. If the flat is no longer the State\u2019s property, or if it has been otherwise alienated, the respondent State should ensure that the applicant receives an \u201cequivalent flat\u201d.

Accordingly, whenever possible, preference must be given to just satisfaction over reopening the domestic proceedings. This rule of subsidiarity of reopening contradicts Article 41 of the Convention itself. According to this provision, the respondent State should do its best to provide full reparation (and not \u201cpartial reparation\u201d) for a declared Convention violation, preferably by way of restitutio in integrum, which means wiping out the legal and material consequences of its wrongful act by re-establishing the situation that would exist if that act had not been committed, and for that purpose by reopening the domestic proceedings that led to the wrongful act. Compensation can certainly be added to restitution insofar as damage is not made good by restitution, but not set as an alternative to it, and even less as a preferable alternative. To put it in logical terms, the Recommendation reverses the logical order of preference established by Article 41 of the Convention.

As a matter of law, it is erroneous to argue that in Portuguese law the extraordinary appeal for the reopening of a criminal case has \u201csome features in common with an appeal on points of law\u201d. They differ in terms of the admissibility requirements, locus standi, time-limits, formalities, the competent court, the remit of the court and the appellant\u2019s procedural guarantees, as the Government themselves rightly pointed out. Ordinary appeals (recursos ordin\u00e1rios) and extraordinary appeals (recursos extraordin\u00e1rios) are regulated, respectively, in Title I and II of Book IX of the Criminal Procedure Code. There are common provisions applicable to both ordinary appeals to the court of appeal and ordinary appeals to the Supreme Court (Articles 399 to 426-A), but there are no common provisions applicable to both ordinary appeals and extraordinary appeals. They are regulated separately, in different Titles of the Code. Article 448 foresees the subsidiary application of the provisions on ordinary appeals to the appeal for the uniformity of the case-law, but there is no equivalent norm for an appeal to reopen a case. Thus, it is wrong to maintain that in Portuguese law the extraordinary remedy of Article 449 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is an \u201cextension\u201d of the previous proceedings concluded by the judgment of 19 December 2007. The Supreme Court itself has always held that the extraordinary remedy for the reopening of a case is not an \u201cappeal in disguise\u201d or a \u201csubstitute of the ordinary appeals\u201d and therefore it should not be \u201cpermissive to the extent of trivialising and consequently underestimating reopening\u201d as if it were a mere extension of the previous proceedings.",

I would like to emphasise the importance of a\u00a0more nuanced approach to the difference between the Court\u2019s straightforward \u201corders\u201d to reopen the proceedings, actually issued to the domestic judicial authorities, and its less assertive suggestions that such reopening might be the (most) appropriate or even the only form of redress of the Convention violation (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 2, 8, 18 and 57 of Judge Pinto de Albuquerque\u2019s opinion), which, not amounting to \u201corders\u201d in the proper sense of the word, only indirectly compel the domestic judicial authorities to reopen the proceedings in order to meet, at last, the requirements of the Convention. Nevertheless, this difference in our approaches as to the Court\u2019s \u201cdictating\u201d and \u201cengineering\u201d is not really relevant to the present case.

Equally, I consider that the majority is right in its conclusions regarding the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Apart from the reasons given in this respect in the judgment of the Court, I believe that in the present case, the examination of the request for a reopening of criminal proceedings cannot be entirely separated from the assessment of the law and facts applicable to the initial determination of a criminal charge against the applicant. In this context, the Supreme Court was expected to re-evaluate the findings of fact and the application of the relevant law in the initial criminal proceedings in the light of the Court\u2019s judgment. The Supreme Court considered that the applicant\u2019s conviction was not irreconcilable with the judgment of the Court and that no serious doubts could be raised regarding the applicant\u2019s condemnation.

In the Court\u2019s view, this question could not be resolved without direct examination of the applicant\u2019s testimony (see paragraphs 33 and 34 of the judgment). In line with those arguments, it is clear that the violation in question could only be entirely set aside by reopening the proceedings before the Court of Appeal, which had to include a hearing of the applicant.",
