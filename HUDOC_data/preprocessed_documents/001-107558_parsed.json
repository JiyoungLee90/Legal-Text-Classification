In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty at issue (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2002IV; Waite v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 53236/99, \u00a7 65, 10 December 2002; and Kafkaris v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, \u00a7 117, ECHR 2008...).

The causal link required by sub-paragraph (a) might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release or to re-detain was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the initial decision (by a sentencing court) or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. In those circumstances, a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 (compare Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, \u00a7 40; Eriksen, cited above, \u00a7 78; and Weeks, cited above, \u00a7 49).\u201d",

However, under Article 68c \u00a7 3, second sentence, of the Criminal Code, the four-year supervision of conduct was still running even at the time of the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in June 2006, as the applicant had been detained since June 1995 and the time spent in detention did not count towards the duration of the supervision of conduct (see paragraph 33 above).
