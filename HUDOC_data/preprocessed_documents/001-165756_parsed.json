As a result, on 28 July 2011 the Court of Appeal allowed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the High Court\u2019s judgment. However, as the Secretary of State had continued to detain the applicant after the relevant policy had been taken into account (from 29 April 2010 onwards), the court was satisfied that she would have been detained during the earlier period even if the policy had been considered. Moreover, having assessed all the evidence in the case \u2013 in particular, the risk of the applicant reoffending, self-harming, or absconding \u2013 the court concluded that it had been open to a reasonable decision-maker to detain the applicant in all the circumstances of the case.

In his leading judgment, which was accepted by the majority of the court, Lord\u00a0Dyson found that in assessing the reasonableness of the length of the period of detention, the risk of re-offending would be a relevant factor. In this regard, he noted that if a person re-offended, there was a risk that he would abscond either to evade arrest or, if he was arrested and prosecuted, that he would receive a custodial sentence. Either way, his re-offending would impede his deportation. He also considered that the pursuit of legal challenges by the Foreign National Prisoner could be relevant. However, he considered the weight to be given to the time spent on appeals to be factsensitive. In this regard, he noted that much more weight should be given to detention during a period when the detained person was pursuing a meritorious appeal than to detention during a period when he was pursuing a hopeless one.",

On the contrary, he considered it necessary to distinguish between cases where the return to the country of origin was possible and cases where it was not. Where return was not possible for reasons extraneous to the person detained, the fact that he was not willing to return voluntarily could not be held against him since his refusal had no causal effect. If return was possible, but the detained person was not willing to go, it would be necessary to consider whether or not he had issued proceedings challenging his deportation. If he had done so, it would be entirely reasonable that he should remain in the United Kingdom pending the determination of those proceedings, unless they were an abuse of process, and his refusal to return voluntarily would be irrelevant. If there were no outstanding legal challenges, the refusal to return voluntarily should not be seen as a trump card which enabled the Secretary of State to continue to detain until deportation could be effected, otherwise the refusal would justify as reasonable any period of detention, however long.",

One such principle established in the case-law is that detention will be \u201carbitrary\u201d where, despite complying with the letter of domestic law, there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see, for example, Bozano v.

The applicant additionally claims that her detention from 8 August 2008 to 22\u00a0July 2010 was not \u201clawful\u201d, either because it would have been in breach of the published policy (from 8 August 2008 to 28 April 2010) or because it was in breach of the published policy (from 29 April 2010 to 22 July 2010). The national courts \u2013 that is to say, both the Administrative Court and then the Court of Appeal \u2013 expressly considered and rejected this argument, finding that at all times the applicant either was or could have been detained \u201clawfully\u201d under the policy (see paragraphs 38 and 45 above). As is well-established in the Court\u2019s case-law, whilst it is not normally the Court\u2019s task to review the observance of domestic law by the national authorities, it is otherwise in relation to matters where, as here, the Convention refers directly back to that law; for, in such matters, disregard of the domestic law entails a breach of the Convention with the consequence that the Court can and should exercise a certain power of review. However, the logic of the system of safeguards established by the Convention sets limits upon the scope of the review. It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply the domestic law, even in those fields where the Convention \u201cincorporates\u201d the rules of that law: the national authorities are, in the nature of things, particularly qualified to settle the issues arising in this connection (see Winterwerp v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 46, as confirmed in multiple other authorities, such as Creanga v.

In the recent case of J.N. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 90-93, the Court expressly rejected this argument. In doing so, it found that, despite the absence of fixed time-limits and/or automatic judicial review, the system of immigration detention was sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application because it permitted the detainee to challenge the lawfulness and Convention compliance of her ongoing detention at any time. In considering any such challenge, the domestic courts were required to consider the reasonableness of each individual period of detention based entirely on the particular circumstances of that case, applying a test similar to \u2013 indeed, modelled on \u2013 that required by Article 5 \u00a7 1(f) in the context of \u201carbitrariness\u201d (the Hardial Singh test \u2013 see paragraph 54 above).",

Consequently, the principal question for the Court to consider is whether, at any time between 8 August 2008 (when her criminal sentence ended \u2013 see paragraph 16 above) to 22 July 2010 (the date on which her first application for judicial review was heard by the Administrative Court \u2013 see paragraph\u00a037 above), the applicant\u2019s detention could be said to have been \u201carbitrary\u201d. Generally speaking, as recalled above (at paragraphs 85-87), detention will be arbitrary where there has been bad faith on the part of the authorities, where detention is not closely connected to the grounds relied on by the authorities, where the place and conditions of detention are not appropriate for its purpose, or where the length of the detention exceeds that reasonably required for the purpose pursued.",

The authorities considered whether she should have been transferred to hospital for compulsory psychiatric treatment but found that there was insufficient medical evidence to satisfy the requirements for a compulsory transfer (see paragraph 25 above). The national courts subsequently reviewed all of the medical evidence and concluded that the authorities\u2019 decision not to transfer the applicant to a hospital had been one which was reasonably open to them (see paragraphs 38 and 45 above). In view of the conflicting nature of the available medical evidence, it would not be appropriate for this Court to now find that the national administrative and judicial authorities should have come to a different conclusion.",

Nevertheless, insofar as any \u201cnecessity\u201d test can be said to exist, the Court accepts that it was met in the particular circumstances of this case. First, it observes that pursuant to the Secretary of State\u2019s published policy on immigration detention, \u201cwherever possible, alternatives to detention should be used\u201d (see paragraph 58 above). Although that policy, notably the provisions on persons suffering from mental illness, was not properly considered by the domestic authorities in respect of the period of detention from 8 August 2008 to 28 April 2010, both the Administrative Court and the Court of Appeal concluded that the applicant could have been detained lawfully under the policy during this period (and thereafter was detained lawfully under it) in view of the serious risk of her absconding, reoffending, or harming herself or others (see paragraphs 38 and 45 above). Similar conclusions can be found in the decisions rejecting the applicant\u2019s bail applications (see paragraphs 19-21 above). Secondly, the Court notes that limited \u2013 if any \u2013 alternatives to detention were available in the present case. Reporting requirements were generally not considered to be an effective safeguard against a risk of absconding, and electronic tagging was not recommended for detainees with mental health problems. Thirdly, it is apparent, in light of the medical evidence from mid-2009 onwards, that the applicant\u2019s release into the community would not have been possible as her mental health had significantly deteriorated and she was repeatedly selfharming (see paragraphs 24, 25, 30, 33 and 35 above). Consequently, the only options available to the authorities were to keep her in immigration detention or transfer her to a hospital for compulsory psychiatric treatment.",

Two days after she was notified of the Secretary of State\u2019s decision not to treat those representations as a fresh claim (see paragraph 27 above), the applicant sought permission to apply for judicial review of her ongoing detention. She also made further representations, which the Secretary of State, in a decision dated 26 April 2010, again refused to treat as a fresh asylum claim (see paragraph 27 above). Permission to apply for judicial review was granted five months after the application was lodged (on 14 May 2010 \u2013 see paragraph 37 above) and the hearing took place two months later on 22 July 2010 (see paragraph 38 above).",
