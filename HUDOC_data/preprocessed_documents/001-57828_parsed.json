From these facts we can only draw the same conclusion as the Commission that the judge in question gave the impression by his remarks that he wanted to read the entire public-law appeal statement, but had not been able to do so, although he regarded the document as being pertinent to the case. Mr Kraska had been able to make his submissions to the court, but there was a doubt as to whether his observations had been given proper consideration by one member of the court. Since these misgivings were based on the admission of the judge himself no other objective justification is in our opinion necessary.",
