The case originated in an application (no. 9235/11) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by fourteen applicants, on 15 December 2010. Their further personal details are set out in the appendix to this judgment.
The applicants were represented by Mr R. Savić, a lawyer practising in Bojnik. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Ms V. Rodić, being more recently substituted by their current Agent, Ms. N. Plavšić.
On 11 July 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
In 1961 the applicants’ predecessors were deprived of certain land in favour of the State.
On 26 January 2006 the Niš Municipal Court ordered PIK Niš (the debtor), a company predominantly comprised of socially-owned capital, as the end user of that land, to pay the applicants specified amounts on account of the compensation for the land in question.
On 25 October 2006 and 1 February 2007 respectively, upon the applicants’ request to that effect, the Niš Municipal Court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicants the enforcement costs. This judgment became both, final and enforceable by 16 August 2006.
Only one applicant, Mr Tomislav Đorđević, never lodged an enforcement request.
On 3 June 2009 the Niš Commercial Court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor (St. 10/09).
Only one applicant, Ms Milica Nikolić Jajčević, duly submitted her claims therein.
These insolvency proceedings are still ongoing.
On 2 March 2009, 31 August 2009 and 9 June 2010 respectively, all applicants lodged their constitutional appeals.
On 17 March 2011, 4 April 2012 and 23 May 2012, respectively, the Constitutional Court found a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in respect of all applicants, except Mr Tomislav Đorđević. However, the court did not award the applicants any damages, merely stating that the applicants “had not claimed non-pecuniary damages”.
The Constitutional Court dismissed the appeal in respect of one applicant, Mr Tomislav Đorđević, since he had failed to request enforcement of the judgment in question.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially-owned companies, as well as enforcement and insolvency proceedings, has been outlined in the cases of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06 et al., §§ 57-64 and 71-76, 15 January 2008, and Jovičić and Others v. Serbia (dec.), no. 37270/11, §§ 88-93, 15 October 2013. Furthermore, the case-law of the Constitutional Court in respect of socially-owned companies, together with the relevant provisions concerning constitutional redress has likewise been outlined in the admissibility decision in Marinković v. Serbia (dec.), no. 5353/11, §§ 26 -29 and 31-44, 29 January 2013, the judgment in Marinković v. Serbia, no. 5353/11, §§ 29-31, 22 October 2013, and the decision in Ferizović v. Serbia (dec.), no. 65713/13, §§ 12-17, 26 November 2013.
