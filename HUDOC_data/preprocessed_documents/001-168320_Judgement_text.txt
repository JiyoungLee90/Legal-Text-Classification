The case originated in applications against Russia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on the various dates indicated in the appended table.
The applications were communicated to the Russian Government (“the Government”).
Having studied the terms of the Government’s unilateral declarations submitted by them in respect of applications nos. 69323/13 and 76881/13, the Court considers that the proposed declarations do not provide a sufficient basis for concluding that respect for human rights does not require it to continue its examination of these applications. The declarations are therefore rejected.
The list of applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table.
The applicants complained under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention of the excessive length of their pre-trial detention. The applicant in case no. 29899/09 also complained under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention about the domestic courts’ failure to speedily examine his appeals against a number of detention orders.
