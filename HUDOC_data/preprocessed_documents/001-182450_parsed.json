Moreover, it was found to be the case that C was in control of the applicant and that she followed his orders. Among other things, the City Court referred to the fact that the applicant under the hearing had made herself unavailable to her counsel, but not to C. The City Court stated that the abduction risk might possibly be regarded differently when the criminal case against C had been heard by the court.

At least one member of the applicant\u2019s family had demonstrated that he was willing to carry out unlawful acts on behalf of C. The applicant\u2019s contact with her own family would therefore entail a significant risk of her and the children\u2019s whereabouts becoming known to C. The applicant had stated that she would be willing to break off all contact with her family if the children were returned to her. However, when at the same time she said that C was no longer a threat, it was difficult for the Board to envisage that she would be sufficiently motivated to make such a sacrifice. In the Board\u2019s assessment, C represented such a significant threat that the children would probably be at risk, even if the applicant managed to break off contact with her family. The Board referred to how C had over a period of several years demonstrated that he had both the means and the will to carry out his wishes. His rape of the applicant in March 2012, and the surveillance and death threats against her via an accomplice in the summer of 2013 showed that he had learnt nothing from the abduction in 2011.

She had wanted constant reassurance that she was to live in the foster home forever. This had improved considerably from approximately March 2013. Most of the anxiety had now gone, and the foster home interpreted this to mean that A now felt certain that she would not have to leave the foster home. A disliked events involving big crowds, such as end-of-term events. She had taken part in a leisure activity, but had stopped because she preferred to stay at home. The appointed psychologist, B.S., had stated before the Board that A had spontaneously told him during his visits that thieves had tried to steal her. The foster parents had told him later that A had not talked about this for a long time, and that they never talked about the abduction with A. The expert\u2019s interpretation was that A still appeared to have memories of her abduction. He also assumed that she had memories of her parents\u2019 turbulent marriage, since she was nearly three years old at the time of her emergency placement.",

Gradually, the foster father had been allowed to get closer to her, first by sitting next to them while B sat on her foster mother\u2019s lap. Even at the time of the Board\u2019s decision, B had an extreme fear of losing her foster parents. In the autumn of 2013 the foster parents had gone away for the weekend. B had been to stay with an aunt who had children of the same age and whom B knew well and was fond of. The foster parents had prepared her thoroughly, telling her that they were going away for a few days, but that they would come back. When they had come to collect her, B had reacted with hysterical laughter that had turned into sobbing and crying. She had clung to her foster mother and repeated over and over again that they must never leave her again.

The expert witness in this case has stated that, in his general experience, a foster home relationship is not the preferable option for the long-term placement of children who go to the foster home before forming an attachment to a biological parent; in such cases, adoption is in the child\u2019s best interests.

It was moreover emphasised that decisions to remove parental authority must not be taken without first having carried out a thorough examination and consideration of the long-term consequences of alternative measures, based on the concrete circumstances of each case.",

Norway inadmissible (see Johansen v. Norway (dec.), 12750/02, 10 October 2002). The Supreme Court reiterated that the requirement that adoption be in the child\u2019s best interest, as set out in section 4-20 of the Child Welfare Act (see paragraph\u00a0114 above) implied that \u201cstrong reasons\u201d (\u201csterke grunner\u201d) must be present in order for a consent to adoption to be made contrary to the wish of the biological parents. In addition, the Supreme Court emphasised that a decision of this kind had to be made based on the concrete circumstances of each case, but also take account of general experience, such as experience from child-psychological or -psychiatric research. The Supreme Court examined the general principles in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights and concluded that domestic law was in conformity with those principles; an adoption could only be authorised where \u201cparticularly weighty reasons\u201d were present. The case was subsequently brought before the Court, which found no violation of Article 8 of the Convention in Aune, cited above, see \u00a7 37 of that judgment for a recapitulation of the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the general principles developed in the case-law of the Supreme Court and the Court.",

The family ties were protected by Article\u00a08 of the Convention and Article 102 of the Constitution. Also for the child, the adoption is an intrusive measure, which may, under Article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (see paragraph 122 below), accordingly only be decided when in his or her best interests. However, when there were decisive factors on the child\u2019s hand in favour of adoption, the parents\u2019 interests would have to yield, as had been provided by Article\u00a0104 of the Constitution and Article 3 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (ibid.). Reference was made to Aune, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066, where the Court had set out that an adoption may only be authorised when justified in \u201can overriding requirement pertaining to the child\u2019s best interests\u201d (see also paragraph 147 below), which corresponded to the standard of \u201cparticularly weighty reasons\u201d as set out by the Supreme Court in the judgment that had been scrutinised by the European Court of Human Rights in Aune (see paragraph 117 above).",

In the proposal it had been suggested that the child welfare authorities had developed a reluctance to propose adoptions in the aftermath of the Court\u2019s finding of a violation in Johansen, cited above, even though research had shown that it was in a child\u2019s best interest to be adopted rather than experiencing a continuous life in foster care until coming of age. The Supreme Court interpreted the document so as to emphasise that the child welfare authorities should ensure that adoption would actually be proposed where appropriate, but that the document did not imply that the legal threshold, drawn up by Article 8 of the Convention, had changed. The Supreme Court added that the general information from research on adoption was relevant to the concrete assessment of whether an adoption should be authorised in an individual case.",

The essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities (see, for example, Wagner and J.M.W.L. v.

In determining whether an interference was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, the Court will take into account that a margin of appreciation is left to the national authorities, whose decision remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention (see Paradiso and Campanelli, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0181).",

However, consideration of what is in the best interests of the child is in every case of crucial importance. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned, often at the very stage when care measures are being envisaged or immediately after their implementation. It follows from these considerations that the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities for the regulation of the care of children and the rights of parents whose children have been taken into local authority care, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation.",

When a considerable period of time has passed since the child was originally taken into public care, the interest of a child not to have his or her de facto family situation changed again may override the interests of the parents to have their family reunited. The Court thus recognises that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of taking a child into care. However, a stricter scrutiny is called for in respect of any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by the authorities on parental rights of access, and of any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between the parents and a young child are effectively curtailed (see K. and T. v.\u00a0Finland, cited above, \u00a7 155).",

Thus it is incumbent upon the Court to ascertain whether the domestic courts conducted an indepth examination of the entire family situation and of a whole series of factors, in particular of a factual, emotional, psychological, material and medical nature, and made a balanced and reasonable assessment of the respective interests of each person, with a constant concern for determining what would be the best solution for the child.

In the Court\u2019s view, there are no grounds to assume that these procedural issues in the previous care proceedings in 2011-2012 had consequences for the adoption proceedings in 2014-2015 or the case overall in such a manner that they require further examination by the Court when assessing the applicant\u2019s complaints against the removal of parental authority and adoption.",

Moreover, a review was inherent in the leave-to-appeal proceedings to the High Court and the Supreme Court\u2019s Committee on Leave to Appeal (see paragraphs\u00a0105-113 above).",

This conclusion to uphold the placement in care was based, inter alia, on the Board\u2019s view that the children were \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d (see paragraphs 65-68 above); the court-appointed expert\u2019s finding that removing the children from the foster home would constitute a serious trauma with the potential to do great harm, not least because of their vulnerability (see paragraph 95 above); and the fact that the children had not had any contact with the applicant since the abduction on 21 June 2011 \u2013 three years and three months earlier \u2013 and had no attachment to her at the time of its examination (see paragraph\u00a096 above). The eldest daughter A had been placed in her foster home when she was around three years old (see paragraph 69 above), and she was approximately seven years old when the domestic proceedings came to an end. The other child B had gone to her foster parents at about the age of one (see paragraph 67 above), and was around four and a half years old when the proceedings ended.",

The Court recalls that it has previously held that, when a considerable period of time has passed from a child originally being taken into care, the interests of the child in not having his or her de facto family situation changed again may override the interests of the parents to have their family reunited (see paragraph 150 above). In the instant case A and B had first been placed in care on an emergency basis in November 2010 (see paragraph\u00a020 above) and had not had any contact with the applicant since the abduction on 21 June 2011 (see, inter alia, paragraph 96 above). The Court adds at this point that there are no grounds for contesting the domestic authorities\u2019 assessment that A and B\u2019s backgrounds had made them particularly vulnerable with regard to experiencing anew broken relationships and, thus, that a removal from their foster parents would constitute a serious trauma with the potential to do great harm, as had been concluded by the appointed expert psychologist (see paragraph 95 above). This finding of a particular vulnerability was substantiated by facts \u2013 that are as such undisputed \u2013 namely their previous experiences of their violent father, their dramatic abduction and their broken relationships (see paragraphs\u00a065-68 and 90-92 above).",

It agreed with the expert that it was \u201ccompletely improbable that the parents [would] at any point in the future be in a position to make use of or exercise their parental responsibility\u201d. The situation was \u201cpermanent\u201d, and it was in the children\u2019s best interest that the foster parents be given parental responsibility for them. The children had no attachment to their mother but were so attached to their foster parents that it would be harmful to them to be removed. This was sufficient for the removal of parental authority, but the City Court nevertheless took into account that there was also a risk with respect to C and his family. The High Court reached the same conclusion (see paragraph 109). As regards the risk relating to C and his family, the Court has noted that the City Court found that this risk implied that visits from the applicant could in any event not be implemented, whichever security measures be put in place (see paragraph\u00a0102 above).",

This was particularly important to A and B because of their history, and the foster family already faced insecurity as they lived under a strict security regime because of the abduction risk. Offering A and B the higher degree of security that an adoption implied, compared with long-term foster care, was therefore \u201cespecially important\u201d (see paragraph 103 above).",

The factors motivating the domestic authorities were clearly the need to protect A and B and ensure that they could be brought up in a safe environment suited to their particular vulnerability, by the persons to whom they had attached as carers. It is also satisfied that the domestic authorities had regard to individual factors relating to each child, such as their age and maturity, and observes that they discussed the effects of the decisions with regard to A and B\u2019s cultural background and their relationship with relatives (see, inter alia, paragraph 75 above).\u00a0However, as mentioned above (see paragraph\u00a0147), the far-reaching measures of removing the applicant\u2019s parental authority and authorise her children\u2019s adoption could nonetheless only be applied \u201cin exceptional circumstances\u201d and if motivated by an \u201coverriding requirement\u201d pertaining to their best interests.",

This had in turn since long led to a number of necessary child welfare measures, which had also entailed A and B already having experienced several broken relationships, including the placement in two emergency foster homes and in a permanent foster home (see paragraph 92 above). In the course of time, the applicant\u2019s children had, unsurprisingly, become particularly vulnerable, as observed inter alia by the City Court (see paragraphs 89-90 and 154-155 above). Moreover, it had no doubt that the children had such an attachment to their foster parents that it would be harmful to them to be removed (see paragraph\u00a096 above). The applicant would not be able to take care of two children with so traumatic a background as A and B, even if her situation had improved (see paragraph 89 above), and, as stated above, the City Court had also concluded that it was completely improbable that any of the parents would be able to exercise parental authority over A and B in future (see paragraphs\u00a097 and 156 above).",

At the time of the City Court\u2019s examination in 2014, the abduction risk was still such that it led that court to find that even in the alternative that A and B were to remain in temporary care, the applicant could not in any event be given access to them (see paragraph 102 above).",

Moreover, these arguments were reinforced by security considerations based on concrete events (see paragraphs 76, 98, 103 and 109-110 above). The Court also notes that as A and B had lost their attachment to the applicant and had developed such an attachment to their foster parents that it would be harmful to them to be removed when the adoption was authorised (see paragraphs 95-96 above). Replacing the children\u2019s legal ties to the applicant with legal ties to the adoptive parents thus served to consolidate their de facto family ties.

The Court has not overlooked the City Court\u2019s observation that the applicant had established an independent life for herself after the final breakdown of her relationship with C at the time of its judgment (see paragraph 89 above). However, it has no basis for disputing the domestic courts\u2019 assessment that the applicant would not be able to protect the children against C or his relatives, or that contact between the applicant and the children would increase the risk of abduction (see paragraphs 101-103 and 111).",
