No attempts were made to account for the origin of the applicant\u2019s injuries. Overall, it appears that the manner in which the authorities approached the investigation of the applicant\u2019s complaints was largely aimed at exonerating the suspected officers, rather than establishing the actual circumstances in which her injuries had been sustained.",
