First, the mayor had rejected her neighbours\u2019 request to have their building declared lawful under section\u00a040 of the Styrian Buildings Act. Then, the Municipal Council had dismissed their appeal and, subsequently, the Regional Government had referred the case back to the Municipal Council, which apparently took no further decision.
