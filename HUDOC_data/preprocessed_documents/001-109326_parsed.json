However, for the Government to argue effectively that the applicant was infected with Koch\u2019s bacillus even before his arrest, it would have been necessary for the authorities to perform a Mantoux test on the applicant upon his admission to the detention facility and, in addition, to conduct a fluorography examination, or a special tuberculosis blood test, which would have indicated the presence of any latent infection. However, as is apparent from the parties\u2019 submissions, apart from fluorography examinations the Russian custodial facilities did not use any other method of screening for the presence of MBT in detainees at the time of their admission. The possibility that the applicant might never have been exposed to the infection prior to his arrest and that he only contracted tuberculosis during his detention cannot therefore be ruled out, particularly as the severe overcrowding in which the applicant found himself in facility no. IZ-47/1 (see paragraphs 28-33 above) constitutes a recognised setting for the transmission of tuberculosis (see, among many others, Yevgeniy Alekseyenko v. Russia, no. 41833/04, \u00a7 103, 27 January 2011, and Ghavtadze v. Georgia, no. 23204/07, \u00a7 86, 3 March 2009). Nor does the Court lose sight of the statistical estimations that place Russia among one of the top twenty-two high-burden countries for tuberculosis in the world, a dramatic increase in the incidence of the disease having been recorded in the 1990s, with some reports indicating that TB is twenty times more prevalent in Russian prisons than in the country in general (see Yevgeniy Alekseyenko, cited above, \u00a7 79). With all these considerations in mind, added to the fact that the first five fluorography tests carried out between December 1998 and February 2003 showed no disease in the applicant\u2019s lungs, the Court considers it probable that the applicant did contract tuberculosis in detention facility no.
