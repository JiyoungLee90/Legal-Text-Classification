Since the publication of his 2010 report, the Commissioner continued to receive reports of threats, harassment, and violence against journalists or youth activists. One of the Commissioner\u2019s recommendations to the Azerbaijani authorities was to end practices of unjustified or selective criminal prosecution of journalists or others who may express critical opinions. However, resort to such methods has apparently not abated, as illustrated by the trial against Bakhtiyar Hajiyev, a youth activist and candidate in the 2010 parliamentary elections who was using social networking sites to organise a protest. The Ganja City Court sentenced him to two years in prison on 18 May 2011 for evading military service. The timing of his arrest and the charges against him appear to be indicative of an attempt to stop his activities, which were critical of the Government. ...",

Turkey the Court considered that the refusals to grant permits to the applicant in order to cross into southern Cyprus had in effect barred his participation in bi-communal meetings there, preventing him consequently from engaging in peaceful assembly with people from both communities. The Court observed that hindrance could amount to a violation of the Convention just like a legal impediment (see Djavit An, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061 and, mutatis mutandis, Loizidou v.

The Court has emphasised on many occasions that it is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a028883/95, 4 April 2000, and Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos.\u00a057942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7 135, 24 February 2005). Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court, however, is not bound by the findings of domestic courts, although in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts (see Klaas v. Germany, 22\u00a0September 1993, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30, Series A no. 269, and Av\u015far v. Turkey, no.\u00a025657/94, \u00a7 283, ECHR 2001VII (extracts)). The Court has previously applied this reasoning in the context of Article 11 of the Convention (see Hakobyan and Others v. Armenia, no. 34320/04, \u00a7\u00a7 92-99, 10 April 2012 and, mutatis mutandis, Europapress Holding d.o.o. v. Croatia, no.\u00a025333/06, \u00a7 62, 22 October 2009).",

Its role is to rule not on criminal guilt or civil liability, but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention.

The Court adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all the evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Nachova and Others v.

The \u201cObservations on the human rights situation in Azerbaijan\u201d of 29 September 2011 adopted by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe stated, in particular, that \u201c[o]ne of the Commissioner\u2019s recommendations to the Azerbaijani authorities was to end practices of unjustified or selective criminal prosecution of journalists or others who may express critical opinions\u201d. It noted that despite those recommendations, \u201cresort to such methods has apparently not abated\u201d (see paragraph 67 above).

Thus, according to the official records, all three applicants were arrested on the street for offences related to breach of public order, and none of them resisted being taken into police custody. The first applicant was accused of disobeying an order to show an identity document. Police officers had allegedly mistaken him for a person on a wanted list and had therefore stopped his car and demanded his identity document. However, neither the name of the wanted person, nor his specific features that had led the police officers to suspect the applicant were ever indicated by the police or the domestic courts. The second and third applicants were accused of swearing aloud at no one in particular and for no apparent reason. It is remarkable that neither of those charges, which were practically identical, provided sufficient details of the acts attributed to the applicants. They were couched in standardised and vague terms and remained unclear and unexplained at the trial (compare Hakobyan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 93-95).",

The legal basis for those measures was Articles 296 and 310.1 of the CAO, which prescribes an administrative penalty for \u201cminor hooliganism\u201d and for \u201cfailure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer\u201d respectively. Thus, the measures in question were imposed relying on legal provisions which had no connection with the intended purpose of those measures. The Court cannot but agree with the applicants that the interference with their freedom of peaceful assembly on such a legal basis could only be characterised as arbitrary and unlawful (compare Hakobyan and Others, cited above, \u00a7 107).",

This Convention provision speaks of \u201cassistance\u201d and not of \u201cnomination\u201d: mere nomination does not ensure effective assistance, since a lawyer may be prevented from providing such assistance for various practical reasons, or shirk his or her duties. A State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. However, if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or is sufficiently brought to the authorities\u2019 attention in some other way, the authorities must take steps to ensure that the accused effectively enjoys the right to legal assistance (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7\u00a7 33-37, Series A no. 37, and Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, \u00a7 65, Series A no. 168). Moreover, where it is clear that the lawyer representing the accused before the domestic court has not had the time and facilities to organise a proper defence, the court should take positive measures to ensure that the lawyer is given an opportunity to fulfil his obligations in the best possible conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, \u00a7\u00a031, Series A no. 76).\u00a0The Court notes that in the case of the first applicant, a State-funded lawyer joined the proceedings at the trial stage.

The Court also observes that during the hearing the State-funded lawyer did not submit any written objections, complaints or motions on the applicant\u2019s behalf. In his oral submissions the lawyer simply stated that the applicant was not guilty and asked the court to terminate the administrative proceedings against him. These circumstances give reason to believe that the representation by the State-funded lawyer was of a formalistic nature.\u00a0Furthermore, the Court of Appeal failed to reply to the applicant\u2019s complaints of lack of effective legal assistance both at the pre-trial proceedings and at the first-instance court hearing.",

Secondly, even though the applicants refused State-funded legal assistance, it must be ascertained that their refusal amounted to an unequivocal waiver of the right to a lawyer. However, having already established that the second and third applicants were not afforded legal assistance at the pre-trial stage, the Court finds it unnecessary to rule on the issue whether their refusal of State-funded legal assistance at the trial constituted an unequivocal waiver of the right to a lawyer.",

The Court further notes that in the Strasbourg proceedings the second and third applicants were represented by the same lawyers, Mr R. Mustafazade and Mr A. Mustafayev, and that those lawyers\u2019 submissions in both cases were very similar.
