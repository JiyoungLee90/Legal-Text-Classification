While working there she had met the first victim, a certain N.B., who was a close relative of the owner and an employee in the same establishment. In June 1999 D.K. had left the applicant and moved in with N.B. in Burgas. The applicant had then decided to kill N.B. and to steal the cash kept in the bureau de change. He had purchased a \u201cMakarov\u201d pistol, a silencer and ammunition. The applicant had persuaded a friend, A.S., to take part in the robbery. On the afternoon of 1 July 1999 the applicant and A.S. had arrived in Burgas by bus. They had then gone to the building in which the bureau de change was located, and had gone up to the top floor to spend the night. Next morning, just before 9 a.m., they had descended to the floor on which the bureau de change was located and noted that N.B. was in the premises alone. A.S., who had been carrying the pistol, had burst into the premises and fired one point-blank shot at the victim\u2019s left temple. The young man had died instantly. The two accomplices had then placed the money which they had found in the bureau de change in a bag which they had brought with them. Meanwhile the armed security guard of the bureau de change, a certain P.I., had rushed into the premises where the first victim had been killed. A.S. had fired two shots at him, hitting him in the face. The security guard had been killed instantly. A.S. and the applicant had left the building. They had then concealed the murder weapon under a rubbish bin, thrown away the clothes they had been wearing and hidden the stolen money. Some time later the two men had ordered a certain E.E. to fetch the money for them, which he had done.",

It was true that the applicant had been at his place of work in Sofia on 2\u00a0July 1999.

The case file also shows that the applicant\u2019s hospital treatment and ongoing medical surveillance are part of a prevention and screening programme for tuberculosis in prisons run by the prison authorities (see paragraphs 50 and 57 above). The Court also observes that the reports on the CPT visits to Sofia Prison do not include any particular criticism of the medicinal treatment or the medical supervision of prisoners suffering from tuberculosis (see paragraphs\u00a057 and 59 above).",

Given that the domestic courts consider that the manner and method of executing life sentences are not contrary to domestic legislation, no possible action for damages based on section 1 of the Law on State and Municipal Responsibility for Damage complaining of such manner and method would stand any chance of success (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 142, 143 and 226). Moreover, the remedy used by the applicant himself against the provisions of the implementing regulations of the Prisons Act concerning the manner and method of execution of his life sentence was dismissed by the administrative courts on the ground that those provisions were in conformity with higher-level legislation (see paragraph\u00a044 above).

In 2008 his prison regime was relaxed (see paragraph 41 above). However, like all prisoners in his category, he was still kept separate from the rest of the prison population and his cell was kept locked during the day (ibid.).

Section\u00a070 [4] of the former Law on the Interior Ministry guaranteed the applicant\u2019s access to a lawyer as from the time of his arrest by the police on 3\u00a0October 1999, and Article 73 \u00a7 1 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure extended the same guarantee to the applicant\u2019s detention as ordered on 4\u00a0October 1999 by the preliminary investigation authorities (see paragraphs\u00a052 and 53 above).
