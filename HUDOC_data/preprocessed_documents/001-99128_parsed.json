Bulgaria, no.\u00a09161/02, \u00a7 40, 3 July 2008), given that it became available only after July 1999, whereas the proceedings started in February 1997 (see paragraphs 5 and 15 above), that the applicant could not resort to it in respect of the delays occurring while the case was pending before the Supreme Court of Cassation (see Pavlova v. , no. 39855/03, \u00a7 31, 14 January 2010), and that it could not have prevented the delays flowing from the numerous remittals of the case.",
