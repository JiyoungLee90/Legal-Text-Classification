Further, all the subsequent delays in listing the case were the responsibility of the applicant who had asked for adjournments. Witnesses had to be summoned anew before each hearing. ",

This gave rise to periods of inactivity in between the dates set for hearing lasting: one year, six months and twelve days; one\u00a0year, nine months and nineteen days; one year, nine months and twenty-six\u00a0days and one year, two months and six days (see paragraphs\u00a01115 above). As regards the Government\u2019s submissions that the length of the third of those periods (one year, nine months and twenty-six days) was caused by the lawyers\u2019 strikes, it is to be noted that a period of over five\u00a0months elapsed after the end of the strikes and before the case was listed on 5\u00a0December\u00a01994 (see paragraphs\u00a013\u201314 above).
