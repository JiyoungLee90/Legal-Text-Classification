Insofar as the applicants claim that the cadastral value of land in the same zone as theirs amounted to AMD 222 per sq. m., it should be noted that Government Decree No.\u00a01746N of 24 December 2003, which sets out the coefficients used for calculation of cadastral value of land and indeed lists the applicants\u2019 village within the zone, the coefficient of which corresponds to the amount per square metre claimed by the applicants, explicitly states that this decree is not applicable to the determination of cadastral value of agricultural lands (see paragraph 44 above).",

The Court is mindful of its above finding that the relevant provisions of the Law were sufficiently foreseeable in that a professional expert should legitimately have the freedom of choice of the appropriate real estate evaluation method (see paragraph 58 above). It should be noted however that in a situation where the market value of the applicants\u2019 land was determined on the basis of the sale prices of plots of land within the same area, it cannot be excluded that the applicants would not be able to acquire or would at least experience serious difficulty in finding equivalent land in another area not subject to expropriation with the amount of compensation received.",

It should be noted in this respect that both experts appointed by the court attached to their respective reports photographs of the applicants\u2019 plot of land which showed that they had indeed four fruit trees. In their opinion, however, the four trees in question could not have affected significantly the market value of the land (see paragraph 28 above).",

The courts decided that, despite the circumstances, the applicants should be provided with compensation which was determined in relation to the prices of real estate situated in the area subject to expropriation. They did not address the issue whether the compensation granted would cover the applicants\u2019 actual loss involved in deprivation of means of subsistence or was at least sufficient for them to acquire equivalent land within the area in which they lived.",
