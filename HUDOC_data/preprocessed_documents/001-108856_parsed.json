It noted, however, that the applicant had left the scene of the crime and had failed to inform the authorities of his current address. Therefore the fact that he had not been aware of the criminal proceedings against him was a consequence of his own conduct. The court concluded that by fleeing and failing to inform the authorities of his whereabouts the applicant had given up his procedural rights of his own free will.

This may be the case, for example, where the accused states publicly or in writing that he does not intend to respond to summonses of which he has become aware through sources other than the authorities, or succeeds in evading an attempted arrest (see, among other authorities, Iavarazzo v. Italy (dec.), no. 50489/99, 4 December 2001), or when materials are brought to the attention of the authorities which unequivocally show that he is aware of the proceedings pending against him and of the charges he faces (see Sejdovic, cited above, \u00a7 99). Such circumstances are to be distinguished from the outright fact of fleeing from the crime scene in fear of prosecution or a general expectation that criminal proceedings might be instituted, which are not sufficient to justify the assumption that the accused was aware of the proceedings for the determination of the charges against him and has waived his right to appear in court. An assumption of that kind would risk undermining the very concept of the right to a public hearing within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as well as the notion of an effective defence guaranteed under Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which includes the right of the accused to be informed promptly of the nature and cause of the charges against him, to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of the defence and to examine or have examined witnesses against him.",
