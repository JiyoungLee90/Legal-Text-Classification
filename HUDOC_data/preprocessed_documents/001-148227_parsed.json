The authorities were provided with appropriate opportunities to deal with the alleged ill-treatment at the domestic level. The Court has previously found, in respect of Ukraine, that the procedures of appeal to hierarchically superior prosecutors and to the courts have not been proved to be capable of providing adequate redress in respect of complaints of ill-treatment by the police and ineffective investigation (see Kaverzin v.\u00a0Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7 97). In particular, the Court has noted that, although the prosecutors and the courts dealing with complaints of inadequate official inquiries had indicated, often repeatedly, the necessary actions to be taken during a fresh (or the pending) inquiry, such instructions were not followed diligently or were completely disregarded. This often resulted in lengthy and repeated examinations of such complaints by the prosecutors and the courts, albeit without any meaningful effect (ibid. \u00a7 94). It is true that unlike in previous cases, part of the criminal proceedings took place under the operation of the new Code of Criminal Procedure. However, by that time the proceedings had lasted for more than eight years and the Government have not demonstrated that the remedies invoked had been different from those existing under the old Code. Moreover, the applicant used those new remedies on two occasions but to no avail. The decisions concerning remittals, taken under the new Code, were based on the same grounds as before: failure to take all necessary investigative steps and to comply with the instructions of the supervising authority which had remitted the case for further investigation or inquiry (see paragraph 31).",
