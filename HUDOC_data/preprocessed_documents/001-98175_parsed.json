Taking into account that the Government failed to furnish the Court with any information as to the dates of the investigative measures taken by the prosecutor's office, it is nonetheless clear that after the opening of the criminal case the investigators did not take even the most basic steps. For instance, the Court notes that, as can be seen from the decision of the district court of 30 December 2004, by that date the investigators had not questioned any of the persons involved in the arrest of the Mudayev brothers even though \u201c... in the course of the preliminary investigation it had been unequivocally established by whom and when the Mudayev brothers had been arrested and where they had been detained ...\u201d (see paragraph 44 above). It is obvious that if they were to produce any meaningful results such investigative measures should have been taken immediately after the investigation obtained the relevant information. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious matter (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7\u00a094, ECHR 2004XII). Further, it does not appear that the investigation tried to identify and question any of the servicemen who had worked in the Nadterechniy district department of the FSB, other than officer M.Kh., in order to establish whether Aslan and Mokhmad Mudayev had been detained there after 29 January 2003, or that the investigators tried to identify and question the more than twenty other residents of Raduzhnoye who had been arrested in the course of the same special operation.",

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in its early stages by the authorities' failure to take essential investigative measures. Moreover, the district court's instructions to the prosecutor's office to investigate the crime effectively did not bring any tangible results for the applicants. The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant investigative measures were taken to identify those responsible for the kidnapping. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the district prosecutor's office. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
