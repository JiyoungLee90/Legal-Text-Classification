Mr B\u2019s remark did not amount to an allegation that the Lithuanian mafia was present at Strawberries, but that Mr A wanted the rumour to be spread. In fact, it was clear from the interview that those interviewed by the applicant thought that no Lithuanians went to the club but that this was a false rumour that the plaintiff wanted to have spread around town. When considering the remark in its true context, it was clear that in no way did it contain Mr B\u2019s claim that the plaintiff was involved in criminal conduct. Whatever could be said about mafia operations, the remark contained no allegation regarding the plaintiff\u2019s activities that could be singled out as mafia related, i.e. criminal conduct. The main point was whether the plaintiff had been accused of such conduct. This had clearly not been the case. Accordingly, there was no basis for considering that the remarks were covered by the provisions in the Penal Code on protection of reputation.

However, the interview and the above-mentioned remark stated that the plaintiff had mentioned in many places the story that Mr B had been beaten up inside the club.

Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them.

The Court regards it as significant that Mr A opted to institute libel proceedings against the applicant journalist only. It cannot but note that this had the effect of reducing considerably any possibility for the applicant to substantiate the allegations.",

(no. 2), 1\u00a0July 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 31-35, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV). It cannot but note that what had prompted the applicant to write the article had been that Mr A, the person considered the victim of the accusations, had contacted the applicant in the first place asking that DV publish his own account of the relevant violent incident at Strawberries. That account, which the applicant accepted to render in her article, contained serious accusations levelled against Mr Y, the owner of the rival club Goldfinger, and Mr B, the person whom Mr A claimed was known for being violent and, sent by Mr\u00a0Y, had attacked him at his club. In the District Court\u2019s reasoning, it ought to have been clear to Mr A that his remarks would be shown to Mr B and that he would be given an opportunity to state his version of events. Whilst the District Court does not appear to have drawn any consequences from this state of affairs, the Court for its part attaches importance to this factor. By the manner in which he chose to express himself publicly, Mr A had knowingly exposed himself to criticism and should therefore display a greater degree of tolerance in this respect (Nilsen and Johnsen, cited above, \u00a7 52).",

Though they may have been capable of causing injury to Mr A\u2019s reputation, the Court sees no cause for criticising the applicant for not having distanced herself from the contents of Mr B\u2019s statements (Thoma, cited above, \u00a7 64; Standard Verlags GmbH v. , no. 13071/03, \u00a7 53, 2\u00a0November 2006).",

Moreover, the punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so (see Jersild, cited above, ibidem).
