For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and \u2013 if appropriate \u2013 punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation as to the results to be achieved, but the means to be employed. The authorities must take the steps reasonably available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. In cases under Article 3 of the Convention, where the effectiveness of an official investigation has been at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time. Consideration has been given to the opening of investigations, delays in taking statements, and the length of time taken for the preliminary investigation (see Bouyid v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], no.\u00a023380/09, \u00a7\u00a7 116 and 119\u2011123, ECHR 2015; Mocanu and Others, Mocanu and Others v.

A prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. Tolerance by the authorities towards such acts cannot but undermine public confidence in the principle of lawfulness and the State\u2019s maintenance of the rule of law (see Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Others v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 71156/01, \u00a7 97, 3 May 2007).",

The authorities must do whatever is reasonable in the circumstances to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of violence induced by, for instance, racial or religious intolerance, or violence motivated by gender-based discrimination (see Nachova and Others v.

Hence, treatment can be qualified as \u201cdegrading\u201d \u2013 and thus fall within the scope of the prohibition set out in Article 3 of the Convention \u2012 if it causes in its victim feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority, if it humiliates or debases an individual in the victim\u2019s own eyes and/or in other people\u2019s eyes, whether or not that was the aim, if it breaks the person\u2019s physical or moral resistance or drives him or her to act against his or her will or conscience, or if it shows a lack of respect for, or diminishes, human dignity (see M.C. and A.C., cited above, \u00a7 108, with further references therein). Furthermore, where an individual is confronted with lawenforcement officers, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by the person\u2019s conduct diminishes human dignity. The words \u201cin principle\u201d cannot be taken to mean that there might be situations in which such a finding of a violation is not called for because the severity threshold has not been attained. Since interference with human dignity strikes at the very essence of the Convention, any conduct by law-enforcement officers vis-\u00e0-vis an individual which diminishes human dignity constitutes a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see, for instance, Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 100 and 101, and also Zherdev v.

However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability, but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. In the proceedings before it, the Court imposes no procedural barriers on the admissibility of evidence or predetermined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, the burden of proof is on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim. In the absence of such explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7 83; Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 147, ECHR\u00a02005 VII; and Farbtuhs v.\u00a0Latvia, no. 4672/02, \u00a7 54, 2\u00a0December 2004).",

Accordingly, the fees of a representative who has acted free of charge are not actually incurred. The opposite is the case with respect to the fees of a representative who, without waiving them, has simply taken no steps to pursue their payment or has deferred it. The fees payable to a representative under a conditionalfee agreement are actually incurred only if that agreement is enforceable in the respective jurisdiction (see\u00a0Merabishvili\u00a0v. Georgia\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a0371, 28 November 2017).\u00a0In\u00a0the present case,\u00a0the applicants\u00a0did not submit documents showing that\u00a0they\u00a0had paid or\u00a0were\u00a0under a legal obligation to pay the fees charged by\u00a0their\u00a0British representative or the expenses incurred by\u00a0him.\u00a0In the absence of such documents, the Court finds no basis on which to accept that the costs and expenses claimed by the applicants\u00a0have actually been incurred\u00a0(ibid.,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7 361-62, 364-65 and 372-73, and Vazagashvili and Shanava v.
