[The applicant\u2019s] arguments about the public having the right to be informed about the candidates in public elections cannot be ignored. By introducing themselves publicly to gain voters\u2019 confidence and to persuade people to vote for them, [candidates] in a way become public persons and cannot expect all media coverage about them to be as positive as their own. Disputes, resolved and unresolved, regarding their earlier behaviour are matters to which one can expect attention to be drawn. By competing for voters\u2019 attention, candidates usually undertake to be heavily criticised and have to tolerate this up to a point, although that point should be determined on a case-by-case basis.

The sisters reacted to this criticism on their website and then [Pressan] published their reactions.

The statement in section D that appeared as a headline on [Pressan] quotes the sisters\u2019 replies but is partly rephrased. The statement in section E published in an article on [Pressan] is mostly directly quoted. However, this statement can be understood as a statement by the media itself.

However, the Supreme Court found that under domestic law the applicant, as editor, was subject to an unwritten supervisory duty consisting of preventing the publication of harmful content on the website, referring in this regard to a previous Supreme Court judgment in case no. 100/2011. Taking into account the nature of the editorial activity in question, that the liability was foreseeable to the applicant with appropriate legal advice, and the judgments of the Supreme Court as the ultimate interpreter of domestic law, the Court thus considers that it has been adequately established that the applicant\u2019s liability was prescribed by domestic law within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

A responded by denying the allegations and by stating that he would not discuss the matter further. The journalist tried to contact A in relation to later articles, but without success. However, in later articles published by Pressan on the matter, A\u2019s response, denying the allegations, was reported. Furthermore, in an article published on 8 November 2011 A\u2019s response to the allegations which had been published by another newspaper V\u00edsir, was reported and in an article published on 22 February 2011, parts of a television interview with A\u2019s daughter on the subject were reported (see paragraphs 7\u00a0\u00a010 above).",

They had published that letter and all the impugned statements on their own website before the articles were published on Pressan. As it appears in the domestic courts\u2019 findings, the quotations under items A-C and D in paragraph 12 were a verbatim rendering of the sisters\u2019 statements in their letter, on their website and from their interviews with the journalist who had written the articles. Furthermore, they later confirmed that their statements had been accurately quoted and published with their consent (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above).",

The Court regards it as significant that A opted to institute proceedings against the applicant editor only. It refers in this respect to the fact that A\u2019s lawyer sent a letter to the sisters offering to settle the case, failing which defamation proceedings would be brought against them. However, according to the sisters\u2019 statements before the domestic courts, A never brought court proceedings against them. In these circumstances, it may be open to question whether the applicant was afforded a real opportunity to absolve himself of liability by establishing that he had acted in good faith and, in the case of factual allegations, by ascertaining their truth.",

Although the compensation was not a criminal sanction, and the amount may not appear harsh, the Court reiterates that in the context of assessing proportionality, irrespective of whether or not the sanction imposed was a minor one, what matters is the very fact of judgment being made against the person concerned, even where such a ruling is solely civil in nature. Any undue restriction on freedom of expression effectively entails a risk of obstructing or paralysing future media coverage of similar questions (see, for example, Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s v. France, cited above, \u00a7 151).",

It thus exceeded the margin of appreciation afforded to it and failed to strike a reasonable balance of proportionality between the measures imposed, restricting the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression, and the legitimate aim pursued.",
