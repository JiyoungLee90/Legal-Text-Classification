The court based its findings, inter alia, on the testimonies of the victims of all three instances of robbery, medical reports concerning the injuries they sustained during those robberies, as well as material evidence (certain items seized from the applicant and recognised by the victims as the stolen ones; two knives, a hammer and a sack discovered in the car, which the co-defendants had left immediately before their arrest). The court also heard two eye-witnesses of the applicant's arrest on 31\u00a0October 2003, according to whom he had shown resistance to the police and had tried to escape from the scene. Furthermore, it was noted in the verdict that both co-defendants had fully confessed to the crimes they had been charged with on 4 November 2003 and had consistently pled guilty throughout the pre-trial investigation. The court examined their allegations of ill-treatment in police custody, voiced for the first time at the trial, and found them unsubstantiated. Namely, it noted that they had failed to raise any such complaints in the course of the pre-trial investigation and that the circumstances of the case indicated (as confirmed by the eye-witnesses of the arrest and by the police officers who had carried out the arrest and who were questioned by the court) that the bruise on the applicant's face noted on 1 November 2003 might have been sustained in the course of his fight with the police prior to his arrest.",

This conclusion was based on the fact that a considerable number of the applicant's letters were opened and that some of them were accompanied by letters and summaries produced by SIZO officials as well as on the view that \u201cthe applicable legislation... did not indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the discretion conferred on the public authorities in respect of the monitoring of detainees' correspondence\u201d (paragraph 57).",

In such circumstances it is not possible to exclude other occasions of interferences with the applicant's correspondence with the Court and/or to determine the extent or manner of such interferences. I find myself also unable to join the majority's satisfaction that a letter from the applicant \u201calbeit consisting of ten pages\u201d, opened and accompanied by a cover letter prepared by the prison authorities, which allegedly consisted of 53 pages, reached the Court without major delay. Should the Court be satisfied with such a dispatch? Following the logic of the conclusions in Article 8, there is nothing to exclude that the allegedly missing 43 pages contained the documentary substantiation of the applicant's complaints under Articles 3 and 5 requested by the Court. If this was so, could one conclude with certainty that there was no hindrance of the applicant's right to individual petition under Article\u00a034? Taken together with the letter of withdrawal under alleged pressure and the subsequent restoration of the application to the list, can it be certain that the applicant was not subject to \u201cany form of pressure\u201d in exercising this right?",
