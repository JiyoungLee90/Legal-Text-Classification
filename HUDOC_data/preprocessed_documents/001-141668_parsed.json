It noted that Article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive (Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted), which corresponded in substance to Article 3 of the Convention, had been transposed into Belgian law by section 9ter of the Aliens Act. In adopting the latter provision, the legislature had clearly and legitimately sought to reserve the benefit of section 9ter to foreign nationals who were so \u201cseriously ill\u201d that their expulsion would amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, and to ensure that the assessment in question was carried out in accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law as established in the case of N. v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 26565/05, ECHR 2008). The fact that section 9ter referred to three specific situations did not mean that its scope differed from that of Article 3. The three types of illness, where they attained a minimum level of severity \u2013 which had to be high \u2013 were apt to satisfy the requirements of Article 3. The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat concluded that the Aliens Appeals Board had unduly extended the scope of section 9ter by ruling that this provision obliged the Belgian State to carry out a more extensive assessment than that arising out of the case-law concerning Article 3 of the Convention.",

The judgment adopted the same interpretation of section 9ter of the Aliens Act as that adopted by the Aliens Appeals Board in judgments nos. 92.258, 92.308 and 92.309 of 27 November 2012 (see paragraph 55 above). The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat dismissed the arguments of the Belgian State based on European law, noting that the minimum standards of protection laid down by the Convention and the Qualification Directive could not be relied on in order to narrow the scope of the Belgian legislation.",

It also notes that if, in the circumstances described above (see paragraph 102 in fine), the alien concerned does not withdraw his or her initial application to set aside in order to resubmit it, this time accompanied by a request for a stay of execution under the ordinary procedure, the system advocated by the Government could give rise to situations in which the alien does not actually have the protection of a suspensive remedy either during the proceedings challenging the expulsion order or when his or her removal becomes imminent. That is what happened in the present case, despite the fact that the applicant was being advised by a specialist lawyer. In view of the importance of the right protected by Article 3 and the irreversible nature of expulsion, such a situation is incompatible with the requirements of the aforementioned Convention provisions (see, among other authorities, Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a025389/05, \u00a7 66, ECHR\u00a02007II; M.S.S., cited above, \u00a7 293 and 388; Diallo v. the Czech Republic, no. , \u00a7 74, 23 June 2011; Auad v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 120, 11 October 2011; Al Hanchi v.

That omission can have no effect upon her for so long as she is not placed in Nigeria. The crucial act which will determine whether she lives or dies is the execution of the State\u2019s decision to deport. The intentional and proactive removal of the applicant from a place where she can obtain life-saving treatment to a place where she cannot is what will bring about her death. It is this conscious exposure of her to a real and imminent risk of near certain but avoidable suffering and death that engages the State\u2019s responsibility under the Convention. \u201cArguing otherwise is akin to saying it is the fault of the hard ground for injury suffered by a person pushed from a cliff rather than the hand that pushed him\u201d.",

Article 3 protects those within a State\u2019s jurisdiction from proscribed treatment regardless of whether such treatment is inflicted directly in the contracting State or somewhere else at a later date. A contracting State\u2019s responsibility is engaged where \u201csubstantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subject to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country\u201d. The Court has made it clear that this liability is incurred by reason of \u201chaving taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment\u201d (emphasis added).",

The applicant, a suspected terrorist, was the subject of an extradition request from the United States. Whilst held in a British hospital, his illness (schizophrenia) was well-controlled and he received the appropriate medication needed for his health and safety. The Court considered that whether or not his extradition would breach Article 3 very much depended upon (i) the conditions in which he would find himself and (ii) the medical services that would be made available to him (\u00a7 52). Accepting that the applicant would have access to mental health services regardless of the institution in which he would be detained, the Court noted that the absence of guarantees that he would not be detained at ADX Florence\u2014a maximum security facility in which long periods of isolation were the norm. It found that there was a real risk that the applicant\u2019s extradition to a potentially more hostile prison environment would result in a significant deterioration in his mental and physical health. This, it concluded, would violate Article 3.",

Without access to life-saving treatment, she will suffer a rapid and a fatal deterioration in her condition. If Article 3 prohibits, rightly, the expulsion of a suspected terrorist to a third country because the conditions there would have adverse consequences for his health, it defies logic for the same Court to maintain that the same provision does not prohibit the expulsion of a vulnerable mother to a third country where the conditions there will have fatal consequence for her life.
