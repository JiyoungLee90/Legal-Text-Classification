[GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I). In that context, its established case-law reflecting a principle linked to the proper administration of justice requires that judgments of courts and tribunals should adequately state the reasons on which they are based. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision. The question whether a court has failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons, deriving from Article\u00a06 of the Convention, can only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see Hiro Balani v. Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7\u00a027, Series A no. 303B, Suominen v. Finland, no. 37801/97, \u00a7 34, 1 July 2003 and Tatishvili v. , no. 1509/02, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2007III).",

In this connection, the Court observes that the case-law on the matter initially imposed such requirement. This is evident from the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions \u0420\u0435\u0432.\u0431\u0440.474/96 and \u0420\u0435\u0432.\u0431\u0440.312/98 (see paragraph 19 above). In the applicant\u2019s case, the first-instance court also applied this jurisprudence by having relied on a court decision in which the reassignment of the applicant\u2019s colleague had been found unlawful due to lack of reasons (see paragraph 11 above). It was the Supreme Court which departed, for the first time in the applicant\u2019s case, from the previous case-law stating that the employers were not bound with such a requirement. The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions \u0420\u0435\u0432.\u0431\u0440.768/04 and \u0420\u0435\u0432.\u0431\u0440.285/05 (see paragraph 20 above) support the continued application of this approach after the applicant\u2019s case. This jurisprudential conflict evolved between 1997 and 2006 (see, a contrario, Beian v.  (no. 1), no. 30658/05, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2007 (extracts)).",

In this connection, the Court notes that case-law development is not, in itself, contrary to the proper administration of justice since a failure to maintain a dynamic and evolutive approach would risk rendering it a bar to reform or improvement. However, it recalls that the existence of an established judicial practice should be taken into account in assessing the extent of the reasoning to be given in a case (see, mutatis mutandis, Gorou v.  (no. 2) [GC], no. 12686/03, \u00a7\u00a038, ECHR 2009). In the present case, the Supreme Court deviated from both the lower courts\u2019 and its own jurisprudence on the matter. In this connection, the Court recalls that the requirement of judicial certainty and the protection of legitimate expectations do not involve the right to an established jurisprudence (see Un\u00e9dic v. France, no. 20153/04, \u00a7 74, 18 December 2008). However, given the specific circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the well-established jurisprudence imposed a duty on the Supreme Court to make a more substantial statement of reasons justifying the departure. That court was called upon to provide the applicant with a more detailed explanation as to why his case had been decided contrary to the already existing case-law. A mere statement that the employers were no longer required to provide concrete reasons for reassignment, but only to refer to one of the terms specified in the Collective Agreement was insufficient. While such a technique of scarce reasoning by the highest court is, in principle, acceptable, in the circumstances of the present case it failed to satisfy the requirements of a fair trial.",
