She added that anyone asking to consult his or her officially appointed or freely chosen lawyer, before an interrogation, was allowed to do so; contrary to his assertions, the applicant\u2019s access to his lawyer before the interrogation of 18\u00a0December 2009 had not been restricted.",

He considered that the legal requirements set out in Article 39(7) of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been disregarded in line with the systematic and widespread practice of the police at the material time. His insistence on seeing a lawyer in line with practice in the United Kingdom clearly demonstrated his initial determination not to waive his right to legal assistance; he could therefore not be deemed to have willingly agreed to take part in the police questioning without the assistance of a lawyer. In his in his further submissions of 6 January and 2\u00a0February 2015 the applicant noted the lack of relevant domestic legal provisions. The case before the Court showed that Articles 39 and 52 of the Code of Criminal Procedure did not apply where an individual was arrested under a European arrest warrant. To the Government\u2019s submission that new legislation had been proposed recently on that subject, the applicant replied that even supposing that bill was enacted, it only provided for access to the case file after the first interrogation by the investigating judge, not during police questioning, so that legal assistance was still not real or effective at the police custody stage. At all events, neither the proposed legislation nor the circulars from the Principal State Prosecutor had had the desired effect in the past.",

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 85 of that Code, the latter could not consult the case file before the first interrogation. The mere presence of a lawyer, who is only entitled to remain silent, could in no way constitute real and effective assistance. The applicant emphasised that the main act during the preliminary examination was the immediate pressing of charges against the applicant, even before he had been questioned about the facts, as transpired from the minutes of 18 December 2009. Moreover, with particular reference to Emilian-George Igna v. Romania (no.\u00a021249/05, 26 November 2013), he emphasised that the preliminary interrogation could lead to the accused being remanded in custody. Domestic case-law confirmed that the right of access to the case file had still not been enshrined in legislation before the preliminary examination before the investigating judge ...

However, they pointed out that the lack of legal assistance did not automatically amount to a violation of Article 6 of the Convention (see Zdravko Petrov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a020024/04, 23 June 2011, and Stanca v.\u00a0Romania, no. 34116/04, 24\u00a0July\u00a02012) and that an express or tacit waiver of that right was accepted by the Court (see Yolda\u015f v. Turkey, no.\u00a027503/04, 23 February 2010). According to the Government, the applicant had been served with the European Arrest Warrant on his arrest in the United Kingdom, so that at his questioning on 17 December 2009 he had known for thirteen days the charges against him, and he could have sought the assistance of a lawyer of his own choice with whom to discuss the approach to be adopted in his defence. If the applicant had initially requested the assistance of a lawyer during the police questioning, he had received the necessary explanations concerning the procedure and the applicable texts \u2013 which unambiguously granted the right to legal assistance as from the first interrogation \u2013 and had been advised, for reasons of the efficient running of the investigation, to begin discussions pending the arrival of the officially appointed lawyer. The applicant had approved that procedure voluntarily and without coercion, and had waived, with full knowledge of the facts, the benefit of the presence of counsel at that very early stage in proceedings, having been informed that a lawyer would be present during the exchange with the investigating judge, which had been the case. In that regard, the Government, while accepting that he had not been notified of his rights in writing against receipt, emphasised that the applicant had been informed of the details of the usual procedure in Luxembourg and had signed the official record, which had been translated in full by the accredited interpreter assisting him; therefore, the applicant\u2019s waiver had been unequivocal and attended by the requisite minimum guarantees. Last but not least, the Government submitted that the statements given during the first interview had in no way influenced the final decision, because during both the police questioning and the interrogation by the investigating judge and in the trial courts the applicant had consistently and vehemently contested the charges. Therefore, the conviction had not been based in any way on the statements or any confession given without the assistance of a lawyer; the judges had been persuaded by the various witness statements and the medical reports. Accordingly, the oral evidence given at the first interview had been completely confirmed during the subsequent proceedings, the presence of a lawyer. In their observations of 14 January 2015 the Government explained that the exchange of letters between the public prosecutor\u2019s office and the police and customs departments (see paragraphs 31 to 33 above) showed that the provisions of Articles 39 and 52 of the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning police questioning were automatically applicable to the right to legal assistance of an individual arrested under a European arrest warrant. That clarification as regards the applicable legislation had been made at the beginning of 2011, when the Salduz and Dayanan judgments had just begun to have a real international\u00a0impact; the applicant\u2019s proceedings had been ongoing at the time and had benefited from the State Prosecutor\u2019s explanations. The service instructions had been backed up with a wide range of meetings in the police and customs services, in order to ensure that the instructions were followed to the letter. A bill had since been tabled reinforcing procedural safeguards in criminal matters in line with the Salduz precedent and transposing the relevant European directives.",

They explained that the key element of the case before the investigating judge was the victim\u2019s deposition as it emerged during the interrogation. The fact that the applicant\u2019s lawyer had been unable to consult the case file in advance had had no effect on the applicant\u2019s defence because it had never been a question of the judge simply reading out the indictment and presenting the applicant with the victim\u2019s allegations. Nevertheless, the lawyer\u2019s role had not been confined to his mere presence alongside the applicant, because he had been free to interrupt and ask questions throughout the interrogation. Thanks to his attendance at that meeting, the lawyer had subsequently had more than one year to prepare his client\u2019s defence, with full knowledge of the contents of the case file. As regards the preliminary talks between the applicant and his lawyer before the interrogation, the Government explained that the lack of regulations allowed for full freedom in that sphere; the client could at any time, on request, engage in consultations with his lawyer, including before the questioning at the preliminary stage of the investigation. It was true that in practice the procedure was easier to implement if the defendant knew the lawyer and had contacted him in advance; on the other hand, the procedure for appointing a lawyer on his behalf meant that the latter had to be appointed at the time of the first interview. However, it was wrong to suggest that the Code of Criminal Procedure prevented the applicant from communicating with his lawyer and rendered the latter\u2019s intervention wholly ineffective. The Government emphasised that communication was possible without restriction and that the lawyer could ask to speak at any time during the interrogation before the investigating judge; only full consultation of the case file was impossible before the end of the interrogation. To the applicant\u2019s criticism that he had suddenly found a lawyer unknown to him setting beside him, the Government replied that that was inherent in the procedure for appointing a lawyer, as the applicant had been unable to appoint counsel known to him. The Government added that Mr W., who had been appointed at the applicant\u2019s request, had not been prevented from intervening but had probably seen no need to do so at that stage in the proceedings; moreover, the applicant had never complained about his lawyer, who had continued to assist him throughout the proceedings.",

Given that neither the Court of Appeal nor the Court of Cassation had found any breach of his defence rights, it had not been incumbent on those courts to provide redress. According to the Government, even if the Court of Appeal had decided to nullify the first interview, such a decision would have had no effect on his conviction, as the trial court had based the conviction on other elements in the case file. The Court should pursue a flexible approach based on an overall reading of the situation in the light of the whole proceedings in order to satisfy itself that the aims of Article 6 had been secured (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996I, and Rupa v.

In order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently \u201cpractical and effective\u201d, Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of the case that there are compelling reasons to restrict that right. The Court specifies that even in such cases, denial of access to a lawyer must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6, and that the rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 55). The Court found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) notwithstanding that the applicant had subsequently benefited from legal assistance and adversarial proceedings, having noted, in particular, that the restriction in question on the right to a lawyer had been based on the systematic application of legal provisions (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 61).",

The Court emphasises in that respect that the fairness of proceedings requires that an accused be able to obtain the whole range of services specifically associated with legal assistance, pointing out that discussion of the case, organisation of the defence, collection of evidence favourable to the accused, preparation for questioning, support of an accused in distress and checking of the conditions of detention were fundamental aspects of the defence which the lawyer must be able to exercise freely (see Dayanan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 31-33). Moreover, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at the investigation stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself (see Pavlenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 42371/02, \u00a7 101, 1\u00a0April 2010).",

It transpires from the 15 June 2011 letter sent by the State Prosecutor that at the material time the right to the assistance of a lawyer had not applied to a police interrogation in the context of a preliminary investigation, on letters rogatory from a Luxembourg investigating judge, of a person detained pursuant to a European arrest warrant issued by a Luxembourg court (see paragraph 33 above). The Law of 17 March 2004 on the European Arrest Warrant and surrender procedures between Member States of the European Union provides for the assistance of a lawyer during police interrogations solely in the framework of the enforcement in Luxembourg of a European arrest warrant issued by a foreign authority ... However, it must be borne in mind that the applicant\u2019s questioning by the police had taken place following his arrest in the United Kingdom on the basis of a European arrest warrant issued by a Luxembourg investigating judge. It is therefore incontrovertible that at the material time legal assistance during police questioning had been explicitly provided for in law under certain circumstances, but implicitly ruled out under circumstances such as those prevailing in the present case. That is why the assistance had been automatically ruled out in this way under the relevant legal provisions (see, mutatis mutandis, Navone and Others v.\u00a0Monaco, cited above, \u00a7 81).",

What is more, by confining itself to that finding the Court of Appeal had failed to analyse the need at least to exclude the statements recorded during the impugned phase of the proceedings; on the contrary, it even took account of those statements, albeit in conjunction with a substantial amount of other evidence, in the reasoning underpinning its conviction of the applicant. The Court of Cassation subsequently dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law on the ground that the Court of Appeal had found that there had been no violation of his defence rights since he had recorded his agreement to giving evidence in the absence of a lawyer. The Court takes the view that in so doing decision the judgment of the Court of Appeal, as subsequently upheld by the Court of Cassation, had failed to consider the situation complained of and had therefore failed to provide redress for the consequences of the failure to provide the applicant with legal assistance during the police hearing. In so far as the Government invited the Court to adopt a flexible approach based on an overall interpretation of the situation, the Court considers that they cannot use the judgments in the cases of John Murray (cited above) and Rupa v. Romania no. 2 (cited above) as authority. In John Murray, which preceded Salduz, the Court noted that the applicant had remained silent from the beginning of the police interrogation until the end of his trial, and found no violation of his right to remain silent; however, the Court did find a violation of Article 6 as regards the refusal to grant the applicant access to a solicitor for his first forty-eight hours in police custody. As regards Rupa, the complaints were of a different nature; the applicant in question had complained that the prosecutor had denied him the assistance of the lawyer of his choice and that the officially appointed lawyer had failed to provide adequate assistance.",

In addition, before charges are pressed, the person interrogated is at liberty to organise his defence (including the right to remain silent, to consult the case file after the first interrogation by the investigating judge, and to choose his defence strategy throughout the criminal proceedings).

Accordingly, the consultation between the lawyer and his client upstream of the interrogation must be unequivocally enshrined in legislation. However, that is not the case in Luxembourg. Article 84 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not provide that accused persons can consult their lawyers before the first interrogation by the investigating judge, as in fact recommended by Article 3 of Directive 2013/48/EU ... On the contrary, the actual wording of the provision in question gives the impression that no communication is possible before the first interrogation. Such a legislative position might suggest to accused persons that there is no point in demanding discussions with their lawyer before the first interrogation.",
