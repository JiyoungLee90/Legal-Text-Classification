However, it analysed in detail the terms of Article 31 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution (see paragraph 33 above) and held that that provision was to be construed as containing a procedural obligation to comply with the statutory timelimits for conducting and finalising the pre-trial phase of criminal proceedings, with a view to bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial. It thus served the same purpose as Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, albeit only in relation to the first phase of criminal proceedings. The court continued:",

In most cases those timelimits would be longer than the sum of the timelimits under Article 234 \u00a7\u00a7 15 and Article 242 \u00a7 3 of the Code. An exception could occur only if the duration of the investigation was extended, exceptionally, to more than six months by the head of a regional or higher prosecutor\u2019s office or a person designated by him or her (Article 234 \u00a7 3 of the Code).

The constitutional amendments in 2006 and the new [Judiciary Act], adopted in 2007, put in place additional safeguards for the faster examination of cases and for avoiding their undue protraction. The repeal of [Articles 368 and 369 of the Code] does not affect that system of rules. Its aim was to improve the law in order to ensure good justice, which is [a legitimate aim].",

It is true that in most cases such an approach would lead to a correct assessment \u2013 something fully logical in view of the fact that under the rules of procedure a person can be charged only if there already exists \u2018enough evidence\u2019 that he or she is guilty. However, in some complex cases that criterion might, contrary to the public interest that all offenders be brought to justice, give the accused an undue advantage \u2013 for instance in cases in which it proves to be genuinely difficult to trace and charge accomplices, cases in which the need arises to gather additional evidence, including through letters rogatory, cases in which the accused has slowed down the proceedings, etc. It is no wonder that the caselaw of the European Court of Human Rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is quite flexible. That Court uses three criteria to assess the relevant period: the factual and legal complexity of the case, the conduct of any authorities involved and the conduct of the person concerned [(see Eckle v. Germany, 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51; Zimmermann and Steiner v.\u00a0Switzerland, 13 July 1983, Series A no. 66; Kreps v. Poland, no. 34097/96, 26 July 2001; and S.H.K. v. Bulgaria, no. 37355/97, 23 October 2003)]. It is equally possible to exceed a reasonable time while formally complying with the applicable timelimits and to comply with the \u2018reasonable time\u2019 requirement while exceeding the applicable timelimits. The European Court of Human Rights finds breaches of the \u2018reasonable time\u2019 requirement only on the basis of delays attributable to the authorities. In view of that, the Constitutional Court considers that by repealing [Articles 368 and\u00a0369] of the [2005] Code of Criminal Procedure the legislature sought to achieve a constitutionally legitimate aim \u2013 to ensure the interests of justice while taking into account the right to \u2018a hearing within a reasonable time\u2019, as construed by the European Court of Human Rights. In so far as in exceptional cases the new legal framework could restrict the rights of the accused, one should take into account that there exists a balancing mechanism, namely the requirement under Article 234 \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9 of the [Code] for all preventive measures [such as pretrial detention or house arrest] to be set aside after the expiry of timelimits that are identical to those under the repealed provisions.",

                                        "content": "It is also important to examine whether the repeal of the possibility for accused persons to request that their case be brought for trial does not create a lacuna in the law, in breach of the requirement of Article 13 of the Convention for effective remedies in respect of the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Convention and in particular the right of those charged with criminal offences to have their cases examined within a reasonable time. In its caselaw the European Court of Human Rights has held that remedies are effective if they can prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred [(see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 158, ECHR 2000XI)]. In a number of judgments, that Court has noted that before the introduction of Article 239a of the [1974] Code of Criminal Procedure our State did not make available a remedy complying with the requirements of Article 13, read in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and capable of ensuring that the pretrial phase of criminal proceedings does not exceed a reasonable time [(see Osmanov and Yuseinov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, nos. 54178/00 and 59901/00, 23 September 2004; Mitev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a040063/98, 22 December 2004; and Sidjimov v. Bulgaria, no. 55057/00, 27 January 2005)]. In those circumstances, the answer to the above question depends on whether, from the creation of that remedy in 2003 until its abolition in 2010, the State has created alternative mechanisms ensuring the availability of effective remedies in respect of the right to have charges examined within a reasonable time during the pretrial phase of criminal proceedings. In [our] view, that has been done, as far as rules are concerned. An amendment to the Constitution [which came into force in February 2007] created a new independent body, the Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council, which may act pursuant to requests by the persons concerned, a category which includes those charged with a criminal offence. That Inspectorate checks the work of the judicial authorities and has the power to report and make proposals to all State authorities, including the competent judicial authorities (Article 132a \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 9 of the Constitution). The Inspectorate\u2019s powers have been laid down in more detail in the new [Judiciary Act]. It may now check \u2018the way in which judicial, prosecutorial and investigation case files are being opened and processed, as well as their completion within the prescribed timelimits\u2019 (section\u00a054(1)(2) of the Act). Under section 58(3) of the Act, the results of such checks have to be made available not only to the judge, prosecutor or investigator concerned, but also to the head of the relevant department of the judiciary. That head must then inform the chief inspector whether any recommendations given have been complied with within the timelimit set in the Inspectorate\u2019s report (section 58(4) of the Act). If it is necessary to prevent or overcome an undue delay during the pretrial phase of criminal proceedings, the authority in charge of ensuring compliance with the Inspectorate\u2019s directions is the head of the relevant department of the prosecuting authorities. He or she has the power to take various measures: organisational (under section 136(4) of the Act), disciplinary (to impose certain light sanctions under section 311(1) of the Act or to initiate disciplinary proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council) and procedural (to set aside or vary the decisions of the lower prosecutors, to give mandatory directions or personally to take the necessary procedural steps, as possible under Article 46 \u00a7 3 of the [2005] Code of Criminal Procedure, [or] to exercise control over the activities of the investigating authorities in line with Articles 196 and 197 of the [same Code]). It can therefore be accepted that the repeal of [Articles 368 and 369 of the Code] does not lead to a legal vacuum incompatible with Article 13 of the Convention. Naturally, the mere existence of rules does not preclude the risk of future judgments in which the European Court of Human Rights will find violations in respect of . All State authorities must take into account the general statement made in Kud\u0142a, cited above, namely that the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law.\u201d",

Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7 180, ECHR 2006V). The Court does not doubt that the plea bargain between Mr Dimitrov and the prosecution (see paragraph 15 above) prevented further delay in the determination of the criminal charges against him. It also probably led to a more lenient punishment than the one that he might have received if his case had gone to trial. It is a common feature of European criminal justice systems for a criminal defendant to receive a reduction in his or her sentence for a guilty plea in advance of trial (see Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 and 36742/08, \u00a7 168, 6 July 2010, with further references).

As evident from its reasoning, that court took the length of the proceedings into account amongst a number of other mitigating circumstances (see paragraph 26 above). While it is true that Mr Hamanov\u2019s sentence was below the mean punishment envisaged by the 1968 Criminal Code for the chief offence of which he was convicted (see paragraph 51 above), it is not clear from the court\u2019s reasoning whether the time/delay element amounted to a primary ground to mitigate the sentence. The Court cannot therefore find that the reduction on account of the length factor was measurable and had a decisive impact on Mr Hamanov\u2019s sentence. He cannot therefore be regarded as having been afforded quantifiable redress for the alleged breach of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time (see Jensen v. Denmark (dec.), no.\u00a048470/99, ECHR 2001X; Lehtonen v. Finland, no. 11704/03, \u00a7 16, 13\u00a0June 2006; Donner v. Austria, no. 32407/04, \u00a7 27, 22 February 2007; Taavitsainen v.

Moreover, the question whether the alleged redress was sufficient to make good a violation resulting from the entire length of the proceedings can be decided only at their close. The reduction of Mr Hamanov\u2019s sentence by the firstinstance court could not remedy any delays that occurred later, when the case was heard on appeal (see Uoti v. Finland, no. 61222/00, \u00a7 31, 9 January 2007).",

The period of inactivity between May 2002 and March 2005, while at first sight due to an objective reason \u2013 a key witness and possible coaccused being abroad \u2013 cannot be considered justified, given that that individual could have been interviewed during the five years between the opening of the proceedings in 1995 and the time when he left Bulgaria in 2000 (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above).

The Court\u2019s conclusion was based on the length of the proceedings from when they started in March 1996 until the latest information from the parties in April 2003 (see Hamanov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01132 and 10207).

France (no. 2), no.\u00a049531/99, \u00a7 22, 17 June 2003; and Geraldes Barba, cited above, \u00a7 38). There were no serious delays in the proceedings before the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 2932 above). However, the same cannot be said of the proceedings before the  and the Plovdiv Court of Appeal. The  held eleven hearings. One of those was adjourned for reasons attributable to the authorities, four for reasons attributable to Mr Hamanov\u2019s coaccused, two for reasons attributable to Mr Hamanov, and two because of the need to gather additional evidence, with the result that the case remained pending before that court for more than two and a half years (see paragraphs 1825 above). After that, there was a gap of about fourteen months between the filing of the appeals against the \u2019s judgment and the time when the Plovdiv Court of Appeal heard those appeals (see paragraph 28 above). Part of that delay was apparently due to the late handing down of the reasons for the \u2019s judgment (see paragraph 26 in\u00a0limine above). The Court considers that the authorities could have done more to expedite the examination of the case, which had started as early as March 1996 and had already been beset by considerable delays (see Hamanov, cited above, \u00a7 105).",

In a number of cases the Bulgarian Government argued that the 1988 Act can provide an effective remedy in that regard. However, that Act does not explicitly envisage liability of the authorities for excessively lengthy proceedings (see paragraph 47 above). The Court has therefore in a number of cases rejected the Government\u2019s argument, noting that they were unable to cite any domestic caselaw in support of their assertion (see Nalbantova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 25 and 35; Doinov v.

                                                "content": "97.\u00a0\u00a0Naturally, the Court cannot overlook that in its recent caselaw the Supreme Court of Cassation, when it allows claims for compensation brought under section 2(1)(2) of the 1988 Act by persons who have been acquitted or the proceedings against whom have been discontinued, in fixing the amount of damages takes into account, among other factors, the length of the proceedings (see paragraph 49 above). However, the Court does not consider that such claims can be regarded as an effective remedy in respect of the excessive length of criminal proceedings, for several reasons. First, the cause of action underlying such claims is not a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, but the fact that the proceedings have resulted in an acquittal or have been discontinued (see paragraph 48 above and contrast Gonzalez Mar\u00edn v. Spain (dec.) no. 39521/98, ECHR 1999VII; Mifsud, cited above; and Paulino Tom\u00e1s v. Portugal (dec.), no. 58698/00, ECHR 2003VIII). Therefore, it cannot be regarded as an avenue whereby persons charged with criminal offences can vindicate, as such, their right to a hearing within a reasonable time (see Ommer v. Germany (no. 1), no.\u00a010597/03, \u00a7\u00a7 4143 and 75, 13 November 2008, and Ommer v. Germany (no. 2), no. 26073/03, \u00a7\u00a7 3740 and 62, 13 November 2008, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Peev v. Bulgaria, no. 64209/01, \u00a7\u00a7 7273, 26 July 2007). Secondly \u2013 and this point is closely related with the first \u2013 it is unclear what weight the domestic courts, when calculating the amount of damages to be awarded to a successful claimant, accord to the length of the proceedings vis\u00e0vis other relevant factors, such as the length of any related pretrial detention or the impact of the proceedings on the individual\u2019s private or family life (see paragraph 48 above). It is thus impossible to ascertain whether the level of compensation afforded to the applicant in relation to the length of the proceedings is reasonable (see Scordino (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7\u00a0206, and Simaldone v. Italy, no. 22644/03, \u00a7\u00a030, 31 March 2009). Thirdly, those claims do not fall to be examined under a streamlined procedure, but under the general rules of civil procedure, by at least two, and possibly three, levels of court, with the result that the proceedings can last several years (see paragraph 49 in fine above). Such a lapse of time is not reconcilable with the requirement that a remedy for delay be sufficiently swift (see McFarlane, cited above, \u00a7 123). Fourthly, such claims can be brought only after the criminal proceedings have ended and not while they are still pending (see Robert Lesjak v. Slovenia, no. 33946/03, \u00a7\u00a7 5253, 21\u00a0July 2009). Lastly, such claims may come for hearing before the courts against which they are directed, and any awards that the courts make pursuant to such claims must be paid out of their budget. Both of those facts may raise serious issues in relation to the lack of objective impartiality of the courts hearing such claims (see Mihalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 67719/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04551, 10 April 2008). Therefore, claims under section 2(1)(2) of the 1988 Act cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention, but any awards made in such proceedings may be relevant in respect of an award of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Hornsby v. Greece, 19 March 1997, \u00a7 37 in fine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II, and Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 1999II).",

It had to be borne in mind that the two applications concerned proceedings which had taken place between 1996 and 2009. The assessment whether they were indicative of a structural problem called for the consideration of the reform of the criminal justice system which had taken place during that period. Many of those reforms, which had started in 1999, had been a result of rulings made by the Court. The increasing incidence of adverse rulings against  and the high number of pending applications evinced not only problems with the Bulgarian criminal justice system, but also the increasing popularity of the Court. Another fact showing the lack of a structural problem was that the Committee of Ministers had not adopted an interim resolution in relation to the group of Bulgarian cases concerning length of proceedings. More time was therefore needed to assess the effect of the ongoing reform of the judicial system and the impact of the newly adopted rules of procedure.",

The number of cases completed in 2009 had increased by 15.46% in relation to those completed in 2008; that figure was chiefly due to the number coming from the district courts, where the increase had been upwards of 20%.

It had specifically addressed the issue of unreasonable length of proceedings and had proposed solutions for overcoming it and for putting in place effective remedies in respect of it. Based on that Blueprint, a working group had been asked to propose amendments to the 1988 Act. In May 2010 that group had drawn up a draft bill, but work on it was still under way. That bill specifically envisaged adding undue delay in criminal, civil and administrative cases as a cause of action entailing State liability.",

It was unclear whether and when the measures envisaged in the two blueprints mentioned by the Government would be implemented. The fact that the draft bill for the amendment of the 1988 Act had not been put before Parliament for more than a year showed the lack of political will to see those measures through. It could not be accepted that the inspectorates of the Ministry of Justice and of the Supreme Judicial Council would provide a solution to the problem. The Government had not pointed to specific examples in which interventions by those bodies had led to an acceleration of the proceedings. Those bodies were only competent to analyse the work of the courts and make suggestions for disciplinary action, not to give binding instructions for the faster processing of individual cases.",

Germany, 28 June 1978, \u00a7 100, Series A no. 27, and, more recently, Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7\u00a7 83 and 84, 16 November 2010). Moreover, the unreasonable length of proceedings is a multifaceted problem which may be due to a large number of factors, of both a legal and logistical character. Some of those \u2013 such as an insufficient number of judges, prosecutors, investigators or administrative staff, inadequate court premises, overly complex procedures, procedural loopholes allowing unjustified adjournments, or poor case management \u2013 may be internal to the judicial system, whereas others \u2013 such as the belated submission of expert reports and failures by the authorities to provide in a timely manner documents needed as evidence \u2013 may be extrinsic to that system. The Court will therefore abstain from indicating any specific measures to be taken by the respondent State to tackle the problem. The Committee of Ministers is better placed and equipped to monitor the measures that need to be adopted by Bulgaria in that respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov (no. 2), \u00a7\u00a7 136 and 137, and Olaru and Others, \u00a7 57, both cited above, as well as Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov v.

Indeed, as evident from its Interim Resolution of 2 December 2010 and the first Appendix to it, the Committee is already doing so and will continue, in cooperation with the national authorities (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above). By way of example, the Court would point to the recent adoption of statutory provisions proclaiming the right to a \u201chearing within a reasonable time\u201d (see paragraph 36 above) and the obligation for the courts to \u201cexamine and decide cases within a reasonable time\u201d (see paragraph 42 above).",

In some cases, the Bulgarian courts mitigate sentences on the basis of the general provisions of the Criminal Code governing the individualisation of punishment (see paragraph 50 above). However, that practice is often a result of the courts\u2019 view that long after the commission of an offence the aims of the punishment and the public interest do not require harsh sentences. Thus, while in some cases the courts spell out clearly that the reduction is meant as redress for a breach of the right to trial within a reasonable time, in others, such as Mr Hamanov\u2019s, they do not (see paragraphs 26, 65 and 66 above). Since that practice is not based on express statutory language or established caselaw, usually does not make clear that the sentence is reduced in an express and measurable manner so as to make good any undue delays, and, most importantly, is not a possibility available as of right to those concerned, it cannot for the time being be regarded as an effective remedy.

In April 2006 that procedure was superseded by an almost identical procedure, governed by Articles 36869 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 43 above). That remedy could function either as an acceleratory one (it could expedite the bringing of a case to trial) or as a compensatory one (it could lead to a discontinuance of proceedings). However, it had certain limitations. When operating as an acceleratory remedy, it could prevent further delay only in the pretrial proceedings, and was available only to persons who had been formally charged. That is well illustrated by the proceedings in Mr Hamanov\u2019s case (see paragraph 17 above). In addition, it does not seem that it could prevent delays resulting from repeated referrals of cases back to the pretrial stage \u2013 a major source of delay in some Bulgarian criminal cases (see Yankov (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7 51). When functioning as a compensatory remedy, in could not make up for delays accrued before its introduction in June 2003 (see the cases cited in paragraph 93 above). Lastly, as correctly pointed out by the Bulgarian Constitutional Court (see paragraph 45 above), that remedy used a formal criterion to measure \u201creasonable time\u201d, which in some cases could, contrary to the public interest that offenders be brought to justice, result in the undue discontinuance of criminal prosecutions. It could also, as pointed out by the Supreme Court of Cassation, come into conflict with the right to a fair trial (see paragraph 41 above).",

It also stated that it is clear that for countries where lengthofproceedings problems already exist, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings \u2013 although desirable for the future \u2013 may not be adequate to redress a situation in which proceedings have clearly already been excessively long (ibid., \u00a7 185). It confirmed this position in three subsequent cases against Slovenia (see \u017duni\u010d v.  (dec.), no.\u00a024342/04, 18 October 2007; Toma\u017ei\u010d v. Slovenia, no. 38350/02, \u00a7 37 in\u00a0fine, 13 December 2007; and Robert Lesjak, cited above, \u00a7 36). In view of what has been said above,  can be considered as a country in which lengthofproceedings problems already exist. It must therefore put in place a remedy which can provide redress for past delays. Indeed, the Committee of Ministers very recently invited the Bulgarian authorities \u201cto complete as soon as possible the reform undertaken in order to introduce a remedy whereby compensation may be granted for prejudice caused by excessive length of judicial proceedings\u201d (see paragraph 52 above), and the Bulgarian authorities are now working on a draft bill in that domain (see paragraphs 53 and 103 above). The Court would add that the introduction of effective domestic remedies in this domain would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that could otherwise, and in the Court\u2019s opinion more appropriately, have been addressed in the first place within the national legal system (see Kud\u0142a, \u00a7\u00a0155, and Scordino (no. 1), \u00a7 188, both cited above).",

The effectiveness of such a measure does not depend on whether it is the product of legislative changes or of wellestablished caselaw of the domestic courts. However, to be able to redress the breach of the defendant\u2019s right to a hearing within a reasonable time, such a measure must meet three conditions. First, the courts must acknowledge the failure to observe the reasonabletime requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in a sufficiently clear way. Secondly, they must afford redress by reducing the sentence in an express and measurable manner. Lastly, the opportunity to request such a reduction, whether based on express statutory language or clearly established caselaw, must be available to the convicted defendant as of right. Naturally, that does not mean that the courts must as a rule accede to such requests; in situations where a reduction of sentence would not be an appropriate measure, they may refuse to do so, and it will then be for the defendant to seek other forms of redress, such as pecuniary compensation.",

Moreover, the hourly rate charged by the applicants\u2019 lawyers is comparable to those charged in recent cases against Bulgaria having a similar complexity (see Velikovi and Others v. Bulgaria, nos.\u00a043278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01 and 194/02, \u00a7\u00a7 268 and 274, 15 March 2007; Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Metropolitan Inokentiy) and Others v.

It can thus be regarded as reasonable. In view of that and bearing in mind that the case, due to its pilot character, raised a range of issues which surpass the complexity of those usually raised by a normal lengthofproceedings case, the Court awards the applicants the full sums claimed in respect of legal fees: EUR 2,683 to Mr Dimitrov and EUR 1,820 to Mr Hamanov. The sum awarded to Mr Dimitrov is to be paid into the bank account of his legal representative, Mr A. Atanasov. EUR 1,667 of the sum awarded to Mr\u00a0Hamanov is to be paid into the bank account of his legal representatives, Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms K.
