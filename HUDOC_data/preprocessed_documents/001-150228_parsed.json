It examined the constitutionality of the defence provided in Article\u00a0213\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the CC in respect of the offence of defamation committed through the mass media (Article\u00a0212\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the CC). The Constitutional Court ruled that Article\u00a0213\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 was compatible with the Constitution in so far as it required that an allegation had to be true. It held, however, that this provision was unconstitutional in so far as it necessitated that a true allegation concerning the conduct of a public official had to pursue a justifiable public interest. It further discontinued the proceedings in respect of the constitutionality of Article\u00a0212\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the CC, having regard to its earlier judgment of 30\u00a0October 2006 in the case no.\u00a0P 10/06.",

These factors, in turn, require consideration of other elements such as the authority of the source (Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above), whether the newspaper had conducted a reasonable amount of research before publication (Prager\u00a0and\u00a0Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria, 26\u00a0April 1995, \u00a7\u00a037, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0313), whether the newspaper presented the story in a reasonably balanced manner (Bergens Tidende and Others v.\u00a0Norway, no.\u00a026132/95, \u00a7\u00a057, ECHR\u00a02000IV) and whether the newspaper gave the persons defamed the opportunity to defend themselves (Bergens Tidende and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058). Hence, the nature of such an exemption from the ordinary requirement of verification of defamatory statements of fact is such that, in order to apply it in a manner consistent with the caselaw of this Court, the domestic courts have to take into account the particular circumstances of the case under consideration. If the national courts apply an overly rigorous approach to the assessment of journalists\u2019 professional conduct, the latter could be unduly deterred from discharging their function of keeping the public informed. The courts must therefore take into account the likely impact of their rulings not only on the individual cases before them but also on the media in general (see Kasabova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055 and Yordanova\u00a0and Toshev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a05126/05, \u00a7\u00a048, 2\u00a0October 2012).",

The starting point of the article at issue was the disappearance or theft (as alleged by the applicant) of the private hunting trophies from the office of the former bailiff H.J. which was located on the court premises. The applicant described long and unsuccessful efforts of the former bailiff aimed at elucidating the circumstances concerning this event and establishing persons responsible for it. The applicant expressed his doubts about the procedure followed in respect of removal of the hunting trophies and the exactitude of the list of the trophies allegedly returned to the bailiff. He referred to the lack of proper administrative supervision of bailiff H.J. by Judge W.G., the then President of the Wroc\u0142awKrzyki District Court which was subsequently confirmed in the proceedings against him (see paragraph\u00a035 above). The applicant further described the civil proceedings for compensation instituted by bailiff H.J. against the Wroc\u0142aw Regional Court in connection with the disappearance of the trophies. In those proceedings the representatives of the Wroc\u0142aw Regional Court produced three different versions of the apparently same list of trophies as supposedly returned to the former bailiff H.J. The applicant also related a decision of the Wroc\u0142aw StareMiasto Prosecutor\u2019s Office following a criminal complaint filed by H.J. against M.K. The Prosecutor\u2019s Office discontinued the investigation on the ground that the trophies which had disappeared in 1995 were damaged by a flood which had occurred two years later.",

However, the trial court\u2019s position was that since a trainee bailiff was not a\u00a0judge or a prosecutor nor an employee of the administration of justice then it was factually incorrect to assert that there were \u201cthieves in the administration of justice\u201d. The Court is unpersuaded by such a restrictive interpretation of the term \u201cadministration of justice\u201d in the present case. First, it notes that the actual charge against the applicant was related to defamation of \u201cofficials\u201d (pracownik\u00f3w) of the Wroc\u0142aw Regional Court and of the Wroc\u0142awKrzyki District Court which term could well encompass not only judges and prosecutors but also other officials involved in the administration of justice, including administrative staff. It should be noted that in 1995, at the time of the alleged theft of hunting trophies, the status of court bailiffs was regulated by the Act on the Organisation of Courts. According to this Act, at the material time court bailiffs were employed in district courts by virtue of a nomination made by the President of the Regional Court. Trainee bailiffs completed their oneyear long training under the supervision of a bailiff and then took a professional exam. Second, the Court already established that the administration of justice in the broader sense of this term includes also public prosecutors (see Le\u0161n\u00edk v.\u00a0Slovakia, no. 35640/97, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2003IV). Furthermore, the editorinchief of the newspaper explained that the administration of justice in the popular understanding comprised all persons employed in the justice system who were connected one way or the other with the observance and enforcement of the law (see paragraph\u00a012 above). The applicant relied on such understanding of the term and the Court finds this position reasonable. It would be unduly formalistic to require that a journalist writing about the functioning of the courts or the prosecutors should only use precise legal terms without making any allowance for the understanding of an average reader subject to the condition that a journalist acted in good faith and provided accurate and reliable information.",

The applicant asserted that it was a value judgment and not a statement of fact as determined by the domestic courts. In assessing whether there was a \u201cpressing social need\u201d capable of justifying an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression, a\u00a0careful distinction needs to be made between facts and value judgments. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see Lingens v.\u00a0Austria, 8\u00a0July 1986, \u00a7\u00a046, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0103; De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, \u00a7\u00a042). Even where a\u00a0statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (see De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, \u00a7\u00a047; Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria (no.\u00a02), judgment of 1\u00a0July 1997, Reports\u00a01997IV, p.\u00a01276, \u00a7\u00a033; Jerusalem v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a026958/95, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 2001II; and Lewandowska-Malec, cited above, \u00a7\u00a065).",

The Court is unpersuaded by the above approach of the domestic courts. Firstly, it notes that the phrase at issue does not lend itself to a clear categorisation. In the Court\u2019s view the impugned phrase is something of a hybrid between a factual statement and a\u00a0value judgment with a prevalence of the latter element. Secondly, it notes that the impugned phrase was used by bailiff H.J. in his complaint to the State Prosecutor and then relayed by the applicant who deemed it to be an opinion. Thirdly, the critical issue for the proportionality of the interference is the question of a factual basis for the impugned statement. The Court notes in this respect that the impugned statement was used by the applicant in connection with various procedures involving judges and prosecutors by which bailiff H.J. attempted to elucidate the circumstances concerning the alleged theft of his hunting trophies. The numerous irregularities which he identified in respect of those procedures constituted, in the Court\u2019s view, a\u00a0sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement.",

The phrase at issue remains within the acceptable limits being closely connected with factual information provided by the applicant in his article (compare and contrast, Kania and Kittel v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a035105/04, \u00a7\u00a047, 21\u00a0June 2011). In this connection, the Court agrees with the domestic courts\u2019 position of the need to protect public confidence in the judiciary as confirmed in its own caselaw and the caselaw of the Polish Supreme Court. However, it does not find it established in the circumstances of the case that the use of the impugned expressions and the overall tone of the applicant\u2019s article, although undoubtedly critical, amounted to a destructive unjustified attack aimed at undermining the public confidence in the integrity of the judicial system as a whole (compare and contrast, Prager and Oberschlick, \u00a7\u00a036; and Kobenter and Standard Verlags GmbH, \u00a7\u00a031, both cited above).

It should be noted that the trial court recognised that the case involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and the public interest in maintaining the authority of the judiciary.

The former bailiff was suspected of embezzlement of PLN\u00a0370,000. In his article the applicant quoted a number of allegations made by H.J. against prosecutor R.M. He alleged that the prosecutor had remanded H.J. in custody for 2 years. Furthermore, he imputed that prosecutor R.M. had refused H.J.\u2019s requests for evidence to be adduced, prevented his access to the case file, failed to carry out a\u00a0confrontation between H.J. and M.K., refused H.J.\u2019s access to a lawyer and added a forged document to the case file. The Court recalls that it may be necessary to protect civil servants, including public prosecutors from offensive, abusive and defamatory attacks which are likely to affect them in the performance of their duties and to damage public confidence in them and the office they hold (see Janowski v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a025716/94, \u00a7\u00a033, ECHR 1999I; and Le\u0161n\u00edk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053).

However, they did not establish factual circumstances related to many of the applicant\u2019s imputations against prosecutor R.M. In its reasoning, the trial court found, inter alia, that \u201cthe bad faith of prosecutor R.M. who allegedly did not allow the accused\u2019s access to his lawyer has not been substantiated\u201d. In respect of the latter imputation, the trial court did not question its accuracy but went on to say that had it occurred then certainly a defence lawyer would have raised the matter in the course of the trial. By doing so, the court left unanswered a serious allegation that prosecutor R.M. had acted to the detriment of H.J. (see paragraph\u00a022 above). Similarly, it found that even if the accused (H.J.) did not have access to the case file in the course of the investigation he could have had such access during the trial. Another example concerned the applicant\u2019s allegation that prosecutor R.M. had belatedly added a forged document to the case file and changed the numbering of pages. The trial court\u2019s response to this was that documentary evidence may be added by each party at any stage of the proceedings and that, in any event, the document at issue was not decisive for H.J. However, the point raised by the applicant was how an allegedly forged document exonerating M.K. could have been added to the file after the investigation had been closed. It is noteworthy that on this issue the applicant consulted another prosecutor who confirmed that the adding of relevant documents to the file after the investigation had been closed was inappropriate (see paragraph\u00a09 above). The Court notes that this and other relevant factual issues were not elucidated by the domestic courts, which seem to have adopted a dismissive attitude to allegations relayed by the applicant. Nonetheless, they found that the applicant\u2019s allegations regarding prosecutor R.M. were not true.",

It noted that an average reader would understand that a familiarity between judges and prosecutors was a factor influencing their decisions, while those decisions should be based on neutral grounds. The Court notes that the impugned phrase carries with it a certain negative connotation; however its objective impact may be assessed only against the background of the article taken as a whole. It notes that the relevant part of the article concerned exclusively the allegations against prosecutor R.M. and his alleged mishandling of the investigation against H.J. Even if the expression used by the applicant may appear unfortunate, it does not seem directly relevant to the imputation that the prosecutor R.M. mishandled the investigation. On the other hand, the applicant wrote in the article that trainee bailiff M.K. had forged H.J.\u2019s signature but the prosecutor discontinued the investigation in this respect for lack of significant social danger.

The investigation into the alleged excess of authority was carried out by the Wroc\u0142awStare Miasto District Prosecutor\u2019s Office.

Finally, nearly 7 years after the criminal complaint had been filed, on 2\u00a0March 2005, the District Prosecutor formally discontinued the investigation in respect of the excess of authority on the ground that prosecution of the offence had become timebarred.

The lack of assessment of the applicant\u2019s diligence is particularly striking with regard to the second count of defamation. The applicant alleged that prosecutor R.M. had mishandled investigation against H.J. and provided a number of specific facts to support his allegation.

Bodnar of the Helsinki Foundation of Human Rights informed the Registrar that he was appointed the applicant\u2019s new representative and that the applicant intended to purse his application. The new representative submitted that Mr\u00a0A.\u00a0Rzepli\u0144ski left the Helsinki Foundation of Human Rights in January 2008. He explained that for this reason all correspondence addressed to Mr\u00a0A.\u00a0Rzepli\u0144ski did not reach the Foundation and that they were not aware of any deadline for the submission of observations in the present case. The new representative asked for extension of the timelimit for submission of the applicant\u2019s observations until 6\u00a0April 2011. The applicant\u2019s second new representative was Ms D. BychawskaSiniarska. Both new representatives requested authorisation from the President of the Section to act as the applicant\u2019s representatives under Rule\u00a036\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04\u00a0(a) of the Rules of Court. The President of the Section granted them leave to this effect on 4\u00a0May 2011.",
