The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see, Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2010). It is in the first place for the national authorities, and notably the courts, to interpret domestic law, and in particular, rules of a procedural nature and the Court will not substitute its own interpretation for theirs in the absence of arbitrariness. However, since under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention failure to comply with domestic law may entail a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (Toshev v. Bulgaria, no. 56308/00, \u00a7 58, 10 August 2006, and Shteyn (Stein) v. Russia, no. 23691/06, \u00a7\u00a7 89 and 94, 18 June 2009).",

The Court accepts that in cases concerning alleged organised crime, the risk that a detainee might put pressure on witnesses or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings if released is often particularly high. These factors can justify a longer period of detention; however, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend the preventive measure (see, Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-38, 4 May 2006, and Osuch v. Poland, no. 31246/02, \u00a7 26, 14\u00a0November 2006). Furthermore, the investigating judge considered that, in view of the fact that the applicant was of Chinese nationality (see paragraph 12 above) there was a risk of her absconding. Lastly, the investigating judge considered that there was a risk of her obstructing the investigation and continuing criminal activity. This reasoning was later reiterated by the Lisbon Court of Appeal on 14 September 2011 when it examined and rejected her request for release, having established no grounds for replacing detention on remand with a more lenient preventive measure (see paragraph 16 above).",

In this connection, particular regard must be had to the character of the person involved, his morals, assets, links with the State in which he is being prosecuted and international contacts (see Bolech v. Switzerland, no. 30138/12, \u00a7 47, 29 October 2013). The Court has also acknowledged that being of a nationality of a State which would make extradition impossible can justify pre-trial detention (Barfuss v. the Czech Republic, no. 35848/97, \u00a7\u00a7 69-70, 31 July 2000).",

It also notes that the domestic courts relied on the seriousness of the charges, the risk of her continuing criminal activity (which was committed from home) and the danger that the proceedings would be obstructed if she absconded or communicated with third parties (see paragraphs 12 and 16 above). Secondly, the Court observes that the national authorities took into consideration the fact that the crimes being investigated had been committed by an international criminal group of which the applicant was allegedly its leader in Portugal (see paragraph 12 above). Lastly, it takes note of the extradition treaty signed between the Portuguese Republic and the People\u2019s Republic of China which establishes the grounds for refusal if the person sought is a national of the requested party. The domestic courts analysed several factors to justify ordering the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention on 16 June 2011 (upheld by the Lisbon Court of Appeal on 14 September 2011), her nationality being one of them. Given the fact that she was a Chinese national and suspected of aiding Chinese illegal immigration, it would have been difficult for the domestic courts to avoid referring to her nationality, which was linked to the practice of the alleged crimes and an important factor for assessing the risk of her absconding. Having analysed all the factors concerning the applicant\u2019s situation, the domestic courts considered that her pre-trial detention would be proportionate and adequate to prevent the criminal proceedings from being frustrated or impeded. Consequently, the Court considers that the domestic courts\u2019 analysis was based on relevant factors and cannot be seen as arbitrary or discriminatory.",

Given the circumstances of the case, the Court is persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the relevant passage did not have a discriminatory intent.
