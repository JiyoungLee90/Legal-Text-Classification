His observation and treatment in this institution lasted more than a year. In the Court\u2019s view, the domestic courts should have assessed the risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding in the light of his serious psychiatric condition and should have considered his placement in a civilian institution, all the more so since, before his committal to the IMEI, he had already been detained for more than one and a half years. Instead, the courts limited themselves to reiterating that, given the seriousness of the charges against him, there was a risk that the applicant would abscond. The Court finds this implausible in the circumstances. Having regard to its overall duration, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, in particular after 17\u00a0October 2003, was justified.",
