The subject matter of an indictment was a specific act or event which, in the eyes of the public prosecutor, had brought about a punishable result.

The trial court had merely come to a different legal qualification on the facts. However, this did not exceed the terms of the indictment (Anklage\u00fcberschreitung). Moreover, the different legal qualification given to the offence was not in breach of the Convention. It was the main purpose of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention to achieve equality of arms between the prosecution and the defence.
