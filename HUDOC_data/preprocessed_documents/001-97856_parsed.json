The decision was mainly based on the investigation report submitted by the two police inspectors and the statements contained therein. The District Administrative Council held that it was believed to have been the applicant who had reported herself to the police for reasons unknown to them. Moreover, although she had remained calm and silent throughout her detention at the police headquarters, she had attempted to hurt herself severely on three separate occasions upon being confronted with her family. The conclusion was therefore drawn that the applicant's suicide attempt could not be related to her detention and that the applicant's relatives had done no more than provide conflicting statements without bringing forth any evidence or witnesses in support of their allegations.",

The State's responsibility, however, may be invoked if it can be proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant's selfdestructive behaviour was a direct result of adverse treatment she had received while in police custody, which was sufficiently severe to drive her to take her own life. It remains to be considered whether this causal link can be established.",

The parties, moreover, make entirely conflicting submissions on the events in question without presenting satisfactory documentary evidence, which severely hampers the Court's ability to make an assessment of the facts. In these circumstances the Court cannot but conclude that there is an insufficient factual and evidentiary basis on which to find \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d that the applicant was illtreated in police custody. This finding moreover precludes the Court from making any assessment as to whether the State authorities could be held accountable for the applicant's subsequent suicide attempt.",

Turkey, no.\u00a033086/04, \u00a7 42, 18 September 2008) and the results of such examinations play a crucial role in cases where the detainees raise allegations of ill-treatment. It further notes that, at the time of the events giving rise to this application, the medical examination of persons taken into police custody was a requirement to be fulfilled by the State authorities under Turkish law (see paragraph 36 above), and not the responsibility of the applicant as argued by the Government. Despite the foregoing, the Court observes that the applicant underwent a medical examination neither before being taken into custody at the Bah\u00e7elievler police headquarters, nor after her release from detention. In the Court's opinion, this procedural shortcoming reduced the possibility of a meaningful examination in respect of the State authorities' substantive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 48 above).",

The minimum standards applicable, as defined by the Court's case-law, include the requirement that the investigation be independent and impartial. In addition, for an investigation to be considered effective, the authorities must take whatever reasonable steps they can to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, a detailed statement concerning the allegations from the victim (see, for example, Mehmet\u00a0\u00dcmit Erdem v.
