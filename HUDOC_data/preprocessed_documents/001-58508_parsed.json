Turkey judgment of 2\u00a0September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, pp. 2437-38, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96), in which it was alleged that the security forces had connived in an attack on E\u015fref Ya\u015fa and his uncle who were both involved in the sale and distribution of \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem in Diyarbak\u0131r, the Court found that the Susurluk report did not provide a basis for enabling the perpetrators of the attack on E\u015fref Ya\u015fa and his uncle to be identified. It did find that the report gave rise to serious concerns and that it was not disputed in the Ya\u015fa case that there had been a number of serious attacks on journalists, newspaper kiosks and distributors of \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem. Furthermore, while the Susurluk report indeed may not be relied on for establishing to the required standard of proof that State officials were implicated in any particular incident, the Court considers that the report, which was drawn up at the request of the Prime Minister and which he decided should be made public, must be regarded as a serious attempt to provide information on and analyse problems associated with the fight against terrorism from a general perspective and to recommend preventive and investigative measures. On that basis, the report can be relied on as providing factual substantiation of the fears expressed by the applicants from 1992 onwards that the newspaper and persons associated with it were at risk from unlawful violence.",

In determining whether or not a positive obligation exists, regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interests of the individual, the search for which is inherent throughout the Convention. The scope of this obligation will inevitably vary, having regard to the diversity of situations obtaining in Contracting States, the difficulties involved in policing modern societies and the choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources. Nor must such an obligation be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (see, among other authorities, the Rees v. the United Kingdom judgment of 17 October 1986, Series A no.\u00a0106, p. 15, \u00a7 37, and the Osman v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, pp. 3159-60, \u00a7 116).",

However, the vast majority of the petitions and requests for protection submitted by the newspaper or its staff remained unanswered. The Government have only been able to identify one protective measure concerning the distribution of the newspaper which was taken while the newspaper was still in existence. The steps taken after the bomb attack at the Istanbul office in December 1994 concerned the newspaper's successor. The Court finds, having regard to the seriousness of the attacks and their widespread nature, that the Government cannot rely on the investigations ordered by individual public prosecutors into specific incidents. It is not convinced by the Government's contention that these investigations provided adequate or effective responses to the applicants' allegations that the attacks were part of a concerted campaign which was supported, or tolerated, by the authorities.",

While the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, for the protection of the vital interests of the State, such as the protection of national security or territorial integrity against the threat of violence or the prevention of disorder or crime, it is nevertheless incumbent on the press to convey information and ideas on political issues, even divisive ones. Not only has the press the task of imparting such information and ideas; the public has a right to receive them. Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of political leaders (see the Lingens judgment cited above, p. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42).",

However, it is significant that in two of the articles the officials named were not in fact alleged to be responsible for the misconduct but merely implicated in the surrounding events. In particular, concerning the death during detention, the \u015e\u0131rnak security director was cited as having previously reassured the family that the man would be released safely and the \u015e\u0131rnak chief public prosecutor was reported as being unavailable for comment.

Thus, the governor of the sate of emergency region who was named in one article was a public figure in the region, while the gendarmerie commanders and village guards named in the other articles would have been well known in their districts. The interest in protecting their identity was substantially diminished, therefore, and the potential damage which the restriction aimed at preventing was minimal. To the extent, therefore, that the authorities had relevant reasons to impose criminal sanctions, these could not be regarded as sufficient to justify the restrictions placed on the newspaper's freedom of expression (see, for example, S\u00fcrek v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], no. 24122/94, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-42, 8 July 1999, unreported). Accordingly, these measures could not be justified in terms of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

The Court notes that the use of the term \u201cKurdistan\u201d in a context which implies that it should be, or is, separate from the territory of Turkey, and the claims by persons to exercise authority on behalf of that entity, may be highly provocative to the authorities. However, the public has the right to be informed of different perspectives on the situation in south-east Turkey, irrespective of how unpalatable those perspectives appear to the authorities. The Court is not convinced that, even against the background of serious disturbances in the region, expressions which appear to support the idea of a separate Kurdish entity must be regarded as inevitably exacerbating the situation. While several of the articles were highly critical of the authorities and attributed unlawful conduct to the security forces, sometimes in colourful and derogatory terms, the Court nonetheless finds that they cannot be reasonably regarded as advocating or inciting the use of violence. Having regard to the severity of the penalties, it concludes that the restrictions imposed on the newspaper's freedom of expression disclosed in these cases were disproportionate to the aim pursued and cannot be justified as \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",

In support of its claims, it has alleged only hypothetical, illusory and imaginary facts, without providing any evidence. In short, it was speculating and, furthermore, certain matters relied on bore no relation whatsoever to the truth. I shall refer to only one of the allegations, so that it can be seen in the light of a finding of the European Commission of Human Rights based on its own investigation in a previous case. Thus, according to the applicant company, prior to the actions of the authorities, the newspaper \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem was selling 45,000 copies per day. That figure fell to 30,000 and the newspaper disappeared permanently as a result of those actions (see paragraph 77 of the judgment). That account is shown to be untrue by the Commission. The Commission stated in its report of 23 October 1998 in the case of K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkey (application\u00a0no.\u00a022492/93, \u00a7 176): \u201c\u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem was a daily newspaper ... with a national circulation of some thousand copies ... In or about April 1994, \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem ceased publication and was succeeded by another newspaper, \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00dclke ...\u201d The difference between the alleged figure and the Commission's figure is striking. In addition, \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem disappeared only in theory, since it was replaced by \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00dclke. That clearly shows the fanciful and speculative nature of the claim for pecuniary damage in the instant case.",
