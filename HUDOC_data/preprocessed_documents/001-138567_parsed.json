It endorsed the lower court\u2019s conclusion that the transaction itself had indeed taken place, but that the claimant\u2019s alleged involvement in it had been presented in a tendentious and unreliable manner.

The Press Act 1984 obliged them to comply with the obligation of diligence by contacting persons about whom they wished to write prior to the publication of such material (I CSK 385/07). Such an obligation was all the more important in the present case because, given the claimant\u2019s prosecutorial function in cases against P.T. and S.W., the testimony of the latter could not be accepted uncritically. The journalists had failed to try to contact the claimant, had accepted S.W.\u2019s statements in an undiscriminating manner and had failed to contact P.T. prior to publishing the article.",

However, this protection was not absolute. It could be limited by the legitimate aims listed in paragraph 2 of this provision. Journalists making allegations about individuals were obliged to show that there was sufficient factual basis for their assertions (here it referred to Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, ECHR 2004XI). Not only should statements of fact be consistent with the material gathered for the purposes of the press articles, but value judgments should also have a sound factual basis (here it cited D\u0105browski v. Poland, no. 18235/02, 19\u00a0December 2006). These principles were equally applicable to situations where the administration of justice or judges or prosecutors were criticised by the press (citing Barfod v. Denmark, 22 February 1989, Series A no.\u00a0149; Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, Series A no. 313; and Le\u0161n\u00edk v. Slovakia, no. 35640/97, ECHR 2003IV). The Supreme Court reiterated that informing the general public of improper conduct on the part of public prosecutors served the general interest, but the guarantees enshrined in Article 10 could be successfully relied on only where journalists had reliable and precise information at their disposal that could justify levelling such serious charges against public officials. No such factual information had been put forward by the defendants in the present case. The courts had not therefore erred in finding against them.",

Russia, no. 29492/05, \u00a7 46, 26 February 2009, mutatis mutandis). Public prosecutors are civil servants whose task it is to contribute to the proper administration of justice. In this respect they form part of the judicial machinery in the broader sense of this term (see Le\u0161n\u00edk, cited above, \u00a7 54). The Court takes note of the applicant\u2019s argument that the character of the claimant\u2019s public function was such as to justify close public scrutiny (see paragraph 45 above). The Court accepts that personal integrity of public prosecutors is a subject which may be of legitimate interest to the general public. However, it may be necessary to protect public servants from offensive, abusive and defamatory attacks which are likely to affect them in the performance of their duties and to damage public confidence in them and the office they hold (see Janowski. [GC], cited above, and Le\u0161n\u00edk, cited above, \u00a7 53). The extent to which such protection might be deemed necessary depends on the particular circumstances of the case. Whilst in the present case the applicant company considered that it was its duty to alert the public to an important issue of general interest, the fact that the article concerned a prosecutor did not exempt it from the obligation to provide a sufficient factual basis for the allegations.",

However, the courts found that the same could not be said of the statements by S.W. to the effect that the claimant had been aware of and had participated in the transaction, still less that she had acted as illicit \u201cprotection\u201d for her former husband. In this connection, the courts found that S.W. had never met the claimant, that he had relied only on what her former husband had told him and, crucially, that he had not recognised the claimant before the civil court. Taken as a whole, the courts found that the statements contained in the article referring to the claimant\u2019s conduct, both in connection with the drug-trafficking transaction and the insinuations concerning her alleged involvement in drug trafficking, were not supported by the evidence.",

It also applied the test of adequate diligence in assessing whether the journalists had discharged their obligations. The first-instance court found that the journalists had not exercised sufficient diligence when making their allegations about the claimant\u2019s involvement, which were, in the court\u2019s view, not sufficiently supported by the facts. In particular, the first-instance court regarded the effort of the researcher and the journalist to get in touch with the claimant as \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d and observed that no evidence had been submitted showing that M.Sz. had indeed tried to call her before publication of the impugned article.",
