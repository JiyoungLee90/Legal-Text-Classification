After the applicant filed a motion for judgment in default of defence on 22 June 1998, it appears a first defence was served out of time on 7 July 1998. A second defence was served on 16 September 1998. After the service of this second defence, a motion filed by the applicant for judgment in default was dismissed by consent on 17 September 1998. On 25 January 1999 the defendants filed a motion for a split trial between liability and quantum issues, which was dismissed on 25 October 2000. It appears that there had been no correspondence between the parties and the High Court between 27 July 1999 and 6 January 2000, leading the High Court to write to the defendants on 26 January 2000 indicating, inter alia, that Acting Deemster Hall \u201cwas very anxious to progress the matter\u201d.

On 20 December 2002 the applicant issued a motion for additional time to serve a further expert report to which the defendants responded with a motion that the action be struck out for non-compliance with orders of the High Court.

In addition, a substantial proportion of the delay in the proceedings was caused by the applicant himself. In particular, he was responsible for an initial two year delay in serving the summons. He had pursued a motion for judgment in default even after the defence had been served and failed to serve his list of documents until five months after it was due to be served.

However, the damages awarded, which included interest, amounted to over GBP 19,000 and were not negligible. Furthermore, in light of the difficulties encountered in the previous proceedings, the CJM proceedings had taken on an added significance for the applicant. In this connection the Court also notes the conclusion of the trial judge that the applicant and his wife were victims of negligence on the part of DOLGE and Mr Carter, a conclusion that led him to state his 'enormous sympathy' for them.",

The Court also finds that the applicant bears primary responsibility for the initial delay in the proceedings due to the failure promptly to serve the summons on the defendants, though it also notes that time for service was extended by the High Court on 27 February 2007.",

The Court is particularly struck by the fact that it took one year and ten months for the defendant's motion for a split trial to be heard and dismissed. In this respect it is also significant that during this period the only other developments in the proceedings were the service of the applicant's list of documents and the letter from the High Court of 26 January 2000. The Court also notes the fact that after the dismissal of this motion, the greater part of 2001 and 2002 was taken up by successive amendments and re-amendments to the statement of case, the defence and reply. The Court recognises that some responsibility for these delays must lie with the parties and that they agreed to a series of consent orders revising the timetable for the proceedings. However, this does not absolve the State from the requirement to deal with cases in a reasonable time. The Court recalls that the State remains responsible for the efficiency of its system (Guincho v. Portugal, judgment of 10 July 1984, Series A no. 81, \u00a7\u00a038) and the manner in which it provides for mechanisms to comply with the reasonable time requirement \u2013 whether by automatic time-limits and directions or some other method \u2013 is for it to decide. If a State allows proceedings to continue beyond the \u201creasonable time\u201d prescribed by Article 6 of the Convention without doing anything to advance them, it will be responsible for the resultant delay (see Price and Lowe v. the , nos. 43185/98 and 43186/98, \u00a7\u00a023, 29 July 2003, together with further references therein). In this respect, the Court notes that it does not appear that the High Court took active steps to expedite the proceedings until its orders of 31 October 2002 and 12 February 2003. The Court therefore considers that the delays in the CJM proceedings derived, to a large extent, from the failure by the State to take adequate steps to advance the proceedings and, more generally, to organise its system in such a way as to meet its Convention obligations (see also Mitchell and Holloway v. the , no. 44808/98, \u00a7\u00a054, 17\u00a0December 2002).",
