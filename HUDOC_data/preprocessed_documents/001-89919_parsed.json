In this regard the Court observes that the information about the killing of Alaudin Gandaloyev was published on behalf of the Headquarters, which had received it from the field report about the activities of federal forces and law-enforcement agencies in the Achkhoy-Martan district on 17-18 September 2003. The Court further notes that the deputy head of the Operational Troops provided the criminal investigation with sufficiently detailed information concerning the contents of the field report. According to his statement, the document had stated that A. Gandaloyev and V. Badayev had opened fire on a group of officers from the Achkhoy-Martan district department of the interior (the Achkhoy-Martan ROVD), the district military commander\u2019s office and the OMON (the special task-force unit) from the Tver region (see paragraph 50 above). The Court further observes that the content of the radio announcement and the newspaper article announcing the killing of the applicant\u2019s husband by a unit of federal forces had never been refuted by the authorities. In that context, the Government have not asserted that the officer Sh. had provided incorrect information; nor have any proceedings been pursued against that officer for providing this information to the mass-media (see paragraph 58 above). The Court also pays attention to the fact that the decision of the Achkhoy-Martan District Court stating that the investigation into Alaudin Gandaloyev\u2019s murder had obtained enough information implicating military servicemen in the crime was taken in November 2004, that is to say six months after the transfer of the criminal case from the unit military prosecutor\u2019s office back to the inter-district prosecutor\u2019s office (see paragraph 39 above).",

The Government referred to the threat note and the dead rabbit found by the agency\u2019s employees in May 2003. In this regard the Court observes that the investigators in criminal case no.\u00a044073 questioned two employees of the forestry agency about the discovery of the threat note shortly after the beginning of the investigation, on 22 September 2003, and collected the note on the same date. However, it appears that on the basis of all the information the investigators considered that military servicemen were implicated in the crime and on 29 October 2003 they transferred the investigation in the criminal case from the inter-district prosecutor\u2019s office to the unit military prosecutor\u2019s office.",

The Court has also noted the difficulty for the applicants to obtain the necessary evidence in support of allegations in cases where the respondent Government are in possession of the relevant documentation and fail to submit it. Where the applicant makes out a prima facie case and the Court is prevented from reaching factual conclusions owing to the lack of such documents, it is for the Government to argue conclusively why the documents in question cannot serve to corroborate the allegations made by the applicants, or to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred. The burden of proof is thus shifted to the Government and if they fail in their arguments, issues will arise under Article 2 and/or Article 3 (see To\u011fcu v.

In spite of having sole jurisdiction to conduct an investigation into the crimes allegedly committed by military servicemen, in almost six months of investigation the military investigators carried out only a few investigative actions, such as questioning three military officers and receiving responses to information requests made by the inter-district prosecutor\u2019s office. They failed to undertake a number of investigative measures which fell solely within their competence, such as identifying and questioning the officers from the district military commander\u2019s office and the OMON from the Tver region who, according to the statement of the deputy head of the Operational Troops, had opened fire on Alaudin Gandaloyev and his colleague and killed them (see paragraph 50 above). Furthermore, the investigators failed to obtain the registration log of local law-enforcement agencies and military forces which, according to the head of the Headquarters officer Sh., contained the record about the discovery of the corpses of Alaudin Gandaloyev and Viskha Badayev during the mopping-up operation (see paragraph 54 above). The investigation failed to explain the discrepancies between the content of the newspaper article concerning the evidence seized at the scene of Alaudin Gandaloyev\u2019s murder (AK-74 5.45 machine-guns \u2013 2 items, magazines for AK-74 \u2013 4\u00a0items, F-1 [grenades] - 8 items, 5.45 cartridges \u2013 275 items) and the crime scene examination report of 17 September 2003 according to which only 2\u00a0bullets and 6 bullet casings had been collected from the scene and the witness statements obtained by the investigators from officer K. (questioned on 18 February 2004) and officer V. (questioned on 27 April 2004) to the same effect (see paragraphs 17, 42, 51 and 60 above).",

The passage of time will inevitably erode the amount and quality of the evidence available and the appearance of a lack of diligence will cast doubt on the good faith of the investigative efforts, as well as drag out the ordeal for the members of the family (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).
