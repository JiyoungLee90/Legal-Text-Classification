The domestic courts\u2019 interpretation of Articles 129 and 46 had been sufficiently clear and foreseeable. They also claimed that the domestic courts\u2019 interpretation had been supported by the text of Article 54 of the 2002 Code which had explicitly listed that requirement. Having issued a power of attorney for her husband, the applicant must have believed that he would adequately protect her interests, as if he were a professional lawyer.

Nevertheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. They must pursue a legitimate aim and there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see, among other authorities, Khalfaoui v.

France, judgment of 30 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII, p.\u00a03350, \u00a7\u00a047). In the present case the domestic courts, by way of preliminary procedural decisions, disallowed the applicant\u2019s applications with reference to Article\u00a0129 \u00a7 9 of the 1964 Code. Under this provision, a judge could refuse to accept for examination a statement of claim submitted by a person who was not properly authorised to do so (see paragraph 13 above). In each set of proceedings, the applicant\u2019s representative received a decision putting him on notice that the court held the view that his written authority to act did not include an authorisation to sign and lodge on the applicant\u2019s behalf the statement of claim in question and affording the applicant and opportunity to rectify what it had considered a shortcoming (compare Grof v. Austria, no. 25046/94, Commission decision of 14 April 1998). Instead of seeking to do so, the representative opted to lodge an appeal, but on each occasion the appellate court upheld the lower court\u2019s decision.",

In this connection it is to be reiterated that it is not the Court\u2019s task to take the place of the domestic courts and it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. This applies, in particular, to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature. The Court\u2019s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see P\u00e9rez de Rada Cavanilles v. Spain, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII, p.\u00a03235, \u00a7\u00a043, and Ivanova v. , (dec.), no. 53504/99, 28\u00a0May 2002).",

It is also to be noted that the applicant did not contest their argument or otherwise submit that the courts\u2019 interpretation of the impugned provision had been unforeseeable and if so for what reason. Neither did she argue that she was in any manner prevented from seeking professional legal advice at the time when she wished to issue the proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Ca\u00f1ete de Go\u00f1i v. Spain, no.\u00a055782/00, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2002VIII). In sum, the Court considers that the condition imposed by the national courts for the applicant to pursue her suits before them was not such as to render the procedure unforeseeable from the point of view of the applicant (see Levages Prestations Services v. France, judgment of 23 October 1996, Reports 1996V, p.\u00a01453, \u00a7\u00a042).",

Greece, judgment of 16 December 1997, Reports 1997VIII, p.\u00a02857, \u00a7\u00a041, and De Geouffre de la Pradelle v.

In the case at hand the domestic courts advised the applicant and her representative of the need to rectify what could reasonably be considered a simple formality. In particular, the applicant had two options \u2013 either to sign her statements of claims or to issue Mr Kolovangin with a proper power of attorney. It has not been submitted that either option was impracticable for the applicant, for example by reason of difficulties to meet time-limits, or otherwise impossible to comply with. Hence, in the Court\u2019s opinion, it cannot be said that the essence of the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court was impaired or that the proportionality principle was not respected in the present case.",
