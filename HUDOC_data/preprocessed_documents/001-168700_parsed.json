Russia, no. 7097/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-62 and 89, 6 December 2011). The Court concluded that, under Russian law, there was no further recourse against that judgment that might potentially lead to reinstatement of the applicant\u2019s title to the flat. It further noted that the possibility of bringing an action for damages, in those circumstances, could not deprive the applicant of victim status for the purpose of complaints under Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. Nor could doing so be regarded as necessary for compliance with the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Lastly, the Court considered that any damages that the applicant might have been able to recover against the seller of the flat might only be taken into account for the purposes of assessing the proportionality of the interference and, calculation of pecuniary damage if a violation of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention was found by the Court, and if just satisfaction was awarded under Article 41 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a062).",

The fact that the authorities investigated Yar.\u2019s actions and, at the same time, condoned his selling the flat to the applicant is a matter of concern for the Court.",

However, in the particular circumstances, of the case, such action would be devoid of any prospect of success given that (1) the person who had sold the flat to the applicant had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment and all his property had been confiscated by the State and (2) the authorities have not established to date the identity of all perpetrators involved in the fraudulent acquisition of the flat in 2001 (see paragraph 13 above).",

However, it was not for the first applicant to assume the risk of the title to the flat being revoked on account of the said omissions on the part of the authorities in procedures especially designed to prevent fraud in real-property transactions. The Court reiterates that mistakes or errors on the part of State authorities should serve to benefit the persons affected. In other words, the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova v. Russia, no. 15711/13, \u00a7\u00a049, 29 January 2015, with further references). The Court therefore concludes that the forfeiture of the title to the flat by the first applicant and its transfer to the City of Moscow, in the circumstances of the case, placed a disproportionate and excessive burden on her (compare, Gladysheva, cited, above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a077-83).

Belgium (Article\u00a050), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85; Tchitchinadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a018156/05, \u00a7 69, 27 May 2010; Fener Rum Patrikli\u011fi (Ecumenical Patriarchy) v.

Consequently, having due regard to its findings in the instant case and to the fact that the applicant did not receive any compensation for loss of title to the flat in the domestic proceedings, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to restore the applicant\u2019s title to the flat and to reverse the order for her eviction. Thus, the applicant would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which she would have been had there not been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (compare, Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106).

Here again the information regarding the fraud was accessible only after the purchase by applicant. As to the balance among the various interests in the case it is noteworthy that the Court orders full restitution of the applicant\u2019s title, even though a person entitled to social housing has been living there since 2010. The Court does not specify which authorities are to be held responsible, but refers only to \u201cso many authorities having granted clearance to the title to the flat\u201d (see paragraph 53). In fact, the authority issuing passports, the Housing Department and the Registration Service were acting in an official capacity. At one point the notary is also involved (issuing a certificate of inheritance; see paragraph 9). This judgment (though not the \u201csister\u201d judgments) refers, in the Relevant Domestic Law section, to the Fundamental Principles of Notarial Legislation 1993, which point out that the notary conducts notarial acts on behalf of the Russian Federation (see paragraph 47). The Court considers it sufficient that the notary and the State organisations were involved in the various decisions leading to the situation whereby the embezzled State property was sold to a bona fide third party. We do not know whether any professional mistake was committed by the notary, a private professional. I am concerned that this could lead to the extension of notarial liability all over Europe and also to the extension of State liability under international law for the acts of private professionals.",
