Concerning the reason for this, the preparatory works to the Act state, inter alia: \u201cWith resident aliens and Danish nationals of foreign extraction it is a widespread marriage pattern to marry a person from their countries of origin, among other reasons due to parental pressure [...]. The Government finds that the attachment requirement, as it is worded today, does not take sufficient account of the existence of this marriage pattern among both resident foreigners and resident Danish nationals of foreign extraction. There are thus also Danish nationals who are not well-integrated in Danish society and where integration of a spouse newly arrived in Denmark may therefore entail major problems.\u201d By Act No. 1204 of 27 December 2003, the application of the attachment requirement to Danish nationals was restricted through the 28-year rule, and the preparatory works to the Act stated that the purpose was, inter alia, \u201cto ensure that Danish expatriates with strong and lasting ties to Denmark in the form of at least 28 years of Danish nationality will be able to obtain spousal reunion in Denmark\u201d.

In our opinion it is dubious whether there is any basis for such restrictive interpretation as the provision, according to its wording, comprises any difference in treatment exercised as a consequence of how and when nationality was acquired. As appears from the explanatory report, the provision is not a prohibition from which no derogation may be made, and the provision must be taken to mean that it may be derogated from if the difference in treatment is objectively justified and proportionate. However, when assessing the 28-year rule relative to Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention, we consider it necessary to include the fact that, at least according to its wording, Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the European Convention on Nationality comprises a general provision stating that any difference in treatment between different groups of a State Party\u2019s own nationals is basically prohibited.",

In this respect, the Supreme Court referred to paragraphs 84 to 86 of the judgment delivered by the European Court of Human Rights on 28 May 1985 in Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom. Difference in treatment based on nationality must be seen, inter alia, in the light of the right of Danish nationals to settle in Denmark, and no significance can be attributed to the fact that such discrimination is not considered contrary to Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 8 when assessing whether it is permissible to implement a scheme implying difference in treatment between different groups of Danish nationals. In our opinion, no crucial significance can be attributed to paragraphs 87 to 89 of the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment either in this assessment, among others because difference in treatment based on the length of a person\u2019s period of nationality is not comparable to difference in treatment based on place of birth.",

Such strong attachment to Denmark will exist in most cases in which a person has held Danish nationality for 28 years. However, when assessing whether the difference in treatment implied by the 28-year rule can be considered objectively justified, it is not sufficient to compare persons not raised in Denmark who acquire Danish nationality later in life with the large group of persons who were born Danish nationals and were also raised in Denmark. If exemption from the attachment requirement was justified only by regard for the latter group of Danish nationals, the exemption should have been delimited differently. The crucial element must therefore be a comparison with persons who were born Danish nationals and have been Danish nationals for 28 years, but who were not raised in Denmark and may perhaps not at any time have had their residence in Denmark. In our opinion, it cannot be considered a fact that, from a general perspective, this group of Danish nationals has stronger ties with Denmark than persons who have acquired Danish nationality after entering and residing in Denmark for a number of years. It should be taken into consideration in that connection that one of the general conditions for acquiring Danish nationality by naturalisation is that the relevant person has resided in Denmark for at least nine years, has proved his or her proficiency in the Danish language and knowledge of Danish society and meets the requirement of self-support.",

If a person obtained the citizenship at birth, the aggregate ties requirement will not be considered if the person is at least 28 years old. However, it continues to be applied in relation to a person who was later naturalised, until the 28 years of citizenship is achieved, unless he or she was born in Denmark or arrived as a child, in which case the length of citizenship requirement is substituted by an equally long residence requirement. These provisions do not in my view guarantee the principle of equality before the law.\u201d",

Hence the provision does not stipulate that the resident spouse must have been a Danish national for 28 years to acquire family reunion, but only that the attachment requirement will be derogated from in such cases, if relevant. In a letter of 15 October 2004 to the Danish Government the Commissioner added the following clarification of his views:",

It is of course true that the 28-years rule applies equally to all citizens. It follows, however, that whilst the exemption from the aggregate ties condition will apply to a 28 year old citizen born in Denmark, it will do so, for instance, only, allowing for the current 9 years residence requirement for naturalization, at the age of 57 for a citizen who first settled in Denmark at the age of 20. The dispensation from the aggregate ties conditions for a naturalised citizen, for whom the condition will, inevitably, be harder to meet in virtue of his or her own foreign origin, at so late an age constitutes, in my view, an excessive restriction to the right to family life and clearly discriminates between Danish citizens on the basis of their origin in the enjoyment of this fundamental right.\u201d",

They should normally have sufficient means of subsistence, adequate housing, health insurance and the national spouse should often have a registered place of residence in the country. Some countries require that spouses should have reached either 18 or 21 years of age. The requirement that candidates should have basic knowledge of the national language is also common. Furthermore, there should be no other grounds for the refusal of a permit, such as marriages of convenience, giving false identity and/or documents, concerns of public order or security and public health, a criminal record and being a burden on the welfare system. Some countries specify that candidates should not have links with extremist or terrorist structures or with organised crime. A number of countries condemn in particular giving false identity and statements in the proceedings. In a number of countries, the unlawful entry/stay of an alien is an impediment to the acquisition of the residence permit. However, some countries specify that it is not.\u00a0Some countries may provide for special conditions, for instance in view of the prevention of polygamy or human trafficking. The requirements for family reunion usually vary depending on the type of permit sought. For long-stay permits and the acquisition of nationality, the duration of the marriage, the existence of genuine life community and residence in the country are relevant factors.",

Moreover, Article 8 does not entail a general obligation for a State to respect immigrants\u2019 choice of the country of their residence and to authorise family reunion in its territory.\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, in a case which concerns family life as well as immigration, the extent of a State\u2019s obligations to admit to its territory relatives of persons residing there will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest (see, for example, Butt v. Norway, no. 47017/09, \u00a7\u00a070, 4\u00a0December 2012; Antwi and Others v. Norway, no. 26940/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08889, 14\u00a0February 2012; Nunez v. Norway, no. 55597/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a066-70, 28\u00a0June 2011; Darren Omoregie and Others v. Norway, no. 265/07, \u00a7 64, 31 July\u00a02008; Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7\u00a039 and \u00a7 43, ECHR 2006I; Priya v. Denmark (dec.), 13549/03, 6\u00a0July 2006 and G\u00fcl v. Switzerland, judgment of 19\u00a0February 1996, Reports 1996-I). Factors to be taken into account in this context are the extent to which family life is effectively ruptured, the extent of the ties in the Contracting State, whether there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in the country of origin of one or more of them and whether there are factors of immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion (see Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above; Ajayi and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 27663/95, 22 June 1999; Solomon v.\u00a0the Netherlands (dec.), no. 44328/98, 5 September 2000). Another important consideration is whether family life was created at a time when the persons involved were aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence of that family life within the host State would from the outset be precarious (see Jerry Olajide Sarumi v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 43279/98, 26\u00a0January 1999 and Andrey Sheabashov v. Latvia (dec.), no. 50065/99, 22\u00a0May 1999). Where this is the case the removal of the non-national family member would be incompatible with Article 8 only in exceptional circumstances (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali, cited above, \u00a7 68; Mitchell v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 40447/98, 24 November 1998, and Ajayi and Others, cited above; and Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above).",

In 2003 he married the second applicant, and they then submitted an application for spousal reunion in Denmark. The application was finally refused in 2004. The factual circumstances of the case are thus in all material aspects identical to Mrs Balkandali\u2019s situation in the judgment Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom (cited above) in which the Court found that the principle of proportionality had not been violated. She was born in Egypt in 1946 or 1948. She first went to the United Kingdom in 1973 and obtained nationality of the United Kingdom and Colonies in 1979. She married a Turkish national in 1981, and their application for spousal reunion in the United Kingdom, on the grounds that he was the husband of a British national, was refused later in 1981. A comparison of the two cases reveals that both the first applicant in this case and Mrs Balkandali only came to Denmark and the United Kingdom, respectively, as adults. In the first applicant\u2019s case, the application was refused when he had resided in Denmark for 11 years, two of which as a Danish national. In Mrs Balkandali\u2019s case, the application was refused after she had resided in the United Kingdom for eight years, two of which as a British national.",

The normal situation is that a 28-year-old who has been a Danish national from birth or has legally resided in Denmark from early childhood with the resulting childhood spent in a Danish culture will have stronger real ties with Denmark and insight into Danish society than the first applicant, who only started having ties with Danish society at the age of 22. Hence, the Government found that the approximately ten years that the first applicant spent in Denmark prior to the refusal did not confer on him a special link to Denmark comparable to the special link held by a person falling within the 28-year rule.",

For persons born Danish nationals, the rule only implied that the attachment requirement applied until they were 28 years old. For persons not raised in Denmark who acquired Danish nationality later in life, the rule implied that the attachment requirement applied until 28 years have passed after the date when any such person became a Danish national. For example, the first applicant, who became a Danish national at the age of 31, will be subject to the attachment requirement until he is 59 years old. The 28-year rule will therefore affect persons who acquire Danish nationality later in life far more often and with a far greater impact than persons born with Danish nationality.

The majority of the Supreme Court also referred to the preparatory works to Act no. 1204 of 27\u00a0December 2003 introducing the 28-year rule which relaxed section 9, subsection 7, of the Aliens Act, so that in cases where one of the partners had been a Danish national for at least 28 years, family reunion was no longer subject to the attachment requirement. The preparatory works stated that the fundamental aim of tightening the attachment requirement in 2002, to include Danish nationals, would not be forfeited by refraining from demanding that the attachment requirement be met in cases where the resident person has been a Danish national for 28\u00a0years. It was mentioned in that connection that Danish expatriates planning to return to Denmark one day with their families would often have maintained strong ties with Denmark, which were also communicated to their spouse or cohabitant and any children. This was achieved when they spoke Danish at home, took holidays in Denmark, read Danish newspapers regularly, and so on. Thus, there would normally be a basis for a successful integration of Danish expatriates\u2019 family members into Danish society.

It is even difficult to imagine how a person acquiring Danish nationality at the average age for creating a family can expect to do so with a foreign spouse in Denmark. This finding is in line with that of the Commissioner for Human Rights, who in a letter of 15\u00a0October 2004 to the Danish Government stated: \u201cMy concern is that this requirement places undue restrictions on naturalised Danish citizens and places them at considerable disadvantage in comparison to Danish citizens born in Denmark. It is of course true that the 28-years rule applies equally to all citizens. It follows, however, that whilst the exemption from the aggregate ties condition will apply to a 28 year old citizen born in Denmark, it will do so, for instance, only, allowing for the current 9 years residence requirement for naturalization, at the age of 57 for a citizen who first settled in Denmark at the age of 20. The dispensation from the aggregate ties conditions for a naturalised citizen, for whom the condition will, inevitably, be harder to meet in virtue of his or her own foreign origin, at so late an age constitutes, in my view, an excessive restriction to the right to family life and clearly discriminates between Danish citizens on the basis of their origin in the enjoyment of this fundamental right\u201d (see paragraph 38).",

(For exceptions which do not apply in the present case see, inter alia, paragraphs 31, 33, 69, 72, 86, 89, 90 and 100.)

Thus, the requirement that a Danish citizen has to meet in order to be allowed to reunite in Denmark with his or her foreign spouse includes two alternatives: he or she must meet either (i) the 28-year citizenship criterion or (ii) the criterion of both spouses\u2019 stronger aggregate ties to Denmark.

To assume that birth to Danish nationals per se results in attachment is a fiction, or even two, as this approach is based on (i) the fictional assumption about the attachment of any foreign-born non-resident Danish citizen to Danish society, and (ii) on the generalised suspicion that any long-term-resident naturalised Danish citizen with proven attachment to Denmark does not provide guarantees of attachment when it comes to family reunion.",

In the present case, the \u201cgeneral context\u201d is the impact on a class of citizens who are treated with suspicion on the ground of their alleged lack of strong ties due to their national origin, regardless of whether they are longstanding residents, even longstanding citizens, have no other citizenship or any other formal affiliation with another country, and so on. It is in this \u201cgeneral context\u201d that these nationals will be considered second-class citizens who lack \u201cproperly\u201d strong ties to their country of citizenship and, thus, will rightfully feel discriminated against.",

Citing Taxquet the majority claim that \u201cit is not the Court\u2019s task to review the [national] legislation in the abstract\u201d (paragraph 103 of the judgment). The majority\u2019s analysis is thus restricted to the specific burden which the 28-year rule had placed on both applicants jointly. It is argued that the spouses\u2019 \u201caggregate ties to Denmark were clearly not stronger than their ties to another country\u201d (paragraph 105). But the issue is not, first and foremost, how integrated the wife is. True it is \u2013 and it goes without saying \u2013 that a spousal reunion is a union of two, but it is a union in which each spouse exercises his or her individual choice, individual determination and individual right to be united with the partner in marriage. Therefore, the husband\u2019s restricted possibility of family reunion in his country of citizenship, Denmark, concerns not only their joint right to reunion but also his individual right, which has to be considered not only jointly with that of the spouse but, as in the case of non-resident nationals who were born or raised in Denmark, also separately. In the event that the husband\u2019s individual right to family reunion in Denmark is breached by the application of the Act, this (with a spousal reunion seen as a union of two) also entails that the corresponding right of the wife must be considered breached even without any \u201cjoint\u201d examination. In the present case, the fact that the first applicant\u2019s right to family reunion had been breached by the application of the Act is clearly proved by the discriminatory manner in which this Act treats immigrants who were naturalised in their adulthood (no matter how long ago, provided that this term is shorter than twenty-eight years) vis-\u00e0-vis those citizens who are not Danish citizens by birth but were born or raised in this country: a person belonging to the latter category may have an equally \u201cunattached\u201d foreign spouse, but no \u201cjoint\u201d consideration is required in such a case!",

Even if we do not claim that the Amendment resulted in the kind of racist or ethnic discrimination that was found unacceptable in Abdulaziz, we find that the Government have not provided an objective justification for the disparate, disadvantageous treatment of a group of Danish citizens, namely naturalised citizens, nor have they provided reasonable justification for such different treatment on the factual ground of ethnic or national origin which would have required weighty reasons, especially given the rather narrow margin of appreciation that States have in family reunification matters (see paragraph 15 above).",

This second-generation (and, from the point of view discussed here, also second-class) Danish citizen, owing to the severity of the Act, but also owing to the judgment of this Court, will obviously not be raised in Denmark. Were he to marry a foreigner (which is more likely when a citizen lives all his life abroad) comparatively early, he would be able to reunite with his spouse in Denmark only in 2032, after having reached the age of twenty-eight. The applicants\u2019 family are forced to live abroad if they wish to live as a family and the Act obliges them to educate their Danish child abroad.
