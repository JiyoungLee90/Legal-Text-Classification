The Government argued that as the diagnosis of \u201cblunt trauma of the abdomen\u201d was based only on the applicant\u2019s statements, the medical record of 27 November 2005 does not prove that the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment. However,\u00a0the Court does not consider that the letter of 7 February 2011 can be used to call into question the medical record of 27 November 2005. In particular, the Court observes that the medical record of 27 November 2005 was delivered immediately after the incident, following a medical examination of the applicant by a doctor, whereas the letter of 7\u00a0February\u00a02011 was issued without any medical examination of the applicant, more than five years after the incident. In any event, the Court does not see how the author of the letter of 7 February 2011 could challenge a diagnosis established five years before, without examining the patient at the material time. In view of the above, the Court considers that the medical record of 27\u00a0November\u00a02005, despite certain shortcomings, constitutes reliable medical evidence and that, for the purposes of the present complaint, its content is sufficient to conclude that the applicant suffered \u201cblunt trauma of the abdomen\u201d (compare Rizvanov, cited above, \u00a7 47).",

The Court further observes that upon her arrival at the hospital the applicant stated that she had been beaten in Galaba Square by police officers. In any event, there is no indication that any other person or group other than the police used force on 26 November 2005 at Galaba Square during the dispersal of the demonstration. In these circumstances, the Court does not see any contradiction or inconsistency in the applicant\u2019s submission that the \u201cblunt trauma of the abdomen\u201d described in the medical certificate of 27\u00a0November 2005 was inflicted by the police on 26\u00a0November 2005. The concordant evidence produced before the Court is sufficient to establish that the police officers kicked the applicant in the abdominal area during the dispersal of the demonstration. In the Court\u2019s opinion, neither the Government in their submissions, nor the domestic courts in their decisions, provided a convincing rebuttal of this presumption (see, mutatis mutandis, Najafli v.
