Except for 29 June 2005 the Court cannot establish beyond reasonable doubt that the conditions were such as to amount to a violation of Article\u00a03 of the Convention. As for the 29 June 2005 the Court accepts that the convoy cell was overcrowded during the applicant\u2019s 4-5 hour stay there. Nevertheless, taking into account the brevity of the applicant\u2019s stay in the convoy cell, the fact that it did not alternate with inhuman and degrading conditions of his detention in the remand prison and transport (compare Moiseyev, cited above, \u00a7 142), the Court does not consider that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention on 29 June 2005, although far from adequate, reached the threshold of severity required to characterise the treatment as inhuman or degrading within the meaning of Article\u00a03 of the Convention (see Fetisov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0138).",
