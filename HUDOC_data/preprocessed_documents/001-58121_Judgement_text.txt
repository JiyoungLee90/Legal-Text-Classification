The case was referred to the Court by the Polish Government (“the Government”) on 6 January 1997, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 25086/94) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under Article 25 by a Polish national, Mrs Bronisława Proszak, on 28 April 1994.
The Government’s application referred to Articles 44 and 48 of the Convention and to the declaration whereby Poland recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 35 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court B, the applicant stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 31). The lawyer was given leave by the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, to use the Polish language (Rule 28 § 3).
The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr J. Makarczyk, the elected judge of Polish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr Ryssdal, the President (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On 20 January 1997, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr J. De Meyer, Mr A.N. Loizou, Sir John Freeland, Mr L. Wildhaber, Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici, Mr B. Repik and Mr E. Levits (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 § 1 and 40). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 25 June 1997 and the Government’s memorial on 17 July 1997.
In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 25 August 1997. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.
There appeared before the Court:
The Court heard addresses by Mr Herndl, Mr Cichoń and Mr Drzewicki.
Subsequently Mr D. Gotchev, substitute judge, replaced Mr Wildhaber, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1).
As Mr Ryssdal was unable to attend the deliberations on 24 November 1997, his place as President of the Chamber was taken by Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, substitute judge (Rule 21 § 6).
Mrs Bronisława Proszak, who was born in 1926, is retired and lives at Stalowa Wola.
On 20 December 1988 the applicant was attacked and struck by her neighbour, Mr R.T. On 29 November 1989 the Stalowa Wola District Court (Criminal Division) sentenced Mr R.T. to six months’ imprisonment for assault and causing actual bodily harm. Mrs Proszak had not joined the proceedings as a civil party. On 12 March 1990 the Tarnobrzeg Regional Court decided to discontinue the proceedings, pursuant to an amnesty.
On 25 October 1990 the applicant brought a civil action against Mr R.T. in the Stalowa Wola District Court (Civil Division – “the District Court”). She sought damages of five million (old) zlotys for injury resulting from the attack; on an unspecified date the applicant increased the amount of that claim.
On 14 April 1992 the District Court took expert evidence from a psychiatrist, Dr B.S., in order to determine the extent to which the applicant’s health had been affected by the attack and whether there was a causal link between the attack and the injury alleged by the victim.
On 23 February 1993 the applicant was examined by two other psychiatrists, Dr W.S. and Dr A.S., at the request of the District Court, which had appointed them as experts. On 8 June 1993 Dr W.S., who had been treating the applicant for ten years, gave evidence to the court, confirming that he disagreed with Dr B.S.’s findings. Counsel for the defendant then applied for another expert to be appointed. The applicant’s lawyer initially opposed the application but eventually agreed to it, and the court allowed it.
On 18 June 1993 Mrs Proszak refused to undergo a further psychiatric examination, arguing that there was already sufficient evidence as to the state of her mental health and that she had already been examined on two occasions during the proceedings. She said that she did not see how a further examination could be of use in determining the defendant’s civil liability.

On 7 September 1993 the applicant informed the District Court that, for health reasons duly confirmed in a medical certificate, she had been unable to appear at the hearing on 2 September 1993 and she also complained of the length of the proceedings. In a letter of 10 September 1993 to the District Court she confirmed her refusal to undergo a further psychiatric examination.
On 6 October 1993 the District Court set a date for a further psychiatric examination of the applicant, who did not attend for it. Subsequently she complained of the slowness of the proceedings. On 19 October 1993 the President of the District Court informed her that the alleged delays were in part due to her refusal to submit to another medical examination and that there was nothing to show any lack of diligence on the part of the court.
On 26 October 1993 Mrs Proszak wrote to the Minister of Justice complaining of the length of the proceedings. She also alleged that the President of the District Court had not answered some of her complaints and she applied for the reporting judge to be removed from the case on the ground that he had not dealt with it diligently and was prejudiced against her. On 2 November this letter was forwarded by the Minister to the President of the Tarnobrzeg Regional Court.
On 16 November 1993 the applicant asked to be examined by a psychiatrist who was a specialist in the syndrome of former prisoners of German concentration camps; she had herself been held in Ravensbrück during the Second World War and considered that this factor had not been sufficiently taken into account by the various court-appointed psychiatrists. The court contacted Cracow Military Hospital, where Dr W.Œ. replied on 26 November 1993 that the case called for a joint opinion and a longer period of observation as Mrs Proszak might compensate for her symptoms during an examination by a single expert. On 15 December 1993 the court wrote to Łǿdz Military Medical Academy, which informed it that, in view of commitments already entered into, it could not undertake the task asked of it.
On 9 February 1994 the applicant demanded that the judge in charge of her case should be replaced, on the ground that the proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time. On 10 March 1994 the District Court dismissed her application as lacking any legal basis.
In August 1994 the court contacted the District Mental Health Centre at Rzeszów but received no reply, despite a number of reminders. On 31 March 1995 it turned to the Lublin Medical Academy, which on 30 June 1995 agreed. The specialist initially designated made it known on 7 November 1995 that his workload made it impossible for him to produce the requested opinion. On 20 December 1995 a second specialist requested the court to ask the applicant to attend for examination on 23 January 1996.
On 9 January 1996 Mrs Proszak informed the District Court that for health reasons she was unable to undergo the fresh examination. She again complained of the length of the proceedings and also stressed the pointlessness of the further examination in view of those already undergone. On 18 January 1996, being of the view that she had supplied all the information necessary for deciding her case, she asked the court to continue the proceedings in her absence.
On 15 January 1996 the District Court had notified the applicant that as the previous experts had given conflicting opinions, her file had been sent to the Faculty of Medicine at Lublin University for a fresh expert opinion. It ordered her to attend for examination on 23 January.
On 21 February the Lublin Academy informed the court that, despite repeated reminders, Mrs Proszak had not attended for examination.
On 18 March 1996 Mrs Proszak submitted a medical certificate to the District Court to the effect that for health reasons she was unable to appear at the hearing set down for 20 March 1996. That hearing was adjourned as the applicant’s lawyer was not present either. In a letter of 20 March 1996 the court offered to take evidence from her at her home.
On 2 April 1996 the applicant informed the District Court of her health problems and emphasised the pointlessness of fresh hearings in that her case was pending before the Strasbourg institutions and the Commission had already determined her state of health.
On 16 May 1996 the District Court partly allowed the applicant’s claim, awarding her 1,500 new zlotys plus interest and costs.
Mr R.T. and the applicant appealed.
On 16 September 1996, after the District Court had given judgment, the applicant asked it to replace the reporting judge, but the application was refused on 26 September 1996. That refusal was upheld by the Tarnobrzeg Regional Court on 23 October 1996.
On 5 December 1996 the appellate court affirmed the District Court’s judgment of 16 May 1996 but reduced the first sum awarded by 6 zlotys.
On 7 January 1997 the applicant appealed on points of law in order to obtain more substantial damages. The appeal was, however, dismissed by the Tarnobrzeg Regional Court on 19 February 1997 on the ground that the claim related to a sum below the threshold laid down in Article 393 of the Code of Civil Procedure (5,000 new zlotys).
Mrs Proszak applied to the Commission on 28 April 1994. She complained of: (1) the length of the civil proceedings brought in the Stalowa Wola District Court (Article 6 § 1 of the Convention); (2) a slur on her reputation due to a 1986 medical certificate to the effect that she was suffering from schizophrenia; (3) the refusal of the Ministry of Justice to reopen proceedings relating to her son’s death; and (4) persecution by various individuals.
In its partial decision on admissibility of 17 January 1995 the Commission (Second Chamber) adjourned consideration of the first complaint and declared the others inadmissible. On 18 October 1995 it declared the application (no. 25086/94) admissible as to the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings. In its report of 4 September 1996 (Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.
The Government submitted that there had not been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
Counsel for the applicant asked the Court to hold that there had been a breach of that provision and to award his client just satisfaction.
