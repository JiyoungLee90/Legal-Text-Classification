Kleinknecht/Meyer, [Code of Criminal Procedure], 40th ed., \u00a7\u00a0170 no. 1). The findings of the investigation do not found such an expectation. There would have been sufficient cause to prosecute for false imprisonment (Article 239 of the Criminal Code) if the accused police officers had unlawfully taken the applicants to the police station and held them there. The investigation did not disclose any such unlawful act. The inquiries made at Ulmen gave the police officers on duty cause to suspect a fraud on Mr and Mrs [S.] (rent arrears and telephone bills amounting to approximately DEM 4,000), especially as the applicants had admitted that they were not then able to find that sum. Furthermore, according to the statements of the witnesses [J.] and [S.] (page 4 of file Js 25638/91) and the findings of the accused police officers (position of the wheels of the vehicle ... \u2013 page 4 of the above-mentioned file), the accused police officers had the impression that \u2018[K.-F.] intended to drive off come what might\u2019. The fact that the accused police officers, in the light of all these circumstances, consequently suspected the applicant of \u2018attempted rent fraud\u2019 cannot be criticised. The arrest was accordingly, on the facts, likewise justified. At the police station the alleged offenders, who had had the applicants\u2019 address checked, learned that, according to inquiries made at Bad Orb, the address there was \u2018fictitious\u2019 and that, according to further inquiries made of the Hanau Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, several sets of proceedings were pending against the applicants for fraud. The applicants\u2019 detention at the police station was therefore justified. The question whether it was necessary to hold them until the following morning can be left open in the instant case as, on grounds of intent at least, the potential defendants\u2019 conviction on a charge of false imprisonment is unlikely.",

It was accordingly lawful in the circumstances to carry out a search (Article 163\u00a0b \u00a7 1, third sentence, of the Code of Criminal Procedure). Besides, even if it were to be accepted that there had been coercion, the accused police officers\u2019 behaviour could not be considered reprehensible within the meaning of Article 240 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. For the purposes of that provision, reprehensible behaviour is behaviour which in all the circumstances is so manifestly objectionable that it calls for punishment under the criminal law as a gross interference with other people\u2019s exercise of free will (see Criminal Decisions of the Federal Court of Justice 17, 328, 332).",

According to the reasons set out on p. 3 of the Division\u2019s judgment of 21 May 1992 (1 Ws 164/92), the applicant was held at the police station lawfully. In the aforementioned judgment the Division had already explained that the question whether it had been necessary to hold the applicant in detention until the following morning could be left open as, on grounds of intent at least, the potential defendants (Laux, Walther, Kugel and Reuter) were unlikely to be convicted of false imprisonment. In his report dated 4 July 1991 (pp. 23 et seq. of the file) Detective Sergeant Laux said (p. 24) that \u2018Mr and Mrs [K.-F.] and their son were first taken to the police station so that their identity could be checked\u2019 and Mr\u00a0and Mrs [K.-F.] were held in police custody after consultation of Supt. Blang. The second sentence of Article 127 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the checking of a person\u2019s identity by police officers must be conducted in accordance with Article 163\u00a0b \u00a7 1 of that code. A person affected by a measure taken under Article 163\u00a0b for the purposes of checking his identity cannot be deprived of his liberty for more than twelve hours in all. The applicant was detained at 9.45 p.m. on 4\u00a0July 1991 (page 19) and released at 10.30 a.m. on 5 July 1991 (page 20). For this detention, which lasted for more than twelve hours, Superintendent Blang was responsible. On the basis of the evidence as it currently stands, however, it appears unlikely that he would be convicted of false imprisonment as ultimately it will not be possible to establish that he was aware that the maximum permitted period had been exceeded.",

No other evidence, beyond the applicant\u2019s statements, is to be found. On the basis of the evidence as it currently stands, the decision to discontinue the proceedings cannot be criticised. For these reasons, no offence of extorting a confession (Article 343 of the Criminal Code) has been made out either. Given the information to which the Division has already referred in its judgment of 21 May 1992, the checking of the applicant\u2019s identity was justified. Nor, lastly, can the accused police officer be said to be guilty of coercive behaviour in having forbidden the applicant to enter the flat at Ulmen to collect personal belongings. In the police officer\u2019s view, his behaviour cannot be shown to have been reprehensible since he had cause to believe that as the rent for the holiday flat had not been paid as agreed, the landlord was entitled to exercise a lien.",

To that end, Mr K.-F. and Mrs S., the landlady, were questioned further during the morning of 5 July 1991.

On reading, several years after the event, the files available in Strasbourg, one may have doubts as to whether the arrest and its duration were really necessary and could be justified under one or both of these provisions. In order to clarify the lawfulness of the arrest, adequately and finally, the applicant could and should have instituted appropriate proceedings available under German law. These possibilities are mentioned in paragraphs 37 and 38 of the present judgment. The applicant deliberately chose a different procedure; he tried to instigate criminal proceedings against the police officers and certain public prosecutors. These proceedings did not concern primarily the lawfulness of the arrest, but the question whether there was sufficient suspicion that the officials had intentionally committed illegal acts. The decisions quoted in paragraphs\u00a024 and 32 of the present judgment show that ultimately the lack of personal guilt was decisive and that for that reason no criminal proceedings were instituted. The central question of the objective legality of the initial detention was answered only incidentally, and that of its continuation overnight remained entirely open; it would inevitably remain open if no criminal proceedings against the police officers could be instituted for other reasons.",

Article 163\u00a0c, on the other hand, prohibits detention for the purpose of checking identity for more than twelve hours. Admittedly, the release of the applicant on 5 July at 10.30 a.m. occurred only a short time after the end of the maximum permissible period; nevertheless, in the actual circumstances even this short time of unjustified detention violated the Convention. One could add that Article163\u00a0c permits such an arrest only for the period strictly necessary for identification, and it is difficult to believe that even twelve hours could be considered necessary in the circumstances.",
