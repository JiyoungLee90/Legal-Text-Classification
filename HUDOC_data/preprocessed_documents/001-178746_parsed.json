In the present application, the procedural mistake committed was clearly consequential, since the Supreme Court had found against the applicant without awaiting his pleadings although they had been submitted within the time-limit.

The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory, but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. However, the existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile is not a valid reason for failing to exhaust domestic remedies. Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention also provides for a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see\u00a0Sejdovic v.

In particular, a very similar situation was contemplated in the case of Leoni v. Italy ((dec.), no.\u00a043269/98, 15\u00a0June 1999) where the Court rejected the Government\u2019s objection based on the applicant\u2019s failure to introduce a claim for compensation against the clerks of the Court of Appeal who had allegedly not forwarded to the Court of Cassation his appeal on points of law concerning a civil case. This case is noteworthy notably because in that application Mr Leoni possessed a certificate proving that he had deposited his appeal on points of law on time and it was admitted by the Court of Cassation that the Court of Appeal clerks had not forwarded \u2013 as they were obliged to do \u2013 the appeal. Despite these elements plausibly capable of producing a rather strong case for a compensation claim made by Mr Leoni, the Court considered that he was not required to have attempted an official liability action in order to exhaust domestic remedies.",

Such an action, even if successful, could not have led either to the calculation and awarding of the amounts sought by the applicant in his original claim before the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Labour Court or to the case being examined afresh by the domestic courts in the light of his ignored submissions. The two examples of successful official liability actions (one concerning non-pecuniary damage and the other revolving around the frustration of the execution of an award already adjudicated in a final and binding judgment) submitted by the Government do not demonstrate how the applicant could have obtained the reopening of his case or the fully adversarial adjudication of his claims by the Supreme Court, let alone the awarding of those claims by a court hearing an eventual official liability action (see paragraph 14 above). Therefore, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court cannot follow the approach taken in Mih\u00e1ly K\u0151szegi v. Hungary ((dec.), no. 36830/97, 15 March 2001) where it held that an official liability action was a remedy to exhaust.",

It is not true that the judge who is called on to assess the tort claim could not \u201credo\u201d the initial proceedings by calculating the sum to which the applicant would have been entitled if the initial proceedings had been properly conducted. This is the normal task of a court in a liability claim: the judge, with hindsight, considers what ought to have to be done and, if it was done correctly, what loss would have been avoided.

Quite to the contrary, it flows from the case-law cited in paragraph 14 of the judgment that under Hungarian law, substantial damages can be awarded to compensate for shortcomings in previous judicial proceedings. This was confirmed in Mih\u00e1ly K\u0151szegi v. Hungary where the Court noted that the applicant could have, under Section 349 of the Hungarian Civil Code, sought compensation for any damage he might have suffered on account of the domestic courts\u2019 mismanagement of his claims, and that an official liability action was a remedy to be exhausted in similar circumstances.",

In K\u0151szegi the applicant had claimed, in addition to his original claim, the payment of certain amounts of lost profit, accrued interest and social security contributions, and had challenged a previous ruling that had allocated him a certain amount based on a technical expert\u2019s findings. Before the Court, he claimed that the domestic courts had omitted to take into consideration his supplemental claims. Although a judge dealing with a subsequent tort claim would have had to proceed to assess those claims, involving a series of complicated calculations, the Court nevertheless found that the applicant should have exhausted this remedy before launching his application with the Court. We simply fail to see any difference with the said case, which is, moreover, also Hungarian.",

Pursuant to the well-known mechanism, once liability is established, in order to assess the consistency of the damage, the judge performs a probability assessment, and if he deems that the probability of success was very high, he can allocate up to 100% of the missed profit in damages.",
