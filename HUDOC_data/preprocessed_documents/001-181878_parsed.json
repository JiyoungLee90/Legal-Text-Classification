As to the applicant\u2019s arrest on 18\u00a0September 2005, the Government submitted that, since the court order authorising the applicant\u2019s release on parole had been quashed on 16\u00a0September 2005 on appeal, with that appeal judgment becoming effective immediately, the applicant had been bound to continue serving the sentence imposed by the judgment of 19\u00a0May 2004. Therefore, on 18\u00a0September 2005 he had been re-arrested and taken back to the facility. The reinstatement of a time-limit permitting the prosecutor to appeal against the decision of 19\u00a0August 2005 had been conducted in strict accordance with the applicable rules of criminal procedure. In any event, the Government considered that the applicant had not brought his grievances concerning his arrest on 18\u00a0September 2005 to the attention of domestic courts or the prosecutor\u2019s office and that the complaint should be dismissed for the applicant\u2019s failure to exhaust the domestic remedies.",

It notes that this question is, in any event, closely related to the broader issue of whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the applicant was a former law-enforcement officer, the Court can accept that his allocation to the penal institution in Nizhniy Tagil was intended to ensure the safety and security of his person (compare Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v.
