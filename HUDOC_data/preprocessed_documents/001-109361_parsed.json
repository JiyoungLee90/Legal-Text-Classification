Moreover, there had been no interference with the right to inherit since the applicant\u2019s father was not the owner of the plot of land for which there was a right of use. It was rather owned by the agricultural community and thus he could not transfer such property rights. Even if there had been an interference, the statutes of the AA required a permit from the agricultural community for the transfer of moving shares. This measure served legitimate aims in the public interest, namely to secure the future existence of farmers, to secure a distribution of the land permitting the development of viable farming units and the harmonious cultivation of the area and the landscape and to promote a reasonable use of available areas while preventing natural dangers. Furthermore this measure was in line with the proportionality principle and was necessary. Since the applicant only wanted to use the hut during the holidays, this would clearly be in conflict with these interests.",

Having regard to the reasoning of the Administrative Court in its decision of 7 July 2005 the Court considers that the question of the lawfulness of the agricultural authorities refusal to grant transfer of the grazing and hut rights to the applicant was still an issue in the proceedings conducted after 23 May 1996 and they did not concern a separate and different subject matter. It is, however, not in dispute that as regards the supplementary request of 10 December 1997 the applicant exhausted domestic remedies.
