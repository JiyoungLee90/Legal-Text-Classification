The applicant argued that the procedure for lodging an appeal in Greece was a mere formality and a matter of few minutes. It was standard practice that the defendants be provided by domestic courts with a pre-printed form for lodging an appeal in which a standard phrase, with slight variations, was included as the reason for the appeal, essentially that: \u201cthe defendant complained about erroneous assessment of facts and/or evidence\u201d. According to domestic case-law, this phrase was considered sufficient reason for appeal as the text of the decision would only become available months later and a defendant could therefore not provide more specific reasons for appeal at that time. In his case, this standard phrase had been omitted in the report completed by the registrar of the Nafplio Court of Appeal but this was not the applicant\u2019s fault. The applicant had been handcuffed and escorted by policemen into the office of the competent registrar and had been requested merely to sign the report, which he had not been able to read, partly due to the handcuffs but also because he could not read the Greek language. He had not been accompanied by his lawyer at the registry office, as it was not obligatory to lodge an appeal in the presence of a lawyer. In any event, he had shown complete trust in the registrar\u2019s assurance that his appeal had been lawfully lodged. It had been the registrar\u2019s responsibility to complete the report correctly and to inform the applicant whether he should add anything.",

While this possibility was afforded by the domestic legislation, it is obvious that the applicant was under the impression that his appeal had been lawfully lodged using the form provided and completed by the registrar of the Nafplio Court of Appeal and there was thus no reason for him to submit an additional document. This is made even more pertinent by the fact that the domestic legislation provides for the possibility of giving a copy of the report to the appellant but not an obligation so to do (see Boulougouras v.
