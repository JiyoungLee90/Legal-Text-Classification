He further stated that the land was in a good state although the man in the street might deem otherwise due to the appearance of salt marshes and that the department had added certain species to the site in order to avoid erosion and had carried out engineering works to improve the state of the pools therein. In this light, and having considered subsequent structural plans and assessments confirming the necessity of protecting the biodiverse site, the court held that the taking of the land had been in the public interest, which persisted, notwithstanding that no construction had taken place. It was in fact the aim of the taking of the land to leave the site in its original state, a state which could not have been guaranteed if it had been left in the hands of private individuals.",

In the applicant\u2019s view, if she had retained possession of the property she would have kept it in order as she had always done, respecting the ecological balance, and could have developed it according to the relevant local plan issued by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA). The latter, although it recognised the site as a salt marsh of ecological importance, nevertheless allowed for development of the site if it took into account the potential effects on the site. However, the applicant had always been precluded from such development because of the supposed expropriation of the said land. Indeed, the applicant\u2019s family had not only taken care of the property but had prepared projects for its development (an environment-friendly yacht marina), which had then been put aside when they discovered the land had been expropriated in 1999.",

However, this did not mean that the Government could not protect such areas before the relevant legislation entered into force. While the taking of the land had been carried out to conserve the site in its original state, certain development of an ecological nature had been carried out as mentioned by the domestic courts (see paragraph 19 above). The area was also regularly cleaned up, at least twice a year. However no measures could totally protect it from vandalism, to which any property could be subjected.

Sweden, 23 September 1982, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 52). The first, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph and is of a general nature, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties. However, the rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property. They must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, for example, Air Canada v\u00a0\u00a0the , 5 May 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 29 and 30, Series A no. 316-A).",

In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference, and a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No.1 only in exceptional circumstances (see The Holy Monasteries v. Greece, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7 71, Series A no. 301-A ). However, while it is true that in many cases of lawful expropriation only full compensation can be regarded as reasonably related to the value of the property, Article 1\u00a0of Protocol No. 1 does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances. Legitimate objectives in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d, such as those pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for reimbursement of less than the full market value (see Urb\u00e1rska Obec Tren\u010dianske Biskupice v.

The same applies to abnormally lengthy delays in administrative or judicial proceedings in which such compensation is determined, especially when people whose land has been expropriated are obliged to resort to such proceedings in order to obtain the compensation to which they are entitled (see Aka v.

Moreover, the Court notes that notwithstanding the  judgment, to date no proceedings have been instituted by the COL. Lastly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant was not cooperative in proving ownership title. Indeed the Court considers that, in the context of an expropriation mechanism, it can understandably be the responsibility of the Government to identify the relevant owners. This responsibility also entails the necessary research to identify the owners. Moreover, the Court further notes that the Maltese legal system also provided for the possibility of initiating proceedings by means of a curator.
