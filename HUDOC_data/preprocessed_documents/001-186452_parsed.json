Under Rule 60 of the Rules of Court, any claim for just satisfaction must be itemised and submitted in writing, together with the relevant supporting documents or vouchers, failing which the Chamber may reject the claim in whole or in part. In the present case, the Court notes that that the applicant concluded an agreement with his counsel concerning his fees, which is comparable to a contingency fee agreement. This is an agreement whereby a lawyer\u2019s client agrees to pay the lawyer fees amounting to a certain percentage of the sum, if any, awarded to the litigant by the court. Such agreements, if they are legally enforceable, may show that the sums claimed are actually payable by the applicant. Agreements of this nature \u2013 giving rise to obligations solely between lawyer and client \u2013 cannot bind the Court, which must assess the level of costs and expenses to be awarded with reference not only to whether the costs are actually incurred, but also to whether they have been reasonably incurred (see Iatridis v. Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7 55, ECHR\u00a02000XI, and Stergiopoulos v. Greece, no.\u00a029049/12, \u00a7 63, 7\u00a0December 2017).",
