The case originated in an application (no. 74495/01) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a construction company registered in Turkey, the Kat İnşaat Ticaret Kollektif Şirketi / İsmet Kamış ve Ortakları (“the applicant”), on 17 October 2000.
The applicant was represented by Mr T. Elçi, a lawyer practising in . The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.
On 31 January 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
On 18 August and 16 September 1987 and 16 May 1990 the applicant concluded three contracts with the General Directorate for Water and Infrastructure (İSKİ) (“the General Directorate”) and undertook the construction of parts of the water infrastructure in İstanbul.
Subsequent to the failure of the General Directorate to pay the applicant the relevant fees, on 10 October 1995 the applicant filed an action with the 4th Chamber of the Istanbul Commercial Court and requested the court to order the payment of 10,279,231,935 Turkish liras (TRL), alleging that the General Directorate had failed to comply with the contract of 16 May 1990.
In 1999 the General Directorate filed a cross-action with the 7th Chamber of İstanbul  requesting a sum of TRL 7,650,721,062, claiming that this sum had been overpaid to the applicant.
On an unspecified date, the 7th Chamber of İstanbul  decided that the case before it should be joined with the case before the 4th Chamber of the same court.
On 14 July 1999 the 4th Chamber of İstanbul  requested the 7th Chamber of the same court to submit the file of a case (file no. 1999/724) which was related to the case before it.
Between 14 July 1999 and 3 November 2000 the 4th Chamber of İstanbul  repeatedly requested the 7th Chamber to send the aforementioned file.
On 3 November 2000 a copy of the file no. 1999/724 was submitted to the 4th Chamber of the İstanbul  by the applicant.
On the same day the first-instance court awarded the applicant the claim in full, plus interest at the rediscount rate, running from the date of lodging of the case. The court dismissed the General Directorate’s crossaction.
On 14 January 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.
On 23 October 2002 the Court of Cassation dismissed the request for rectification of decision.
