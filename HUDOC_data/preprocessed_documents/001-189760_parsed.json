A police officer may use physical force to put an end to a crime or an administrative offence being committed, to escort the alleged perpetrator to the police station or other premises and to arrest him or her, and to overcome resistance to lawful acts of a police officer (section 20 of the Act). Such special means as handcuffs may be used to overcome resistance to a police officer; to arrest a person who was caught during the commission of a crime and who tried to escape; to escort to the police station and to convoy arrested persons and detainees who are subject to administrative detention, and to suppress escape attempts by persons resisting a police officer or attempts to cause harm to self and others (section 21 of the Act). If the physical force used results in damage to health, or if special means or a weapon are used, then a police officer must submit a report about the use of physical force, special means or weapon to his or her supervisor within twenty-four hours (section 19 of the Act).",

Russia, no. 8810/05, \u00a7 89, 30 May 2013). In the present case, the Court is not satisfied that the internal inquiry by the regional department of the Ministry of the Interior resulted in an assessment which corresponded, at least in substance, to this requirement. Nor did the judicial proceedings initiated by the applicant cure any related defects. In fact, in the present case no attempt was made by the authorities to determine the proportionality of the police officers\u2019 reaction to the applicant\u2019s behaviour, namely distributing leaflets and using foul language. Even if the applicant did indeed try to escape, he did not threaten the police officers arresting him, for example, by openly carrying a weapon or by attacking them (see Nadrosov v. Russia, no. 9297/02, \u00a7 36, 31 July 2008).

However, the domestic authorities have never argued that there were reasons to suspect the applicant of a criminal offence or that his name was on a wanted persons list. Neither have they indicated if there were any reasons for prosecuting the applicant for an administrative offence or any other grounds for arresting a person which could justify an identity check under Russian law, namely section 13 of the Police Act (see paragraph 26 above). Even assuming that there was a legal basis for the police officers\u2019 order to present an identity document, the applicant has never been accused of disobeying such an order (compare Huseynli and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 67360/11 and 2 others, \u00a7 95, 11 February 2016), a fact which casts doubt on the legitimacy of the ensuing intervention by the police. Furthermore, while there is little to contradict the finding that the applicant tried to escape and resisted police officers during his arrest, it is not made out that taking him to the police station was a direct consequence of his behaviour towards the police rather than a consequence of his exercising his freedom of expression by way of leafleting (compare Dilek Aslan v. Turkey, no. 34364/08, \u00a7 76, 20 October 2015). The Government have not disputed that officer O. had shown some interest in the content of the leaflets distributed by the applicant before the arrival of a special group of police officers, and that Ms B. had wished to stop his leafleting (see paragraph 10 above). In that regard, the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression cannot be viewed as an incidental effect of a police operation (compare with Butkevich v. Russia, no. 5865/07, \u00a7\u00a7 121-23, 13 February 2018, and Malofeyeva v. Russia, no. 36673/04, \u00a7\u00a7 129-30, 30 May 2013).",

The applicant has contested that he used any utterances which could be perceived as foul language during his leafleting. Indeed, it remains unclear what exact words were allegedly uttered by and held against the applicant, in the absence of any detail in the administrative offence record or any further judicial assessment of them. The Court considers that it has not been established whether the applicant used foul language to such an extent or in such a way as to constitute an administrative offence which could have justified his arrest and the termination of his leafleting. The domestic authorities failed to make an assessment as to how exactly the applicant had disturbed passers-by and in what manner he had insulted them. Nor did they consider the adverse effect that the intervention by the police and the arrest of the applicant had on the exercise of his freedom of expression. In this context, the Court cannot but conclude that it was not convincingly shown at the domestic level that these measures were justified (see, for similar context and reasoning, Novikova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 223-24; see also Ivashchenko v. Russia, no.\u00a061064/10, \u00a7\u00a7 89-91, 13 February 2018). Faced with the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to give reasons that would be both relevant and sufficient to justify the interference, the Court finds that the domestic authorities cannot be said to have applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 or to have based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, for the approach, Terentyev v. Russia, no. 25147/09, \u00a7 24, 26 January 2017; Annenkov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 31475/10, \u00a7 139, 25 July 2017, and \u00d6\u011fr\u00fc and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 60087/10 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a7 64-71, 19\u00a0December 2017).",
