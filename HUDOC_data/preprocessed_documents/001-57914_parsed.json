In the event of his death, the sum insured was to be paid to Pierre De Varga-Hirsch and Allenet de Ribemont. The turning-point came last night when Guy Simon\u00e9, a police officer, was the first to crack. He admitted that he had organised the murder and had lent a gun to have the MP killed. He also hired the contract killer, G\u00e9rard Fr\u00e8che, who was promised three million old francs and who in turn found two people to accompany him. The reasons for their downfall were, first, that Simon\u00e9\u2019s name appeared in Jean de Broglie\u2019s diary and, second, that they killed him in front of no. 2 rue des Dardanelles. That was not planned. The intention had apparently been to take him somewhere else, but Jean de Broglie perhaps refused to follow his killer. At all events, that was their first mistake. Varga and Ribemont apparently then refused to pay them. That led to the secret meetings in bars, the shadowing by the police and informers - we know the rest of the story - and their arrest. The second mistake was made by Simon\u00e9. Before contacting Fr\u00e8che he approached another contract killer, who turned down the job but apparently talked to other people about it. To catch the killers, the police realistically based their investigation on two simple ideas. Firstly, the murder was committed in the rue des Dardanelles as Jean de Broglie was leaving De Varga\u2019s home. There was necessarily a link between the killer and De Varga. Secondly, De Varga\u2019s past did not count in his favour and the police regarded him as a rather dubious legal adviser. Those two simple ideas and over sixty investigators led to the discovery of the murderer.",

A second period, of nine months and two weeks, elapsed during the proceedings in the Conseil d\u2019Etat between the filing of the applicant\u2019s full pleadings on 1 July 1981 and the Minister of the Interior\u2019s reply on 13 April 1982 (see paragraph 16 above).

My dissent arises from the consideration that this extended interpretation of the presumption of innocence cannot be guaranteed in a practical and effective way. When the violation is committed by the public authorities before the trial of the person charged with a criminal offence, no practical and effective remedy for that violation is afforded if that remedy is sought as soon as the violation takes place. In the instant case, the Court is finding a violation which occurred in 1976, and therefore it can accord a financial remedy. But this is clearly not a practical and effective remedy which can be applied satisfactorily if the violation is established before the trial takes place.",
