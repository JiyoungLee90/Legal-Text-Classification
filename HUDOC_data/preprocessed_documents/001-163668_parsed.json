It had not been necessary for the lower court to rely on the Court\u2019s case law. According to the appellate court, although it shared the applicant\u2019s views based on the Court\u2019s case law on the freedom of expression presented in his appeal, those views were not relevant for the adjudication of the case (nie maj\u0105 one znaczenia dla rozstrzygni\u0119cia niniejszej sprawy) The applicant\u2019s point in this matter had therefore been wholly erroneous (ca\u0142kowicie chybiony). The appellate court was well aware of the role of the media in a pluralist and democratic society, but the press was obliged to present truthful or at least carefully verified information to the public and to show diligence and thoroughness. The applicant had failed to do so and the information he had published had seriously damaged B.J.\u2019s reputation.",

These factors, in turn, require consideration of other elements such as the authority of the source (ibid.), whether the newspaper had conducted a reasonable amount of research before publication (see Prager\u00a0and\u00a0Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria, 26\u00a0April 1995, \u00a7\u00a037, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0313), whether the newspaper presented the story in a reasonably balanced manner (see Bergens Tidende and Others v.\u00a0Norway, no.\u00a026132/95, \u00a7\u00a057, ECHR\u00a02000IV) and whether the newspaper gave the persons defamed the opportunity to defend themselves (ibid., \u00a7\u00a058). Hence, the nature of such an exemption from the ordinary requirement of verification of defamatory statements of fact is such that, in order to apply it in a manner consistent with the caselaw of this Court, the domestic courts have to take into account the particular circumstances of the case under consideration. If the national courts apply an overly rigorous approach to the assessment of journalists\u2019 professional conduct, the latter could be unduly deterred from discharging their function of keeping the public informed. The courts must therefore take into account the likely impact of their rulings not only on the individual cases before them but also on the media in general (see Kasabova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055, and Yordanova\u00a0and Toshev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a05126/05, \u00a7\u00a048, 2\u00a0October 2012).",

The situation in the present case presents no material difference. The veracity of information concerning the unsatisfactory quality of the petrol sold by B.J. was not contested by the courts. The first-instance court called an expert witness who confirmed this (see paragraph 19 above). That court also referred to the fact that an administrative fine had been imposed on the plaintiff for this failure to comply with the applicable standards (see paragraph 21 above). Nonetheless, the first-instance court was of the view that the applicant had also been obliged to check which technical standards the fuel sold by B.J. had not complied with.",
