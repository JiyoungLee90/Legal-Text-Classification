According to the record of the testimony of the applicant\u2019s mentor, she had discussed with the applicant his plan to move prior to her decision. The mentor was of the view that the applicant did not understand all the consequences of the plan, and did not realise that the good things in his present situation would not be relocated with him.

The court further noted that, according to an expert evaluation dated 26\u00a0November 2010 and established by a psychologist, the applicant\u2019s decision-making skills were equal to those of a child aged between six and nine years. Consequently, the evaluation concluded that the applicant was not able to consider whether his plans about future were realistic and what consequences or implications they would have. The court noted that the applicant had told the court that he had no particular complaints about his current situation and that according to the witness statements he enjoyed his apartment and work in his home town. There was no evidence that the applicant\u2019s situation in his home town was not good. The court found that the applicant clearly did not understand what it would be like to live in a remote part of the country, especially as he had previously lived there for only one year, and what the implications of the move would be for his situation. Moreover, the court found it uncertain how clear or strong the applicant\u2019s will actually was, taking into account the evidence regarding his gullibility. It was likely that his opinion was influenced by that of the former foster parents. The applicant\u2019s development had improved in his home town and he had been able to live in a special unit for intellectually disabled adults, to go to work and to cycle independently around town. The applicant had in his home town a support network consisting of relatives, friends and staff of the social welfare authorities, a job, hobbies and educational possibilities. Due to the remote and isolated location of the former foster parents\u2019 home, the applicant would miss out on all these possibilities if he were to move there. The court further noted that according to the plan, the applicant would attend a vocational school far away from his new home, requiring daily long-distance trips each school day, more specifically a 15 km taxi ride to a bus station followed by a 70 km bus transport, and the reverse after school. The court was in doubt as to whether it was reasonable to expect that the applicant could cope with such demands on a daily basis.",

The Court of Appeal found no reason to deviate from the assessment of the evidence as conducted by the District Court and affirmed the conclusions reached by the latter. The dissenting judge found that the former foster mother had been the only adult with whom the applicant had had a long-standing and safe relationship in his life. The applicant had clearly understood the importance of this relationship in his life, he knew the former foster family and what life with them entailed, although he might not be able to understand all the implications of the envisaged move. When the applicant had been removed from the former foster family in 2007 and placed in a children\u2019s home in Southern Finland, no specific reasons had been given as to why this measure had been in the applicant\u2019s best interests. The decision taken subsequently by the mentor in February 2011 had merely confirmed the earlier decision. These decisions had created distrust between the applicant and his mentor. As both the present mentor and the proposed replacement were equally competent, the one who had the applicant\u2019s trust should be chosen.",

Instead, the applicant spent Christmas with his brother and other relatives. According to the Government, the applicant has not discussed the possibility of moving elsewhere for a long time. He is happy with his work and plays floorball twice a week as a hobby. The applicant states that he has stopped talking about his desire to move since there is no point in doing so, given the fact that the social welfare authorities do not want him to leave his home town. Although he now has a girlfriend in his home town, he maintains that his true and most sincere wish is still to live with or near to his former foster mother. There is nothing in his home town that keeps him there or makes him want to stay there.",

This means that any decision on the protection of a person with deficient functional ability (\u201cthe ward\u201d) must be based on the inviolability of human and basic rights and liberties. Preference is to be given to the ward\u2019s interests and to the need to safeguard the ward\u2019s opportunities to participate in the decision-making concerning him or her. The principle of respect for human dignity is supplemented by the principles of necessity and proportionality. The principle of necessity means that the ward must be permitted to maintain his or her legal competence as extensively as possible, and that that competence can be restricted only to the extent necessary to protect the ward. The principle of proportionality means that the measures to protect the ward must be determined on a case-by-case basis and according to the need for such protection. On the other hand, it may be necessary to restrict the right of self-determination of the ward in certain situations in order to protect his or her own interests. Thus, a balance must be struck between the need for protection and the right of self-determination.",

The principles applicable to assessing a State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under the Convention are similar. Regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests, the aims in the second paragraph of Article 8 being of a certain relevance (see H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen v.

Russia, no. 2700/10, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2011). The reason for this approach, which questions certain classifications per se, is that such groups were historically subject to prejudice with lasting consequences, resulting in their social exclusion. Such prejudice could entail legislative stereotyping which prohibits the individualised evaluation of their capacities and needs (see Alajos Kiss v. Hungary, no. 38832/06, \u00a7 42, 20 May 2010). In the past, the Court has identified a number of such vulnerable groups that suffered different treatment on account of their sex (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and\u00a0Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, \u00a7 78, Series A no. 94; and Burghartz v.

The powers of the mentor to represent the ward cover the latter\u2019s property and financial affairs to the extent set out in the appointing court\u2019s order, but these powers do not exclude the ward\u2019s capacity to act for him- or herself. If, like in the present case, the court has specifically ordered that the mentor\u2019s function shall also cover matters pertaining to the ward\u2019s person, the mentor is competent to represent the ward in such a matter only where the latter is unable to understand its significance (see paragraph 30 above). In a context such as the present one, the interference with the applicant\u2019s freedom to choose where and with whom to live that resulted from the appointment and retention of a mentor for him was therefore solely contingent on the determination that the applicant was unable to understand the significance of that particular issue. This determination in turn depended on the assessment of the applicant\u2019s intellectual capacity in conjunction with and in relation to all the aspects of that specific issue. The Court also notes that Finland, having recently ratified the UNCRPD, has done so while expressly considering that there was no need or cause to amend the current legislation in these respects (see Government Bill HE 284/2014 vp., p. 45).",

In essence, the decision was not based on a qualification of the applicant as a person with a disability.
