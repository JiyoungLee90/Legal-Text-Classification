In particular, even though the Court of Appeal did not make an explicit reference to Article 143 \u00a7 1 of the CCP, the content and essence of that decision show that it confirmed the findings reached by the Regional Court, including those concerning the refusal to grant bail. Thus, the Court agrees with the applicant that his application for bail was refused on the grounds provided by Article 143 \u00a7 1 of the CCP and that he can claim to be a victim of an alleged violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 on that ground.

He had been provided only with documents of a procedural nature \u2013 such as the decision to institute criminal proceedings, the arrest report and the charge \u2013 which had been attached to the investigator\u2019s application. The fact that the judge had taken the entire investigation file with him to the deliberation room meant that the judge had relied on certain documents in that file without giving the applicant the opportunity to challenge or oppose them. The decision of 12 December 2006 stated that it was based on materials confirming that the investigator\u2019s application was well-founded, materials which he had neither been able to comment on or challenge.",

In reaching that conclusion the Court referred to a number of cases in which it had decided that the extension of the applicant\u2019s detention by a court at the request of the prosecution also attracted the guarantees of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Grau\u017einis v. , no. 37975/97, \u00a7 33, 10 October 2000; W\u0142och v.\u00a0Poland, no. 27785/95, \u00a7\u00a7 125 et seq., ECHR 2000XI; and Telecki v\u00a0Poland (dec.) no. 56552/00, 3 July 2003). The Court went on to conclude that Article 5 \u00a7 4 was applicable to proceedings determining questions of extension of the applicant\u2019s detention (see Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7 74). The Court therefore concludes that the guarantees of Article 5 \u00a7 4 are applicable to the detention hearing of 12 December 2006 and decides to dismiss the Government\u2019s objection.",
