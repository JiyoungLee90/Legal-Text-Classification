Pointing out that it lacked the technical means to provide the audio and video transmission of the questioning, it gave the applicant and her coaccused ten days to submit the questions they wanted the court to put to the witness. The applicant made no such submission (compare Poletan and Azirovik v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 26711/07 and 2\u00a0others, \u00a7 87, 12 May 2016).

In that connection, it notes that the applicant never alleged that she had not had the benefit of appropriate legal advice on the matter or alleged that the services of her lawyer were inadequate. The Court considers that taking into account the applicant\u2019s unequivocal refusal to use the safeguard provided by the domestic court, it cannot speculate on whether the said safeguard was sufficient so as to provide the same guarantees with the defence as the cross-examination of the witness.",

This waiver was attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance. In this respect, the Court observes that during the closed hearing, the trial court itself heard the anonymous witness in the presence of the public prosecutor, forming its own impression of his reliability (contrast Balta and Demir, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056). The questions prepared by the applicant\u2019s co-accused were put the anonymous witness, who responded to each of them. The public prosecutor did not ask any questions to the witness (see paragraph 17 above). The Court observes that the statements made by the anonymous witness during the closed hearing were read out to the applicant and her co-accused at the subsequent hearing and that she had the possibility to comment on them. However, while the applicant challenged those statements as being contradictory, neither she nor her lawyer specified before the trial court why they considered them to be so. Nor did they advance any substantive objections to their content (see paragraph 18 above). In that connection, the Court also observes that following the closed hearing, the applicant did not repeat the only argument she had raised regarding the reliability of the anonymous witness\u2019 statements, which concerned the alleged discrepancy between them and the bus driver\u2019s statements. It notes that notwithstanding her failure to put that question to the anonymous witness, or to raise it again when the witness statements were read out to her, the Assize Court responded to that argument by referring to the scene-of-incident report drawn up after the events of 15\u00a0February 2007 (see paragraph 20 above).",
