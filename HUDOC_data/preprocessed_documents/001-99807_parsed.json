The report stated that the right to vote of Greek nationals living abroad arose out of both Article 108 and Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution. In particular, as regards Article 108, the report pointed out that it \u201caffords Greek expatriates a \u2018social right\u2019. The provision obliges the Greek State to take all necessary measures to maintain Greek expatriates\u2019 ties with Greece, to ensure they have access to Greek education and to make provision, as a matter of State duty, for the social and professional advancement of Greeks working outside . Regulating the conditions for the exercise by Greek expatriates of their right to vote in Greek parliamentary elections will undeniably contribute to real ties being forged between Greek expatriates and their homeland\u201d. Moving on to the constitutional provision on this specific subject, namely Article 51 \u00a7 4, the report stated that the law to which that Article referred had the status of an implementing law of the Constitution. Finally, the report considered that \u201cin these times of globalisation, Greek expatriates must be able to have a decisive political say in the development of their own country\u201d.",

That report noted that in the past, some legal authorities had argued that Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution imposed upon Parliament an obligation to grant expatriate Greeks the right to vote from outside . However, referring to other legal authorities and the preparatory work for Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution, the Scientific Council stated that it was an option rather than a duty of the legislature to grant the right to vote from abroad. It observed, further, that the optional nature of the aforementioned provision of the Constitution had not been affected by the Constitutional revision of 2001.",

Lastly, the participation of expatriate Greeks in parliamentary elections could not be compared to the exercise of the right to vote in European Parliament elections.

Accordingly, the complaint does not concern the existence of the right to vote as such, since that right is, in principle, recognised under Article 51 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution, together with Article 4 of Presidential Decree no. 96/2007, but rather the conditions for exercising that vote. The present case therefore differs from other cases examined by the Court concerning, for example, measures subjecting the right to vote to a required minimum period of residence (see Hilbe, cited above) or forfeiture of the right to vote by virtue of a law prohibiting convicted prisoners from exercising it (see Hirst\u00a0(no.\u00a02), cited above). It also differs from X. and Association Y. v. Italy (no.\u00a08987/80, Commission decision of 6 May 1981, Decisions and Reports\u00a024, p. 195), where the Commission concluded that the obligation to exercise the right to vote on national territory did not amount to a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. Unlike in the aforementioned case, the Court notes that in the present case a constitutional provision, namely Article 51 \u00a7\u00a04 of the Greek Constitution, exists and authorises the legislature to determine the conditions for exercising the right to vote. Moreover, since the Commission decision in question dates back to 1981, the Court considers it necessary to examine more closely in the context of the present case the evolution of Council of Europe law on the matter at issue.",

However, such a provision cannot remain inapplicable forever, depriving its content and the intention of its drafters of any normative value. In other words, the role of the Court is not to tell the national authorities when and how they should give effect to the content of the constitutional provision concerned, but merely to ensure that it does not fall into disuse. In the present case the Court notes that approximately thirty-five years, quite a considerable time, have elapsed since Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution was adopted, and that the legislature has still not given effect to the content thereof.",

As a result, and as argued by the applicants, economic, professional and family considerations may by force of circumstances make it impossible in practice for them to travel to Greece at the time of national elections. This applies with even greater force to other expatriates who, due to their financial circumstances or the fact that their place of residence is even further away, are de facto deprived of the opportunity to exercise their right to vote. Consequently, the absence of any regulation over such a long period in relation to the right of expatriates to vote at their place of residence, despite the provisions of Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution, is likely to constitute unfair treatment of Greek citizens living abroad in comparison to those living in Greece.",

Viewed from this angle, the failure by Parliament to implement regulations on the right to vote of expatriates becomes more striking, having regard to the changes in Council of Europe law on the subject at issue. In fact, the bodies of the Council of Europe have demonstrated their will to render more effective the right to vote in national elections by urging member States to enable their citizens living abroad to participate to the fullest extent possible in the electoral process. Thus, Resolution no. 1459 (2005) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe considers that member States should take the appropriate measures to facilitate such voting rights as much as possible, in particular by means of postal voting. Moreover, in Recommendation 1714 (2005), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe invited the competent services of the Council of Europe to develop their activities aimed at improving the conditions for the effective exercise of election rights by groups facing special difficulties, such as expatriates (see paragraph 18 above).",

Belgium, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 54, Series A no.\u00a0113). In this respect the Court has reiterated that the rules in this area vary in accordance with the historical and political factors specific to each State; the large variety of situations provided for in the electoral legislation of numerous member States of the Council of Europe shows the diversity of the possible options. For the purposes of applying Article 3 of the Protocol, any electoral legislation must be assessed in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned, so that features that would be unacceptable in the context of one system may be justified in the context of another (see Py v. France, no.\u00a066289/01, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2005I (extracts)), at least so long as the chosen system provides for conditions which will ensure the \u201cfree expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\u201d.

Even more so, I do not agree that one of the elements to overrule the decision in \u03a7. and Association Y.

In my opinion, it would be for the Grand Chamber to deal with this specific issue of the right to vote and, if it decided so, to change the approach to Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. The \u201cCouncil of Europe law\u201d which is put forward, consisting in a recommendation and a resolution by the Parliamentary Assembly, as well as texts adopted by the Venice Commission, can be seen as an interesting indication of the aims to be pursued in the field. However, they do not as such create any legal obligations for States. As to the comparative law research (see paragraph 19 of the judgment), it obviously indicates a trend summarising recent developments in the laws of the States parties in this sphere. This state of affairs does not create an obligation for Greece to introduce a right to vote for citizens living abroad and certainly not one allowing all of them to vote in their actual place of residence (see paragraphs 43 and 47 of the judgment). The Court\u2019s view has been that where States parties have adopted a number of different ways of addressing the question of the right to vote of certain groups/categories of citizens, the Court must confine itself to determining whether the restriction in issue exceeds any acceptable margin of appreciation, leaving it to the legislature to decide on the choice of means for securing the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Hirst, op. cit.).",

In a similar situation the Commission was satisfied that the restriction on the applicant\u2019s right to vote was not arbitrary, noting that \u201cas to the correlation between one\u2019s right to vote in Parliamentary elections and being directly affected by acts of political bodies so elected, the applicant cannot claim to be affected by the acts of these political bodies to a similar extent as resident citizens\u201d (see X v. the United Kingdom, cited above).",

Moreover, it can be understood as introducing a very broad positive obligation, i.e., a general recognition of the right of citizens living abroad to vote in their place of residence (see paragraphs 43 and 47 of the judgment), which I am unable to accept. If confirmed, such a solution might affect not only large numbers of European citizens but create considerable political, organisational and/or economic problems for many member States of the Council of Europe.",
