Russia, no. 78146/01, 12 June\u00a02008 (see also paragraph 135 below). The Constitutional Court held that section 18 contained precise limitations concerning the frequency and length of visits and provided for an authorisation procedure for such visits. The existence of those limitations was related to the specific nature of criminal proceedings and the aims pursued by preventive measures such as remand in custody pending criminal proceedings. Indeed, there was a difference vis-\u00e0-vis detention following conviction, during which, under certain conditions, there is a right to long visits. The limitation relating to the length of visits applies during remand in custody pending investigation, which, in itself, should not go beyond a reasonable time. That limitation also applies to detention pending trial, which may be extended, for no longer than three months each time, only in serious and particularly serious cases.

It was stated therein that the examination of cases falling within the scope of those Articles required an individualised approach, with due regard to the existence or absence of any continuing need of detention for punishment and rehabilitation of the convicted person, his or her personality, and attitude displayed towards labour or education during the prison term. The mere fact that the convict had already served the required part of the prison term would not suffice for granting early release under Article 79.

Only a credible and reasonably detailed description of the allegedly degrading conditions of detention constitutes a prima facie case of ill-treatment and serves as a basis for giving notice of the complaint to the respondent Government (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0122). Cases concerning allegations of inadequate conditions of detention do not lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation) because in such instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. It follows that, after the Court has given notice of the applicant\u2019s complaint to the Government, the burden is on the latter to collect and produce relevant documents. A failure on their part to submit convincing evidence as to the conditions of detention may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the validity of the applicant\u2019s allegations (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0123).",

Moreover, the Court has often found that the Russian authorities did not appear to have acted with due care and diligence in handling prison records because some of them had actually been destroyed after the Government had been put on notice that the Court was dealing with the case (see Novinskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a011982/02, \u00a7\u00a7 102-103, 10 February 2009; Gultyayeva v. Russia, no. 67413/01, \u00a7 154, 1 April 2010; and Shcherbakov v. Russia, no. 23939/02, \u00a7 78, 17\u00a0June 2010). In other cases the Government submitted extracts from original prison records, but they were too disparate and far apart in time to present a credible refutation of the applicant\u2019s claim of severe overcrowding at the material time (see Sudarkov v.

As stated by the Supreme Court of Russia, examination of cases in this area requires an individualised approach, with due regard to the existence or absence of any continuing need of detention for rehabilitation of the convicted person, his or her personality, and attitude displayed toward labour or education during the prison term. The mere fact that the convict has already served the mandatory part of the prison term will not suffice for granting early release (see paragraph 63 above). If granted, release remains \u201cconditional\u201d, since a court could revoke it if, during the period at liberty, the convict commits a breach of the public order, seriously violates the obligations imposed on him in the decision to grant early release, or commits a criminal offence (see paragraph 61 above).",

With respect to the need for foreseeability, what is required is that, where discretionary powers are conferred on authorities, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Munjaz v. the United Kingdom, no. 2913/06, \u00a7 88, 17 July 2012).",

The applicant maintained his allegation, also arguing that he had been dependent on the staff of the detention facilities in seeking to correspond with the outside world, including the Court, and that the domestic regulations were such as to seriously undermine his ability to prove interference (non-dispatch of letters) and to ensure \u201crespect\u201d for his correspondence and the unhindered exercise of his right of application, as protected by Articles 8 and 34 of the Convention respectively.",
