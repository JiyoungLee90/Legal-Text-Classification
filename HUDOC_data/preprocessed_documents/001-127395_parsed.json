The programme had not focused on K.U. but on the problems of co-operation between the authorities, which was an issue of major general importance. The defendants also contested the lower court\u2019s view that it would have been possible to report on the issue without making any connection to K.U. At the time of the broadcasting, K.U. and a number of other persons had been charged with serious economic offences. The problems of co-operation between the authorities reported in the programme had occurred in the investigation of that very case. The defendants further contested the lower court\u2019s finding of criminal intent and that K.U. had sustained damage.",

There had thus been justified grounds to support the need to encourage public discussion of the matter in general. However, the applicants had not been convicted for having alerted the public to this issue but for having indirectly alleged that K.U. was guilty of an offence, which had to be considered as defamation. A large number of persons had become aware of the programme. Even though the applicants could have been convicted of aggravated defamation for this reason, the District Court did not find their offence to be aggravated as a whole. Even though the applicants had on 28 February 2006 added to the programme that the money in question had come from an insurance company and not from K.U., the District Court found that such an addition did not make good the fact that a false insinuation had been made in the first broadcast.

The applicants had admitted before the Court of Appeal that K.U. had not been the subject of the programme but alleged now in their observations to the Court the contrary. The whole programme had been structured around K.U. The District Court considered that the applicants had to consider it very likely that the programme contained a false insinuation aimed at K.U. and that the applicants had thus acted with intent. The applicants had not sought judicial advice on the advisability of publishing K.U.\u2019s name and photograph before the first broadcast or even after K.U. had contacted them after the first broadcast. Even though K.U. could be considered a public figure, that fact did not justify making a false insinuation about him. As to the penalties, the Government noted that the sanction had been modest and considerably smaller than in some other previous cases.

For the Court, this is a pure statement of fact having no element of insinuation. The programme was clearly aimed at disclosing a malfunctioning of the administration in two specific cases which both involved influential persons. Both of these persons, including K.U., were mentioned in the programme rather as examples but their role was not decisive. The major part of the programme focused on the tax authorities.",
