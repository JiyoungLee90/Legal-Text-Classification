It was further noted that his state of health was compatible with detention as none of his diagnoses were on the list of the illnesses, provided for by law, for which early release was possible. The applicant challenged this conclusion before the Office of the Prosecutor General alleging, inter alia, that the certificate had been forged and issued unlawfully by an unauthorised and unqualified medical officer. To verify the applicant\u2019s complaint, the Zaporizhzhya regional prosecutor\u2019s office conducted enquiries and ordered, inter alia, that the applicant be examined by different medical specialists.",

When the personal space available to a detainee falls below 3 sq. m of floor space in multi-occupancy accommodation in prisons, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 arises (see, amongst many authorities, Karalevi\u010dius , no.\u00a053254/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03940, 7\u00a0April 2005, and Ananyev and others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7\u00a7 145-147 and 149, 10 January 2012, and Mur\u0161i\u0107 v. Croatia [GC], no.\u00a07334/13, \u00a7\u00a7 136-139, 20 October 2016). This presumption will normally be capable of being rebutted only if the following factors are cumulatively met: (1) the reductions in the required minimum personal space of 3 sq. m are short, occasional and minor; (2)\u00a0such reductions are accompanied by sufficient freedom of movement outside the cell and adequate out-of-cell activities; (3) the applicant is confined in what is, when viewed generally, an appropriate detention facility, and there are no other aggravating aspects of the conditions of his or her detention (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0130, 133 and 134).",

On the facts, the Court does not find any compelling reason for the failure to respect the applicant\u2019s right to a lawyer on the first occasion on which he was questioned. The Court finds irrelevant the Government\u2019s argument that it was the applicant\u2019s own choice to explain his version of events and that he had been informed of his right not to give any explanations. It notes in this connection that the relevant documents suggest that no right to legal assistance had been explained to the applicant on that day and there is no evidence that the applicant had waived, in any way, his right to a lawyer.
