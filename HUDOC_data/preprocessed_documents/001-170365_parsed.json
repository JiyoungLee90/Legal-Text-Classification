Slovenia [GC], no.\u00a071463/01, \u00a7\u00a7 153-63, 9 April 2009). Thus, this part of the applicant\u2019s complaints falls within the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction. Although the Court is precluded from examining the applicant\u2019s above complaints of allegedly inadequate treatment, it notes that her complaints to the domestic authorities, in particular those to the prosecutor\u2019s office, contained serious and reasonably credible allegations which triggered a procedural obligation under Article 3 of the Convention for the domestic authorities to investigate them. Notably, they concerned a serious harm to the applicant\u2019s health, which was sufficiently severe to attain the relevant threshold of that provision (see paragraph 6 above), and were supported by documentary evidence (see paragraphs 7 and 10 above). On the whole, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning the procedural limb of Article 3 are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(a) of the Convention.

In the sphere of medical negligence, the obligation may, for instance, also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress to be obtained. Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged (see, mutatis mutandis, Calvelli and Ciglio v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 32967/96, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2002 I). However, the above-mentioned rule is not absolute. In certain situations it is only by recourse to criminal-law remedies that it can be ensured that situations are investigated and evidence is collected in conformity with the Convention requirements (see Mitkus v. Latvia, no. 7259/03, \u00a7 76, 2\u00a0October 2012). In such cases, the Contracting Parties are required to conduct an effective official investigation, which must be thorough and expeditious. However, the failure of any given investigation to produce conclusions does not of itself mean that it was ineffective: an obligation to investigate is not an obligation of result but of means (see I.G. and Others v.\u00a0Slovakia, no.\u00a015966/04, \u00a7 129, 13 November 2012).",
