Accordingly, the privatisation of the building and all subsequent transactions had been null and void. The municipality, being the legitimate owner of the building, had rightfully reclaimed its property from the applicants. Lastly, the Government reiterated the findings of the national courts, that the municipality had not authorised the transactions relating to the rooms in the building. Accordingly, the sale of the building in the absence of such authorisation had meant that the municipality had lost possession against its will, and, as the lawful owner, it had a right to recover its property. The authorities had acted in accordance with the public interest. They had protected the rights of other persons employed by the Stroitel company and in need of social housing.",
