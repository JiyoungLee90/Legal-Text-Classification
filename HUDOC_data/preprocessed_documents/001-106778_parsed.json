On the way [to the police station] the guy who was sitting behind the driver moved his right arm towards the driver. In his hand he had an object which resembled a knife. The driver saw the guy\u2019s movements in the rear-view mirror and leaned forward. After that, the guy made another move with his right arm \u2013 [holding] the object resembling a knife \u2013 towards the driver. The driver, however, covered his neck with his right hand to protect himself and then grabbed the guy by the right hand. Then the driver stopped the car, opened the rear door next to the guy with the sunglasses with his left hand, grabbed the guy\u2019s right hand \u2013 holding a knife \u2013 with his left hand and pulled him out of the car. He kicked the guy in the chest. The other policeman ... took out a gun, told the others present in the car to sit and be quiet. Then he got out of the car and helped the driver to handcuff the guy. When the driver pulled the guy out of the car, the guy fell down on the asphalt and hit his face.\u201d",

However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.
