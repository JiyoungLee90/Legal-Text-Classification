Section 1711 and section 1634 of the Civil Code thus pursued the same purpose, however, the conditions were different. While, pursuant to section\u00a01634 of the Civil Code, the parent not having custody and care had the right to personal contact with the child born in wedlock, section 1711 did not grant such a right to the father of a child born out of wedlock. Rather, the person having custody, as a rule the mother, determined if and to what extent the father was entitled to have contacts with his child. Only if contacts were in the interest of the child could the competent court grant a right of access. This weaker legal position resulted from the different social position of the father of a child born out of wedlock. Referring to case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court of 1971 and 1981, the Regional Court found no reason to doubt the constitutionality of section 1711 of the Civil Code. The court added that while, for considerations of legal policy, there was an urgent need for a reform of the law on children born out of wedlock, it was bound by the law in force.",

It could be assumed that, as a rule, such contacts were ordered as regular contacts between a father and his child offered the possibility of a normal development and facilitated the forming of the child\u2019s own personality. In applying these principles in the applicant\u2019s case, the court found that the applicant applied for access on the ground of true love for his daughter. However, such responsible motives could not result in granting a right of access which would have to be enforced. The child would suffer from the existing tensions between the parents on the occasion of every contact and her further development would be disturbed. There were no particular circumstances to conclude that contacts would nevertheless be favourable to the child. In this respect, the court found that there had already been tensions between her parents during the period of cohabitation. Furthermore, the expert had established that the child had repressed her memories concerning the applicant and did not talk about this subject in order to protect herself. She did not suffer from the situation.",

The consideration that fathers of children born out of wedlock often were not interested in contacts with their children and might leave a non-marital family at any time, and that it was normally in the child\u2019s interest to entrust the mother with custody and access, still applied, even if the number of non-marital families had increased.

Unlike the latter, natural fathers had no right of access to their children and the mother\u2019s refusal of access could only be overridden by a court when access was \u201cin the interest of the child\u201d. Under such rules and circumstances, there was evidently a heavy burden of proof on the side of a father of a child born out of wedlock. The crucial point is that the courts did not regard contacts between a child and the natural father prima facie as in the child\u2019s interest, a court decision granting access being the exception to the general statutory rule that the mother determined the child\u2019s relations with the father. The mother\u2019s negative attitude and the inevitable tensions between the parents in a situation of dispute, irrespective of the father\u2019s responsible motives, being thereby decisive for refusing access, there are reasons to conclude that the applicant as a natural father was treated less favourably than a divorced father in proceedings to suspend his existing right of access.

The first instance court, the Wiesbaden District Court, dismissed the applicant\u2019s access request on 5 September 1991, following a previously held oral hearing at which it heard the Wiesbaden Youth Office, both parties and several witnesses.

For the European Court of Human Rights  to say that the domestic court should not have based itself on that advice in my view runs counter to the above-mentioned principle \u201cthat the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities\u201d. In the circumstances of the present case the conclusion that  \u201cthe national authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation\u201d (paragraph 49) amounts to leaving practically no margin of appreciation at all to the domestic courts which, after all, are in a much better position than this Court to make the type of  sensitive  decisions as the one at issue here.

According to paragraph 55 of the present judgment the \u201ccrucial point is that the courts did not regard contacts between child and natural father prima facie as in the child\u2019s interest, a court decision granting access being the exception to the general statutory rule that the mother determined the child\u2019s relations with the father.\u201d  I fail to see that the approach of the domestic courts  on this point was  in any relevant manner different in Elsholz, in which the district court stated, inter alia, that the provisions \u201cconcerning the father\u2019s right to personal contact with his child born out of wedlock ...  was conceived as an exemption clause which had to be construed strictly\u201d (paragraph 13 of the Elsholz judgment).",

Therefore it could  not \u201cbe said  ... that a divorced father would have been treated more favourably\u201d (paragraph 61). The child\u2019s interests, however, seem to have been an equally paramount consideration in the present case, in which the Regional Court concluded its reasoning by emphasizing the importance of looking at the situation from the point of view of the child (\u201cDenn massgeblich ist stets eine Betrachtung aus der Sicht des Kindes.\u201d).",
