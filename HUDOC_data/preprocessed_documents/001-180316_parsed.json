Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuation decision in any other proceedings, the fairtrial guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 94). The Court has found that \u201cfollowing discontinuation of criminal proceedings the presumption of innocence requires that the lack of a person\u2019s criminal conviction be preserved in any other proceedings of whatever nature\u201d (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 102).",

Moreover, the statements declaring the applicant guilty of the new offence were made by different courts than the competent trial court. In the present case, however, the statements about the applicant\u2019s guilt were made by the court before which the trial had been conducted and in a judgment which convicted the applicant of criminal offences and established that a certain number of incidents had occurred as part of a broader series of events.",

While for the first four incidents the court had all elements to define the crimes as offences in the procedural sense, for fifty further incidents in respect of which it discontinued the proceedings it was convinced that the accused was guilty, but could not indicate the exact time and place at which the incidents took place owing to the victim\u2019s speech disorder (see paragraph 11 above). In this context the Court takes into account that the other fifty incidents were, as stated by the Regional Court, indeed similar and closely linked: they all related to the same type of offences, i.e. coercion to engage in sexual activity; they had been committed on the same victim within a certain period, from January 2001 to October 2007, with precisely the same intention of sexual abuse. This supported the finding that in such a case, against the background that the occurrence of the acts have been proven beyond reasonable doubt, it was not necessary to determine the exact time and place of every committed act. Thereby, the courts fulfilled the requirements which have been established in the domestic courts\u2019 case-law regarding the assessment of evidence in accordance with the particularities of serial offences in the field of sexual abuse (see paragraph 24 above).",
