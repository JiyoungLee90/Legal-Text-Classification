The case originated in an application (no. 38003/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Armenian national, Ms Roza Boyajyan (“the applicant”), on 8 October 2004.
The Armenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr G. Kostanyan, Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 19 September 2006 the President of the Third Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1935 and lives in .
Starting from 1971 the applicant made various deposits in Soviet roubles with the Armenian branch of the USSR Savings Bank. These included:
(a)  sums of money deposited on three deposit accounts (ժամկետային ավանդ) opened in 1973-1974 amounting to a total of 19,795.30 roubles as of 1 January 1993, sums of money deposited on three 40% offset accounts (40% փոխհատուցման հաշիվ) opened in 1991 amounting to a total of 8,264 roubles as of 1 January 1993, and sums of money deposited on three on-demand accounts (ցպահանջ հաշիվ) opened in 1971, 1977 and 1988, the latter in the name of the applicant's grand-daughter, amounting to a total of 29,384.81 roubles as of 1 September 1993;
(b)  23 State internal premium bonds of 1982 (1982 թ. պետական ներքին շահող փոխառության պարտատոմսեր), each worth 50 roubles;
(c)  four special-purpose State interest-free bonds of 1990 (1990 թ. պետական նպատակային անտոկոս փոխառության պարտատոմսեր): one worth 2,500 roubles entitling the applicant to receive a video recorder, one worth 1,000 roubles entitling her to receive a television set, and two others each worth 200 roubles entitling her to receive two sewing machines;
(d)  11 certificates of the USSR Savings Bank obtained in 1990 (ԽՍՀՄ խնայբանկի սերտիֆիկատ), each worth 1,000 roubles.
On 5 July 1993 the Government decided to restructure the Armenian branch of the USSR Savings Bank into the State Specialised Savings Bank of Armenia (hereafter, the Savings Bank). Later that month the Soviet rouble was withdrawn from circulation.
On 22 November 1993 the Armenian currency, the dram, was introduced, at a rate of 200 roubles to 1 dram.
On 26 April 2002 the Convention and Protocol No. 1 entered into force in respect of .
On 21 June 2004 the applicant applied to the Savings Bank seeking to recover her deposits.
By a letter of 21 July 2004 the Savings Bank informed the applicant that:
“...the question of compensation for deposits made with the Savings Bank in former  roubles prior to 1 January 1993 is currently at the centre of attention of the National Assembly and the Government of Armenia. The Decision no. 835 of the Government of Armenia of 8 September 2001, which states that '... the Republic of Armenia assumes responsibility for the future possible indexation of deposits made by citizens with the Savings Bank CJSC in former USSR roubles prior to the currency conversion of 1993', serves as proof of this.
As to your inquiry concerning the former  internal premium bonds of 1982 and the certificates, we would inform you that all operations in their respect were stopped by the decision of the Supreme Soviet of Armenia of 10 June 1993, until a final decision is adopted concerning their repayment by the CIS member States. However, no decision or directive was adopted thereafter.
As to the redemption of the former USSR special-purpose interest-free bonds given to the Armenian population in 1990, which were planned to be converted into household and domestic goods starting from 1993, this was found not to be feasible by Decree no. 377 of the Government of Armenia of 29 June 1992.
For purposes of compensation the Government of Armenia, in its Decree no. 345 of 5 July 1993, decided to index the nominal value of the above [special-purpose interest-free] bonds by 300% and to open a deposit account or to make payments by 1 August 1993, which you failed to do within the said period.
As you see, in the above circumstances the Savings Bank has no obligation to make payments in respect of the deposits and securities.
The Savings Bank will be able to serve citizens only after a decision is taken by the Government of Armenia concerning the choice of possible compensation alternatives for the deposits and the above securities and their payment.”
On 4 August 2004 the applicant lodged a claim with the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan against the Government, seeking to recover her deposits and securities made with the Savings Bank. She requested, in particular, that her savings be returned to her in the currency in which the deposits were made.
On 6 August 2004 the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan refused to admit the applicant's claim on the ground that:
“... the dispute is not subject to court examination, since the National Assembly and the Government of Armenia have not yet adopted relevant laws and decrees concerning the procedure for returning to citizens their deposits made with the Savings Bank of .”
On 13 August 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, arguing that the reasons for the refusal to admit her claim were groundless and seeking to reverse the decision of the District Court.
On 27 August 2004 the Court of Cassation decided to dismiss the applicant's appeal. In doing so, the Court of Cassation referred to the grounds for the refusal to admit the applicant's claim and found the District Court's decision to be well-founded.

Pursuant to this Decree the Savings Bank of  was sold to two private companies. The Ministry of Finance and Economy was instructed to conclude a privatisation agreement with the buyers, which was to contain guarantees on behalf of the .

The Armenian Government, based on the above-mentioned 2006 annual programme, was to develop the procedure for such compensation and to specify the lists of individuals enjoying a priority right to receive such compensation.
