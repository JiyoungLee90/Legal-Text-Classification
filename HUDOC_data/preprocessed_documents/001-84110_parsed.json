Belgium, judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series A no. 86, p. 14, \u00a7 26). In this respect, even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public (see Wettstein, cited above, \u00a7 44; Castillo Algar v.\u00a0Spain, judgment of 28\u00a0October 1998, Reports 1998VIII, p.\u00a03116, \u00a7\u00a045; Morris v. the , no. 38784/97, \u00a7 58, ECHR\u00a02002-I). Accordingly, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is such a legitimate reason, the standpoint of the party concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see P\u00e9tur Th\u00f3r Sigur\u00f0sson, cited above, \u00a7 37; Ferrantelli and Santangelo v. Italy, judgment of 7 August 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, p. 951, \u00a7 58).",

Even in the absence of any direct financial link between the judge and the defendant, the fact that his wife was employed by the defendant should have alerted him to the possibility that his impartiality might appear to be under doubt, and should have brought about a notice under Section 66 \u00a7 2. The applicant could not request his disqualification from sitting for the reasons detailed in the Court's admissibility decision of 9 October 2002 given in the present case. Secondly, the Court of Appeal did not address the applicant's concerns about the judge's bias. This may have been because under domestic law, challenges to judges must be made at the latest by the end of the first-instance trial (see Section 67 of the Civil Proceedings Act at paragraph 15 above). However, when the applicant raised the issue with the Court of Appeal, he gave that tribunal the opportunity to put his mind at rest as to his concerns about the perceived lack of impartiality on the part of the judge. The Court of Appeal's failure to comment may have confirmed the applicant's impression. Finally, the exclusion of the judge in question from other cases in which the defendant was a party supports the conclusion that the applicant's doubts were objectively justified.",
