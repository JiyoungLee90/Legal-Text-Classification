On 30 December 1994 the Mayor of Mykanów issued a decision granting building permission for a certain M.N., the proprietor of a plot of land adjacent to the applicants’ house, to construct a butchery and abattoir on his property. Since at least 1997 Mr M.N. had been running the butchery in question.
Following the re-opening of the case, on 17 September 1998 the Mayor’s decision of 1994 was quashed.
On 27 April 1998 M.N. requested planning permission in order to extend the butchery.
On 15 June 1998 the Mayor of Mykanów granted planning permission.
The applicants appealed against that decision.
On 21 July 1998 the Częstochowa Self-Government Board of Appeal upheld the challenged decision. The applicants lodged a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court.
On 23 May 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court allowed the complaint, quashed the challenged decision and remitted the case.
After the ’s judgment, on an unspecified date, the proceedings were discontinued because the investment in question had been completed.

On the basis of the decision of 9 February 1999 given by the Mayor of Mykanów M.N. carried out some building work and extended the butchery.
In the light of the fact that the extension to the butchery had been built on the basis of a final decision which was subsequently quashed, on 8 July 2002 the District Building Inspector ordered M.N. to carry out work in order to legalise the building.
On 25 September 2002 the Regional Building Inspector upheld the decision of 8 July 2002.
On 20 December 2001 the District Building Inspector ordered the demolition of a smoking chamber as it had been built by M.N. without the necessary permit.

On 1 July 2002 the District Building Inspector reminded Mr M.N. of the obligation to demolish the smoking chamber.
On 17 December 2002 the Supreme Administrative Court allowed the appeal and quashed the decision of 20 February 2002. Thus the decision of 20 December 2001 ordering the demolition of the smoking chamber became enforceable.

On 31 July 2003 the Regional Building Inspector again decided that the appeal lodged by Mr M.N. against the decision of 20 December 2001 should be rejected as lodged out of time. M.N. lodged a complaint against this decision with the Supreme Administrative Court. Since the relevant provisions had been amended, the complaint was transferred to the Regional Administrative Court.
On 7 October 2004 the applicants lodged a complaint with the Chief Building Inspector about inactivity on the part of the Regional Building Inspector in that the decision to demolish the illegal construction had not been enforced.

On 24 November 2006 the applicants lodged another complaint about inactivity on the part of the Regional Building Inspector.
On 15 January 2007 the Regional Building Inspector quashed the decision of 10 February 2006 and remitted the case.
On 23 January 2007 the Regional Building Inspector replied to the applicants’ complaint, explaining the reasons for the delay, which included problems with serving the correspondence and the fact that the inspector who was conducting the proceedings had been ill. The Inspector concluded that the appellate proceedings had been terminated by the decision of  15 January 2007.
On an unspecified date at the beginning of 2007 the applicants lodged a complaint with the Regional Administrative Court about inactivity on the part of the administrative authorities.
On 29 June 2007 the Regional Administrative Court examined their complaint and ordered the District Building Inspector to issue a decision within two months. The court found, inter alia, that “for the last few years no decision on the merits [had been] given”. The Regional Administrative Court found that the applicants had exhausted the available remedies as required by section 52 of the Proceedings before the Administrative Courts Act, in that they had lodged appeals with the Chief Inspector of Construction Supervision in which they had raised the problem of the length of the proceedings.
On 6 December 2007 the District Building Inspector, finding that M.N. had used the smoking chamber without the required permit, imposed a fine on him.

M.N. did not pay the fine,
On 10 September 2008 M.N. appealed against the Building Inspector’s decision.
On 24 September 2008, following an inspection of M.N.’s premises and finding that he had failed to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Act (Prawo Budowlane), the District Building Inspector ordered M.N. to suspend the operation of the butchery and to provide the necessary documentation on certain legal and technical issues.

The District Inspector inspected the area and informed all the parties to the administrative proceedings that the smoking chamber had been dismantled. This information was disputed by the applicants in their pleadings before the Court; on 19 August 2010 they submitted that M.N. was continuing to use the butchery and the smoking chamber.
On 13 May 2009 the Regional Building Inspector decided to stay the appellate proceedings which had been instituted by M.N. on 10 September 2008, considering that the judgment given by the Regional Administrative Court had not been enforceable.
On 28 May 2009 M.N. appealed.
On 15 July 2009 the Chief Inspector of Construction Supervision, considering that the ’s judgment of 23 February 2009 had become enforceable on 19 May 2009, quashed the Regional Building Inspector’s decision of 13 May 2009.

On 3 August 2000 a check of the level of noise coming from M.N.’s butchery was carried out at the applicants’ property. It was established that the admissible noise level was exceeded by 15 dB. Therefore, on 29 September 2000, the Regional Environment Inspector gave a decision and imposed an incremental fine on M.N.
On 6 December 2000 M.N. informed the Regional Environment Inspector that a special silencer had been installed in the smoking chamber.
On 18 and 19 December 2000 the Regional Environment Inspector inspected the butchery and confirmed that a silencer had indeed been installed and the permissible noise level was no longer being exceeded.

However, as a result of this set of proceedings, M.N. ceased the night-time operation of the smoking chamber.
On 23 and 24 September 2004, during a check carried out by the Regional Environment Inspector, it was confirmed that the smoking chamber was not operating at night. Subsequently, a noise test was carried out. The level was established as being 40.9 dB, which was only 0.9 dB above the permissible norm, which did not constitute a sufficient basis to impose a fine on M.N.

On 29 December 2004 the Chief Environment Inspector quashed the challenged decision and remitted the case.

The Governor relied on the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment of 29 July 2004, according to which the permissible level of noise for the relevant area had been increased to 45 dB.
On 12 April 2005 the Regional Environment Inspector made a check of the butchery and confirmed that it was not operating at night. M.N. constructed a shelter and a roof which functioned as acoustic screens.
On 13 April 2005 the Regional Environment Inspector discontinued the proceedings. The applicants appealed.
On 12 December 2005 the Chief Environment Inspector dismissed the appeal. The applicants did not lodge a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court. The decision of 12 December 2005 became final.
In a letter of 26 October 2007 the Regional Environment Inspector confirmed that the decision of 12 December 2005 was final and informed the applicants that no proceedings relating to M.N. and his butchery were being conducted before that administrative authority.
The relevant domestic law concerning the remedies for inactivity on the part of the administrative authorities at the material time is set out in the Court’s judgment in the case of Grabiński v. Poland, no. 43702/02, §§ 60-65, 17 October 2006.
