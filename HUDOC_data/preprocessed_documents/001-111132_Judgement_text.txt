The case originated in seven applications (nos. 36268/02, 25416/04, 25500/04, 43454/06, 24717/07, 16297/08 and 17068/08) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Romanian nationals (“the applicants”).
In applications nos. 36268/02 and 17068/08 the applicants also hold the American and Swiss citizenships respectively.
In application no. 24717/07 the applicant died in 2011. His heirs Liliana Dorogan and Iosif Gheorghe continued the procedure.
The applicants were represented as indicated in the appended table. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Irina Cambrea.
The applications were communicated to the Government on 25 January 2010, with the exception of application no. 25500/04 that was communicated on 1st September 2008.
The applicants are Romanian nationals. They are all owners of immovable property which was occupied by tenants by virtue of lease agreements concluded with the State. After the fall of the Communist regime, the applicants’ ownership was confirmed by the courts. The applicants therefore attempted, unsuccessfully though, to evict the tenants or to cash in the rent due to them. The relevant court decisions are set out in the table appended hereto.
