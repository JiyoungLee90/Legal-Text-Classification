It could not therefore be said that the local development plan was suddenly altered to a substantial degree. Moreover, the applicants did not sustain any damage on account of the apartment block having been constructed on the adjacent plot of land. In particular, they were not prevented from constructing on the land belonging to them as the local authorities had granted the first applicant planning permission in 1997 and 2001.

Finally, the Government indicated several types of remedies which the applicants should have exhausted before making their complaint to the Court. In particular they should have brought a civil action for compensation if they had sustained any damage in\u00a0consequence of the actions of public authorities or the private investor. The Government underlined that the apartment block had been built legally, in accordance with all safety and technical requirements, and that thus there had been no obligation on the authorities to demolish it or to prevent its construction.",
