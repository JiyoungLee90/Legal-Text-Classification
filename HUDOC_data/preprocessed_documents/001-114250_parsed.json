If the delay complained of arises in, or mainly in, the appellate proceedings themselves, it will not be practicable to submit such a ground at the outset of these proceedings. But it will or should be evident to any person concerned about such delay to identify and formulate it in good time before the proceedings are otherwise concluded. Leave can then be sought to expand any existing ground of appeal against sentence to include the complaint or, if there is otherwise no appeal against sentence, leave can be sought to lodge such an appeal out of time. There is no difficulty about the court affording a remedy of reduction of sentence within its existing powers. The court is in use when dealing with appeals against sentence to take into account relevant circumstances which have occurred since sentence was passed.

That time was largely the result of applications made by the applicant for extensions of time, which given the complexity of the issues may well have been justified.

Matters thereafter proceeded reasonably expeditiously to a decision (on 21\u00a0December 2002) by the single judge on the application for leave to appeal. It was thereafter that time passed, which, in retrospect, might have been better occupied. The single judge had refused leave to appeal in respect of certain of the stated grounds. The applicant was dissatisfied with that decision and wished leave on all the grounds stated. But he set about seeking to secure this by what turned out to be the wrong legislative route. He can hardly be criticised for doing so, since the route which he took was that generally regarded at that time by the legal profession as appropriate. The judges who considered his application to the High Court under section\u00a0107(4) of the 1995 Act fell into the same error. However, the basic explanation for the error was the problematic character of the relevant legislation. It was only after that had been addressed and elucidated on 8\u00a0December 2004 that matters could proceed on the right basis. This two-year excursion was unfortunate but it was attributable to the state of the legislation for which neither of the relevant public authorities, the Crown and the court, is responsible.\u201d",

I consider, however, that an accused person who asks the court to take the significant step of granting a diligence for the recovery of documents, whether from the Crown or from a third party, does require to explain the basis upon which he asks the court to order the haver to produce the documents. The court does not grant such orders unless it is satisfied that they will serve a proper purpose and that it is in the interests of justice to grant them. This in turn means that the court must be satisfied that an order for the production of the particular documents would be likely to be of material assistance to the proper preparation or presentation of the accused\u2019s defence. The accused will need to show how the documents relate to the charge or charges and the proposed defence to them. Such a requirement imposes no great burden on an accused person or his advisers: the averments in the petition may be relatively brief and the court will take account of any relevant information supplied at the hearing.\u201d",

The phrase \u2018equality of arms\u2019 brings to mind the rules of a mediaeval tournament \u2013 the idea that neither side may seek an unfair advantage by concealing weapons behind its back. But in this context the rules operate in one direction only. The prosecution has no Convention right which it can assert against the accused. Nor can it avoid the accused\u2019s Convention right by insisting that the duty does not arise unless the accused invokes it first. Secondly, the prosecution is under a duty to disclose to the defence all material evidence in its possession for or against the accused. For this purpose any evidence which would tend to undermine the prosecution\u2019s case or to assist the case for the defence is to be taken as material. Thirdly, the defence does not have an absolute right to the disclosure of all relevant evidence. There may be competing interests which it is in the public interest to protect. But decisions as to whether the withholding of relevant information is in the public interest cannot be left exclusively to the Crown. There must be sufficient judicial safeguards in place to ensure that information is not withheld on the grounds of public interest unless this is strictly necessary.\u201d",

The applicant had chosen to pursue every avenue available to him to investigate the case and delay the final outcome. In the circumstances the Government argued that the State had acted reasonably and with due expedition. Referring to the various proceedings before the courts between 2001 and 2009 and the regular procedural hearings conducted by the High Court and the Appeal Court, the Government concluded that there had been no single excessive period of delay, nor had there been an unreasonable delay overall. The applicant\u2019s conduct, on the other hand, had contributed to the length of the proceedings. In particular, he had shown no desire to bring the matters to a full hearing and had been astute to explain and justify why further time should be afforded to him for submission of documents, preparing of hearing or seeking new information.",

The applicant\u2019s appeal against sentence was, at that time, outstanding. However, on 7 April 2011 his counsel made it clear to the  that the appeal against sentence under the 1995 Act and the associated devolution minute would not be pursued. The Court does not consider that the application purportedly made pursuant to section 7 of the Human Rights Act can be considered part of the criminal appeal proceedings for the purposes of Article 6, in light of the insistence of applicant\u2019s counsel that the proceedings were wholly independent of the possibility envisaged under the 1995 Act to appeal against sentence (see\u00a0paragraphs 142 and 144 above).

The trial proceedings lasted almost five weeks and four separate written opinions were handed down by the trial judge (see paragraphs 21-26 above and the Court\u2019s decision in Beggs (No.\u00a02), cited above). The applicant\u2019s subsequent note of appeal relied on eight grounds of appeal against conviction and one ground of appeal against sentence, covering diverse and complex matters including prejudicial pre-trial publicity, extradition and the rule of specialty, the admission of evidence and the trial judge\u2019s directions to the jury, and each ground of appeal contained several subparagraphs (see paragraph 48 above). Shortly before the appeal was heard the applicant lodged a further ground of appeal regarding disclosure (see paragraph 133 above). From 2006 onwards, the applicant sought disclosure of a large volume of documents, both informally and through the use of court procedures, from a variety of bodies including the Crown, the Sheriff Court, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the police (see, inter alia, paragraphs 81, 85, 94, 98-101, 104, 107, 111-112, 115 and 122 above). This documentation was in addition to the extensive case file already in existence. He also pursued ancillary civil proceedings in respect of his detention at HM Prison Peterhead and the opening of his prison correspondence, as well as raising devolution minutes in the context of his appeal proceedings (see paragraphs 86 and 117 above). The multitude of court proceedings added to the complexity of proceedings which were in substance complicated and vast. The appeal hearing itself took eight days and the detailed judgment handed down was 128 pages long (see paragraphs 134-135 above and the Court\u2019s decision in Beggs (No. 2), cited above).",

However, if a State lets proceedings continue beyond the \u201creasonable time\u201d prescribed by Article 6 of the Convention without doing anything to advance them, it will be responsible for the resultant delay (see Price and Lowe, cited above, \u00a7 23).

In their second request for an extension (see paragraph 35 above) based on the need for further transcripts, the applicant\u2019s agents did not explain which transcripts were required and why they were needed. The Court notes that by the time the request was made, the SLAB had already processed, in two days, a request for sanction for further transcripts (see paragraph 34 above).\u00a0\u00a0As regards the third request for an extension in February 2002 (see\u00a0paragraph 37 above), based on the \u201cproduction of the \u2018Parole Report\u2019\u201d by the judge, the Court notes that the applicant did not specify when he or his solicitors first saw the note to the Parole Board, but it is clear that the note was available by 4 December 2001 (see paragraph 31 above) and it is therefore unclear why it would have prompted the need for an extension some two months later. The Court further observes that while the fourth request for an extension referred to factual inaccuracies in the trial judge\u2019s opinion, the applicant has not clarified to which of Lord Osborne\u2019s rulings he was referring, nor did he explain what the inaccuracies were. It appears that when the note of appeal was finally lodged with the court, it made no reference to any factual inaccuracies. The extension of time request also referred to the need for further transcripts. However, the Court notes that this request for an extension was made some five months after the conclusion of the trial. The applicant has failed to explain why further transcripts were required at this late stage and had not been sought earlier. Similar considerations apply to the reference in the extension of time request to the need for SLAB sanction for expert evidence to be obtained on the issue of pre-trial publicity. The Court notes that the question of pre-trial publicity was argued as a plea in bar of trial in October 2001 and the late decision that an expert opinion was required in order to formulate a relevant ground of appeal has not been explained by the applicant. The fifth extension was requested in April 2002 (see paragraph 42 above) in order to obtain authority to transcribe yet further evidence. Again, it is not clear why transcripts were still being sought at this late stage and it is clear that the request for sanction was treated promptly by the SLAB, being received on 19 March 2002 and granted the following day (see paragraph 41 above). Similarly, as regards the sixth request for an extension on 21 May 2002 (see\u00a0paragraph 45 above) on the basis of the applicant\u2019s transfer to HM\u00a0Prison Peterhead and the difficulty of arranging a meeting, the Court notes that an application for SLAB sanction for the costs of a visit to Peterhead was only made on 24 May 2002 and was granted three days after receipt of additional information requested (see paragraph 47 above).",

He referred to delays in obtaining authorisations by the SLAB and transcripts and a copy of the Book of Adjournal from the High Court. The Court notes that the facts outlined by the applicant demonstrate that the SLAB dealt with his requests promptly (see for example paragraphs 34, 41, 47, 59-60, 62, 64-65, 77 and 80 above). He further did not dispute the information provided by the Government as to the SLAB\u2019s treatment of his requests (see paragraph 228 above). That information discloses no significant periods of delay in sanctioning requests for additional expenditure. In particular, there can be no criticism of the SLAB\u2019s request for further information in order to assess whether there was a need for the additional expenditure to be incurred and paid for through public funds. Requests for further information were made timeously and once the requested information was received, the SLAB dealt promptly with legal aid applications. Accordingly the Court finds that no unreasonable delay on the part of the SLAB during this stage of proceedings has been established on the facts. There is also no evidence of unreasonable delay in obtaining transcripts and the applicant has not pointed to any occasion on which the clerk failed to promptly approve a request for further transcripts. The Court further observes that none of the applicant\u2019s requests for extension made reference to any delay in obtaining a copy of the Book of Adjournal. In any event the Court does not consider that any delay in obtaining a copy of the official record of the appeal proceedings should have had a significant effect on the preparation of the applicant\u2019s note of appeal, given the technical nature of the information it contained.",

Further, the note of appeal contained eight grounds of appeal against conviction and one ground of appeal against sentence covering diverse and complex legal issues, and was further divided into a number of subparagraphs.

The Government have not provided any evidence to support their contention that the error was of the applicant\u2019s own making and have not disputed the applicant\u2019s allegation that this procedure was standard at the time and was followed in thousands of appeals following the entry into force of the 1995 Act and until the High Court decision in his case.

The Court recalls that applicants are entitled to make use of all relevant domestic procedural steps but emphasises that they should do so with diligence and must bear the consequences when such procedural applications result in delay (see Jordan v. the  (no. 2), no. 49771/99, \u00a7 44 10\u00a0December 2002; Boczo\u0144 v. Poland, no. 66079/01, \u00a7 51, 30\u00a0January\u00a02007; and McFarlane, cited above, \u00a7 148). In the applicant\u2019s case three petitions for recovery of documents were lodged (see paragraphs 85, 111 and 122 above) together with associated devolution minutes (see paragraphs 86, 117 and 122 above). Various amendments to the petitions were made (see\u00a0paragraphs 87 and 116 above). One petition for recovery was lodged some three weeks later than the deadline permitted (see paragraph 111 above). Despite being ordered to do so prior to the hearing on 11-14 March 2008, the applicant failed to lodge an inventory detailing the extent of disclosure already made and the issues in relation to material not disclosed (see paragraphs 123 and 125 above). In the event, none of the petitions resulted in an order for recovery being made against the Crown and although some further material was disclosed to the applicant between July 2006 and May 2009, the Appeal Court in its judgment of 9 March 2010 indicated that the disclosure exercise which the applicant and his advisers had embarked upon had had little significant result but had substantially delayed the hearing of the appeal (see paragraph 136 above). This was a point reiterated in its later judgment of 12 March 2011, where the  accepted that the petitions for recovery might have been, to some extent, instrumental in obtaining disclosure of information, but emphasised that what was material was whether the exercise was justified (see\u00a0paragraph 152 above). Only once the petitions for recovery of documents had been withdrawn, in May 2009, could the court move to fix a hearing.",

It appears that a great deal of disclosure took place, and it is noteworthy that the only ground of appeal linked to non-disclosure related to a statement by I.C., which the Court found in its decision in Beggs (No.\u00a02) did not constitute material evidence in the case. The Appeal Court held regular procedural hearings in the applicant\u2019s case in order to assess progress on disclosure, and in affording such extensive opportunities to the applicant to avail himself of the procedural possibilities for further disclosure safeguarded the applicant\u2019s right to adequate time and facilities in the preparation of his case as well as his right to have access to all material evidence for or against him.",

However, the fact remains that Article 6 \u00a7 1 required the domestic court to adopt an active role in steering the appeal to a speedy conclusion, and in particular in the present case, to press for the resolution of the matters concerning disclosure and the fixing of a date for the appeal hearing, particularly in the period following the handing down of the Privy Council decision in McDonald and Others in October 2008 (see paragraph 128 above). There is no evidence before the Court that the domestic courts that the court took matters in hand in this way (see Richard Anderson, cited above, \u00a7 28).",
