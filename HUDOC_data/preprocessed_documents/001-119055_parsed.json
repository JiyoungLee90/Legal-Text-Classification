In support of this objection the Government relied on a judicial finding by a domestic court against the State for the excessive length of a set of judicial proceedings. The Government explained that the domestic courts could not have adduced the principle of res judicata in the case of the applicant company because decisions given by the chambre du conseil did not constitute res judicata. The Government also enclosed a 16 December 2005 judgment from the Luxembourg District Court and a judgment of 10 December 2009 in which the Court of Appeal had upheld the District Court\u2019s judgment, declaring the Luxembourg State liable for the damage caused by a search, pursuant to section 1(1) of the 1988 Law. Otherwise the applicant company could always have sought compensation for the damage under section 1(1) of the 1988 Law, which provided for compensation for victims of damage, even where the functioning of State services had not been defective, in cases of flagrant injustice.",

On the other hand, the case which was determined with final effect by the 10\u00a0December 2009 judgment of the Court of Appeal concerned not the principle of the search but the manner of its execution. The Court of Appeal in fact stated that \u201cin proceedings seeking to prove State liability vis-\u00e0-vis the execution of a search ordered by the investigating judge, it is unacceptable to focus the deliberations on the issue of the lawfulness, expediency and necessity of this investigative measure\u201d. Accordingly, the Government have not proved that the courts applied to under the 1988 Law would have jurisdiction to assess the necessity of an investigative measure, as the evidence produced shows that only the investigating judge holds such jurisdiction. However, the Government did not establish that it would still have been possible to apply to the investigating judge on this matter. Furthermore, the Government provided no examples of litigants obtaining compensation pursuant to section 1(2) of the 1988 Law.

In the alternative, the Government contended that the interference in question had been legally justified, had pursued the legitimate aims of preventing disorder and crime and protecting the rights and freedoms of others, and that it had been necessary in a democratic society. Confronted with facts which had constituted prima facie evidence of offences, it had been incumbent on the judicial authorities to initiate the requisite investigation for ascertaining the circumstances of the case in hand. The Government submitted that publishing companies could not be exempted from the implementation of criminal legislation, and that the impugned article had been published under a name which did not appear in the list of journalists officially recognised in Luxembourg, a fact which had necessitated investigations in order to identify the author of the article. Moreover, the interference had been fairly unintrusive given that the police officers had not actively searched for documents, all the documents seized had been voluntarily handed over by the journalist and the search and seizure had actually been in the journalist\u2019s and the publishing house\u2019s best interests. Furthermore, the investigating judge had only being doing his duty, since he had been obliged to gather both incriminating and exonerating evidence and since seizure was the only way to take possession of objects, even where they were handed over voluntarily.",

Germany, no.\u00a041604-98, ECHR 2005-IV, and Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, Series A no. 251-B). The Court has expanded its interpretation of the concept of \u201chome\u201d to include professional or business activities or premises (see Niemietz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30-31). In these cases the bearer of the rights under Article 8 were still natural persons. In the case of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Colas Est and Others v. France (no. 37971/97, ECHR 2002-III), however, the Court, referring to the nature of the Convention as a \u201cliving instrument which must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions\u201d and pointing out that the Court had already recognised a company\u2019s right under Article 41 to compensation for non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, ruled that \u201cthe time has come to hold that in certain circumstances the right guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention must be construed as including the right to respect for a company\u2019s registered office, branches or other business premises\u201d (\u00a7 41). The Court reached this conclusion after having, inter alia, cited the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities (CJEC). In Hoechst v.\u00a0Commission (judgment of 21 September 1989 in joined cases 46/87 and 227/88), the CJEC had concluded that, regardless of the non-applicability of Article 8, the need for protection in the sphere of the private activities of any person, whether natural or legal, must be recognised as a general principle of Community law.",

As regards the removal of the journalist\u2019s papers and the measure, which was remarkable in itself, of inserting a USB memory stick into his computer, the measures also targeted the journalist as a suspect, and the applicant company has not claimed that they directly affected it in any other way. In my view, moreover, these measures were not such as to qualify as interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for its private life. For these reasons, I consider that the application is manifestly ill-founded as regards the complaint under Article 8 and should have been declared inadmissible as regards that part.",
