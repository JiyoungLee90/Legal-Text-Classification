However, Article 5 \u00a7 3 requires that after a certain lapse of time the persistence of reasonable suspicion does not in itself justify deprivation of liberty and the judicial authorities should give other grounds for continued detention (see Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v. Poland, no.\u00a033492/96, \u00a7 80, 21 December 2000, and I.A. v. France, no. 28213/95, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, \u00a7 102). Those grounds, moreover, should be expressly mentioned by the domestic courts (see I\u0142owiecki v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 61). From the materials available to the Court, it does not appear that the domestic courts gave any such reasons or seriously considered any alternative preventive measures instead of detention - by relying essentially on the gravity of the charges, the authorities prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention on grounds which cannot be regarded as \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d. Furthermore the Court notes that in its decisions of 17 December 2002 and 11 April 2003 the domestic courts did not advance any grounds whatsoever for maintaining the applicant\u2019s detention.",
