The Government argued that the applicant had received adequate medical care comprising regular examinations and clinical testing by a large number of prison and civilian medical personnel and a life-supporting chemotherapy regimen. The administration of the detention facility had taken every possible step to safeguard the applicant\u2019s health. Doctors from the Centre had provided him with medical services in a special room on the ground floor of the facility where the necessary medical equipment had been installed. The Government noted that it had been impossible to transfer the applicant to any prison hospital in the Krasnodar Region as they had not had the medical equipment to perform haemodialysis.

The facility staff had also tried to make his walk to and from the haemodialysis room as comfortable as possible. Having acknowledged that although it was not possible to install a lift in the facility or transfer the applicant to a cell on the ground floor of the facility, the Government noted that warders and a prison nurse had always helped the applicant up and down the stairs, and allowed him to rest in the wheelchair between the flights of stairs for as much time as he had needed to recover his strength. According to the Government, the fact that the applicant had refused the warders\u2019 proposal to be carried on a stretcher whenever he had needed to leave his cell clearly demonstrated that the applicant had not experienced any suffering during those walks. It had also been the applicant\u2019s own choice not to leave his cell for daily walks in the recreation yard of the detention facility.",

The applicant insisted that in violation of the requirements of the domestic law and despite the absence of qualified medical personnel and necessary medical equipment, the Russian authorities had refused to admit him to a prison hospital and had kept him in the detention facility, where only healthy inmates should have been detained.

It has already held on a number of occasions that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 69, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV, and Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI). The objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies cannot be raised against an applicant if, in spite of the latter\u2019s failure to observe the forms prescribed by law, the competent authority has nevertheless examined the substance of the claim (see, mutatis mutandis, Dzhavadov v. Russia, no.\u00a030160/04, \u00a7\u00a027, 27\u00a0September 2007; Ska\u0142ka v. Poland (dec.), no.\u00a043425/98, 3\u00a0October 2002; Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others\u00a0v.

The Court therefore finds that since the same domestic courts, to which a tort action laid, examined the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaints about the inadequate conditions of his detention, he cannot be said to have failed to exhaust domestic remedies. The Court therefore dismisses the Government\u2019s non-exhaustion objection.",

Although Article 3 of the Convention cannot be construed as laying down a general obligation to release detainees or place them in a civil hospital, even if they are suffering from an illness which is particularly difficult to treat (see Mouisel, cited above, \u00a7 40), it nonetheless imposes an obligation on the State to protect the physical well-being of persons deprived of their liberty. The Court cannot rule out the possibility that in particularly serious cases situations may arise where the proper administration of criminal justice requires remedies to be taken in the form of humanitarian measures (see Matencio v. France, no. 58749/00, \u00a7\u00a076, 15 January 2004, and Sakkopoulos v. Greece, no. 61828/00, \u00a7 38, 15\u00a0January 2004). In exceptional circumstances, Article 3 may go as far as requiring the conditional liberation of a prisoner who is seriously ill or disabled. In applying these principles, the Court has already held that the detention of an elderly sick person over a lengthy period may fall within the scope of Article 3 (see Papon v. France (no. 1) (dec.), no.\u00a064666/01, ECHR\u00a02001-VI; Sawoniuk v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a063716/00, ECHR 2001-VI; and Priebke v. Italy (dec.), no. 48799/99, 5\u00a0April 2001). For instance, in Farbtuhs v. Latvia, (no. 4672/02, 2\u00a0December 2004), the Court concluded that the detention of a disabled seventy-nine-year-old applicant was in breach of Article 3 on account of \u201chis age, infirmity and health situation\u201d. Furthermore, the Court has held that detaining a person suffering from tetraplegia in conditions inappropriate to her state of health amounted to degrading treatment (see Price, cited above, \u00a7 30).",

Thus, in Mouisel v.

This test was further developed in the case of Gelfmann v. France (no.\u00a025875/03, 14\u00a0December 2004), where the Court took into account, among other relevant factors, the dynamics of the applicant\u2019s health condition, the possibility of conditional release or parole for a seriously ill detainee if his health deteriorated, and the applicant\u2019s own attitude (namely, his persistent refusal to cooperate with the doctors).\u00a0In the cases of Henaf\u00a0v.\u00a0France (no. 65436/01, \u00a7\u00a7 49 et seq., ECHR 2003-XI) and Mouisel (cited above) the Court also analysed whether the application of handcuffs or the shackling of a seriously ill detainee to his bed was justified by any security risks. The applicant\u2019s potential \u201cdangerousness\u201d was also taken into account in the case of Sakkopoulos v. Greece (no. 61828/00, \u00a7 44, 15\u00a0January 2004) in order to decide whether his continuous detention was justified.",

The Court further notes that, while it appears that the judge who authorised the applicant\u2019s placement in custody took no steps, before committing him to a regular detention facility, to ascertain where he would be detained or to ensure that it would be possible to provide adequate facilities given his severe level of disability, on every other occasion when the question of the extension of the applicant\u2019s detention arose or when he complained about the conditions of his detention, the courts considered the detention facility suitable for accommodating his needs as a disabled detainee.

Among the conditions he complained of were the inaccessibility of the facilities on the ground floor, counting the recreation yard and visiting rooms, the inappropriate sanitary conditions for a person of his state of health, hazardous access to life-supporting medical facilities installed on the ground floor and the existence of impediments on his way to court hearings, medical procedures performed outside the detention facility, and so on.",

While the frequency of his trips to the ground floor during the first three months of his detention cannot be ascertained, it appears that after the failure of his renal transplant and initiation of haemodialysis at the end of April 2009, his use of the stairs became a daily occurrence. The Court observes that at least four times a week for almost fifteen months the applicant, a disabled and extremely overweight individual who depended on a wheelchair for mobility, had to descend and ascend four flights of stairs on his way to and from the lengthy, complicated and tiring vital medical procedure of haemodialysis. He had to endure similar trips whenever he needed to visit the medical unit, see his lawyer, undergo clinical testing in the Centre, take part in investigative procedures or attend a court hearing. Although assisted by the warders and an inmate nurse and allowed to take short breaks in the wheelchair between the stair flights, the applicant had to rely largely on his weak legs and extremely poor eyesight to negotiate the hazardous flights of stairs, clearly inadequate to address the needs of wheelchair-bound inmates. These forced walks undoubtedly inflicted unnecessary pain on the applicant and subjected him to an unreasonable risk of serious health damage. In these circumstances, the Court does not find it surprising that he refused to add up yet another trip, to the recreation yard, to his daily routine of climbing the stairs. As a result he did not have an outdoor recreation walk during the entire period of his detention in facility no. 5, save for two occasions in May 2010, remaining confined within the walls of the detention facility twenty-four hours a day. In this respect, the Court reiterates that it has already had an occasion to find Article 3 violated by the lack of opportunity for outdoor exercise (see Poltoratskiy v. , no. 38812/97, \u00a7 146, ECHR 2003V). However, the Court finds it more striking that the applicant was so frustrated, exhausted and unable to cope with the stress and humiliation resulting from the absence of a lift in the facility that he occasionally refused to leave his cell to take life-supporting haemodialysis or to submit to medical examinations.",

The sheer frequency with which the applicant had to use the stairs, not to mention the physical suffering, as well as the psychological burden that he experienced in attempting to reach the inaccessible facilities, indicates that he has been subjected to treatment running contrary to the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention, having been incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm to his health and having been denied the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities.",

However, the Court cannot overlook the applicant\u2019s claim that the detention authorities were indifferent to his accessibility needs. The prison management made no improvements which could have mitigated his access to the medical, recreational or administrative facilities over time, although the frequency with which the applicant needed to use the stairs indicated that the authorities should have taken action to address his needs. Additionally, given the number of grievances the applicant appears to have lodged regarding the conditions of his detention, the Court finds it undisputable that the authorities were aware of the applicant\u2019s unusual distress. While reiterating its constant jurisprudence, according to which a State has a sufficient margin of discretion in defining the manner in which it fulfils its obligation to protect the physical well-being of persons deprived of their liberty, inter alia, by choosing an appropriate facility, taking into account \u201cthe practical demands of imprisonment\u201d, as long as the standard of chosen care is \u201ccompatible with the human dignity\u201d of a detainee (see Aleksanyan v. , no.\u00a046468/06, \u00a7\u00a0140, 22 December 2008, and most recently, Vasyukov v.\u00a0, no. 2974/05, \u00a7 79, 5 April 2011), the Court finds it inexplicable that the Russian authorities persistently dismissed the applicant\u2019s pleas for a transfer to another detention facility or a prison hospital, given, and it was not disputed by the Government, that detention facility no. 5 was initially unprepared to accommodate an inmate of the applicant\u2019s needs, lacking the medical licence, equipment and personnel to provide him with the required medical care, including haemodialysis. Although the necessary medical equipment was subsequently installed in the facility and the applicant started receiving treatment from licensed medical staff from outside hospitals, it did not alleviate his situation as regards his access to the facilities. The Court reiterates the Government\u2019s argument that accommodation suitable for prisoners in the applicant\u2019s unfortunate condition did not exist in the Krasnodar Region at the time. However, it is not the Krasnodar Region but the  which is the Party responsible under the Convention for ensuring compliance with its standards. The Court is concerned to find that, despite a number of requests to that effect from the applicant, no attempt was made to find a place of detention appropriate for the applicant in another region of Russia (see, for similar reasoning, Mathew v. the , no. 24919/03, \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 215, ECHR 2005IX).",

Finding otherwise would place on the applicant, rather than the authorities, the burden to ensure a lawful basis for his continued detention (see, among other authorities, Melnikova v. , no. 24552/02, \u00a7 62, 21 June 2007; Shukhardin v.

It also failed to set a time-limit for the continued detention or for a periodic review of the preventive measure.\u00a0The Court has already found violations of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (c) of the Convention in a number of cases against  concerning a similar set of facts (see, for example, Solovyev v. Russia, no.\u00a02708/02, \u00a7\u00a7 95-100, 24 May 2007; Shukhardin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-70; and Belov v. Russia, no.\u00a022053/02, \u00a7\u00a7 80-83, 3 July 2008). In particular, the Court has held that the absence of any grounds given by judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for an unspecified period of time is incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see also Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no.\u00a055669/00, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, 2\u00a0March 2006, and Sta\u0161aitis v. , no.\u00a047679/99, \u00a7\u00a067, 21 March 2002). Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2005-X).",

Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention cannot be seen as unconditionally authorising detention provided that it lasts no longer than a certain period. Justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Shishkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a038822/97, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2003-I).",

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina\u00a0v. Russia, no.\u00a054071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005, and Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 84-85, 26 July 2001). The national judicial authorities must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and must set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is not the Court\u2019s task to establish such facts and take the place of the national authorities which ruled on the applicant\u2019s detention. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in the domestic courts\u2019 decisions and of the established facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Korchuganova\u00a0v. Russia, no.\u00a075039/01, \u00a7\u00a072, 8 June 2006; Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7 86; and Labita, cited above, \u00a7 152).",

Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v.\u00a0, 26 June 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 207; see also Panchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7 102, 8\u00a0February 2005; Goral v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a038654/97, \u00a7 68, 30 October 2003; and Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081).

In particular, they found that his criminal record and alleged authority in the criminal underworld made him particularly prone to reoffend, abscond or interfere with the course of the criminal proceedings. The authorities considered that the applicant\u2019s ties to the criminal environment would give him an opportunity to influence witnesses and to destroy evidence if released. In these circumstances the Court is prepared to accept that at the initial stage of the proceedings the courts could have validly presumed the existence of a risk that, if released, the applicant might abscond, reoffend or interfere with the proceedings given the nature of his criminal activities (see, for similar reasoning, B\u0105k v. , no. 7870/04, \u00a7 62, 16\u00a0January 2007).",

The Court notes in this respect that after the renal transplant failure in April 2009 the applicant was almost daily in need of hours-long haemodialysis sessions. His restricted ability to move, as well as the necessity for him to remain under constant medical supervision considerably reduced the risk of his absconding. However, the domestic courts failed to take the changed circumstances into account and continued to extend the applicant\u2019s detention without any assessment of whether, considering the applicant\u2019s medical condition, that risk remained real. In the Court\u2019s opinion, particularly after April 2009 the risk of his absconding was mitigated by his medical condition, so that it was no longer sufficient to outweigh his right to a trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

The decisions to extend the detention pending pre-trial investigation and trial underlined the fact that the fears of collusion were founded on the applicant\u2019s particular status in the criminal underworld. The judicial authorities considered the risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses or of the obstruction of the proceedings by other unlawful means to be so real that they took the decision to hold the trial in camera. In this context the Court observes that the danger of perversion of justice must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors. In particular, regard must be had to the character of the person involved, his morals, his assets, and so on (see W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, Series A no. 254A). Having said that, the Court would emphasise that there is a general rule that the domestic courts, in particular the trial court, are better placed to examine all the circumstances of the case and take all the necessary decisions, including those in respect of pre-trial detention. The Court may intervene only in situations where the rights and liberties guaranteed under the Convention have been infringed (see Isayev and Others v. , no. 43368/04, \u00a7 148, 21 June 2011).",

The Court does not underestimate the fact that the domestic authorities had to take statements from witnesses in a manner which had to exclude any doubt as to their veracity. The Court thus concludes that, in the special circumstances of the case, the risk of the applicant interfering with the course of justice actually existed and justified holding him in custody for the entire relevant period (see, for similar reasoning, Celejewski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 17584/04, 4 May 2006, and \u0141aszkiewicz v. , no. 28481/03, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, 15 January 2008).",

The Court therefore concludes that the national authorities displayed special diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. The length of the investigation and of the trial was justified by the complexity of the case. It should not be overlooked that, while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the efforts of the judges to clarify fully the facts in issue, to provide both the defence and the prosecution with all the necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case and to give judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence to be imposed (see, for similar reasoning, B\u0105k, cited above, \u00a7 64) .",
