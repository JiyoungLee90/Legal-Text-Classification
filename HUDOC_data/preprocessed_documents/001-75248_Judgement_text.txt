The case originated in an application (no. 38341/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mrs Desa Ješič (“the applicant”), on 7 October 2002.
The applicant was represented by the Verstovšek lawyers. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney-General.
The applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts to which she was a party was excessive. In substance, she also complained about the lack of an effective domestic remedy in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings (Article 13 of the Convention).
On 15 September 2004 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Žalec.
On 1 December 1998 the applicant slipped in the premises of the company S and injured herself. S had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZA.
On 14 July 1999 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZA in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 2,210,310 tolars (approximately 9,210 euros) for the injuries sustained.
Between 16 September 1999 and 17 April 2003 the applicant lodged four preliminary written submissions and/or adduced evidence.
Between 8 May 2001 and 21 March 2002 she made three requests that a date be set for a hearing.
Of the four hearings held between 12 September 2002 and 8 May 2003, none was adjourned at the request of the applicant.
During the proceedings, the court appointed a medical expert and once examined a witness at home.
At the last hearing, the court decided to deliver a written judgment. The judgment, upholding the applicant’s claim in part, was served on the applicant on 23 June 2003.
On 4 July 2003 the applicant appealed to the  (Višje sodišče v Celju). ZM cross-appealed.
On 7 April 2005 the court allowed both appeals in part and remitted a part of the case to the first-instance court for re-examination.
The judgment was served on the applicant on 5 May 2005.
On 21 September 2005 the applicant withdrew her claim since the parties had reached an out-of-court settlement. In the letter to the Celje District Court of 21 September 2005, she waved her right to receive the court’s written decision on termination of the proceedings.
