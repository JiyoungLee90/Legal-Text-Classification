It considered that the requirement for lawyers seeking access to classified documents to undergo an authorisation procedure was justified from the standpoint of Article 8 of the Convention by the need to protect interests pertaining to national security and public order. The Supreme Administrative Court observed in that connection that the hearing had been adjourned so that the second applicant could apply for authorisation, but that she had not seen fit to do so. The consideration of the case in camera had also been justified by the confidential nature of the information contained in the file.

Accordingly, before excluding the public from a particular set of proceedings, courts must consider whether such exclusion is necessary in the specific circumstances in order to protect a public interest, and must confine the measure to what is strictly necessary in order to attain the objective pursued (see Belashev, cited above, \u00a7 83).",

Some States Parties to the Convention have adopted such mechanisms, opting, for instance, to publish only the operative part of the judgment (see Welke and Bia\u0142ek, cited above, \u00a7 84) or to partially classify such judgments (see A. and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7 93, ECHR 2009). The Court is not convinced that in the instant case the protection of the confidential information contained in the file made it necessary to restrict the publication of the judgments in their entirety, still less for such a considerable period of time. Furthermore, as the Court noted above on the subject of the holding of public hearings, the restrictions on publication of the judgment resulted from the automatic classification of the entire file as secret, without the domestic courts having conducted an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of such a measure in the specific case.",

The Court observes in this regard that the second applicant\u2019s inability to consult the case file resulted in the present case from her refusal to request authorisation to access classified information, as she was required to do in view of the presence of confidential documents in the file. As stated above, the Court recognises that the State may have legitimate grounds to limit access to certain documents, especially when they concern State security (see paragraph 73 above and the judgments in Turek v. Slovakia, no. 57986/00, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2006II (extracts), and Welke\u00a0and Bia\u0142ek, cited above, \u00a7 63). The necessity for a lawyer to undergo security screening before being given access to such information in the context of court proceedings does not appear in itself to infringe the principle of equality of arms or, more generally, the fairness of the proceedings. More specifically, the first applicant\u2019s assertion that the representative of the Ministry of the Interior had access to the file without having to request authorisation does not appear to be borne out by the information available to the Court. The Protection of Classified Information Act stipulates that, with the exception of a few senior State officials, everyone must obtain authorisation in order to access confidential information, including officials whose work requires such access (see\u00a0paragraphs 42 and 43 above). There is nothing to indicate that this procedure was not complied with in the present case or that the representative of the Ministry of the Interior in the court proceedings did not have such authorisation.",

Furthermore, the domestic regulations state that any refusal by the Ministry\u2019s security officer to issue authorisation is open to appeal before the National Commission on Security of Information, a specialised independent authority of the Ministry of the Interior with no connection to the legal proceedings which were under way (see paragraph 46 above in\u00a0fine).",

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court regards the accused as guilty (see, among other authorities, Minelli\u00a0v.\u00a0Switzerland, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 62). While the principle of the presumption of innocence is one of the elements of a fair criminal trial required by Article 6 \u00a7 1, it is not merely a procedural safeguard in criminal proceedings. Its scope is more extensive and requires that no representative of the State or a public authority should declare a person guilty of an offence before his or her guilt has been established by a court (see \u00c7elik (Bozkurt) v. Turkey, no. 34388/05, \u00a7 29, 12 April 2011, and Moullet v. France (dec.), no. 27521/04, 13 September 2007).",

Nevertheless, if a domestic decision concerning the disciplinary sanctions contains a statement imputing criminal liability to the person concerned, this may raise an issue falling within the ambit of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see \u00c7elik (Bozkurt), cited above, \u00a7 32).",

The facts were duly established before the administrative courts, which did not base their decisions on the findings made in the criminal proceedings, and the applicant had the opportunity to dispute the truth of the allegations. Furthermore, nothing in the findings or the language of the administrative courts\u2019 decisions would appear to call into question the first applicant\u2019s innocence or imply that she was guilty of the offences with which she was charged in the criminal proceedings. Moreover, the Supreme Administrative Court referred to those proceedings only in replying to the first applicant\u2019s submissions, when it stated that the administrative authority was not obliged to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings before imposing disciplinary sanctions (see Hrdalo v.
