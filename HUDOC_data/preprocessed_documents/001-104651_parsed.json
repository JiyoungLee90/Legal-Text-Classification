Thus, the report did not state what examination had been carried out by a particular expert, what facts a particular expert had established and what conclusions he or she had reached.

The applicant further complained that the questions to the jury had been formulated in breach of the domestic law. The presiding judge had dismissed his request to put to the jury questions as to whether the information collected, stored and transmitted by him had constituted State secrets and had been received from closed sources. No questions had been put to the jury as to whether he had had intent to damage national security, whether the representatives of Alternative Futures had belonged to foreign intelligence or whether he had transmitted information which had previously been published in open sources. Nor was the latter question examined in the judgment. The applicant further argued that the trial court had had no grounds to declare the exculpatory expert reports of 30 June and August 2000 inadmissible evidence, to reject his request for examination of N. and K. as witnesses and simultaneously to refuse to declare the inculpatory expert report of 18\u00a0July 2002, which had the same procedural flaw as the former two reports, inadmissible evidence.

Where they relied on other reasons \u2013 the risk of absconding, obstructing investigation and reoffending \u2013 or stated that such reasons underlying the original detention order remained valid four years later, they made no reference in their decisions to any factual circumstances to explain the existence of such risks at the particular time of their review (the Moscow City Court\u2019s decisions of 3 and 4 October 2002 as upheld by the Supreme Court on 25 December 2002, and the Moscow City Court\u2019s decision of 29 September 2003 as upheld by the Supreme Court on 12 November 2003). The applicant\u2019s argument that his visa for a trip abroad, to which Moscow City Court referred in its decisions of 3 and 4 October 2002, had expired in November 1999 was ignored by Supreme Court on appeal. So were other arguments, such as his family ties and his permanent place of residence, put forward by the defence in their applications for release, some of which were supported by nongovernmental and other organisations and persons as the applicant\u2019s potential guarantors. In two decisions no reasons whatsoever were cited for the applicant\u2019s continued detention (the Kaluga Regional Court\u2019s decision of 27 December 2001 as upheld by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 20\u00a0March 2002).

The presiding judge could only replace a judge who had begun examining a case if there were objective reasons which made it impossible for that judge to complete the examination of the case.

However, no such circumstances occurred during the applicant\u2019s trial. The Government argued before the Court that the reasons for the replacement of the presiding judge were Judge Sh.\u2019s involvement in several other criminal proceedings in complex cases and his annual leave scheduled from 15 December 2003 to 14 January 2004. The Court considers that workload and annual leave, akin to those cited by the Government, may be inherent in any judge\u2019s professional reality and cannot plausibly explain that Judge Sh. could \u201cno longer take part\u201d in the proceedings. If the intention behind the transfer had been to avoid the delay in examining the case, such counterarguments as the need to carry out the selection of a new composition of the jury and start the trial from zero should have been taken into account too. Moreover, the new presiding judge was not able to start the trial until March 2004, three and a half months after her assignment. It appears that since the jury had been formed and the trial started, the reasons cited by the Government could not in the circumstances plausibly explain that the need to change the entire composition of the court and to re-commence the trial outweighed the interest of justice in the continued examination of the case by its original composition (see, with necessary changes made, Mellors v.\u00a0the\u00a0 (dec.), no. 57836/00, 30\u00a0January 2003). In any event, it is not for the Court to establish the circumstances which called for the replacement of the judge. They should have been made known to the defence in the domestic trial proceedings. However, no procedural decision stating the grounds and reasons for the replacement had been issued and the defence had been kept in uncertainty until the end of the trial despite their inquiries. They did not, therefore, have the possibility of challenging the decision to replace the judge.",

According to the Court\u2019s caselaw, the disclosure of the State\u2019s interest in a given weapon and that of the corresponding technical knowledge, which may give some indication of the state of progress in its manufacture, were capable of causing considerable damage to national security (they referred to Hadjianastassiou v.\u00a0Greece, 16 December 1992, \u00a7\u00a045, Series A no. 252). The conviction of an individual for such a disclosure could not be seen as a violation of Article\u00a010 of the Convention. The State had not violated Article 10 by holding the applicant criminally liable for disclosure of State secrets of a military nature to a foreign intelligence service. The circumstances of the case, as established by the domestic courts, showed that the applicant had used his research skills to damage Russia\u2019s external security for the purpose of obtaining financial compensation. The fact that he had not had access to State secrets did not relieve him of criminal liability for divulging classified data to a foreign state. The classified information could have been received by any means. Through his education and the post he occupied at the Institute of the USA and , the applicant had professional contacts with a number of officials in the Ministry of Defence, who had had access to State secrets. He had been purposefully eliciting classified information from them. In his videoed statements to FSB officials, which were used as evidence at the trial, the applicant had repeatedly affirmed that he had realised that his interlocutors were agents of foreign intelligence services; however, he had continued to transmit information to them because of his difficult financial situation. As an educated person and a scientist, the applicant could and should have known of the restrictions on his right to impart information. His argument that the relevant information had been publicly available was untenable. It had been established at the trial that the information could not have been received from open sources and its divulgence had damaged Russia\u2019s security and defence.",

Furthermore, in a jury trial, as regulated by Russian law, evidence and a defendant\u2019s guilt were the exclusive competence of a jury. The jury in the applicant\u2019s trial had considered the evidence submitted by the prosecution sufficient to find the applicant guilty of the charges brought against him. They had unanimously found him guilty. According to the law, the jury verdict could not be called into question. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s conviction had been based on Article\u00a0275 of the Criminal Code. The decrees by the Ministry of Defence had merely been specific documents which were used for the expert assessment. The main documents defining the list of classified information had been the Official Secrets Act and Presidential decree no. 1203, which had complied with the requirements of accessibility and foreseeability.",

A complaint is characterised by the facts alleged in it and not merely by the legal grounds or arguments relied on (see \u015eerife Yi\u011fit v.  [GC], no.\u00a03976/05, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2010-...). Having regard to this observation, the Court considers that the essence of the applicant\u2019s complaints is that he did not receive a fair trial, a matter which primarily falls within the ambit of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Having found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on the ground of the lack of independence and impartiality of the trial court (see paragraphs 189-193 above), the Court does not consider it necessary to examine whether such a court afforded the applicant a fair trial (see Kyprianou, cited above, \u00a7 141, and, with necessary changes made, Findlay, cited above, \u00a7 80, and Taxquet, cited above, \u00a7 102).",
