On 17\u00a0April 1992, in judgment no.\u00a01544/1992, the plenary of the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the application. It observed that, pursuant to Law no.\u00a02190/1920, a decision taken by the general meeting of shareholders of a company set up in accordance with that Law could be challenged only by shareholders who held at least 5% of the capital, had been present at the meeting when the decision was taken and had opposed it. Parliament had had good reasons to restrict the right of access to the courts in such a way. The right to challenge decisions of the general meeting should be vested only in shareholders who were closely associated with the company\u2019s activities, in which small shareholders were usually not interested. In addition, the company\u2019s competitors could very easily acquire a small number of shares and attempt to harm its interests. The same restrictions applied to the right of access to a court for the purpose of challenging administrative decisions approving those of the general meeting of shareholders. Shareholders who held less than 5% of the capital could challenge an administrative decision of this type only if they could prove that it affected them personally. An increase in the company\u2019s capital could not in itself harm the interests of a shareholder who held less than 5% of the capital. Moreover, the same rules were applicable where the decision to increase the capital had been taken by a temporary administrator. In the instant case, on 29 July 1986 the applicants had held 3.35% of the BCG\u2019s capital (one having 0.37% and the other 2.98%) and would therefore not have been able to challenge the increase in capital if it had been decided upon by a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders. The applicants could not rely on the fact that they now held a lower proportion of the shares in order to establish that their personal interests had been harmed by the decision to increase the capital. Nor had they pleaded any other fact which could warrant such a conclusion. Accordingly, the Supreme Administrative Court decided by a majority to dismiss the application for judicial review, on the ground that the applicants did not have locus standi.",

That case was not heard within a reasonable time. The applicants in that case therefore suffered a breach of the basic right guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 and I cannot agree that the applicants in the three subsequent cases did not suffer the same kind of breach, just because their cases were made to depend on the first one. Surely it follows \u2013 logically and juridically \u2013 that the breach of the reasonable time requirement in the first case cannot be said to have purged the unreasonable delay in the three cases which followed it simply because it was juridically convenient to tie them up with the previous case which was already unreasonably long.",
