Therefore, at that moment he had not had any interest to lodge a constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. The applicant also submitted that, in view of the fact that the Rijeka Municipal Court had not observed the order of the Rijeka County Court to decide his case within the specified time-limit, he was not required to lodge a second request for the protection of the right to a hearing within reasonable time to complain about the length of the proceedings in the period after the Rijeka County Court\u2019s decision.",

Having regard to section 64 of the Constitutional Court Act (see paragraph 14 above), it follows that the applicant could have lodged a constitutional complaint against it the latest on 13 November 2009. The Court further refers to its above finding that the applicant can still claim to be the victim of the violation of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time primarily because the Rijeka Municipal Court did not comply with the Rijeka County Court\u2019s order to deliver a decision in his case within ten months (see paragraphs 22-23 above). That became evident on 14\u00a0March 2010 when that time-limit expired. However, at that moment the statutory time-limit for lodging a constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court\u2019s decision had already elapsed. In any event, given that the Constitutional Court is not competent to supervise the implementation of higher courts\u2019 decisions ordering lower courts to decide a case within a certain time-limit (see paragraph 15 above), the Court does not see, and the Government has not demonstrated, how lodging a constitutional complaint would have remedied the failure of the Municipal Court to comply with the County Court\u2019s order in the present case.",
