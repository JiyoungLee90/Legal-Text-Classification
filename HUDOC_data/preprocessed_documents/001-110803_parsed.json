Despite the elections having been described as generally fair and free,  could not yet be considered a representative democracy. The 2005 presidential elections were considered rigged and had been accompanied by severe outbursts of violence. With regard to respect for human rights in Togo, the Federal Asylum Office held that although the situation had improved slightly, serious violations of human rights persisted, such as inhuman treatment of prisoners, impunity for illegal acts committed by the authorities, arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention pending trial, and similar. Freedom of opinion, freedom of the press and freedom of assembly were not generally respected. No violence on the part of state organs or government forces against opposition members had been recorded since the end of 2005.

Furthermore, since the 2007 parliamentary elections the UFC had held twenty-seven seats in parliament. Lastly, according to the Federal Asylum Office\u2019s information, returned asylum seekers had not been subjected to systematic persecution. Therefore, the authority concluded that the applicant\u2019s claim for asylum was based on a fabricated story and that he had only submitted speculations on what could happen to him upon his return to Togo, and provided no indication of actual persecution against him on grounds recognized in Article 1 Section A Number 2 of the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.

Several families had protested against those practices and eventually M.A. had organised demonstrations against the way relief items were distributed in the camp. As a result, the police had come, beaten them up and prohibited any further demonstrations. Police and security services had accused M.A. and his followers of causing disturbances in the camp and uttered their threats. M.A. had told the story to a member of the UFC, who had helped him to leave the country.
