Thus, in circumstances such as those of the present case, both the applicants\u2019 father and subsequently the applicants suffered interference with their property rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Anthony Aquilina v. Malta, no. 3851/12, \u00a7 53, 11\u00a0December 2014). Further, the Court notes that it has already held, in similar circumstances, that, at the time, the owners (ancestors of the applicants) could not reasonably have had a clear idea of the extent of inflation in property prices in the decades to come, and that the decisions of the domestic courts regarding their request challenging such laws constituted interference in the applicants\u2019 (heirs) respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Zammit and Attard\u00a0Cassar, v.\u00a0Malta, no. 1046/12, \u00a7\u00a7 50-51, 30\u00a0July 2015). As with this Court\u2019s practice, the domestic court has also accepted the applicant\u2019s standing, in relation to their possessions, over the entire period complained of.",

As to whether appropriate and sufficient redress was granted, the Court considers that even though the market value is not applicable and the rent valuations may be decreased due to the legitimate aim at issue, a global award of EUR\u00a010,000 covering pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage for a property worth EUR\u00a016,800 in annual rent can hardly be considered sufficient for a violation which persisted since 1987. That is enough to find that the redress provided by the Constitutional Court did not offer sufficient relief to the applicants, who thus retain victim status for the purposes of this complaint (see, mutatis mutandis, Portanier v. Malta, no.\u00a055747/16, \u00a7 24, 27\u00a0August 2019).",

Firstly, because there was no certainty that the property would have been leased throughout the entire period of time had it not been requisitioned. Secondly, the tenants had to keep the property in a good state of repair and, thirdly, the measure was in the public interest.
