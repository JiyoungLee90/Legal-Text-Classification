At around 09.40 p.m. he had heard someone knocking on his door. He had looked through the door\u2019s peephole and seen a number of people, who had told him that his brother-in-law had been in a car accident and that he needed help.

They furthermore claimed that given the small size of the drugs in question, there had been a real risk of the applicant getting rid of them. The Government also asserted that the fact that the applicant had refused to open his front door to the SOD officers and that he had also resisted the officer who had tried to enter the flat from the balcony was sufficiently indicative of the urgency of the searches. Accordingly, the Government argued that the risk of the applicant tampering with evidence had been real and imminent and that the SOD officers had thus been justified under Article 102 \u00a7 4 of the CCP in denying him his right to demand the presence of independent witnesses. They furthermore stressed that the applicant had failed to appeal against the decisions of the domestic courts authorising the searches retrospectively and validating the results thereof (see paragraph 10 above).",

It considered, in view of the importance of that evidence, that, cumulatively, (i) the procedural irregularities during the search of the applicant\u2019s person, (ii) the inconsistent and conflicting evidence concerning the physical circumstances of the search, (iii) the inadequate judicial scrutiny both before and during the trial, and (iv) the weakness of the corroborating evidence, had rendered the applicant\u2019s trial as a whole unfair (ibid., \u00a7 73; see also Megrelishvili v.

The searches in question were conducted on the basis of \u201coperational information\u201d which, it appears from the case file, was not subjected to judicial scrutiny at either the pre-trial or trial stage. Furthermore, the searches were conducted in \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d, without the prior issuance of a search warrant. While this in itself did not render the investigative measures unlawful (see Article 290 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 4 of the CCP as cited in Kobiashvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037), it should be noted that the relevant decisions were not substantiated as they did not specify the exigent circumstances that allegedly necessitated that the searches be undertaken without waiting for the issuance of a search warrant (see, ibid., Article 290 \u00a7\u00a03 of the CCP). Moreover, unlike in the case of Kobiashvili, the SOD officers denied the applicant his right to have attesting witnesses attend the searches. The officers referred to \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d as justification for their refusal to permit the attendance of attesting witnesses. The Court notes, in this connection, the Government\u2019s twofold argument: firstly, that the applicant had offered resistance to the officers; and secondly, that the Subutex pills the SOD officers had been looking for had been small in size and could have easily been disposed of. As regards the latter assertion, this argument of the Government has already been dismissed by the Court in the case of Megrelishvili (cited above, \u00a7 33) \u2013 indeed, the applicant in the instant case claimed that he had been handcuffed and surrounded by several officers during the searches and could not as a result have interfered with the evidence. The Government did not dispute the fact that the applicant had been handcuffed and under the control of the SOD officers at the time of the searches; this fact equally negates the Government\u2019s justification for not allowing the presence of attesting witnesses because the applicant had offered resistance to the officers.",

Given the circumstances, it is doubtful that the courts could have assessed in any meaningful way the reasonableness of the authorities\u2019 suspicions in respect of the applicant before he was searched, whether they indeed had had prior knowledge of the type of drugs that they were looking for, and the urgency and necessity of carrying out a search without the prior issuance of a search warrant and in the absence of attesting witnesses. The Court thus considers that the physical circumstances of the searches and the arguments concerning those circumstances and their resultant unlawfulness submitted by the applicant were not addressed in the course of the trial, with the result that his complaint about the arbitrary refusal of his procedural right to invite attesting witnesses to attend the searches remained unanswered.",

The first-instance court dismissed the applicant\u2019s application to have a witness to testify in his favour summoned, noting that the application had been lodged out of time. However, the CCP \u2013 as worded at the material time \u2013 provided for the possibility for a defendant to call witnesses, if there were genuine grounds to do so, at any stage of the proceedings (compare Bregvadze, cited above, \u00a7 27). The appeal court simply upheld the above decision, without examining the witness. In this regard the Court notes the following: the police reports on the searches and the statements of the two SOD officers who had conducted those searches laid the basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction (see paragraph 13 above). The searches constituted the investigative measures that secured the evidence on which the conviction was based. In the light of that fact, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s application for L.Ts. (who had witnessed the arrest and the subsequent searches) to be examined before the court was directly relevant to the charge faced by the applicant and was sufficiently reasoned (see Murtazaliyeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0158; compare, mutatis mutandis, Kartvelishvili, cited above, \u00a7 63). Given the fact that the charges against the applicant were based on the assumption of his possessing drugs, the applicant\u2019s wish to have the only defence witness heard constituted a reasonable attempt to challenge that key assumption in an effective manner. Furthermore, the domestic courts did not consider the relevance of L.Ts.\u2019s testimony and (as already noted above) did not provide sufficient justification for their failure to do so. Lastly, in view of the physical circumstances in which the searches had been conducted (see in this connection paragraph 26 above), the domestic courts\u2019 refusal to examine the only possible defence witness undermined, in the Court\u2019s view, the overall fairness of the proceedings.",
