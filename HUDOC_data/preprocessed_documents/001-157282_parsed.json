According to the applicant, W. had \u201cruthlessly pursued politico-economic interests\u201d.

Furthermore, W. had unlawfully attempted to dissolve the sub-division, thus putting at risk its staff\u2019s employment. The statement made by W. during the staff meeting had been degrading and cynical and had contained halftruths and lies. W. had not assumed any personal responsibility and did not show any concern for finding a socially acceptable solution to the problems arising from the dissolution of the sub-division.",

Under the case-law of the Federal Labour Court, gross insults directed against the employer or the employer\u2019s representative, which constituted a serious violation of the concerned person\u2019s honour, could justify dismissal on grounds relating to the employee\u2019s conduct. In order to establish the seriousness of the violation of honour, it had to be established whether the applicant\u2019s allegations were based on objective facts.

Under the Criminal Code, perversion of justice was a crime subject to up to five years\u2019 imprisonment. In case of a criminal conviction under this provision, a deputy mayor would automatically lose his office. The conduct of a public service employee had to be measured against a stricter yardstick than that of an employee in the private sector. In particular, the employee was under an obligation to behave in such a way as not to interfere with his public employer\u2019s reputation. Under the Professional Code of Conduct, the employee had to exercise special restraint when openly criticising a superior\u2019s decisions. A public allegation of perversion of justice directed against a superior, in particular if it was unfounded, very seriously violated the superior\u2019s personality rights and interfered, as a rule, with the employee\u2019s professional duties.",

It had further to be taken into account that the allegations had been made during a staff meeting. While it was true that criticism made in this context could occasionally be exaggerated or polemic without giving the employer a ground for dismissal, this right was limited by the obligation not to disturb peace in the office. It had to be taken into account in the applicant\u2019s favour that the staff meeting concerned the suppression of the applicant\u2019s field of work and that the atmosphere had been rather tense. However, this did not justify neglecting the fact that the allegation of perversion of justice did not concern the subject matter of the staff meeting, but a single incident which dated back several years and had not been mentioned by the applicant since 1997. The applicant did not make use of the possibility of informing the Mayor about his legal concerns regarding the Deputy Mayor\u2019s decision. At the time of the staff meeting, the decision dated back such a long time that an attempt to put the decision into question must have lacked the prospect of success. Accordingly, it appeared that the applicant\u2019s statement was rather aimed at attacking the Deputy Mayor.",

Based on a detailed examination of the factual and legal situation in 1995/1996, the Labour Court of Appeal considered that the decision taken by the Deputy Mayor at that time had been lawful. The applicant\u2019s written submissions of 17 December 1998 demonstrated that he was not willing to accept and implement politically legitimate decisions, if they concerned sanctions for misuse of property by house owners. The content of the letter to the editor (see paragraph 11, above) contained value judgments which did not amount to insult. However, the Deputy Mayor could not be expected to maintain daily co-operation with the applicant after reading this letter in which he had been described as incompetent.

This was temporary employment which the applicant had obtained by court order in separate proceedings. The applicant had expressed his readiness to accept employment even at a lower level. However, the Labour Court of Appeal considered that the applicant would not have changed his attitude without his dismissal from office. The Municipality could reasonably expect that the applicant would have carried on with his self-righteous attitude if he had not been dismissed. The Labour Court of Appeal finally considered that the applicant\u2019s chances of finding new employment were low.

Moreover, it appears that the applicant addressed his concerns neither to W.\u2019s superior, nor to the public prosecution. The applicant himself claims that he did not want to address the public. Finally, the issue was not closely related to any subject on the agenda of the staff meeting.",

The current case has therefore to be distinguished from cases of \u201cwhistle-blowing\u201d, an action warranting special protection under Article\u00a010 of the Convention, in which an employee reports a criminal offence in order to draw attention to alleged unlawful conduct of the employer (see Heinisch, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

The Court considers that the applicant, as the long-serving head of the sub-division in charge of sanctioning misuse of housing property, must have been well-acquainted with the legal background. Accordingly, the Court is not convinced that he acquitted himself of the obligation to verify carefully whether his allegations were accurate.",

It is thus not unreasonable to assume that he should have been aware of the legal implication of the term \u201cperversion of justice\u201d, in particular, that it described an intentional abuse of public authority punishable with a minimum of one year\u2019s imprisonment under Article 339 of the Criminal Code, thus considered a felony under domestic law (see paragraph 26, above). The Court considers the unfounded allegation of a serious crime rather a defamatory accusation than a criticism in the interest of the public (compare Barfod v. Denmark, no. 11508/85, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a031, 35, 22 February 1989) and notes that the Saxon Labour Court of Appeal held in its 2004 judgment that the applicant had never withdrawn his allegation that W. had committed this crime.",

It follows that the dismissal was not only based on the applicant\u2019s spontaneous statement during the meeting, but also on a written statement he submitted after having been given time to reflect on the impact of his allegations (see\u00a0Palomo Sanchez and Others, \u00a7\u00a073, cited above; and De Diego Nafr\u00eda v.\u00a0Spain, no. 46833/99, \u00a7\u00a041, 14 March 2002).

The Court observes that the accusations were not made publicly, but during a staff meeting. It notes, however, that the Federal Labour Court, when assessing the impact of the applicant\u2019s statement, considered that not all persons present at the staff meeting had been staff members and that there had been a risk that the applicant\u2019s allegations would be made known to a wider public. The Court acknowledges that this intensified the potential impact of the accusations as well as the fact that the crime in question was a felony, and as such the attack on W.\u2019s reputation was even graver. For these reasons the case must be distinguished from the case of Rubin v. Latvia (no. 79040/12, 13 January 2015) in which the domestic courts had not established that insults had been made (\u00a7\u00a091) and the applicant based his accusations on facts undisputed by the parties involved (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a084, 85).",

The Court further observes that the Labour Court of Appeal acknowledged the applicant\u2019s difficulty in finding new employment at the age of 44 but still found the dismissal necessary because the applicant\u2019s behaviour \u2013 also during the proceedings before the domestic courts \u2013 had shown that the applicant was likely to reproach the Deputy Mayor\u2019s conduct in the presence of other employees and in public. Its view, that the Municipality could rightfully fear that the applicant would return to his past behaviour if reinstated, taking into account further elements such as the applicant\u2019s written comments and his letter to the editor, is not unreasonable and as such is acceptable under the Convention.",
