It examined only the course of the proceedings after 27\u00a0February\u00a02009, stating that the applicant\u2019s complaint could only refer to the current stage of the proceedings, i.e. after the Lublin Regional Court had remitted the case to the Lublin District Court and had duly transmitted the case file. As regards the period after 27\u00a0February 2009 it considered that the proceedings before the trial court had been conducted with the requisite speed, especially given the complexity of the case. In particular, the court observed that the hearings had been held frequently and at regular intervals and that only a few had been adjourned for reasons not imputable to the trial court. It further observed that at the request of the applicant, on 24 May 2010 four witnesses who had their permanent place of residence in Italy were summoned to be heard at the hearing on 9 July 2010. The four summons were returned with notes \u201caddressee unknown\u201d. On 9\u00a0July 2010 the applicant indicated a Polish address of one of these four witnesses. The court adjourned the hearing until 25 August 2010 and summoned the witnesses again. On 25 August the court heard one witness; the remaining three failed to appear. On the same day the applicant requested the court to hear another witness who had been deprived of his liberty in the United Kingdom. The court granted the request and decided that the witness in question be heard through the consular office. The court also observed that there had been objective difficulties in appointing expert witnesses of several specialities and that some of the expert reports obtained were incomplete and had to be returned for rectification.",
