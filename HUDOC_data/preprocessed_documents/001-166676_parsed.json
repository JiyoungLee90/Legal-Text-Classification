He further considered that the applicant\u2019s husband had received appropriate treatment but that his discharge on 3 February 1998 may not have been wise in view of his clinical condition. The expert concluded that the applicant\u2019s husband had suffered a series of complications which were uncommon but could occur, and that he had received proper medical care at the CHVNG. As to his care in Santo Ant\u00f3nio Hospital, the expert considered that the applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s condition had been extremely complicated and had given rise to doubts as to the best way to proceed. In his report, the expert in internal medicine rejected the idea of a hospital-acquired infection on the grounds that, had that been the case, the antibiotics administered to the patient would have had no effect. In his view, the meningitis had developed unexpectedly. He further took the view that the applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s discharge on 3\u00a0February 1998 had been appropriate but that he should have continued to be monitored as an outpatient.",

Italy [GC], no. 32967/96, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2002-I). If the infringement of the right to life or to personal integrity is not caused intentionally, this obligation does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case (see Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08990, ECHR 2002-VIII). In the specific sphere of medical negligence the obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and for the publication of the decision, to be obtained. Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged (see Vo v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a053924/00, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2004-VIII, and Lazzarini and\u00a0Ghiacci v. Italy (dec.), no. 53749/00, 7 November 2002).

In the circumstances of the present case, the Court must examine the proceedings as a whole and ascertain whether they satisfied the procedural obligations arising out of Article 2 of the Convention. In other words, the Court considers that it would be artificial and excessively formalistic to treat the above-mentioned proceedings separately for the purposes of calculating the six-month timelimit, given the close connection existing between them. Furthermore, it appears that the authorities and courts to which the applicant applied took account of the investigations and expert assessments that had been concluded in the meantime. For instance, the administrative courts heard evidence from the inspector in charge of the IGS investigation, the experts in gastroenterology and internal medicine who had issued opinions in that connection (see paragraph 70 above), and the Medical Association. Consequently, the Court considers that, in the present case, the final domestic decision was the one given most recently, namely the Supreme Administrative Court judgment delivered on 26 February 2013 following the proceedings for civil liability. As the application was lodged on 23\u00a0August 2013, that is, six months later, it was not submitted out of time. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s objection should be dismissed.",

Yet the medical team does not appear to have taken account of this crucial factor. Without wishing to speculate on the applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s prospects of survival if his meningitis had been diagnosed earlier, the Court considers that the lack of coordination between the ENT department of the CHVNG and the hospital\u2019s emergency department attests to failings in the public hospital service. The applicant\u2019s husband was thus deprived of the possibility of access to appropriate emergency care.

This provision requires that the protective mechanisms afforded by domestic law should not just exist in theory.

Although the applicant\u2019s husband did not die of the infectious meningitis he contracted after his polypectomy, the further complications appear at first sight to be directly linked to that episode, with the result that the applicant was entitled to feel that she had not been informed as to the cause of her husband\u2019s death.

Although the doctor who carried out the operation stated before the Oporto Administrative and Tax Court that he had informed the patient accordingly (see paragraph 71 above), the pre- and post-operative medical protocol for a polypectomy was not explained in any of the proceedings conducted at domestic level.

The latter case concerned a systemic failure of the neonatal service in a given geographical area. On the basis of expert medical opinion on the causes of the death, the Court found in Gen\u00e7 (\u00a7\u00a077) that \u201cin the present case neither the seriousness of the condition of the applicant\u2019s son, who was born prematurely and suffered from respiratory distress, nor the need for urgent medical intervention, was in dispute\u201d and, in \u00a7 82, that \u201c[a]ccordingly, the applicant\u2019s son should be regarded as having been the victim of failings in the hospital services, in that he was deprived of any access to appropriate emergency care.

The obligations of the State, in the absence of State action aimed at depriving life, are related to the proper operation of the existing legal system, with special emphasis on adequate legal recourse in matters of negligence.
