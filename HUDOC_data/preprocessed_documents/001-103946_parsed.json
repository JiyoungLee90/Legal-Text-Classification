Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a016, and Letellier v. France, 26 June 1991, \u00a7\u00a043, Series A no. 207). In the present case, however, the decisions of the domestic authorities gave no reasons why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicant, they considered the risk of his absconding to be decisive. In any event, the Court considers that in the course of time that risk became negligible, given the deterioration of the applicant's health and his subsequent placement in a prison hospital in July 2007.",

These factors may justify a relatively longer period of detention. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v. Poland, no.\u00a031246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14 November 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 4\u00a0May 2006). The fact that a person is charged with acting in criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention; his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account. There is no indication in the present case that the domestic courts had any evidence that the applicant had indeed attempted to intimidate witnesses or to obstruct the course of the proceedings in any other way. In such circumstances the Court has difficulty in accepting the argument that there was a risk of interference with the administration of justice. Furthermore, such a risk was bound to decrease gradually as the trial proceeded and the witnesses were interviewed (compare Miszkurka v. Poland, no.\u00a039437/03, \u00a7\u00a051, 4 May 2006) The Court is not therefore persuaded that throughout the entire period of the applicant's detention compelling reasons existed to fear that he would put pressure on witnesses or otherwise hamper the investigation of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh the applicant's right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

The Court has already found that the practice of issuing collective detention orders without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention in respect of each detainee was incompatible, in itself, with Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see Dolgova v.
