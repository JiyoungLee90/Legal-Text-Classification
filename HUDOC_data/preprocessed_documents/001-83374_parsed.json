In deciding whether there are good reasons for believing that the defendant will not turn up for his or her trial, the relevant factors to be taken into account by the court include: the nature and seriousness of the alleged offence; the probable method of dealing with the defendant in the event of a conviction; and the strength of the evidence against the defendant.

She also noted her special family circumstances (the needs of three young children, the absence of any parent and the age and infirmity of her own parents who were obliged to care for the children while she was detained). She pointed out that the prosecution had not objected to her being granted bail and that the refusal followed her separation from her children for a considerable period of time as a result of an unsafe verdict. She had complied with all bail conditions during her previous two trials and, indeed, she fully complied with all bail conditions later imposed by the third trial judge. She further argued that the prosecution did not at any time in the domestic proceedings consider that she was at risk of absconding. Therefore, the respondent Government could not argue that the risk of absconding was a relevant and sufficient consideration for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3. Moreover, the applicant maintained that the case against her was at its weakest before the third trial, so little weight could be attached to the strength of the case against her in deciding whether or not to refuse bail. The fact that the Court of Appeal opted to order a retrial could never be a consideration in refusing bail since consideration of whether or not to grant bail only arose after the decision to order a retrial: if the Court of Appeal had discharged her instead then there would have been no need to consider the question of bail. It appears that the applicant further submitted that the basis on which her conviction had been quashed was of little importance to the bail decision. Nor was it relevant that the applicant knew that if convicted in the third trial she would face a very lengthy period of imprisonment since the third trial was no different from the previous two trials in this respect. Finally, the Court of Appeal had not considered other means such as requiring a surety for bail before refusing bail.",

It also considered the fact that the conviction had been quashed due to a material irregularity in the trial judge\u2019s direction to the jury and that a prompt retrial was envisaged. It was significant that the applicant had been convicted by a jury since this suggested the case against her was a strong one and she knew that if convicted at the retrial she faced a sentence of life imprisonment with a likely minimum period of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. In addition there was a persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed a serious offence and she had also been in custody for 17 months prior to the bail hearing. In the Government\u2019s view, these factors were sufficient to provide good reason to believe the applicant might abscond if granted bail. It was irrelevant that the third trial judge granted bail since the Court of Appeal made its decision on the basis of the facts before it at the time. Equally, it was irrelevant that the prosecution did not object to bail since according to Article 5 \u00a7 3, the decision to grant or refuse bail was for a \u2018judge or other officer\u2019. The Court of Appeal had therefore properly exercised its discretion and correctly concluded that there were relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the applicant\u2019s detention pending her retrial.",

It would certainly have been desirable for the Court of Appeal to have recorded more detailed reasoning as to the grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention (Van der Tang\u00a0v. Spain, judgment of 13 July 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0321, \u00a7\u00a060; Sardinas Albo\u00a0v. , no.\u00a056271/00, \u00a7\u00a089, 17 February 2005). Nonetheless, the Court is satisfied that reasons were given and observes that the parties have confined their observations to the relevance and sufficiency of those reasons. In this respect, the Court recalls that in general it is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in the domestic courts\u2019 decisions that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (Khudobin\u00a0v. , no.\u00a059696/00, \u00a7\u00a0108, ECHR 2006... (extracts); Jablonski\u00a0v. , no.\u00a033492/96, \u00a7\u00a079, 21 December 2000). It is not the Court\u2019s task to establish such facts and take the place of the national authorities who ruled on the applicant\u2019s detention (Ilijkov\u00a0v. , no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a086, 26 July 2001). Similarly, the Court will confine itself to the reasons actually given by the domestic courts and not consider new reasons advanced by the respondent Government (Trzaska\u00a0v. , no.\u00a025792/94, \u00a7\u00a066, 11 July 2000; and Khudobin, cited above, \u00a7 108). The Court will therefore examine the reasons given by the Court of Appeal, to the extent that they can be discerned from the materials before it. The Court notes that the two reasons given by the Court of Appeal were, firstly, that the re-trial would be prompt and, secondly, that there was a material difference between the applicant\u2019s third trial and her first and second trials, thereby justifying refusing bail pending the third trial although granted pending the first and second trials.",

Therefore insofar as the promptness of the re-trial was a reason for refusing bail and not simply an additional observation by the Lord Chief Justice, the Court considers that it cannot be said to be a relevant reason for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",

[GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a0153, ECHR 2000IV). However, the Court also recognises that the present case must be distinguished from the more common situation where an accused person is placed in detention on remand pending a first trial. In the present case, the applicant had been convicted by a jury. That conviction had been quashed as a result of the improper direction of the trial judge. The Court of Appeal, having heard argument from both parties, quashed the conviction but ordered an immediate re-trial. Having full knowledge of the case the Court of Appeal could be said to have concluded on the basis of the facts before it that there was still a case for the applicant to answer and one sufficient to warrant a re-trial. The persistence of reasonable suspicion may therefore be said to have derived from the same basis as the decision to order a re-trial: indeed the question of bail was considered immediately after the Court of Appeal had implicitly concluded that there was a reasonable suspicion.",

As a matter of domestic law, the Court of Appeal may have been entitled to conclude that there was a material difference between the third trial and the first two trials. Nonetheless, the Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that in drawing this material difference, it can be inferred that the Court of Appeal had concluded that there was a greater risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding before the third trial than had been the case before the previous two trials. In this respect, it is of some significance that the prosecution had made no submission to this effect even though it was open to them to do so. Nor is the Court persuaded that in the circumstances of the case the risk of the applicant absconding was amplified by the length of the sentence she faced following the second re-trial. In this connection, the Court recalls that the risk of absconding cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the sentence faced by the applicant (Muller\u00a0v. France, judgment of 17\u00a0March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II, \u00a7\u00a043) and in any event, the severity of the sentence the applicant faced did not change throughout the proceedings against her.",
