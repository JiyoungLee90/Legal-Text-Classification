They disputed the Government\u2019s submissions about the impact of a request for a fixed hearing date, arguing that a fixed date was obtained primarily because of the estimated length of the hearing and that it was standard listing practice in the Chancery Division of the High Court to request a fixed date. It would have been abuse of process to apply for a \u201cfloating date\u201d in a case of such length involving expert witnesses. They disputed that the availability of witnesses played any part in the delay in fixing a hearing date. They argued that it was unjustifiable to be obliged to wait over two years for a hearing which was not to be of an unusual length. Their own adjournment of the hearing from March to April 1994 was of minor relevance and, in any event, was explained by the disclosure by Buckingham of a significant number of documents on 18 February 1994. They further submitted that neither the complexity of the case nor the actions of third parties had anything to do with the delay in listing the case for hearing. ",

However, the High Court was only notified by the parties of the time-estimate for the hearing on 6 February 1992 and was only then in a position to fix a date.

The Government did not accept that the applicants could rely on the advice of their lawyers that an application would not be successful, noting that the terms of that advice have not been specified and pointing out the importance that the applicants alleged that they attached to an early hearing date and the possibility of putting forwards the arguments that they raise under Article 6 \u00a7 1.

The Court however is not persuaded that the applicants can be blamed for applying for a fixed date hearing to cover the anticipated 15-20 day trial or for not resorting to steps such as applying for a transfer to another division of the High Court. It considers that the delay derives, first and foremost, from the failure by the State to organise its system in such a way as to meet its Convention obligations (for example, Salesi v. Italy judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no. 257-E, \u00a7 24) particularly when it appears that neither a fixed date nor a 15-day hearing were unusual matters in the Chancery division of the High Court. The applicants\u2019 adjournment from March to April 1994 was justified (by late discovery of documents by the plaintiffs) and is, in any event, a relatively minor delay. ",

The applicants have pointed out that their experienced counsel and solicitors advised them that an application for expedition would not have had any prospect of success since it was only in exceptional circumstances, which did not pertain in their case, that a court would allow parties to jump the existing queue. Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 was not applicable in domestic courts at that time and it cannot be considered that reliance on arguments in that context would have been at all decisive.

However, the applicants are not responsible for delays resulting from the applications for extensions and adjournments made by Buckingham (Capuano v. Italy, judgment of 25 June 1987, Series A no. 119, \u00a7 28).
