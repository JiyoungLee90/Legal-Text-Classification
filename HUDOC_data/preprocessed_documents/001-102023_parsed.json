Having regard to the fact that Mr\u00a0R. had a registered domicile in Nova Obodivka, kept his gas pistol there and paid the electricity bills, the police had rightly decided that that was his actual place of residence, not in Trostyanets. The prosecutor also considered that there had been a reasonable suspicion that the items stolen from the local shop could have been found at the household of Mr R. He referred in that connection to the early investigation information, according to which a car similar to that of Mr R. had been seen in the shop's vicinity during the night when the theft had taken place. Furthermore, Mr R. was unemployed and had friendly relations with a certain Mr P. previously convicted for thefts. As to the applicant's allegation that the drugs and bullets had been planted by police, it had not been corroborated by any evidence.",

The Government considered that by having lodged a civil claim she had in fact recognised the effectiveness of that remedy, but was not patient enough for the proceedings to be completed. In substantiation of the effectiveness of such a remedy, the Government submitted a copy of a judgment of a firstinstance court by which the plaintiffs were awarded damages from a pre-trial detention centre on account of the inadequate medical care provided by that facility. The Government also noted that there was sufficient funding allocated in the State budget for compensation for any wrongdoing on the part of the police.",
