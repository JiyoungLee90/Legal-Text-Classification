It first noted that the applicants had not submitted their passports or any other documents to prove their identity or to support their story. It then observed that  is a tribal society dominated by a patriarchal social order where women are subject to discriminating treatment and where they have to obey their husbands. Turning to the applicants\u2019 personal situation, the Board first pointed out that the first applicant\u2019s brother had failed according to the \u201chonour rules\u201d by helping her to obtain a passport. Moreover, it considered that the mere fact that the first applicant had left the country, and by doing so allegedly dishonoured her husband, was not sufficient to create a need for protection in . In this respect, the Board observed that the first applicant\u2019s clan could protect her against X. Concerning the fifth applicant, the Board considered that X\u2019s actions had been motivated by financial gain and that, by paying the necessary sum to X, the fifth applicant could solve any problems that might arise. Here, it noted that the applicants\u2019 contention that they were poor was contradicted by the fact that they had been able to afford to travel to  since the cost of the journey would have been a fortune to a poor person. Turning to the second applicant, the Board observed that her husband had consented to divorce her if she reimbursed him the sum he had originally paid X. Again, the Board considered that the problem was mainly a financial matter which could be solved by paying the required amount. In regard to the remaining applicants, the Board found that they would be able to stay with their maternal grandparents or other relatives in the clan.",

On the contrary, the clan, which was very large and powerful, had blacklisted them and they were convinced that the clan would kill them to save its honour. Moreover, the first applicant\u2019s brother had helped them in secret and had risked his own life by doing so. He would not be able to help them again. According to the applicants, there was no one in  who would be able to protect them. Furthermore, the applicants insisted that their need for protection was honour-related and not economic in nature. The second and fifth applicants did not have the money necessary to buy their freedom and, in any event, nothing would hinder X from marrying them off to someone else later on. The first applicant added that she had been a member of a women\u2019s association which had met on Thursdays and Fridays and that she had told the women in the association about her problems and they had lent her some money to pay for travel. The remainder of the cost, she had paid by selling her jewellery. As concerned the other applicants, the second applicant had helped to pay for that trip.",

He stated in the report that he had hidden the money in his wardrobe about two months previously and had discovered that it had gone two days before.

It then observed that the reasons referred to by the applicants in support of their need for protection mainly concerned problems within the personal sphere caused, inter alia, by the country\u2019s traditions. The court further noted that, other than the first applicant\u2019s petition to a court to stop the fifth applicant\u2019s marriage, the applicants had not turned to the Yemeni authorities to obtain protection against X or the second applicant\u2019s husband. The court reiterated that, before international protection could be considered for problems of violence and reprisals within the family, all avenues of mediation and protection by the national authorities should have been tried. With regard to X\u2019s police report against the third and fourth applicants, the court considered that it would be no problem for them to prove that they were innocent since they were in Sweden at the time of the alleged crime. Therefore, they did not risk being arrested or imprisoned. The court concluded that the applicants could not be considered refugees, that they were not in need of protection and that there were no exceptional circumstances to grant them leave to remain in , even though some of them were still minors. In reaching this conclusion, the court also had regard to the fact that the family was united, that several of them were adults and that they had family and friends in  who supported them.",

He first noted that the security situation in  was affected by a number of internal conflicts, such as conflicts between clans, between the regime and various clan militias in the north and the south of the country as well as the regime fighting Al-Qaida in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP). These conflicts had been accentuated by the growing protests and opposition against the regime by civil society, weakening the central government and its control over the country. During the autumn of 2011, in particular, there had been violent clashes in the bigger cities of Sana\u2019a and Taiz. Following the agreement brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council and sanctioned by the United Nations, where President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to hand over power to Vice-President Abdel Rabbo Mansour Hadi, the situation in Yemen continued to be marked by political unrest, an unstable security situation and continued internal conflicts. However, the country-wide protests had diminished in intensity and no longer paralysed the big cities of Sana\u2019a and Taiz. Thus, the general security situation in Sana\u2019a and other big cities had improved. In view of this, the Head of the Legal Department found that the situation in the country was generally very serious but that the violence was not so serious or indiscriminate as to give well-founded grounds to assume that civilians, through their mere presence in the parts of the provinces where the violence occurred, were at a real risk of being exposed to serious and personal threats to life or limb.",

It was important to point out that the severe conflicts, and consequently the security situation, were more serious in some parts of the country than in others and that this had to be taken into account in each individual case. He further noted that vulnerable groups in , such as women and children, should be given special attention when their need for protection was considered.

It is enough that her guardian agrees and shows his identity card or family book. Moreover, it notes that the mother of the bride has no legal authority to decide about her daughter\u2019s marriage, since she is also under the authority of her husband and has to follow his decisions. The note further states that every year there are girls who flee their forced marriages and seek refuge with NGOs and human rights activists. In this respect, it observes that NGOs run a few shelters in Sana\u2019a and one in  where these girls and other women in vulnerable situations can receive protection, counselling and training in various skills.",

The Court considers that there are reasons to question the authenticity of the document since the applicants have not presented any information about how they obtained it within a few weeks of its issuance. Also, the document is dated two months after the final decision by the Migration Court of Appeal and was invoked as a new ground before the Migration Board in their request for reconsideration of their case, adding to their claims. Moreover, as the Government have pointed out, the applicants have not offered an explanation as to why X would wait until almost three years after the first and fifth applicants\u2019 departure from  before reporting their absence to the court if he was seriously offended by their departure. Furthermore, since X allegedly made the remaining children leave their home when the first and fifth applicants left , this would suggest that he had no interest in maintaining a relationship with his family members and, even less, that he would physically harm them. For these reasons, the Court finds that it has not been established that there is a real risk that X would subject the first applicant, or any of his children, to any honourrelated crimes if they were to be returned to .",

It notes that the first applicant said in the interview with the Migration Board on 6 March 2006 that she would try to obtain copies of the passports from the Yemeni authorities. This should be possible according to information from the Swedish Embassy in . Still, although she has had several years to try to obtain copies of the passports, she has not done so.

Having failed in her courageous efforts to prevent her second daughter (the fifth applicant) from being forcibly married at the age of 12, the first applicant fled Yemen with this child and sought refuge in .

In such circumstances, I see no convincing reason for this Court to do so and I have voted on the assumption that the applicants\u2019 account of gender based violence and forced child marriage is a true one.

The Court accepted that victims of domestic violence fall within a group of \u201cvulnerable individuals\u201d entitled to State protection (\u00a7 66). It further confirmed that physical violence and psychological pressure of the type that occurs within domestic abuse amounts to \u2018ill-treatment\u2019 within the meaning of Article 3. Based on the authorities\u2019 failures, in that case, to take protective measures in the form of effective deterrence against serious breaches of the applicant\u2019s personal integrity by her husband, the Court in Opuz held, unanimously, that Article 3 of the Convention had been breached. Finally, having regard to the independent research evidence available, the Court accepted that domestic violence such as occurred in that case \u201cmay be regarded as gender-based violence which is a form of discrimination against women\u201d (\u00a7 200).",

The beating of women, their forced isolation or imprisonment and forced early marriage are not addressed in Yemeni law. Marital rape is not a criminal offence. Violence against women and children is considered \u2018a family affair\u2019 and there is no minimum age for marriage. The violence inflicted upon the first applicant, in the form of frequent beatings, burning and threatened assaults with a knife, is similar to the violence described in Opuz and, consequently, must also be considered to constitute \u2018ill-treatment\u2019 within the meaning of Article 3. There is compelling evidence that the Yemeni authorities fail to take protective measures in the form of effective deterrence against domestic violence and child marriage. There is nothing to suggest that this situation is likely to change upon the applicants\u2019 return to that country.",
