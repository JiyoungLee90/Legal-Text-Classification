In the present case, as noted by the applicant and the expert herself, the medical expert examination took place one month after the events and the medical record which was made available to the expert had insufficient information about the morphological characteristics of the injuries, such as quantity, form, size, and exact anatomic location. Thus, it was impracticable for the expert to provide adequate answers to the questions raised by the requesting authority. The previously recorded bodily injuries had no forensic qualification and their gravity could not be determined (see paragraph 16 above). While before this expert examination the applicant had been examined in a clinic and a hospital, the nature, purpose and scope of these earlier examinations were not such as to remedy the shortcomings arising from the belated recourse to a forensic expert in the present case.",
