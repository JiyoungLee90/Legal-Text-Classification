In this latter connection, what is at stake is the confidence which such tribunals in a\u00a0democratic society must inspire in the public and, above all, the parties to the proceedings. In deciding whether there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular court lacked independence or impartiality, the standpoint of the party to the proceedings is important without being decisive. What is decisive is whether the party\u2019s doubts can be held to be objectively justified (see, amongst others, Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 38784/97, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2002-I, and Miroshnik v.
