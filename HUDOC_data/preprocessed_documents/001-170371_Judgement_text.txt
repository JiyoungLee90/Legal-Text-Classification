The case originated in an application (no. 63638/14) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on 12 September 2014 by four applicants. The first and second applicants, Mr Eduard Anatolievich Posevin, a Russian national born in 1962, and Ms Tetyana Anatolyivna Posevina, a Ukrainian and Bulgarian national born in 1974, are spouses. The third and fourth applicants, Ms Valeriya Eduardovna Posevina, a Ukrainian national born in 2001, and Ms Dzhulia Eduardovna Posevina, a Ukrainian national born in 2004, are their daughters. All applicants live in Plovdiv, Bulgaria.
The applicants were represented by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev, Ms K. Boncheva and Ms S. Stefanova, lawyers practising in Plovdiv. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Dimitrova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicants alleged, in particular, that searches and seizures in their house and photography studio, and a search of the first applicant’s email account had been unlawful and disproportionate. They also alleged that the house search and the first applicant’s arrest in the course of that search had constituted inhuman and degrading treatment because the police had acted with needless brutality. Lastly, the applicants alleged that under Bulgarian law they did not have an effective remedy with respect to the searches and seizures, and could not challenge them before a court.
On 20 November 2015 the Court decided to give the Government notice of the above complaints and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible under Rule 54 § 3 of its Rules.
As the first applicant is a Russian national and the other three applicants are Ukrainian nationals, on 26 November 2015 the Court advised the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of Ukraine of their right under Article 36 § 1 of the Convention to submit written comments. On 18 February 2016 the former stated that they did not wish to exercise this right at this stage of the proceedings. The latter did not reply within the twelve-week time-limit under Rule 44 § 1 (b) of the Rules of Court.
The first applicant is a professional photographer. Since 1998 he has owned and managed a single-member limited liability company through which he operates a photography studio in Plovdiv.
In January 2014 the French authorities informed the Bulgarian Border Police that a Turkish national who had a permit to reside in Bulgaria was suspected of forging Bulgarian identity documents and providing them to Turkish nationals residing unlawfully in France. Electronic surveillance had showed that he had exchanged email messages with an alleged accomplice whose email account was hosted by a Bulgarian Internet service provider.
Enquiries by the Bulgarian Border Police revealed that the email account belonged to the first applicant and his company. A wiretap placed on the Turkish national’s French mobile telephone showed that on 4 March 2014 he had called the photography studio’s landline and talked with a woman who spoke Bulgarian with a Russian accent. They discussed the receipt of the photographs of two people.
On 10-11 March 2014 the Turkish national travelled from Bulgaria to France by car, and was arrested shortly after entering French territory. A search of his car revealed eight fake Bulgarian identity cards, five fake Bulgarian drivers’ licences and six fake Bulgarian passports.
Two days later, on 13 March 2014, the Plovdiv district prosecutor’s office applied for warrants to search the photography studio, the first applicant’s car and the applicants’ house, and seize evidence there. It set out the above developments, and said that it was investigating the forging of identity documents in which the main suspect was the above-mentioned Turkish national. According to the available information, he had received assistance from the first applicant. The applications were worded as follows:
“In the course of the proceedings, the need has arisen to carry out a search and seizure in [the applicants’ house, the first applicant’s car, and the photography studio], since the available evidence gives probable cause to suspect that [these places] contain items of relevance to the case – items relating to the subject matter of the case. I therefore ... ask for permission for an investigator to search [these places] with a view to finding and seizing the above-mentioned items.”
Between 3.30 and 4 p.m. the same day, a judge of the Plovdiv District Court, sitting in private, issued three warrants authorising the searches and seizures in the following terms:
“The submitted materials make it clear that it is necessary to carry out a search and seizure in [these places] with a view to finding the items set out in the application[s]  relating to the forging of identity documents and others, relevant to the case which is the subject matter of the criminal proceedings.”
At about 9 a.m. the following day, 14 March 2014, just as the first applicant was leaving his house, he was intercepted by three police officers, two in plain clothes and one in uniform.
The parties’ accounts of the ensuing events differ widely. According to the applicants, the police did not identify themselves, roughly pinned down and handcuffed the first applicant behind his back, scared his two daughters, the third and fourth applicants, who were minors, and then searched the house in a rude and chaotic manner, without presenting the warrant authorising them to do so. According to the Government, whose account was based on a statement informally obtained from one of the officers who took part in the search, the first applicant attempted to run back to the house, possibly to conceal evidence, and was only handcuffed for that reason. The officers searched the house with restraint, specifically endeavouring not to frighten the two children. They were only looking for computers, mobile telephones and similar devices, and did not rummage needlessly through things in the house.
According to the record of the search, it lasted between 9.15 and 10.50 a.m. and took place in the presence of two certifying witnesses. The police seized eleven SIM cards, identity and other documents, a laptop computer, three mobile Internet dongles, and a mobile telephone.
According to the applicants, after the search the officers dragged the first applicant into the street, bent over with his hands handcuffed behind his back, in sight of many neighbours and passers-by. Between 10.55 and 11.05 a.m. they searched his car, from which they did not seize anything. The officers then put the first applicant in a police car and drove to the photography studio, very close to the corner of a busy pedestrian street in the centre of Plovdiv, which they searched between 11.35 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. They again refused to allow the first applicant to acquaint himself with the search warrant. According to the record of that search, the officers seized three desktop computers, two video cameras, two still cameras, several flash memory cards, flash memory drives, and cash.
At about the same time, between 11.15 and 11.30 a.m. the police searched the first applicant himself, without a judicial warrant. They seized three flash memory drives and two mobile telephones. They submitted the search record to a judge of the Plovdiv District Court, who approved it at 5 p.m. the same day.
The officers then took the first applicant to a police station for a “conversation”. According to the first applicant, he was kept in handcuffs the whole time. The Government denied this, noting that if that had indeed been the case, the first applicant would not have been able to sign the search records and produce a handwritten statement in the police station.
In the statement the first applicant explained, inter alia, that he used the email account in which the police were interested (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above) to exchange computer files, mostly image files, with clients of his photography studio. He stated that he agreed to provide access to the account for the needs of the investigation, so that the police could subject the messages in it relating to the Turkish national to examination by an expert, and then gave his password. The Government submitted that the police had used the password to go through the email account, but had not seized any messages from it. The first applicant was released at about 6 p.m. The police did not issue a written order for his detention.
The first applicant’s wife, the second applicant, came back to Plovdiv later that evening. According to her, she had been contacted earlier during the day by telephone by her older daughter, the third applicant, and had become worried at the news that her husband had been arrested and their daughters left alone, frightened, in the house. She kept calling her daughters and trying to call her husband throughout the day.
On 20 March 2014 the investigator in charge of the case asked a computer expert to copy the data from three of the seized flash memory cards to an optical disk. In his report, submitted the following day, 21 March 2014, the expert said that he had copied all the files from two of the cards and that the third card did not contain any files.
On 6 June 2014 the investigator asked the same expert to copy the data from the laptop computer seized in the applicants’ house to an external hard drive and to inspect the three desktop computers seized in the photography studio for the presence of software or files which could be used for the forging of documents. In his report, submitted on 18 June 2014, the expert said that he had copied 192,610 files with a total size of 333,204 megabytes from the laptop computer to an external hard drive, which he enclosed with his report, and that his inspection of the desktop computers had revealed that two of them contained software programs which could be used to edit image files, and that the third computer was defective and could not be booted up.
It is unclear what happened with the data copied from the laptop computer and the two memory cards.
On 17 March 2014 the first applicant asked the Plovdiv district prosecutor’s office to order the return of all the seized items. He submitted that they were not relevant for the case and that he urgently needed them for his work as a photographer. On 20 March 2014 the prosecutor’s office partly allowed the request and ordered the return of some of the items – two cameras, two flash memory cards, and two video cameras – but only after the police had made copies of their contents. The next day, 21 March 2014, those items were given back to the first applicant. On 7 April 2014 he appealed to the Plovdiv regional prosecutor’s office, complaining of the refusal of the lower prosecutor’s office to order the return of the remainder of the seized items. It does not appear that he received a formal reply to his appeal, but on 14 May 2014, two months after the seizure, the investigator in charge of the case gave him back three mobile telephones, three mobile Internet dongles, 1,000 euros (EUR), 100 United States dollars, four flash memory cards, and three flash memory drives. The remainder of the seized items were given back to the first applicant a little more than three months after the seizure, on 18 June 2014, immediately after their contents had been inspected by the expert (see paragraph 21 above).
On 9 July 2014 the police sent the case file to the Plovdiv district prosecutor’s office, recommending that the proceedings be discontinued. On 2 September 2014 that office disagreed and instead decided to stay the proceedings on the grounds that the author of the presumed offence had not been identified. On 10 September 2014 it sent the case file back to the police for further investigation. On 18 March 2015 the police again transmitted the case file to the Plovdiv district prosecutor’s office. It appears that the proceedings are still pending. Neither the first nor the second applicant has been charged with an offence.
Searches of premises in the course of criminal proceedings are governed by Articles 160 to 163 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 2005.
Article 160 § 1 provides that when there are enough grounds to suspect that premises contain items, papers or computer systems which contain data that might be relevant for a criminal case, they may be searched and those items or data seized.
As a rule, searches and seizures in the course of a preliminary investigation must be authorised beforehand by a judge of the first-instance criminal court which would try the case or the first-instance criminal court which has jurisdiction over the place where the search and seizure are to take place (Article 161 § 1). In exigent circumstances, when a search and seizure would be the only way to obtain and preserve evidence, the investigating authorities may proceed without a judicial warrant, but then the supervising public prosecutor must submit the record of the search to a judge for approval immediately or, in any event, not more than twenty-four hours after the search (Article 161 § 2).
Articles 162 and 163 lay down the manner in which searches and seizures are to be carried out.
Article 162 § 1 provides that the search and seizure must take place in the presence of certifying witnesses and the person who uses the premises. By Article 162 § 2, if that person or a family member cannot be present, the search and seizure must be carried out in the presence of the building manager or a representative of the municipality. Article 162 § 6 provides that when the search and seizure concern a computer system or software, they must be carried out in the presence of a technical specialist.
Article 163 § 1 provides that, unless urgent, searches and seizures must be carried out during the day. By Article 163 § 2, before proceeding with the search, the investigating authorities must present the search warrant to the person concerned and ask him or her to produce the items, papers or computer systems that they are seeking. By Article 163 § 3, the officers carrying out the search may prohibit those present at the search from interacting with one another or others, or from leaving the premises, until the search is over. By Article 163 § 4, when carrying out a search and seizure, the authorities may not take steps not required to attain their purpose, and rooms and containers may only be opened by force if the persons concerned refuse to open them, but unnecessary damage must be avoided. Article 163 § 5 provides that if the search and seizure reveal intimate details about those concerned, the authorities must take steps to prevent that information from becoming public knowledge.
Article 163 §§ 7 and 8, which relate to data in computer systems, provide that, as a rule, such data must be seized in printed form. If that is not possible, the computer system must be sealed with a record featuring the case number, the authority which has carried out the seizure, the place and time, and the names of all persons present, who must then sign the record. The system can then only be unsealed if authorised by the competent public prosecutor and in the presence of certifying witnesses and a technical specialist.
The seizure and retention of paper or email correspondence in the course of criminal proceedings is governed by Article 165 of the Code. Article 165 § 1 provides that such correspondence may only be seized and retained if necessary to uncover or prevent “serious offences” (Article 93 § 7 of the Criminal Code of 1968 defines a serious offence as one punishable by more than five years’ imprisonment, life imprisonment, or whole life imprisonment). Article 165 § 2 provides that the seizure and retention of correspondence in the course of a preliminary investigation must be authorised, following an application by the competent public prosecutor, by a judge of the first-instance criminal court which would try the case or the first-instance criminal court which has jurisdiction over the place where the seizure is to take place. Reported cases under those provisions show that the courts have authorised the prosecuting authorities to seize email messages by approaching the Internet service provider which holds them on its servers (see опр. № 451 от 31.07.2012 г. по ч. н. д. № 942/2012 г., РС-Враца; опр. № 559 от 09.10.2012 г. по ч. н. д. № 1182/2012 г., РС-Враца; and опр. № 142 от 14.03.2013 г. по ч. н. д. № 319/2013 г., РС-Враца).
In two recent judgments (реш. № 530 от 04.01.2012 г. по н. д. № 2005/2011 г., ВКС, I н. о., and реш. № 17 от 29.01.2015 г. по н. д. № 1622/2014 г., ВКС, I н. о.) which concerned, inter alia, questions of whether the investigating authorities had duly seized Skype conversations and whether it had been proper to admit them in evidence, the Supreme Court of Cassation held that the search of data in computer systems under Article 163 of the 2005 Code (see paragraph 31 above) and the seizure of electronic correspondence under Article 165 of the Code (see paragraph 32 above) were distinct procedures, subject to different requirements, but that the Skype conversations at issue, which were both “computer data” for the purposes of the former Article and “correspondence” for the purposes of the latter Article, had been properly seized because they had been obtained by accessing the data in computers which had themselves already been duly seized. In the first case, the court examined whether the investigating authorities had resorted to the procedure under Article 163 to circumvent that under Article 165, but was satisfied that they had not.
Section 1(1) of the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act 1988 provides that the State is liable for damage suffered by individuals or legal entities as a result of unlawful decisions, actions or omissions by State or municipal authorities or civil servants, committed in the course of or in connection with administrative action. By section 1(2) of the Act and Article 203 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Procedure of 2006, in force since March 2007, such claims fall to be examined by the administrative courts. Before that, they were within the jurisdiction of the civil courts.
Section 2(1) of the Act provides for liability of the investigating and prosecuting authorities and the courts in several specific types of situation: unlawful detention; the bringing of charges, if the accused is acquitted or the proceedings are discontinued on certain grounds; conviction and sentencing, if the conviction is later set aside; coercive medical treatment or coercive measures imposed by a court, if the decision is later quashed as being unlawful; the serving of a sentence beyond its prescribed duration; and the unlawful use of special means of surveillance. In 2012 the list was expanded to include any deprivation of liberty contrary to Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, and any breach of paragraphs 2 to 4 of that Article. By section 2(3), such claims fall to be examined by the civil courts.
In an interpretative decision of 22 April 2005 (тълк. реш. № 3 от 22.04.2005 г. по тълк. гр. д. № 3/2004 г., ВКС, ОСГК), the Supreme Court of Cassation held, inter alia, that the administrative authorities could not incur liability under those provisions for actions taken by them under orders of the investigating or prosecuting authorities. The investigating and prosecuting authorities could not be held liable in respect of such actions or orders either, unless they fell within one of the types of situation exhaustively set out in section 2(1).
However, on 10 February 2014 the Supreme Administrative Court held, contrary to a judgment that it had given on this point in 2010 (реш. № 13496 от 11.11.2010 г. по адм. д. № 3090/2010 г., ВАС, III о.), that the brutal way in which the police had rushed into a person’s home, handcuffed him, even though he had not put up resistance, taken him out in the street in his underpants, woken up his wife and children, and searched the premises in an aggressive manner, were “administrative action” within the meaning of section 1(1), even though the search had taken place in a criminal case. The court noted that it was not deciding whether the search had been duly ordered, but simply whether the police had acted lawfully in carrying it out (see реш. № 1841 от 10.02.2014 г. по адм. д. № 13445/ 2012 г., ВАС, III о.). On remittal, in February 2015 the Pernik Administrative Court found, by reference to, inter alia, Article 3 of the Convention, that the actions of the police in the case before it had been unlawful within the meaning of section 1(1), and awarded the claimant 5,000 Bulgarian levs (BGN) (EUR 2,556) in non-pecuniary damages (see реш. № 44 от 19.02.2015 г. по адм. д. № 127/2014 г., АС-Перник). In July 2016 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld that ruling, but increased the quantum of the award to BGN 10,000 (EUR 5,113) (see реш. № 8948 от 18.07.2016 г. по адм. д. № 7569/2015 г., ВАС, III о.).
In the wake of that judgment, two lower administrative courts gave conflicting rulings on the point resolved by the Supreme Administrative Court. In April 2016 (see реш. № 673 от 08.04.2016 г. по адм. д. № 1517/2015 г., АС-Бургас) the Burgas Administrative Court found the police liable under section 1(1) for the way in which they had conducted a search, whereas in July 2016 (see реш. № 270 от 11.07.2016 г. по адм. д. № 434/2015 г., АС-Перник) the Pernik Administrative Court held that the police could not be liable under that provision as they did not engage in “administrative action” when conducting a search in a criminal case. Neither of those judgments appears to be final.
In February 2013 (see реш. № 2363 от 19.02.2013 г. по адм. д. № 4187/2012 г., ВАС, III о.) the Supreme Administrative Court held that when the police arrest a person and place him or her in police detention they engage in “administrative action”. On that basis, it awarded BGN 2,000 (EUR 1,023) to a person treated roughly by the police in the course of her arrest and subsequent four-hour police detention, even though it made no award in respect of the detention as such, because the detention order had not been quashed in earlier proceedings.
In April 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court held that by needlessly handcuffing in public a person placed under police detention the police had caused damage which could be indemnified under section 1(1) (see реш. № 16059 от 12.04.2013 г. по адм. д. № 15439/ 2012 г., ВАС, III о.). Similarly, in October and December 2013 that court upheld awards of damages to persons who had been unnecessarily handcuffed while in police detention (see реш. № 13685 от 21.10.2013 г. по адм. д. № 13778/2012 г., ВАС, III о., and реш. № 16059 от 04.12.2013 г. по адм. д. № 15439/2012 г., ВАС, III о.).
However, in May 2014 (see реш. № 6728 от 20.05.2014 г. по адм. д. № 15766/2013 г., ВАС, III о.), the Supreme Administrative Court held that the arrest of a witness who was later charged and became an accused was not “administrative action”, because the police officer who had arrested her had done so in his capacity as a criminal investigating authority and in the exercise of powers under the Code of Criminal Procedure.
In 2013 (see опр. № 11 от 13.02.2013 г. по адм. д. № 93/2012 г., ВКС и ВАС, см. петчл. с-в) a joint five-member panel of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court – the formation which resolves conflicts of jurisdiction between the civil and the administrative courts – held that when retaining items seized in a criminal case the police did not engage in “administrative action”, and that a claim for damages relating to such retention was to be heard by the civil rather than the administrative courts.
The general law of torts is set out in sections 45 to 54 of the Obligations and Contracts Act 1951. By section 45(1), everyone is obliged to make good the damage which he or she has, through his or her fault, caused to another. By section 49, a person who has entrusted another with a job is liable for the damage caused by that other person in the course of or in connection with the job. Legal entities cannot be liable under section 45(1), but can be vicariously liable under section 49 for the tortious conduct of individuals whom they employ (see пост. № 7 от 30 декември 1959 г., ВС, Пл.). Liability under those provisions is premised on the wrongfulness of the impugned conduct (see реш. № 567 от 24.11.1997 г. по гр. д. № 775/1996 г., ВС, петчл. с-в).
In August 2011 the Sofia Court of Appeal dismissed claims under section 49 against a criminal court and the prosecuting authorities in relation to a search and seizure. It held, inter alia, that a civil court could not examine whether a criminal court had duly authorised a search and seizure, or whether the actions of the prosecuting authorities in a criminal case were wrongful (see реш. № 1478 от 12.08.2011 г. по в. гр. д. № 1330/2011 г., САС). The Supreme Court of Cassation refused to examine an appeal on points of law against that judgment (see опр. № 640 от 30.05.2012 г. по гр. д. № 1728/2011 г., ВКС, IV г. о.).
In June 2012 the Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed claims under section 49 against the police and the prosecuting authorities in relation to the seizure of records in a notary’s office in a criminal case. It held that the seizure, having been duly ordered in criminal proceedings, had been necessary. It was therefore not wrongful (see реш. № 222 от 05.06.2012 г. по гр. д. № 967/2011 г., ВКС, IV г. о.).
By contrast, in December 2011 the Supreme Court of Cassation allowed a claim under section 49 in relation to the excessively lengthy retention of a motor car seized in a criminal case. It held that the retention of seized items beyond the time-limits for completing a criminal investigation was wrongful (see реш. № 465 от 20.12.2011 г. по гр. д. № 1794/2010 г., ВКС, IV г. о.).
In an action plan submitted to the Committee of Ministers in April 2015 in connection with the execution of the Court’s judgments in Peev v. Bulgaria (no. 64209/01, 26 July 2007) and Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria (no. 65755/01, 22 May 2008), the Government acknowledged that, to comply with those judgments, Bulgaria had to put in place a “procedure whereby a person c[ould] contest [a] search and seizure, air his or her grievances related to the repercussions on the right to respect for private life ... and have the possibility to obtain redress”. The measures being considered included a change in the courts’ case-law or amendments to the 1988 Act (see paragraphs 34 and 35 above).
