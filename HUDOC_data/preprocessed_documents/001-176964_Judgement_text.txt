The case originated in an application (no. 6822/12) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Austrian national, Mrs Ingrid Goldnagl (“the applicant”), on 26 January 2012.
The applicant was represented by W.L. Weh, a lawyer practising in Bregenz. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr H. Tichy, Head of the International Department at the Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and International Affairs.
On 12 May 2015 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Vienna.
On 28 July 1965 the applicant married T.G. They have two children, born in 1968 and 1977. In 1987 the applicant learned that T.G. had a relationship with another woman and in October 1990 T.G. left their common home. On 29 February 1996 the applicant sued for a divorce. On 28 November 1996 the couple was divorced due to the sole fault of T.G. by the Hietzing District Court (Bezirksgericht). This judgment became final.
On 19 September 2005 the Hietzing District Court, after having held several hearings, divided the matrimonial property. This decision became final on 11 July 2006.
On 2 August 1991 the applicant lodged a claim for spousal maintenance with the Döbling District Court (hereinafter “the District Court”) and requested an interim order (einstweilige Verfügung) for provisional maintenance pending the conclusion of the main proceedings. T.G. objected.
On 15 February 1992 the District Court issued an interim order requiring T.G. to pay the applicant provisional maintenance. T.G. appealed. On 23 February 1992 the District Court appointed an expert to assess T.G.’s income.
On 16 June 1992 the Vienna Regional Civil Court (Landesgericht für Zivilrechtssachen; hereinafter “the Regional Court”) confirmed the interim order, which became binding and enforceable. As T.G. did not comply with the interim order, the applicant instituted enforcement proceedings with the District Court. The enforcement was granted on 23 July 1992.
On 9 November 1992 and on 18 January 1993 hearings were held. On 1 October 1993 the expert submitted his report to the court. On 13 June and 15 September 1994, 23 October 1995, 5 and 26 February 1996 further hearings took place.
On 26 March 1997 the District Court issued a judgment partly granting and partly dismissing the maintenance claim. Both parties appealed.
On 1 October 1997 the Regional Court quashed the District Court’s judgment.
The District Court held further hearings on 23 February and 27 April 1998. On the latter date it appointed a second expert to supplement the first expert’s report. The second expert submitted his report on 11 March 1999.
On 29 December 1998 T.G. requested that the enforcement proceedings be stopped, which was granted by the District Court. On 29 April 1999 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal.
On 7 May 1999 the applicant requested a fresh interim order for provisional maintenance and an interim order to prohibit the pay-out of money from T.G.’s pension fund and the redundancy money (Abfertigung) he had received after retiring in April 1999. T.G. objected to this request.
On 9 June 1999 the District Court ordered T.G. to pay the applicant 20,000 Austrian Schillings per month. It also barred T.G. and his former employers from drawing out money from T.G.’s pension fund. T.G.’s objection was dismissed on 19 December 1999. On 26 January 2000 the Regional Court dismissed T.G.’s appeal.
On 28 January 2000 T.G. requested a reduction of his provisional maintenance payment because of his retirement. On 25 May 2000 the District Court rejected this request. The Regional Court quashed the decision upon T.G.’s appeal. On 19 October 2000 the District Court held a hearing.
In the main maintenance proceedings the District Court held further hearings in May 1999, September 2001 and January 2002 and heard further witnesses. On 13 February 2002 the District Court asked the expert to supplement his report concerning T.G.’s income for the years 1999, 2000 and 2001. The expert submitted his report on 1 April 2003.
On 10 July 2003 private insolvency proceedings against T.G. were opened by the Salzburg Regional Court (see paragraph 33 below) and the liquidator requested the lifting of the interim order of 9 June 1999 concerning the maintenance payments (see paragraph 16 above). Thereupon, the maintenance proceedings were suspended. The applicant requested the acknowledgement of her claim of 632,253.65 euros (EUR) for maintenance payments in the insolvency proceedings. The liquidator refused to acknowledge that claim.
On 14 October 2003 the District Court lifted the ban on the pay-out of money from T.G.’s pension fund and his redundancy money, but dismissed the liquidator’s request to lift the order of provisional maintenance payments. The liquidator appealed against this decision.
On 23 November 2003 the applicant requested the continuation of the main maintenance proceedings.
On 10 March 2004 the Regional Court rejected the liquidator’s appeal. On 28 July 2004 the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) partly granted the liquidator’s extraordinary appeal on points of law.
On 16 September 2004 T.G. requested a reduction of the provisional maintenance payments because of the private insolvency proceedings pending against him. The applicant opposed this request. On 21 June 2005 the District Court dismissed T.G.’s request, and on 13 September 2005 the Regional Court confirmed the decision.
On 20 September 2005 the applicant filed a request for the acceleration of the main maintenance proceedings (Fristsetzungsantrag) under Section 91 of the Court Act (Gerichtsorganisationsgesetz). On 7 November 2005 the Regional Court partly granted the request and ordered the District Court to hold a hearing within four weeks.
On 9 January 2006 the District Court held a hearing. The applicant did not appear because she was in hospital. Her representative informed the court that she would be fit for questioning as of March 2006. On 24 April 2006 a hearing was held and the proceedings subsequently adjourned in order to obtain the statement of witnesses by means of letters of request from the Zürich District Court. On 11 September 2006 the applicant asked to address further letters of request to the Zürich District Court regarding more witnesses.
On 21 March 2007 the applicant filed a second request for the acceleration of the proceedings.
On 15 September 2007 the Zürich District Court submitted a large number of documents containing T.G.’s bank data. The questioning of three further witnesses took place on 2 February 2009.
On 11 May 2009 the applicant asked the District Court to suspend the proceedings concerning maintenance payments as from the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened (see paragraph 19 above). On 17 August 2009 the District Court held another hearing and granted this request.
On 30 March 2010 the District Court partly dismissed and partly refused the applicant’s claim regarding maintenance until the opening of the insolvency proceedings on 10 July 2003 by partial judgment (Teilurteil). The applicant appealed.
On 11 January 2011 the Regional Court confirmed this judgment. On 29 June 2011 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s extraordinary appeal on points of law (außerordentlicher Revisionsrekurs), thus the partial judgment entered into force.
On 27 October 2011 the applicant requested the continuation of the maintenance payments proceedings concerning the period starting from 10 July 2003 (see paragraph 28 above).
On 23 June and 5 September 2014, further hearings in the main maintenance proceedings took place before the District Court. After several hearings were postponed, another one took place on 27 November 2015. As no information to the contrary has been given by the parties, the proceedings are apparently still pending.
On 20 May 2003 T.G. applied for the opening of private insolvency proceedings (Schuldenregulierungsverfahren), which were opened by the Salzburg Regional Court (file no. 8 S 44/03y) on 10 July 2003 (see above paragraph 19).
The private insolvency proceedings of T.G. are still pending.
On 28 December 2011 the applicant filed a fresh maintenance claim with the Salzburg District Court (Bezirksgericht) against the liquidator as he had refused to acknowledge the applicant’s claim in the insolvency proceedings.
On 16 February 2012 the Salzburg District Court rejected the application after having held a hearing on 2 February 2012 because of res iudicata. On 25 April 2012 the Salzburg Regional Court quashed the District Court’s decision.
Several hearings were held between 10 September 2013 and 16 September 2014. On 24 August 2015 the Salzburg District Court partly granted the applicant’s appeal. However, the applicant appealed, therefore these proceedings are apparently still pending.
