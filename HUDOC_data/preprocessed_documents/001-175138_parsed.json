The Court notes that the judgment of the Osijek Municipal Court awarding him compensation did not address that specific complaint at all, or any other complaint concerning the lawfulness of his detention. While that court acceded to the applicant\u2019s claim for compensation for unjust detention, it based its decision on Article 480(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure which affords a right to reparation to anyone against whom charges have been dismissed (see paragraph\u00a023 above). The detention was deemed to be \u201cunfounded\u201d only because the charges against the applicant had been dismissed, and an award under Article 480(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not amount to a finding that the detention did not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 of the Convention. While it is true that the length of the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial was taken into account in calculating the amount of reparation, there is no acknowledgment in the judgment concerned, either express or implied, that it had been unlawful because of the reasons put forward by the applicant. It cannot therefore be said that the proceedings for compensation under Article 480 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Code of Criminal Procedure represented an effective remedy for the applicant\u2019s complaint about the lawfulness of the decision of 10 June 2011, which did not contain a time-limit (see, mutatis mutandis, Labita v.

In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the \u201cquality of the law\u201d, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention. \u201cQuality of law\u201d in this sense implies that where a domestic law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur, cited above, \u00a7 50, Baranowski v.

Germany, no. 24479/94, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2001-I). It is true that the provision in question does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention and for hearing applications for release. Nevertheless, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to the detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Fodale v. Italy, no.\u00a070148/01, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2006VII).",

The applicant\u2019s detention was lifted at first instance by an investigating judge and he was released pursuant to the order of the investigating judge of 31 May 2011, confirming his earlier order of 24 May 2011. However, the decision of the investigating judge was subject to further review by a three-judge panel of a county court following an appeal and was therefore not final. An appeal was in fact lodged by the State Attorney\u2019s Office against the investigating judge\u2019s decision ordering the applicant\u2019s release (see paragraph 10 above). In calling for that decision to be quashed, the prosecutor\u2019s office sought, through the appeal proceedings, to have the initial detention order upheld. In\u00a0the case the prosecution\u2019s appeal was dismissed the decision to release the applicant would become final; since it was accepted, the applicant was again placed in custody. The appeal thus represented a continuation of the proceedings relating to the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention. In those circumstances, the Court considers that the outcome of the appeal proceedings was a crucial factor in the decision as to the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention, irrespective of whether at that precise time the applicant was or was not held in custody. It cannot therefore subscribe to the Government\u2019s argument that Article 5 \u00a7 4 was not applicable to the appeal proceedings before the Osijek County Court when it ruled on the appeal by the public prosecutor\u2019s office (compare to Fodale, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040). Their objection in that respect therefore has to be dismissed.",

According to the Court\u2019s case-law, it follows from the wording of Article 6 \u2013 and particularly from the autonomous meaning to be given to the notion of \u201ccriminal charge\u201d \u2013 that this provision has some application to pre-trial proceedings (see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 275). It thus follows that, in view of the dramatic impact of deprivation of liberty on the fundamental rights of the person concerned, proceedings conducted under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention should in principle also meet, to the largest extent possible under the circumstances of an ongoing investigation, the basic requirements of a fair trial, such as the right to an adversarial procedure. While national law may satisfy this requirement in various ways, whatever method is chosen should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment thereon (see Garcia Alva v. Germany, no. 23541/94, \u00a7 39, 13\u00a0February 2001, and Fodale, cited above, \u00a7 42).",

The proceedings must be adversarial and must ensure equality of arms between the prosecutor and the detained person (see, inter alia, Nikolova, cited above, \u00a7 58; A. and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 204; and Mooren v.
