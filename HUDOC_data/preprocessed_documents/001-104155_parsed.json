Therefore, in two of those cases the  held that the legislation in question could not be applied to the complainants, as they had left their flats before 1995. It thus allowed their constitutional complaints (see paragraphs 20 and 22 above). In the remaining case it dismissed the constitutional complaint because it found that the complainant in that case, unlike the applicant in the present case, had left her flat in August 1995 (see paragraph 21 above).

It follows that in so far as the applicant's complaints under Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7 1 and 13 concern the alleged lack of access to a court and an effective remedy in respect of the break-in of his flat on 23\u00a0August 1996, and the decision of the Sequestration Commission of 28\u00a0August 1996, they are also inadmissible as incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention. To the extent that these complaints concern the decision of the Ministry of Reconstruction and Development of 7\u00a0August 1998 they are inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention.
