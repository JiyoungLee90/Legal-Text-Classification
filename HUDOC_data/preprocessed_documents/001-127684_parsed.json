In the absence of any challenge to this claim by the State party, and any other pertinent information from the State party on the practice of execution of capital sentences, due weight must be given to the author\u2019s allegation. The Committee understands the continued anguish and mental stress caused to the author, as the mother of a condemned prisoner, by the persisting uncertainty of the circumstances that led to his execution, as well as the location of his gravesite. The complete secrecy surrounding the date of execution, and the place of burial and the refusal to hand over the body for burial have the effect of intimidating or punishing families by intentionally leaving them in a state of uncertainty and mental distress. The Committee considers that the authorities\u2019 initial failure to notify the author of the scheduled date for the execution of her son, and their subsequent persistent failure to notify her of the location of her son\u2019s grave amounts to inhuman treatment of the author, in violation of article 7 of the Covenant.\u201d",

Thomas Sankara\u2019s family have the right to know the circumstances of his death, and the Committee points out that any complaint relating to acts prohibited under article 7 of the Covenant must be investigated rapidly and impartially by the competent authorities. In addition, the Committee notes, as it did during its deliberations on admissibility, the failure to correct Thomas Sankara\u2019s death certificate of 17 January 1988, which records a natural death contrary to the publicly known facts, which have been confirmed by the State party. The Committee considers that the refusal to conduct an investigation into the death of Thomas Sankara, the lack of official recognition of his place of burial and the failure to correct the death certificate constitute inhuman treatment of Ms. Sankara and her sons, in breach of article 7 of the Covenant.\u201d",

In addition, it pointed out that a significant proportion of the investigative steps required for ensuring compliance with the procedural obligation under Article 2 must have been carried out after the ratification date. In the Chamber\u2019s assessment, neither condition had been met in the instant case, in which the time lapse between the deaths (1940) and the ratification date (5 May 1998) was excessively long, too long in absolute terms to satisfy the \u201cgenuine connection\u201d standard.

Although such crimes are not subject to a statutory limitation by virtue of the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity ..., it does not mean that the States have an unceasing duty to investigate them. Nevertheless, the procedural obligation may be revived if information purportedly casting new light on the circumstances of such crimes comes into the public domain after the critical date. It cannot be the case that any assertion or allegation can trigger a fresh investigative obligation under Article 2 of the Convention. Given the fundamental importance of this provision, the State authorities must be sensitive to any information or material which has the potential either to undermine the conclusions of an earlier investigation or to allow an earlier inconclusive investigation to be pursued further ... Should new material come to light in the post-ratification period and should it be sufficiently weighty and compelling to warrant a new round of proceedings, the Court will have temporal jurisdiction to satisfy itself that the respondent State has discharged its procedural obligation under Article 2 in a manner compatible with the principles enunciated in its case-law.\u201d (references omitted)",

The contemporary Russian Code of Criminal Procedure required that the proceedings be discontinued upon the expiry of the limitation period. In addition, the officers of the NKVD of the USSR had died before the criminal investigation had been opened. As a matter of domestic criminal procedure, their death was a separate legal ground precluding criminal proceedings from being instituted against them or pursued. In international law, the death of suspects or defendants was also a universally recognised ground for refusing to institute or for discontinuing criminal proceedings (here the Government referred to Prosecutor v.

The Government concluded that international law, as it existed in 1940, did not provide a sufficient basis for characterising the \u201cKatyn events\u201d as a war crime, a crime against humanity or genocide unless they were attributable to the major war criminals of the European Axis and fell within the jurisdiction of the Nuremberg Tribunal. Nevertheless, at the request of the Polish authorities, the Russian investigators had examined the \u201cversion of genocide\u201d and determined that no such crime had been committed because the suspects had had purely criminal motives rather than an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group (according to the definition in Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 9 December 1948).",

Secondly, in the opinion of the Government, only those events that took place after the adoption of the Convention could trigger any procedural obligation. Thirdly, the Russian authorities could not reasonably be expected to carry out an effective investigation some fiftyeight years after the events when the witnesses had already died and the crucial documents had been destroyed. In the alternative, the Government pleaded that \u201cthe Convention impose[d] no specific obligation ... to provide redress for wrongs or damage caused prior to ... ratification\u201d (here they referred to Kopeck\u00fd v.

However, where the death had occurred before the ratification date, the Court would have no temporal jurisdiction to perform such an analysis. Furthermore, the detachability principle had to be subject to certain limitations if an unforeseeable extension of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction and the Convention\u2019s outreach were to be avoided. Firstly, the lapse of time had to be reasonably short, which it was not in the present case. Secondly, a significant portion of the investigative steps had to have been carried out after the ratification date. This criterion was likewise not fulfilled in the instant case. Finally, where the need to ensure the real and effective protection of the underlying values of the Convention was concerned, the Government agreed that the event in question had to be of a larger dimension than an ordinary criminal offence. However, as far as the \u201cKatyn events\u201d were concerned, the Court had no jurisdiction, either ratione temporis or ratione materiae, to assess them from the standpoint of international humanitarian law.",

The expression \u201cthe underlying values of the Convention\u201d had previously been invoked by the Court in finding that particular instances of hate speech, such as speech denying the Holocaust or justifying war crimes, were incompatible with the values of the Convention (here they referred to Garaudy v.

In the applicants\u2019 submission, the mention of the underlying values in paragraph 163 of the \u0160ilih judgment indicated that there existed some instances of acts violating the very foundation of the Convention system whose nature, magnitude and gravity should give the Court jurisdiction ratione temporis to examine the State\u2019s obligation to conduct an effective investigation.",

The Polish soldiers captured by the Red Army had been entitled to the full protection guaranteed to prisoners of war, including the protection against acts of violence and cruelty afforded by the provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and the Geneva Convention of 1929. The murder of Polish prisoners of war in 1940 had been an unlawful act which violated Articles 4, 23 (c) and 50 of the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Articles 2, 46, 61 and 63 of the Geneva Convention of 1929. Even though the USSR had not been a party to either Convention, it had a duty to respect the universally binding principles of international customary law, which had merely been codified in those Conventions. That such an obligation was recognised as legally binding by the USSR was clearly evidenced by the fact that, at the Nuremberg trial, the Soviet prosecutor had attempted to charge the Nazi leaders with the murder of Polish prisoners of war. The extermination of Polish prisoners of war was a war crime within the meaning of Article 6 (b) of the Nuremberg Charter and the shooting of civilians amounted to a crime against humanity as defined in Article 6 (c) of the Nuremberg Charter. The Nuremberg Tribunal\u2019s classification of the Katyn massacre as a war crime had to be viewed in objective terms and was not dependent upon who had actually committed the atrocity. Moreover, the execution of prisoners of war constituted and was treated as a war crime by the international community, a fact convincingly demonstrated by the abundant case-law from the postwar trials of war criminals. As a crime under international law, the Katyn massacre had been imprescriptible at the time of its commission, as it was today, and the concomitant duty to investigate it survived to this day.",

The Katyn massacre had been carried out by a totalitarian regime whose aims and values radically contradicted those of the Convention. If the Convention was to be protected in a real and effective manner, the current Contracting Parties had to conduct effective investigations into totalitarian crimes.

The murder and ill-treatment of prisoners of war and civilians had been prohibited under customary international law in 1939, and States had had an obligation to investigate and prosecute war crimes well before 1939, with no statutory limitation (here they referred to Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0186 and 232, ECHR 2010, and to the judgments of the IACtHR in Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v. Honduras (merits), judgment of 29 July 1988, \u00a7\u00a0174, Series C No. 4, and Gomes Lund et al., cited above, \u00a7 108). The third party emphasised that the IACtHR had repeatedly found violations of the obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish acts that took place before the ratification of the American Convention on Human Rights by the respondent State (here they cited the Gomes Lund et al. judgment (cited above), and also Almonacid Arellano v. Chile ((preliminary objections, merits, reparations and costs), judgment of 26 September 2006, \u00a7 151, Series C No. 154). They pointed out that the passage of time did not alter the State\u2019s obligation to conduct an investigation or to provide suitable, effective remedies to victims. The right of victims to effective access to justice included the right to be heard and the right to full reparation, which comprised the following elements: restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition (reference was made to the IACtHR\u2019s findings in Gomes Lund et al., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0261-62, 277 and 297). Finally, the third party submitted, again by reference to the Gomes Lund et al. judgment (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a0241-42), that the failure to conduct an effective investigation adversely impacted the right of family members to be treated humanely.",

The right of families to know the fate of their missing or dead relatives was a free-standing component of the duty to investigate which was a codified norm of customary international law (here they referred in particular to Rule 117 in Customary International Humanitarian Law, Volume I: Rules, International Committee of the Red Cross, 2005, and to the case-law of the IACtHR).

In two cases the fact that the applicants\u2019 relatives had lost their lives at the hands of insurgents or paramilitary formations seven and six years respectively before the critical date did not prevent the Court from taking cognisance of the merits of the complaint under the procedural limb of Article 2 (see Pa\u00e7ac\u0131 and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 3064/07, \u00a7\u00a7 64-66, 8\u00a0November 2011, and Julari\u0107 v.

Nor was the thirteen-year period separating the death of the applicant\u2019s son in a brawl and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Serbia seen as outweighing the importance of the procedural acts that were accomplished after the critical date (see Mladenovi\u0107 v.

The Court nonetheless considers that the \u201cConvention values\u201d clause cannot be applied to events which occurred prior to the adoption of the Convention, on 4 November 1950, for it was only then that the Convention began its existence as an international human rights treaty. Hence, a Contracting Party cannot be held responsible under the Convention for not investigating even the most serious crimes under international law if they predate the Convention.

Mass burials of prisoners wearing Polish uniforms were uncovered in the Katyn Forest as early as 1943, following the German takeover of the territory. A note written in 1959 by the Head of the KGB, a successor to the NKVD, acknowledged that a total of more than twenty-one thousand Polish prisoners had been shot by NKVD officials.

They argued, in contrast to the Chamber\u2019s approach, that those who did not remember their fathers or had been denied an opportunity to have any personal contact with them were more sensitive to the tragic fate of their parents. Furthermore, the applicants in the second group \u2013 in respect of which no violation of Article 3 was found \u2013 had been actively involved in a range of legal steps as well as other activities relating to the commemoration of their relatives who had been killed: Ms\u00a0Wo\u0142kJezierska had written a number of books on the Katyn massacre, Ms Krzyszkowiak had set up a publishing house printing Katyn-related materials, Ms Rodowicz had created several artistic works dedicated to the Katyn massacre and Mr Romanowski, the youngest among the applicants, had \u201cinherited\u201d from his late mother the task of honouring the memory of his uncle who had been killed.

In the Katyn case, the sequence was reversed: those who were \u201cdead\u201d had become \u201cdisappeared\u201d in the eyes of the Russian authorities. That reversal represented a sheer denial of historical facts and inflicted severe pain, anguish and stress on the applicants. It was tantamount to informing a group of relatives of Holocaust victims that the victims must be considered unaccounted for as their fate could only be traced to the dead-end track of a concentration camp because the documents had been destroyed by the Nazi authorities. Moreover, in so far as the military prosecutors had claimed that they were unable to establish \u201cwhich provision of the Penal Code formed the legal basis for calling the [Polish] prisoner[s] to account\u201d, this was essentially an allegation that the victims might have been criminals who had been duly sentenced to capital punishment. Furthermore, in the rehabilitation proceedings before the Moscow Court, the prosecutor had argued that there existed \u201cdue reasons\u201d for the repression, as some Polish officers had been \u201cspies, terrorists and saboteurs\u201d and as the Polish pre-war army \u201chad been trained to fight against the Soviet Union\u201d.

The essence of the issue under Article 3 in this type of case lies not so much in a serious violation of the missing person\u2019s human rights but rather in the authorities\u2019 dismissive reactions and attitudes in respect of that situation when it was brought to their attention.

Turkey [GC], no. 27396/06, \u00a7 50, 29 June 2012). The Court\u2019s case-law, as outlined above, has accepted that the suffering of family members of a \u201cdisappeared person\u201d who have to go through a long period of alternating hope and despair may justify finding a separate violation of Article 3 on account of the particularly callous attitude of the domestic authorities to their quest for information. As regards the instant case, the Court\u2019s jurisdiction extends only to the period starting on 5 May 1998, the date of entry into force of the Convention in respect of Russia. The Court has found above that as from that date, no lingering uncertainty as to the fate of the Polish prisoners of war could be said to have remained. Even though not all of the bodies have been recovered, their death was publicly acknowledged by the Soviet and Russian authorities and has become an established historical fact. The magnitude of the crime committed in 1940 by the Soviet authorities is a powerful emotional factor, yet, from a purely legal point of view, the Court cannot accept it as a compelling reason for departing from its case-law on the status of the family members of \u201cdisappeared persons\u201d as victims of a violation of Article 3 and conferring that status on the applicants, for whom the death of their relatives was a certainty.",

This principle was codified in Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties as an extension of the more general pacta sunt servanda principle, and had been frequently invoked in the jurisprudence of international courts and quasi-judicial bodies including the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the Inter-American Court on Human Rights, the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and arbitration tribunals. When confronted with a State Party\u2019s reluctance to submit the requested materials on account of confidentiality concerns, international tribunals held hearings in a closed session (the applicants referred to the IACtHR\u2019s judgment in God\u00ednez Cruz v. Honduras (merits), judgment of 20 January 1989, Series C No. 5, and the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organisation in Ballo v. UNESCO, judgment no.\u00a0191, 15 May 1972). In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ had not drawn any negative inferences when the United Kingdom refused to submit evidence which it considered to be related to naval secrecy (see Corfu Channel case, judgment of 9 April 1949: ICJ Reports 1949). However, the ICTY had rejected the Croatian government\u2019s reliance on the Corfu judgment as justification for their refusal to produce certain documents and evidence of a military character in the Prosecutor v.\u00a0Tihomir Bla\u0161ki\u0107 case, holding, in particular, that a blanket right of States to withhold, for security reasons, documents necessary for proceedings might jeopardise the very function of the Tribunal (Case No. IT-95-14-AR108bis, judgment of 29 October 1997). It had added that the validity of State security concerns could be accommodated by procedural arrangements, including in camera hearings and special procedures for communicating and recording sensitive documents. In the later case of Prosecutor v. Dario Kordi\u0107 and Mario \u010cerkez (Case No. IT-95-14/2, decision of 9 September 1999), the ICTY had also held that the question of the relevance of the requested material for the proceedings fell within its full discretion and could not be challenged by States.

Being master of its own procedure and of its own rules, the Court has complete freedom in assessing not only the admissibility and the relevance but also the probative value of each item of evidence before it. Only the Court may decide whether and to what extent the participation of a particular witness would be relevant for its assessment of the facts and what kind of evidence the parties are required to produce for due examination of the case. The parties are obliged to comply with its evidential requests and instructions, provide timely information on any obstacles in complying with them and provide any reasonable or convincing explanations for failure to comply (see Davydov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0174; Nevmerzhitsky v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a054825/00, \u00a7 77, 5 April 2005; and Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 210, Series A no.\u00a025).

Indeed, the effective exercise of this right may be thwarted by a Contracting Party\u2019s failure to assist the Court in conducting an examination of all circumstances relating to the case, including in particular by not producing evidence which the Court considers crucial for its task. Both provisions work together to guarantee the efficient conduct of the judicial proceedings and they relate to matters of procedure rather than to the merits of the applicants\u2019 grievances under the substantive provisions of the Convention or its Protocols. Although the structure of the Court\u2019s judgments traditionally reflects the numbering of the Articles of the Convention, it has also been customary for the Court to examine the Government\u2019s compliance with their procedural obligation under Article 38 of the Convention at the outset, especially if negative inferences are to be drawn from the Government\u2019s failure to submit the requested evidence (see, among other cases, Shakhgiriyeva and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a027251/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0134-40, 8 January 2009; Utsayeva and Others v.

The Court also reiterates in this connection that it may establish a failure by the respondent Government to comply with their procedural obligations even in the absence of any admissible complaint about a violation of a substantive Convention right (see Poleshchuk v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a060776/00, 7 October 2004). Furthermore, it is not required that the Government\u2019s alleged interference should have actually restricted, or had any appreciable impact on, the exercise of the right of individual petition (see McShane v. the United Kingdom, no. 43290/98, \u00a7 151, 28 May 2002). The Court reaffirms that the Contracting Party\u2019s procedural obligations under Articles 34 and 38 of the Convention must be enforced irrespective of the eventual outcome of the proceedings and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or potential chilling effect on the applicants or their representatives.",

It has also previously rejected similar objections from the Russian Government relating to the alleged lack of safeguards in the Court\u2019s procedure guaranteeing the confidentiality of documents or imposing sanctions on foreign nationals for a breach of confidentiality (see Shakhgiriyeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0136-40). The Court reiterates in this connection that the Convention is an international treaty which, in accordance with the principle of pacta sunt servanda codified in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, is binding on the Contracting Parties and must be performed by them in good faith. Pursuant to Article 27 of the Vienna Convention, the provisions of internal law may not be invoked as justification for a failure by the Contracting State to abide by its treaty obligations. In the context of the obligation flowing from the text of Article 38 of the Convention, this requirement means that the respondent Government may not rely on domestic legal impediments, such as the absence of a special decision by a different agency of the State, to justify a failure to furnish all the facilities necessary for the Court\u2019s examination of the case. It has been the Court\u2019s constant position that Governments are answerable under the Convention for the acts of any State agency since what is in issue in all cases before the Court is the international responsibility of the State (see Lukanov v. Bulgaria, 20 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports 1997II).",

It has become clear that the classification decision was not made by the Chief Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office of its own initiative but rather on the basis of the opinion of some officials from the Federal Security Service, which had \u201cthe right to dispose as it saw fit of the information reproduced in the Chief Military Prosecutor\u2019s decision\u201d.

It is not even apparent whether the City Court was presented with a copy of the expert report issued by the Federal Security Service. The national courts did not subject to any meaningful scrutiny the executive\u2019s assertion that information contained in that decision should be kept secret more than seventy years after the events. They confined the scope of their inquiry to ascertaining that the classification decision had been issued within the administrative competence of the relevant authorities, without carrying out an independent review of whether the conclusion that its declassification constituted a danger to national security had a reasonable basis in fact. The Russian courts did not address in substance Memorial\u2019s argument that the decision brought to an end the investigation into a mass murder of unarmed prisoners, that is, one of the most serious violations of human rights committed on orders from the highest-ranking Soviet officials, and that it was not therefore amenable to classification by virtue of section 7 of the State Secrets Act. Finally, they did not perform a balancing exercise between the alleged need to protect the information owned by the Federal Security Service, on the one hand, and the public interest in a transparent investigation into the crimes of the previous totalitarian regime and the private interest of the victims\u2019 relatives in uncovering the circumstances of their death, on the other hand. Given the restricted scope of the domestic judicial review of the classification decision, the Court is unable to accept that the submission of a copy of the decision of 21 September 2004, as it had requested, could have affected Russia\u2019s national security.",

I do not find this reasoning persuasive. The State\u2019s obligation to carry out a thorough investigation is engaged when gross human rights violations (genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes) are at stake. The mere fact that the crimes in question took place before the Convention came into existence is not decisive.

Even in international conflicts it is important to adhere to this approach and not to blame the State automatically. In particular, the Russian Federation did not exist in 1940 and the Soviet Union was a totalitarian State in which a large number of families suffered under Stalin\u2019s regime and millions of people were subjected to killings without a fair trial. The Politburo\u2019s order authorised the execution of Polish prisoners of war and of thousands of Soviet citizens at the same time. Indeed, the right approach would be to punish those members of the Politburo but not the State itself, because all the people of that country who were victims cannot at the same time bear responsibility for this crime against humanity.",

Not only did the applicants lose their relatives and were then confronted with official propaganda attributing the crime to the Germans, but also, over many years in the Soviet Union and Poland, any private attempt to conduct research into the truth of the Katyn massacre was punished, as was the dissemination of information gathered on that subject. It is not therefore exact to say that the alleged events occurred more than seventy years ago: on the contrary, various forms of violation of the applicants\u2019 fundamental rights characterised the entire period of the communist regime in both countries. It should be added here that, for the victims of a crime or for their relatives, time does not always flow in the same manner in different States. From the perspective of human rights protection, decades in a totalitarian State cannot be compared with the same lapse of time in a democratic State governed by the rule of law. Consequently, the argument concerning the lapse of time, occasionally relied on to justify the termination of legal obligations with regard to human rights (see, for example, paragraph 157 of the judgment), must always be examined in the specific historical context of each country. Moreover, the applicants have described in detail the various acts and omissions of the Russian authorities subsequent to the date of entry into force of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in respect of the Russian Federation. In particular, they report the disparaging remarks made against them by certain representatives of the Russian authorities. The Chamber judgment (see Janowiec and Others v. Russia, nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, 16 April 2012) established a number of important facts reflecting those authorities\u2019 dismissive and disdainful attitude.

Indeed, the Court has explicitly confirmed in a number of cases the applicability of those rules of interpretation, referring to the provisions of the Vienna Convention (see, for example, the judgments in Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18; Johnston and Others v.

While the temporal scope of a treaty is a matter of substantive law, the extent of the jurisdiction ratione temporis of an international body is governed by the rules of jurisdiction. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the temporal scope of the Convention varies according to the High Contracting Parties. In practice, under the rules of the law of treaties, the Convention comes into force with regard to a High Contracting Party on the date of its ratification and creates obligations as of that date.",

To illustrate this point, one might refer here to the situation of the States which had made a declaration recognising the competence of the European Commission of Human Rights to examine individual applications, under the legal regime applicable prior to 1 November 1998, that is, prior to the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, restructuring the control machinery established thereby.

The existence of a \u201cgenuine connection\u201d, in the ordinary meaning of these words, is hardly open to dispute. Secondly, under Russian domestic law and the rules of international law applicable in Russia, the Russian authorities were obliged to prosecute the perpetrators of the massacre of Polish prisoners of war.

This case is about an undeniable obligation to investigate and prosecute gross human rights and humanitarian law violations which under international law are not subject to statutory limitations. The mass killings of the Polish prisoners of war by the Soviet authorities are war crimes. It is evident that in this case the Court was called upon to identify the relationship between the Convention and one of the most important obligations in international law.

In addition, the declaration by the Russian military courts that the relatives of the applicants were \u201cmissing persons\u201d is illogical considering that Russian prosecutors had previously confirmed the execution of those individuals (see paragraph 122). Furthermore, the domestic authorities failed to undertake an investigation \u201cgeared towards identifying the perpetrators and bringing them to justice\u201d, despite the fact that at least two of the functionaries implicated were alive in the 1990s (see paragraph 119). Lastly, the Russian authorities argued that the domestic proceedings could not be conducted to the standards of the law of criminal procedure because they had been conducted \u201cfor political reasons, as a goodwill gesture to the Polish authorities\u201d (see paragraphs 109 and 111). Such an \u201cexemption\u201d of the proceedings from the procedural requirements of Article 2 is arbitrary and untenable.

The Russian Empire was one of the original signatories of the Hague Convention and ratified it on 27 November 1909.

According to both the rules of State continuity and those of State succession, and plainly in view of the applicable rules of customary law, the Government\u2019s submission that they are not bound by the international humanitarian law on war crimes thus violates the principle of venire contra factum proprium. In light of the above, we must conclusively find that the massacre of the Polish prisoners of war in 1940 constituted a violation of the prohibition of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Under customary international humanitarian law, States have an obligation \u201cto investigate war crimes allegedly committed by their nationals or armed forces, or on their territory, and, if appropriate, prosecute the suspects\u201d. There is no time-limit on this obligation, for war crimes and crimes against humanity are imprescriptible.",

However, in a situation such as that in the case at hand, where the national authorities denied any connection to or responsibility for the Katyn crimes for over forty years, the mere counting of years leads to an absurd result.

In other words, the examination of the events after the ratification of the Convention by the respondent State in paragraphs 158 and 159 is superfluous, if not contradictory. Secondly, this interpretation of the \u201chumanitarian clause\u201d closes the Court\u2019s door to victims of any gross human rights violation that occurred prior to the existence of the Convention, although it is clearly accepted today that the States concerned carry a continuing procedural obligation to establish the facts, to find the perpetrators and to punish them. Thirdly, the majority\u2019s position contradicts a principle well established in the Court\u2019s case-law, namely that the Convention shall not be interpreted in splendid isolation, but is to be interpreted taking into account the relevant international law (see Nada, cited above, \u00a7 169; AlAdsani v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97, \u00a7\u00a055, ECHR 2001-XI; and Al-Jedda v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a027021/08, \u00a7\u00a7 76 and 105, ECHR 2011). In paragraph 151, the Court creates an artificial distinction between the relevant international law and the Convention, finding that the \u201cConvention values\u201d clause is inapplicable to events occurring before the adoption of the Convention in 1950. This distinction was not made in the previous case-law, which had not given the Court the opportunity to consider a case potentially falling under the \u201cConvention values\u201d clause (see paragraph 149). Lastly, it must be noted that the killings committed in 1940 were, also at the time of their commission, in violation of the authorities\u2019 obligations under customary international law.",

According to Article 32 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see paragraph\u00a03 above), the Court has the competence to define its own jurisdiction. With this judgment, the Court has missed an opportunity to fulfil this very task and thereby uphold the \u201cConvention values\u201d clause in the \u0160ilih principles. In doing so, it has deprived that clause of its humanitarian effect in the case at hand and potentially weakened its effect in the event of its future application.
