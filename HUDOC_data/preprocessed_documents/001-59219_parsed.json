Cihat, the son of the village mayor also went with the detainees in order to have his lost identity card reissued (see above paragraphs 87 and 105). However, he was not taken inside the boarding school. When they arrived at the school, the detainees were blindfolded (see above paragraphs 81, 90, 101). They were detained in the basement of the building, where there were toilets and a hamam. Their hands were not bound. They were all kept together in the same room. There was no furniture and they sat on the floor. The detainees were given bread, biscuits and water (see above paragraphs 82 and 91). Ali \u0130hsan and Tahsin were sitting close to Fevzi Fidantek (see paragraph 82). During their detention, Mehmet \u00d6zinek\u00e7i gave some money to Ali \u0130hsan asking him to request the soldiers to buy biscuits (see paragraph 91). None of the detainees was subjected to ill-treatment (see paragraphs 83, 93, 103). On Friday the detainees heard a male voice saying \u201cTahsin and Ali \u0130hsan \u00c7i\u00e7ek, take your identity cards, you are free\u201d. Consequently, the two brothers were taken out of the room (see paragraphs 84, 93). A few minutes later a soldier came and took Ali Ihsan\u2019s coat on which Mehmet \u00d6zinek\u00e7i was sitting (see paragraph 93). A day after the release of the two brothers, the rest of the detainees were taken to the regiment on the border of Lice and released there. Their identity cards were returned to them a week later at the Lice Gendarme Station (see paragraphs 84, 93, 103). When the three villagers returned home, they were surprised to find out that Tahsin and Ali \u0130hsan \u00c7i\u00e7ek had not come back to the village (see paragraphs 85, 94, 103).  ",

Turkey (judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1182, \u00a7 108), in which the Court held that there were insufficient persuasive indications that the applicant\u2019s son had met his death in custody. In the first place, six and a half years have now elapsed since Tahsin and Ali Ihsan \u00c7i\u00e7ek were apprehended and detained. Furthermore, it has been established that the two brothers were taken to a place of detention - the military area in Lice Regional Boarding School- by authorities for whom the State is responsible. Finally, the fact that the soldiers did not release Tahsin and Ali Ihsan \u00c7i\u00e7ek together with the other villagers within a few days, taken together with the other elements in the file, suggests that both were identified as persons under suspicion by the authorities (see above paragraph 78, especially Yaral\u0131\u2019s statement that if people were deemed clearly dangerous or required interrogation, they were handed over to the interrogation units at the end of a short period called \u201cthe observation period\u201d). In the general context of the situation in south-east Turkey in 1994, it can by no means be excluded that the unacknowledged detention of such a person would be life-threatening (see the above cited Timurta\u015f v. Turkey judgment, \u00a7 85). It is to be recalled that the Court has held in earlier judgments that defects undermining the effectiveness of criminal law protection in the south-east during the period relevant also to this case, permitted or fostered a lack of accountability of members of the security forces for their actions (see Cemil K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 22492/93, \u00a7 75, and Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey, no. 22535/93, \u00a7 98, both to be published in ECHR 2000).",

Consequently, the responsibility of the respondent State for their death is engaged. Noting that the authorities have not provided any explanation as to what occurred following Tahsin and Ali Ihsan\u2019s apprehension, and that they do not rely on any ground of justification in respect of any use of lethal force by their agents, it follows that liability for their death is attributable to the respondent Government (see Timurtas v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 86). Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 2 on that account.",

Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that the public prosecutors themselves made an attempt to inspect the veracity of the information contained in the custody ledgers or as regards the places of detention (the Regional Boarding School of Lice); nor were the Lice gendarmes or other soldiers asked without any insistence to account for their actions on 10 May 1994.",

This insistence on the protection of the individual against any abuse of power is illustrated by the fact that Article 5 \u00a7 1 circumscribes the circumstances in which individuals may be lawfully deprived of their liberty, it being stressed that these circumstances must be given a narrow interpretation having regard to the fact that they constitute exceptions to a most basic guarantee of individual freedom (...)\u201d.",

The requirements of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 with their emphasis on promptitude and judicial control assume particular importance in this context. Prompt judicial intervention may lead to the detection and prevention of life-threatening measures or serious ill-treatment which violate the fundamental guarantees contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (...). What is at stake is both the protection of the physical liberty of individuals as well as their personal security in a context which, in the absence of safeguards, could result in a subversion of the rule of law and place detainees beyond the reach of the most rudimentary forms of legal protection.\u201d",

In this respect, the case differs for example from the Kurt case.  The only argument in favour of presumed death is the lack of any information on their whereabouts during six and a half years. In the Kurt judgment, it was emphasised that the Court must carefully scrutinise whether there does in fact exist concrete evidence which would lead it to conclude that (the person) was, beyond reasonable doubt, killed by the authorities while in detention or at some subsequent stage.

I do not see serious obstacles to the application of that doctrine in this particular case (and in similar circumstances in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence in general), even if such a finding is not bolstered by more general analyses and assessment of what is, according to the allegations, an officially tolerated practice of disappearances. To my understanding, under the positive obligation doctrine, even one single disappearance would fall under the first sentence of Article\u00a02 \u00a7 1, which obliges states to protect everyone`s right to life. The disappearance of a person under the control of the authorities means that their life has not been properly protected.
