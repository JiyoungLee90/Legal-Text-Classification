Thus Article 6 - especially paragraph 3 \u2013 may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 50). As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 of the Convention is one element, among others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in paragraph\u00a01 (see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, \u00a7 37, Series\u00a0A no. 275, and Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 50). The Court further recalls that the investigation stage is of crucial importance for the preparation of criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered (Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 54). The Court has also held that, in the context of application of paragraph 3 (e), the issue of the defendant's linguistic knowledge is vital and that it must also examine the nature of the offence with which the defendant is charged and any communications addressed to him by the domestic authorities, in order to assess whether they are sufficiently complex to require a detailed knowledge of the language used in court (see Hermi v.  [GC], no. 18114/02, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2006XII). Finally, the Court has ruled that the assistance of an interpreter should be provided during the investigation stage unless it can be demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of the case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right (see Diallo v. Sweden (dec.), no. 13205/07, \u00a7 25, 5\u00a0January 2010).",

This fact is also confirmed by the decision of the  to authorise her to have an interpreter during the trial. It is also undisputed that she is illiterate. Although she apparently gave a detailed account of her involvement in an illegal organisation, the Court observes that she made those selfincriminating statements without an interpreter and also without the assistance of a lawyer. Taking into account the importance of the investigation stage as reiterated above, the Court is not convinced that the applicant had a sufficient understanding of the questions she was being asked or that she was able to express herself adequately in Turkish, and certainly not to a level which would justify reliance on her statements as evidence against her at the trial.",

However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, a waiver of the right must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards (see Pishchalnikov v. Russia, no. 7025/04, \u00a7\u00a077, 24 September 2009). A waiver of the right, once invoked, must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right. Before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be (see Talat Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 32432/96, \u00a7 59, 27\u00a0March 2007).",

It is not to be ruled out that, after initially being advised of his rights, an accused may himself validly waive his rights and respond to questioning. However, the Court strongly indicates that additional safeguards are necessary when the accused declines the right to a counsel, because if an accused has no lawyer he has less chance of being informed of his rights and, as a consequence, there is less chance that they will be respected (see Pishchalnikov, cited above, \u00a7 78).",

Consequently, the restriction on an accused's right of access to a lawyer in proceedings before State Security Courts had already been lifted. As a result, when the applicant was arrested on 19 February 2004, she had the right of access to a lawyer from the moment she was taken into custody. Despite this amendment in the Turkish legislation, the Court notes that in the instant case the applicant did not benefit from the assistance of a lawyer during the preliminary investigation stage. When questioned by the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge respectively, the applicant gave self-incriminating statements and signed the reports with her fingerprint. The Court notes that the applicant was accused of being a member of an illegal organisation, which is a very serious charge, and faced a heavy penalty.",

Consequently, it cannot find that the applicant waived her right to a lawyer in a knowing and intelligent way. Furthermore, the Court considers that additional protection should be provided for illiterate detainees with a view to ensuring that the voluntary nature of a waiver is reliably established and recorded. In the present case, however, no specific measures of this kind were envisaged.",
