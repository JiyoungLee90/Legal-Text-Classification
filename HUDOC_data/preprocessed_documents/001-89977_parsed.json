These considerations led the courts to assume that the applicant, if released, could obstruct the proper course of the proceedings. The courts found on several occasions that there were no special grounds, as specified in Article 259 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that would justify lifting the detention order and imposing a less severe measure. In its decision of 12 February 2002 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal also acknowledged the delay in the proceedings and asked the trial court to expedite the examination of the case.",
