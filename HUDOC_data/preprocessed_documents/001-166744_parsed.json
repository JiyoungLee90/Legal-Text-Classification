The belated diagnosis of prostate cancer and the failure to provide active treatment, such as glandular therapy, radiation therapy or surgery were mentioned among other major shortcomings on the part of the medical authorities. The doctors had also noted that the applicant could not be provided with adequate medical treatment in the prison hospital, because it had no licence for inpatient treatment of cancer patients and urological diseases.

It is not only material interests which the successor of a deceased applicant may pursue by his or her wish to maintain the application. Human rights cases before the Court generally also have a moral dimension and persons near to an applicant may thus have a legitimate interest in ensuring that justice is done, even after the applicant\u2019s death (see Malhous v. the Czech Republic (dec.) [GC], no.\u00a033071/96, ECHR 2000-XII). Whether the rights at issue are transferable to an heir willing to pursue an application on behalf of a deceased person is not therefore a decisive factor (see Fartushin v. Russia, no.\u00a038887/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03134, 8\u00a0October 2015 and Ergezen v. Turkey, no. 73359/10, \u00a7 29, 8\u00a0April 2014). It has been also established that, in exceptional circumstances and cases concerning allegations of a serious nature, it should be open to associations to represent victims in the absence of a power of attorney, and notwithstanding that a victim may have died before the application in question was lodged under the Convention.
