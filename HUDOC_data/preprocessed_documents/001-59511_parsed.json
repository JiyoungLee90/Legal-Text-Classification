It preserved the ancien r\u00e9gime principle that administrative authorities should be tried by a special court, in accordance with the idea that judging the administrative authorities was \u201calso an administrative act\u201d. Such a special court was set up by the Consulate in 1799. This was the Conseil d\u2019Etat, which was instituted by Article 52 of the Constitution of 22 Frimaire Year VIII (13 December 1799). It was given responsibilities in two areas: administrative (contributing to the drafting of major enactments) and judicial (settling disputes connected with the administrative authorities).",

The Court also points out that in Borgers, which concerned the role of the Advocate-General at the Court of Cassation in criminal proceedings, it held that there had been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, principally because of the Advocate-General\u2019s participation in the Court of Cassation\u2019s deliberations, which had infringed the principle of equality of arms.

Secondly, the last sentence of paragraph 79 adds that all judges must express their views in public \u2013 or none must. But that statement, which begs the question, is not based on any precedent of our Court and is not founded on any authoritative argument.

It was for that reason that the Court dismissed Mrs Kress\u2019s first complaint. The majority of the Court infer that a litigant should enjoy similar safeguards in respect of the deliberations. Yes, but what does that mean? That the private party\u2019s lawyer, or the representative of the administrative authority in dispute with that party, or both, should also attend the deliberations? They would be silent and passive, as the Government Commissioner is, and yet their presence would neutralise his own? Merely to imagine such possibilities is to demonstrate how unrealistic they are. We therefore consider that this argument is ingenious but contrived.",

Despite those criticisms, the majority go further still. It is illogical that the same applicant, who in no way calls in question the subjective impartiality of a judge or his independence (see paragraph 78 of the judgment), may justifiably \u201chave a feeling of inequality\u201d if she sees him \u201cwithdraw with the judges of the trial bench to attend the deliberations held in the privacy of chambers\u201d (see paragraph 81 of the judgment). It is not only illogical; it is open to criticism, since any informed litigant, and at all events any informed lawyer, knows that the participation in the deliberations of someone who has publicly expressed his \u201copinio juris\u201d is not, by the mere fact of his presence, going to increase the impact of that opinion on the judges who have to deliberate and vote.

In our humble but firm opinion, our Court has already gone very far in this area in the past (since Borgers v. Belgium, judgment of 30 October 1991 (Series A no. 214-B), in fact, which represented a departure from doctrine previously established in Delcourt v.

Belgium (judgment of 20 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, Commission decision, p. 246, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54), the Advocate General does not attend the deliberations. This is said to confirm the majority\u2019s approach (see paragraph 86 of the judgment). The Advocate General at the Court of Justice of the European Communities was indeed \u201cclosely modelled\u201d on the Government Commissioner at the French Conseil d\u2019Etat. But it is inappropriate to attach any decisive importance to the difference. The mere fact that in its order in the Emesa Sugar case the Court of Justice held that the office of Advocate General, whose holder does not take part in the deliberations, was compatible with fundamental rights does not mean that our Court had to hold that the Commissioner\u2019s presence at the deliberations of administrative courts breached Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Secondly, this incidental difference, which goes back to the 1950s, is certainly not due to some sort of condemnation of the French system by the Luxembourg Court, any more than it is to the fear of any incompatibility with the Convention, to which the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities have referred only since 1975. Lastly, while it is satisfactory that both courts have reached the same conclusion in respect of the complaint which our Court has dismissed, there would be no flagrant contradiction if they condemned neither the Advocate General nor the Government Commissioner, irrespective of whether the latter attended the deliberations or the former did not.",

We would venture also to draw attention to the determining influence of several Government commissioners, members of the Conseil d\u2019Etat, in regard to the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into the French legal system, whether in the matter of the Convention\u2019s primacy over French law, even that enacted subsequently, or in the matter of the case-law on Article 8 and the law on aliens, on Article 10, on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and even on Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01, in issue in the instant case.",
