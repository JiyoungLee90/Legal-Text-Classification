The case originated in an application (no. 60786/10) against the Portuguese Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Portuguese national, Ms Tomásia Vieira Gomes Bezerra (“the applicant”), on 4 October 2010.
The Portuguese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms. M. F. Graça de Carvalho, Deputy-Attorney General.
On 17 October 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in Silves (Portugal) and lives in Bonn (Germany).
On 28 February 2007 the applicant started civil proceedings against two companies before the Court of Vila Nova de Gaia (Portugal). The proceedings concerned the occupation of a land which the applicant claimed to be her own (domestic proceedings no. 1908/07.8TBVNG).
The defendants contested the proceedings and the court ordered that the size of the land be analysed by an expertise. These procedural steps ended on 18 December 2007.
In the first trimester of 2008 an attempt of conciliation of the parties took place.
On 18 July 2008 the court ordered the suspension of the proceedings as the property was not registered in the name of the applicant, before the Land Registry Office (Conservatória do Registo Predial).
On 20 January 2010 the court ordered the interruption of the proceedings.
On 18 July 2010 the applicant joined an additional supporting document to the proceedings, informing the court of the registration of the land. The judge ordered the proceedings to be resumed.
According to the last information received by the Court on 3 May 2013, the proceedings are still pending.
