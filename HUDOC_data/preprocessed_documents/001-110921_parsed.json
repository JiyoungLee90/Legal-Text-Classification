[T]he Tribunal, while accepting that the appellant\u2019s political activity in this country was genuine, were not prepared to accept in the absence of positive evidence that the Eritrean authorities had \u2018the means and the inclination\u2019 to monitor such activities as a demonstration outside their embassy, or that they would be able to identify the appellant from photographs of the demonstration. In my judgment, and without disrespect to what is a specialist tribunal, this is a finding which risks losing contact with reality. Where, as here, the tribunal has objective evidence which \u2018paints a bleak picture of the suppression of political opponents\u2019 by a named government, it requires little or no evidence or speculation to arrive at a strong possibility, - and perhaps more \u2013 that its foreign legations not only film or photograph their nationals who demonstrate in public against the regime but have informers among expatriate oppositionist organisations who can name the people who are filmed or photographed. Similarly it does not require affirmative evidence to establish a probability that the intelligence services of such states monitor the internet for information about oppositionist groups. The real question in most cases will be what follows for the individual claimant. If, for example, any information reaching the embassy is likely to be that a claimant identified in a photograph is a hanger-on with no real commitment to the oppositionist cause, that will go directly to the issue flagged up by art 4(3)(d) of the [Qualification Directive 2004/83/EC].\u201d",
