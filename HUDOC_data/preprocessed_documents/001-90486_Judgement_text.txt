The case originated in an application (no. 17010/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Macedonian national, Ms Blagorodna Kangova (“the applicant”), on 27 April 2004. By letter of 27 December 2007 the applicant’s husband informed the Registry that she had died on 16 November 2007 and that he wished to pursue the application.
The Macedonian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs R. Lazareska Gerovska.
On 6 December 2007 the President of the Fifth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
On 4 February 1998 the applicant brought a civil claim against her employer, seeking compensation for unpaid salary and social security contributions. On 6 July 2000 the employer was divided into three separate companies (“the successors”).
Between 16 October 1998 and 10 September 2001 the first instance court scheduled fifteen hearings, none of which was adjourned on the applicant’s request. It ordered expert examination of the applicant’s claim and heard evidence from witnesses. The employer’s counter claim against the applicant was dismissed five months after it had been submitted. During the proceedings, the applicant made more specific claims on four occasions.
On 10 September 2001 the Gevgelija Court of First Instance allowed the applicant’s claim and ordered the successors jointly to pay her unpaid salary and to pay social security contributions to the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund. The total award amounted to 486, 557 Macedonian denars (MKD) (approximately 7, 940 euros) plus trial costs. This decision was served on the applicant on 26 June 2002.
On 11 July 2002 the successors appealed. On 7 October 2002 the applicant submitted her arguments in reply.
On 24 October 2002 the Gevgelija Court of First Instance dismissed the successors’ appeal as having been submitted out of time.
On 22 November 2002 the successors appealed, arguing that the first-instance court had wrongly calculated the time-limit. On 26 June 2003 the first-instance court ordered the successors to pay the court’s fees.
On 30 December 2003 the successors withdrew their appeal.
Between 1 April and 26 June 2004 the applicant requested the first-instance court to expedite the proceedings on three occasions.
On 15 July 2004 the Gevgelija Court of First Instance rejected the successors’ appeal as having been withdrawn.
On 21 September 2004 the first-instance court’s decision of 10 September 2001 became final.
Between March 2002 and June 2003 three separate sets of insolvency proceedings were initiated in respect of the successors. The last successor was liquidated in September 2003. The receiver was ordered to enforce the liquidation by public sale of that successor’s assets. The applicant filed a request to have her claim recognised only in respect of that successor. On 9 September 2003 the first-instance court partly allowed the applicant’s claim. No information has been provided as to what actions were taken in respect of the court’s sale order.
