As part of the project the drainage situation on the applicants\u2019 land was changed, not only with regard to the direction of the current, but also in the way in which the water was drained off. These works were carried out in 1988 in close co-operation between the Land Development Commission (Landinrichtingscommissie) and the competent water boards (waterschappen). From 1991 plots of land under cultivation by the applicants were regularly flooded and the yield of the plots subsequently diminished.

Therefore, in proceedings pursuant to this provision only disputes in respect of the amount of damages might be examined but the system of the Land Development Act left no room for the examination in these proceedings of the question of liability. Instead, the damage alleged by the applicants fell within the ambit of Article 212 \u00a7 1 (b) sub-paragraph 4 of the Land Development Act, which concerns the compensation for damage under the terms of the list of financial settlements (lijst der geldelijke regelingen). As the Regional Court anticipated that the applicants would raise the issue of compensation again once the list of financial settlements had been deposited for inspection (terinzagelegging), it submitted as its provisional view that it might be desirable for the applicants to instigate a preliminary hearing of witnesses (voorlopig getuigenverhoor) in view of the fact that the opinions of the expert and the Land Development Commission as to the reasons for the flooding were diametrically opposed.",

They sought compensation for damage as a result of flooding in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994, reimbursement of legal costs, of the costs incurred in the preliminary expert investigation and of the costs incurred in the determination of their damages, as well as legal interest. In support of the claim of the first applicant, it was further submitted that he had only narrowly escaped bankruptcy.

As it proved impossible to produce the requested data, the Land Development Commission, having consulted the Investigating Judge, suggested to the applicants in March 1997 that the damage resulting from the deterioration in land drainage be determined differently. In the absence of a response to this proposal from the applicants the Land Development Commission requested the Regional Court, at the end of 1997, to order the personal appearance of the parties in order to determine how the disputes should be resolved.

The scope of Article\u00a0129 \u00a7 2 Land Development Act was a limited one as it only concerned damage caused by preparatory land consolidation works, and only the amount of such damage and not the question of liability. In the instant case, the damage occurred more than two years after completion of preparatory works and the question thus arose whether it had been caused by those works. Furthermore, the factual and legal complexity of the case, militating against applicability of the remedy of Article 129 \u00a7 2, was demonstrated by the need for specialist expertise and the difficulties in the assignment of the exact scope of the experts\u2019 inquiry in the course of the proceedings before the Regional Court relating to the applicants\u2019 objections against the list of financial settlements.",

To their mind, no reason existed why the question of liability could not be examined within a procedure based on Article 129 \u00a7 2 Land Development Act.

Poland judgment of 30 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, p. 3376, \u00a7 47). At the same time, the Court observes, as did the Commission, that apart from the right to have civil rights determined within a reasonable time the instant case is also concerned with the right, equally guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1, of access to court (cf. the Golder v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21\u00a0February 1975, Series A no.\u00a018, p. 18, \u00a7 36).

When the applicants\u2019 claims were not examined in the proceedings they instituted pursuant to Article 129 \u00a7 2 Land Development Act in October 1993 with the Breda Regional Court, access to court became dependent on the moment at which the list of financial settlements would be deposited for inspection, an event beyond the control of the applicants. In the event, the list was deposited for inspection in October 1995 (see paragraph 13 above) and the applicants\u2019 objections containing their claims for compensation were referred to a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 after the Investigating Judge had failed to bring about a settlement on 23\u00a0October 1996 - over five years and two months after the applicants had first held the Land Development Commission liable.",

In addition, it would appear that in the present case it was the extent of the damage suffered by the applicants which proved the more complex matter to determine rather than the question of liability: this latter issue was decided by the Breda Regional Court in its interlocutory decisions of 14 and 28 January 1997, i.e. less than two months after the hearing before that court on 3\u00a0December 1996.",
