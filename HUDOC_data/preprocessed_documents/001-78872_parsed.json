Such failure prevented the applicant from recovering the claimed amounts in due time and created a situation of chronic uncertainty. Furthermore, it forced the applicant to appeal to the courts on a regular basis with identical claims. In the Court\u2019s view, it may be considered reasonable to require that such refusals be challenged in a single or a few cases.
