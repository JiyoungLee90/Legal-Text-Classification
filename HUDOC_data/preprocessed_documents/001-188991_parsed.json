The Constitutional Court may conclude that an applicant has not complied with the formal requirements for submitting a constitutional complaint (including the obligation to provide legal reasoning) and invoke section 20(5)(3) of that Law. Alternatively, it may find that the legal reasoning submitted is evidently insufficient for the claim in question to be allowed and rely on section 20(6) (see paragraph 31 above) \u2013 a rejection ground that appears to have a discretionary element (see paragraph 32 above). In light of the above, the Court attaches importance to the fact that the third constitutional complaint, just like the previous two, was rejected on the second ground (see paragraphs 16, 18 and 20 above). By contrast, in those cases where the Court has accepted a Government\u2019s nonexhaustion plea owing to insufficiently reasoned constitutional complaints, the Constitutional Court had concluded that the relevant complaint had been incompatible with section 19\u00b2 of the Law on the Constitutional Court (see Gubenko v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a06674/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09 and\u00a025, 3\u00a0November 2015, and Sv\u0101rpstons and Others v.

He argued that this resulted in unjustified difference with respect to men and women\u2019s respective right to prison leave on compassionate grounds, as owing to the prison regime they were subjected to male prisoners were not even eligible for such leave (see paragraphs 15, 17 and 19 above). Thus, the Court considers that in his third constitutional complaint the applicant expressly and in substance raised the discrimination complaint that he has now brought before the Court (compare Schwarzenberger v.

Thus, the Court considers that through the reasons given in its decisions, notably, when rejecting the third constitutional complaint, the Constitutional Court, at least partly, expressed its position on the substance of the applicant\u2019s discrimination complaint (compare G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0145, and Jalloh v.

Likewise, he does not complain that prisoners serving their sentence under a specific prison regime do not have a right to prison leave. Instead, his complaint concerns the fact that men and women who are convicted of the same crimes start serving their sentences under different prison regimes, leading to differences in the restrictions placed on their rights, particularly, a blanket ban on the male prisoner\u2019s right to request prison leave. Hence, the Court is not convinced that challenging before the Constitutional Court the provision setting out the rights and obligations applicable to certain prison regimes would have been an effective remedy for the specific complaint that the applicant has brought before the Court.",

It also drew the Court\u2019s attention to the opinion of the Ombudsperson emphasising the dangerous nature of the inmates to whom this restriction applied (see paragraph 14 above). Furthermore, in the light of the cases of Laduna v.

Also the Court has acknowledged that providing for the distinctive needs of women prisoners, particularly in relation to maternity, in order to accomplish substantial gender equality should not be regarded as discriminatory (see Alexandru Enache, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077). Accordingly, certain differences in the prison regimes that are applicable to men and women are acceptable and may even be necessary in order for substantive gender equality to be ensured.

The Court notes that this claim disregards the fact that the gravity of the regime is determined not only by the security level but also by the type of the prison. Male and female prisoners start serving their sentences in different types of prison, resulting in varied degrees of restrictions of their rights at the medium-security level. In particular, the Sentence Enforcement Code provides that all male prisoners convicted of serious and particularly serious crimes must be placed in closed prisons at the maximum-security level (see paragraphs 22-23 above). Furthermore, no prisoner serving his sentence in a closed prison is entitled to prison leave (see paragraph 25 above). They would acquire such a right only after being moved to a partly-closed prison\u00a0\u00a0a transfer they may become eligible for only after serving one half of the imposed sentence (see paragraph 23 above). In contrast, women prisoners who have been convicted of the same crimes are placed in this type of prison from the very beginning of their sentence (see paragraph 24 above).",

His request was not entertained exactly on the grounds of being placed at the medium-security level of the closed prison. Neither the domestic authorities, nor the Government have suggested that there was any other consideration that had informed this decision. Meanwhile, women prisoners in analogous circumstances, that is to say, convicted of the same crimes, given the same sentence, having served the same proportion of the sentence, and having progressed to the medium-security level, would have been eligible for such prison leave.",

The Government have not, however, submitted any data supporting this claim. In particular, the Court lacks information concerning the conduct of the relevant groups of prisoners, namely, men and women convicted of serious or especially serious crimes, with regard to the compliance with prison regime and, even more importantly, their conduct when released on prison leave.",

Finding otherwise would be tantamount to concluding that all male prisoners, when compared to women who have committed exactly the same offences, are so much more dangerous that no individualised assessment is even purposeful. Such an approach would be incompatible with the case-law of the Court emphasising the need for an individualised risk assessment of all detainees with regard to prison leave (see paragraph 91 below). The Court also refers here to CPT\u2019s repeated criticism of the Latvian \u201cprogressive sentence execution\u201d system under which all prisoners are required to spend a predetermined minimum amount of time at both the maximum- and the medium-security level since it is the prison authorities who should be responsible for determining security and regime requirements, on the basis of professionally agreed criteria and individual assessments of prisoners (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above).",

The Court notes that while Article 8 of the Convention does not guarantee a detained person an unconditional right to leave prison in order to attend the funeral of a relative, the domestic authorities are called upon to assess each such request on its merits (see Giszczak, cited above, \u00a7 36, and P\u0142oski, cited above, \u00a7 38). The Court has found a violation of that Article where the domestic authorities had failed to carry out a balancing exercise between the competing interests or had based their refusal solely on the grounds that the domestic law did not provide for such a right (see Cs\u00e1szy v. Hungary, no.\u00a014447/11, \u00a7 20, 21\u00a0October 2014, and Feldman v. Ukraine (no. 2), no.\u00a042921/09, \u00a7 35, 12\u00a0January 2012).",

While this principle applies regardless of the crime committed or the duration of the sentence imposed (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 111-18), it also applies irrespective of the prisoner\u2019s sex. The Court underlines that maintenance of family ties is an essential means of aiding social reintegration and rehabilitation of all prisoners, regardless of their sex (compare Khoroshenko, cited above, \u00a7 144). Furthermore, also prison leave is one of the means of facilitating social reintegration of all prisoners (see Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2002VIII, and Schemkamper, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031).",

This becomes particularly clear in \u00a7 90 of the majority judgment, where the analysis strays well beyond the question of prison leave to the CPT\u2019s criticism of the Latvian progressive sentence execution regime. However, the assessment which the Court must undertake in relation to an individual decision and a general legislative choice is qualitatively different.",

Had the legislature when adopting its general measure sought to weigh the competing interests or assess the proportionality of any restrictions placed? Yet the chamber did not question the respondent government in this regard and nowhere in the majority judgment did it seek to present, explain or test the legislative choices lying behind the Latvian Sentence Enforcement Code which it had decided to tackle in quite a broad manner. Attempts by the respondent government to explain and justify its differentiated prison regime, the differences between male and female prisoners and the different nature of the crimes committed by men and women are all dismissed rather cursorily. While the quality of the data presented by the respondent Government may not have been exemplary, it is surprising in a discrimination context to dismiss such data as being in any event insufficient.",
