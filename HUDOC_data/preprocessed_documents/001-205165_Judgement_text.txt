Relying on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (right to a fair trial) and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (protection of property), the applicant complained about the authorities’ failure to give a decision on the expropriation of his land for almost ten years, during which time he had been unable to make use of his property or obtain compensation.
The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Budapest. The applicant was represented by Mr Cech, a lawyer practising in Budapest.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z. Tallódi, of the Ministry of Justice.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
In December 1998 the applicant bought a plot of land registered under plot no. 2738 in the interior area of Leányfalu.
On 16 July 2002 the Central Danube Valley Directorate of Water Management (Közép-Duna-völgyi Vízügyi Igazgatóság) established a protection zone for the water reserve of the municipality of Leányfalu. According to the decision, the applicant’s property, together with other plots of land, formed part of the inner protection zone. The decision provided that no facility was allowed to be constructed that did not serve the purposes of the water reserve and no agricultural activity could be carried out in the inner protection zone. Moreover, the owners of the plots of land were obliged to allow the use of their property for any necessary maintenance work on the water reserve.
On 16 December 2002 the General Directorate of Water Management (Országos Vízügyi Igazgatóság) upheld the decision at first instance on the establishment of a protection zone for the municipality’s water reserve and rectified it to specify that the water-protection zone was the property of the Hungarian State, as represented by the Treasury Asset Management Directorate (Kincstári Vagyoni Igazgatóság). The manager of the water reserve remained Danube Regional Waterworks Inc. (Duna Menti Regionális Vízmű Zrt.), in accordance with the decision at first instance. The decision of 16 December 2002 also required that, pursuant to Article 15 § 1 of Government Decree no. 123/1997(VII.18.), if the owner of the protected water reserve was different from that of the land in the protection zone, the owner of the protected water reserve had the obligation to acquire ownership of the land in the protection zone, either through expropriation or through a sale and purchase agreement. The owners of the plots of land could initiate the purchase or expropriation themselves.
On 31 August 2003 the applicant sent a letter to the Treasury Asset Management Directorate, the trustee of the water reserve, asking it to make an offer. The Directorate transferred the request to Danube Regional Waterworks Inc., stating that it had no competence for the expropriation. On 9 October 2003 Danube Regional Waterworks Inc. likewise declared that it had no jurisdiction in the matter.
On 14 January 2004 the applicant requested the Pest County Regional Administrative Office (Pest Megyei Közigazgatási Hivatal) to initiate expropriation proceedings.
On 5 April 2004 the applicant offered to sell his plot of land to Danube Regional Waterworks Inc., which in turn informed the applicant that it was the Treasury Asset Management Directorate that had competence to enter into an agreement.
On 18 July 2005 the Pest County Regional Administrative Office issued a decision on the expropriation of the applicant’s land, assessing the amount of compensation at 23,805,800 Hungarian forints (HUF) (approximately 70,000 euros (EUR)). The decision obliged Danube Regional Waterworks Inc. to pay the full amount of compensation within thirty days.
On 20 December 2005 that decision was quashed in judicial review proceedings by the Pest County Regional Court, which remitted the case to the administrative authority on the grounds that the acquisition of the property fell within the competence of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Water Management.
On 30 March 2006 the Pest County Regional Administrative Office instructed the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Water Management to make an offer to expropriate the land. An application for judicial review lodged by the Ministry was dismissed on 18 October 2006 by the Pest County Regional Court.
On 7 March 2008 the Central Hungary Regional Administrative Office (Közép-Magyarország Közigazgatási Hivatal) gave its decision on the expropriation of the applicant’s plot of land and ordered the Ministry to pay compensation in the amount of HUF 31,721,500 (approximately EUR 100,000) to the applicant within sixty days. The decision set the date of handover as 15 May 2008. The Ministry paid the applicant the stated amount of compensation on 15 May 2008. The applicant handed over the property on 20 June 2008.
In the meantime the Ministry also applied for judicial review of the administrative decision of 7 March 2008. In the ensuing court proceedings, the Pest County Regional Court quashed the administrative decision, finding that it was National Asset Management Inc. (Magyar Nemzeti Vagyonkezelő Zrt) (the legal successor of the Treasury Asset Management Directorate) that had competence to proceed with the expropriation. Thus, the court remitted the case to the administrative authorities. That decision was upheld by the Supreme Court on 12 April 2010.
In the reopened administrative proceedings, on 24 May 2011 the Pest County Governmental Office (the legal successor of the Central Hungary Regional Administrative Office) ordered National Asset Management Inc. to serve notice of expropriation on the applicant within ninety days. National Asset Management Inc. complied with that obligation on 8 February 2012.
In the ensuing proceedings, the Pest County Governmental Office issued a decision on expropriation on 17 July 2012, setting the amount of compensation at HUF 62,356,000 (approximately EUR 200,000). Both the applicant and National Asset Management Inc. sought judicial review of that decision: in the case of the applicant, for the payment of interest since he had transferred the property on 20 June 2008; and in the case of National Asset Management Inc., for a reduction in the amount of compensation.
On 23 April 2013 the Budapest Regional Administrative and Labour Court remitted the case as regards the payment of interest to the administrative authority. In an interim measure it also suspended the enforcement of the compensation to the extent that it had been challenged by National Asset Management Inc. but declared the remaining amount of compensation enforceable.
In a final judgment of 20 May 2014, the court reduced the amount of compensation to HUF 46,989,558 (approximately EUR 137,000).
The applicant requested the enforcement of the compensation and the related interest on 25 August and 20 November 2014. The request was granted by the Pest County Governmental Office on 4 December 2014, which ordered National Asset Management Inc. to pay the remaining amount of compensation and interest owed with effect from 20 June 2008.
The full amount of compensation was paid to the applicant on 29 January 2015.
The relevant domestic law is set out in the Court’s judgment in Barcza and Others v. Hungary (no. 50811/10, §§ 23-25, 11 October 2016).
