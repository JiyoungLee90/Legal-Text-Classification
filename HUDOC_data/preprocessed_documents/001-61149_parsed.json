Moreover, although he had cited section 219 of the Judicature Act (LOPJ) in his application, he had failed to specify the precise ground for challenging the judge. The Government considered that the applicant\u2019s description of a professional whose qualifications were widely recognised and who exercised his profession outside the university as \u201cdependent\u201d because he gave a few lectures a month in return for annual emoluments of 7,200 euros was groundless and subjective. They considered that the applicant, given his duties at the university, could not credibly maintain that he had been unaware before 1998 that Judge J.B.L. was an associate professor at the university. They submitted that the statutory requirement that removal must be applied for as soon as the grounds for removal became known was intended to avoid procedural delaying tactics. To lodge an application for removal two years after the start of the proceedings at a time when almost all the evidence had already been adduced demonstrated either negligence or a desire to delay the conclusion of the trial. The Government insisted that the applicant must have been aware of the professional activity at issue. The Government further reiterated that it was for the domestic courts to interpret domestic legislation concerning the admissibility of an appeal and that the State enjoyed a margin of appreciation in that respect. The Government accordingly submitted that there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the applicant is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Ferrantelli and Santangelo v.

For the Court, the answer is yes. The judge was associate professor at the university and had had regular and close professional relations with the university for a number of years. Moreover, he had been receiving regular income from the university in respect of his teaching activities, and that income was not negligible (7,200 euros per annum according to the Government). J.B.L. had therefore concurrently performed the duties of a judge of the Higher Court of Justice of Castilla-La Mancha and those of an associate professor in receipt of income from the opposing party. In the Court\u2019s opinion, this situation could have raised legitimate fears in the applicant that Judge J.B.L. was not approaching his case with the requisite impartiality.",
