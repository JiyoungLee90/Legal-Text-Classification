There was, therefore, an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence under Article 8 of the Convention, which can only be justified if the conditions of the second paragraph of the provision are met. In particular, such interference must be \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, pursue a legitimate aim and be necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve that aim (see the Court\u2019s judgment in the Vala\u0161inas case cited above, 24.7.2001, ECHR 2001-VIII, \u00a7 128).",
