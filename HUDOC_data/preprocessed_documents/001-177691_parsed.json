The domestic courts had been wrong to rule that there was no longer any possibility to initiate criminal proceedings against C.T. In the applicant\u2019s view, the mere fact of a second trial taking place was per se a violation of his right to a fair trial, which had resulted from the domestic courts\u2019 refusal to suspend the proceedings against him until the end of the proceedings against C.T. The applicant had not participated in the hearings at the first-instance court as he had considered that the trial could not possibly take place without his criminal complaint having been heard first.

The principle in dubio pro libertatis in such cases had had the opposite result as it had worked at the expense of the defendant given that domestic courts tended to consider unproven accusations as false. The applicant had thus been deprived of the opportunity to prove his allegations with the assistance of the domestic authorities in charge of the investigation and had in the end been convicted of false accusation, perjury and slander without first having had the opportunity to prove the truthfulness of his criminal complaint against C.T.",

The initiation of criminal proceedings took place when someone was prosecuted, not just by the filing of a criminal complaint. In the present case therefore, where there had been no prosecution of C.T. following the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint, the conditions for a suspension or adjournment of the trial had not been met. The applicant had been aware of the above-mentioned provisions and their interpretation and therefore should have anticipated the rejection of his request for suspension or adjournment of the proceedings and should have prepared his defence accordingly. In any event, the Government pointed out that pursuant to Article 366 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, in case of suspension of the trial for defamation, there is a presumption that the fact for which proceedings for defamation were initiated is considered proven if there is a conviction and false if there is an acquittal. However, no such presumption is provided for by Article 59 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, even if the proceedings had been adjourned in the present case, the above-mentioned presumption would have concerned only the offence of slander and not the offences of false accusation and perjury. Even, therefore, in the hypothetical case of the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint having led to C.T.\u2019s conviction, the domestic court would have been bound only in respect of the offence of slander and would have freely assessed the decision in respect of the other offences.",

Although the domestic courts could not have convicted C.T. in the context of the criminal proceedings against the applicant, they had had the power to examine all the facts and evidence. If they had had any doubts regarding the truth of the applicant\u2019s allegations against C.T., they could have acquitted the applicant. The applicant had been given every procedural possibility to prove the truthfulness of his allegations against C.T. during the criminal proceedings against him and was trying erroneously to connect the fact that the proceedings had not been suspended with his final conviction, which had taken place following a legally conducted evidentiary procedure.

Rather, the applicant submitted that the domestic courts\u2019 refusal to suspend or adjourn the proceedings had been excessively formalistic in view of the Court\u2019s 2006 judgment, which had been ignored. He further argued that the fact that the trial for false accusation, perjury and slander had taken place had per se violated his right to a fair trial as he had not had the opportunity to first prove the truthfulness of his allegations against C.T., which constituted the basis of his conviction.",

That fact was found by the Court to constitute a breach of the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court under Article 6 of the Convention (Tsalkitzis, cited above). The Court additionally notes that even though the applicant did not appear before the first-instance court and therefore was convicted in absentia, he was able to put forward his request for a suspension or adjournment of the proceedings against him before the Court of Appeal. In decision no. 4512/2009 the Court of Appeal examined the applicant\u2019s request for suspension or adjournment and concluded that it should be rejected on the grounds that no criminal prosecution had been initiated against C.T. That meant therefore that there were no pending criminal proceedings which would justify the suspension of the proceedings against the applicant. It subsequently proceeded with the examination of witnesses and convicted the applicant of false accusation, perjury and slander. The Court of Cassation fully upheld the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusions (see paragraph 15 above).",

The Court considers that this interpretation of the applicable Greek law does not appear to be arbitrary; on the contrary it is supported by the wording of the said provisions. Indeed, it appears that the initiation of criminal proceedings was a prerequisite for suspending or adjourning the proceedings in question; however, there were no provisions in the domestic legislation to allow for the suspension of criminal proceedings in cases such as the applicant\u2019s, that is when a criminal complaint had not led to prosecution for reasons other than it being unfounded and, more specifically, owing to an act found to be in breach of the Convention.",

Croatia, no.\u00a028261/06, \u00a7 21, 15 January 2009), a lacuna in the domestic law cannot be a justification for failing to give full force to the Convention standards (see Yevdokimov and Others v. Russia, nos. 27236/05 and 10 others, \u00a7 31, 16\u00a0February 2016). However, the Court has consistently held in its case-law that its task is not to review the relevant law and practice in abstracto, but to determine whether the manner in which they were applied to, or affected, the applicant gave rise to a violation of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, \u00a7 164, ECHR\u00a02015). In particular, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court\u2019s task is to ascertain in concreto whether the proceedings as a whole, including the refusal of the applicant\u2019s request to suspend the proceedings, infringed the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention in view of the Court\u2019s judgment of 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Karata\u015f v.

It inferred from its reading of that judgment that the Court had identified the problem as the \u201cthe act of the President of Parliament of not putting the request to the Plenary of the Greek Parliament, which resulted, according to the judgment, in impeding the applicant\u2019s and the case\u2019s access to the competent criminal court\u201d (see paragraph 12 above). In view of the margin of appreciation available to the domestic authorities in the interpretation of the Court\u2019s judgments, and in the light of the principles governing the execution of judgments (see, mutatis mutandis, Emre v. Switzerland (no. 2), no. 5056/10, \u00a7 71, 11\u00a0October 2011, and Moreira Ferreira (no 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a095), the Court considers that it is unnecessary to express a position on the validity of that interpretation. It is sufficient for the Court to satisfy itself that the domestic court judgment was not arbitrary, that is to say that the judges of the Court of Appeal did not distort or misrepresent the judgment delivered by the Court (see Moreira\u00a0Ferreira (no 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a098 and compare with Bochan (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63-65, and Emre (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07175).",

In particular, it does not directly flow from the Court\u2019s 2006 judgment that that any future criminal proceedings against the applicant related to the same set of facts would have to be adjourned. In addition, the finding of a violation of Article\u00a06 of the Convention does not generally create a continuing situation and does not impose a continuing procedural obligation on the respondent State (see Moreira Ferreira (no 2), cited above, \u00a7 91 and contrast Jeronovi\u010ds v.

The Court does not lose sight of the fact that the proceedings against the applicant were closely linked with the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint against C.T. for which no criminal proceedings were initiated, in breach of the Convention. In that connection, it remains unclear to the Court whether the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint against C.T. could still lead to a prosecution following the end of his mandate, as the applicant maintained by relying on the Government\u2019s observations in Tsalkitzis (cited above), or if there is no prospect of reconsidering the issue and eventually initiating criminal proceedings, as was accepted by the Court of Appeal. However, the Court emphasises again that the subject matter of the present case refers to the proceedings against the applicant and whether his right to a fair trial was violated, not to his criminal complaint against C.T.

In order to do so, they had to examine if the allegations made by the applicant against C.T. were true, a matter closely linked with the charges against him, as the applicant himself admitted. The applicant was given the opportunity to examine witnesses, adduce documents, be represented by a lawyer and be heard by the domestic courts which examined his case. At the various stages of the proceedings he was able to submit the arguments he considered relevant to his case and an oral hearing was held both before the first-instance court and the Court of Appeal, which had full competence to assess all the relevant facts and evidence. The applicant was therefore afforded all the guarantees of a fair trial in the proceedings against him and had had a real opportunity to defend himself and be acquitted.",

He also left the hearing while his case was being examined and therefore did not testify himself. Under those circumstances, the Court is not convinced that the applicant was deprived of a real opportunity to prove the truthfulness of his allegations against C.T. in support of his defence. Admittedly, the domestic proceedings conducted could not have led to C.T.\u2019s conviction if the applicant had proven that his accusations were true. However, the applicant could have been acquitted if his guilt had not been established.",

However, the Court notes that any lack of assistance in that regard refers to the violation which was previously found by the Court in Tsalkitzis (cited above). In those proceedings the applicant was deprived of his right of access to a court on account of the fact that C.T.\u2019s immunity had not been lifted and he therefore did not benefit from the carrying out of criminal proceedings, including an investigation, for his complaints against C.T. In respect, however, of the criminal proceedings against the applicant, he was able to use all the means provided to him by domestic law and could have been acquitted. In reaching that conclusion, the Court attaches significant weight to the different level of proof required in the two set of proceedings: on the one hand, if criminal proceedings had been initiated against C.T. his guilt would have had to be proven beyond any reasonable doubt; on the other hand, in the proceedings against the applicant any reasonable doubt benefited him as a defendant, in accordance with the principle of in dubio pro reo, which is a specific expression of the presumption of innocence (see Vassilios\u00a0Stavropoulos v.\u00a0Greece, no. 35522/04, \u00a7 39, 27 September 2007). There is nothing in the material in the Court\u2019s possession to support the applicant\u2019s argument that he was not able to benefit from the above-mentioned principle because domestic courts tended to consider unproven accusations as false. On the contrary, the Court notes that the domestic courts examined all the relevant testimony and evidence at their possession in order to conclude that the applicant was guilty.",
