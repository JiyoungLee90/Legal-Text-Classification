France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7\u00a035, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0277A; Lala v. the Netherlands, 22\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7\u00a033, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0297A; and Van\u00a0Geyseghem v.

The Court observes that an arrest warrant had been issued against the applicant (see paragraph 12 above) and that Article\u00a0442(7) of the Code of Criminal Procedure contained an explicit duty for the accused to be present at the appellate hearing. Nevertheless, the above provision did not provide for an explicit restriction on the defence lawyer to represent a client who had failed to appear before the appellate court (ibid.). In any event, an accused cannot be obliged to surrender to custody in order to secure the right to be tried in conditions that comply with Article\u00a06 of the Convention (see Krombach v. France, no. 29731/96, \u00a7\u00a087, ECHR 2001II). It follows that the Government\u2019s objection of abuse must be dismissed.",
