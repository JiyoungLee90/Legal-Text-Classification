While there had been disagreement within the family about the amount of maintenance for and living conditions of the applicant\u2019s mother, there was no proof that the applicant did not care for her or had refused to provide for her. Having analysed the article in its entirety, the court found that the text of the article had gone beyond the views expressed by the family members. The article had contained unjustified conclusions provided in the form of statements of fact. The true information had been presented in an overly negative form. Moreover, the newspaper\u2019s employees \u2013 as professionals \u2013 should have treated the views expressed by the applicant\u2019s mother with a degree of criticism because they had been aware that proceedings for the removal of her legal capacity had been pending.",

The Riga Regional Court noted that at the time of broadcast the applicant\u2019s mother had had full legal capacity and thus could express her own opinion. She had been stripped of her legal capacity only on 4\u00a0January 2006. In addition, the Riga Regional Court dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant\u2019s allegation that her personal data had been broadcast without her consent when the newspaper article with her photograph was shown, accompanied by the subtitle: \u201cIrina Rodina, the elder daughter\u201d. In that regard, the Riga Regional Court noted that the applicant\u2019s claim in respect of the newspaper article had already been dismissed by the appellate court and that proceedings on points of law had been refused (see paragraphs\u00a021 and 25 above), but provided no further reasons.",

The applicant argued that the appeal court had not assessed the various factors noted by the Court in those cases, or the impugned feature as a whole. When examining her claim about the disclosure of personal data, the appellate court had not applied the relevant provisions of the Personal Data Protection Law. She noted that the appellate court had referred to the civil proceedings concerning the publication of the article, but had failed to take into account that her name had not been disclosed in that article.",

In particular, the applicant does not appear to have claimed that her private life was breached specifically because of the broadcasting of her full name, family photograph and telephone conversation with the journalist or that the broadcasting of that data was otherwise unlawful. Instead, her claim was centred on the retraction of statements which had offended her honour and dignity (see paragraphs 33-34, 42 above, and contrast with the applicant\u2019s claim in the first set of civil proceedings as concerns the family photograph, see paragraph 12 above). Although the applicant attempted to raise the abovementioned aspects of the right to private life before the appellate court, her submissions in that regard were considered to be submitted belatedly and were not examined (see paragraph 51 above). Consequently, the Court is precluded from examining whether her right to private life was breached on account of the broadcasting of her full name, family photograph and telephone conversation with the journalist because the domestic courts in the second set of civil proceedings considered that these aspects had not been properly raised before them. That being said, the Court is not precluded, for the reasons set out below, from taking the above-mentioned aspects of the right to private life into account to the extent that they are intrinsically linked with the other parts of the contested statements, and thus relevant for the assessment of damage to the honour and dignity as claimed by the applicant and as examined by the domestic courts in the second set of civil proceedings.",

While the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 98). It is then for the Court to determine whether the State, in fulfilling its positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention, has struck a fair balance between the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her private life and the right of the opposing party to freedom of expression protected by Article 10 of the Convention. Moreover, paragraph 2 of Article 10 recognises that freedom of expression may be subject to certain restrictions necessary to protect the reputation or rights of others.",

The family photograph in the present case merely showed all the family members.
