The Court does not find that the lack of any time-limit in the decision is a ground for considering it unfair. Nor is it correct to consider the decision unfair because the accusations made against [the applicant] might lead to charges being filed against him. A punishable offence may justify a change to a more severe security measure, but this decision is then based on the aims of the security measures and is not considered as a punishment. If the instant case is pursued and [the applicant] convicted, the question whether it is fair to use both placement for a time in a security ward and punishment will have to be considered when sentence is passed. In such circumstances it will be of importance that [the applicant] has had to undergo the change of security measures. This can be compared with the opposite situation referred to in Article 39 \u00a7 5 of the Penal Code.\"",

If this possibility of having a further review by a court did not exist, the alternative would be to allow an authorisation period sufficiently long for the court to feel reasonably certain that there would be no further need to impose security measures after it expired. Under the present system the courts do not have to determine the period on the basis of such considerations and need only specify, initially, a period which in general will probably be shorter than would have been the case if there had been no possibility of having a further review.\"",

The applicant claimed that the Norwegian courts did not have the power to order his release, should they find his detention \"unlawful\": the courts could only order the administrative authorities to act in a certain way if the law contained explicit provisions as to the decision to be taken and nothing was left to the discretion of the authorities concerned; however, such was not the case with regard to the authorities\u2019 obligations under Article 39 of the Penal Code. The Commission agreed with this conclusion, albeit mainly on the basis of what it perceived to be uncertainty regarding the legal position in .",

An order for immediate release could be based on Article 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure, under which a court may, on petition, decide that a judgment can be enforced before it becomes final if \"special circumstances so require\" (see paragraph 44 above). The Norwegian courts would certainly consider this provision to be applicable if a person was deprived of his liberty without the conditions under Article 39 \u00a7 1 of the Penal Code being fulfilled, a fact that would also be in breach of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention, which is a relevant source of law (see paragraph 42 above).",

Considering that in this case the need to impose security measures had been confirmed by the courts on a number of occasions, that the applicant\u2019s mental state had been fairly stable over a long period and had also been such as to necessitate deprivation of liberty at short intervals, and lastly that the applicant contributed to some extent to the delay in the Oslo City Court, the Government maintained that the proceedings had been conducted speedily for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (art. 5-4). In addition, they claimed that there was every reason to believe that the City Court would have delivered judgment immediately if it had found his detention to be unlawful.",

The Court observes that the issues submitted to a court in the context of such challenges of the \"lawfulness\" of a deprivation of liberty as are the subject of this case (see paragraph 51 above), are often of a more complex nature than those which have to be decided when a person detained in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) is brought before a judge or other judicial officer as required by paragraph 3 (art. 5-3) of the Article. Indeed, the notion of \"promptly\" (aussit\u00f4t) in the latter provision indicates greater urgency than that of \"speedily\" (\u00e0 bref d\u00e9lai) in Article 5 \u00a7 4 (art. 5-4) (see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, Series A no. 145-B, p. 32, \u00a7 59). Even so, a period of approximately eight weeks from the filing of summons to judgment does appear, prima facie, difficult to reconcile with the notion of \"speedily\". However, in order to reach a firm conclusion, the special circumstances of the case have to be taken into account (see, inter alia, the Sanchez-Reisse judgment of 21 October 1986, Series A no. 107, p. 20, \u00a7 55).",

A further period of somewhat less than two weeks was allegedly needed to \"put the case on the right track\". However, once contact was established with the applicant\u2019s lawyer, the applicant did not complain of any undue delay in fixing the date of the hearing. Following the hearing, a further period of three weeks elapsed before the court\u2019s judgment was pronounced.",

It is incumbent on the judicial authorities to make the necessary administrative arrangements, even during a vacation period, to ensure that urgent matters are dealt with speedily and this is particularly necessary when the individual\u2019s personal liberty is at stake.
