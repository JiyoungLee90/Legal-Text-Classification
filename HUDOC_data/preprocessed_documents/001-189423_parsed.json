For the purposes of the decision at issue, the Regional Court was required to determine whether there was at least a significant state of suspicion against the late accused (see paragraph 15 above). It made that determination after it had, acting as the trial court, found the late accused guilty after a trial of 91 days, setting out its assessment of the factual and legal aspects of the case in a judgment of 220\u00a0pages (see paragraph 6 above). Therefore, having regard to the nature and context of the Regional Court\u2019s decision, the Court finds that it does not raise, in the circumstances of the present case, an issue under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention that the Regional Court found there to be a significant state of suspicion against the late accused, based on the trial judgment against him (compare and contrast the cases of Cleve, cited above, and Yassar Hussain v. the United Kingdom, no. 8866/04, ECHR 2006III, in which the applicants had been acquitted by the trial court).",

These statements could be understood as attributing responsibility to the defence for the absence of a final guilty verdict against the late accused. However, again having regard to the nature and context of the decision, the Court notes that domestic law required there to be additional factors, besides the significant state of suspicion, rendering the refusal to reimburse the accused\u2019s necessary expenses equitable in the event of a discontinuation of the proceedings (see paragraph 15 above). It thus understands the statement at issue to relate primarily to the existence of such an additional factor, as required by domestic law, which is taken into account in the exercise of discretion for determining who is to bear the accused\u2019s necessary expenses.",

Thereby, the Regional Court made it unequivocally clear that its decision was based on a state of suspicion against the late accused, but that it did not contain a finding or allocation of guilt. The Court of Appeal referred to that part of the decision to conclude that it was compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and the standards following from the judgment in the case of N\u00f6lkenbockhoff (cited above) (see paragraph 11 above).",

These decisions thus did not infringe the presumption of innocence",
