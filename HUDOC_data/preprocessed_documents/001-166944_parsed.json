Assessing the quality of the applicant\u2019s medical assistance, the experts noted that since August 2012 the applicant had only received symptomatic treatment with anaesthetics for his kidney cancer. No other cancer-related treatment had been given until December 2014. The experts drew up a list of various established and widely applied medical procedures, including immunotherapy, extensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which should have been provided to a patient such as the applicant to improve his condition and extend his life. The experts stressed that even after the growing metastasis in the applicant\u2019s brain was discovered in December 2014 the prison doctors had not considered the possibility of radiotherapy. The experts noted that the drug \u201creodoron\u201d mentioned in his medical record did not exist. They further criticised other aspects of his medical assistance, including the frequency and direction of important medical examinations. The experts concluded that the applicant\u2019s life expectancy was critically low.

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2005\u2011I). Although the object of Article 34 is essentially that of protecting an individual against any arbitrary interference by the authorities, it does not merely compel States to abstain from such interference. In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there are positive obligations inherent in Article 34 requiring the authorities to furnish all the necessary facilities to make possible the proper and effective examination of applications. Such an obligation will arise in situations where applicants are particularly vulnerable (see Naydyon v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a016474/03, \u00a7 63, 14 October 2010; Savitskyy v.

Russia, no. 14743/11, \u00a7 222, 2 October 2012). The Court cannot emphasise enough the special importance attached to interim measures in the Convention system. Their purpose is not only to enable an effective examination of the application to be carried out, but also to ensure that the protection afforded to the applicant by the Convention is effective. Such measures subsequently allow the Committee of Ministers to supervise the execution of the final judgment. Interim measures thus enable the State concerned to discharge its obligation to comply with the final judgment of the Court, which is legally binding by virtue of Article 46 of the Convention (see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, \u00a7 125; Shamayev and Others v.\u00a0Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, \u00a7 473, ECHR 2005\u2011III; Aoulmi v.\u00a0France, no. 50278/99, \u00a7\u00a0108, ECHR 2006\u2011I; and Ben Khemais v.\u00a0Italy, no. 246/07, \u00a7\u00a082, 24\u00a0February 2009).",

The vital role played by interim measures in the Convention system not only underpins their binding legal effect on the States concerned, as upheld by the established case-law, but also requires that the utmost importance be attached to the question of the States Parties\u2019 compliance with the Court\u2019s indications in that regard (see, inter alia, the firm position on that point expressed by the States Parties in the Izmir Declaration and by the Committee of Ministers in Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)83 in the above-mentioned case of Ben Khemais). Any laxity on this question would unacceptably weaken the protection of the core rights in the Convention and would not be compatible with its values and spirit (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July\u00a01989, \u00a7\u00a088, Series A no. 161); it would also be inconsistent with the fundamental importance of the right of individual petition and, more generally, undermine the authority and effectiveness of the Convention as a constitutional instrument of European public order (see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 100 and 125, and, mutatis mutandis, Loizidou v.\u00a0Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March\u00a01995, \u00a7\u00a075, Series A no. 310).",

That expert evidence was necessary to decide whether, as the applicant argued, his life and limb were at real risk as a result of the alleged lack of requisite medical care in detention. In addition, the Court was concerned with the contradictory nature of the evidence collected by the applicant and submitted with his application and his request for an interim measure, and the information submitted by the Government in response to the request sent by the Court in August 2014 (see paragraphs  and  above).

The main aim of the interim measure, as indicated by the Court in the present case  and the Government did not claim to be unaware of this \u2013 was to prevent the applicant\u2019s exposure to inhuman and degrading suffering in view of his poor health and his remaining in a correctional colony that was  according to him \u2013 unable to ensure that he received adequate medical assistance.

The aim of the three medical examinations, the results of which were set out in those reports, was to compare the applicant\u2019s medical condition with the exhaustive list of illnesses provided for by the Government decree no. 54 of 6 February 2004, and which could have warranted his release. At no point during the examinations did the doctors from the panels assess the applicant\u2019s state of health independently of that list or evaluate whether his illness, given its current manifestation, nature and duration, required his transfer to a specialist hospital. Nor did they apply their minds to the quality of the medical care he had been receiving while in detention, or to the conditions in which he was being detained.

However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability, but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specific nature of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention  determines its approach to issues of evidence and proof. In proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by a free evaluation of all the evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. In accordance with its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specific nature of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7 88, 23 February 2012, and the cases cited therein).",

They should also allow taking into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the nature of the facts at issue and the difficulty for the parties to present evidence in support of their submissions. The Court reiterates its case-law under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention to the effect that where the events at issue lie within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries, damage and death occurring during that detention. The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a023657/94, \u00a7 85, ECHR 1999-IV; Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000-VII; and Oleg Nikitin v. Russia, no.\u00a036410/02, \u00a7\u00a045, 9\u00a0October 2008). In this case, in the absence of such an explanation the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the respondent Government (see, for instance, Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, \u00a7\u00a0274, 18\u00a0June 2002, and Buntov v. Russia, no. 27026/10, \u00a7 161, 5\u00a0June 2012).",

Furthermore, medical treatment provided within prison facilities must be appropriate, that is, at a level comparable to that which the State authorities have committed themselves to provide to the population as a whole.

The medical supervision afforded to him was insufficient to maintain his health. Moreover, he was prescribed a drug which did not exist (see paragraphs  and  above). There was no thorough evaluation of his condition. The prison medical staff did not take any steps to deal with the rapid progress of his illness. The Court is also particularly concerned with the fact that despite the District Court\u2019s decision authorising the applicant\u2019s transfer to the correctional colony, he still remained in an ordinary correctional colony without any specialist medical care (see paragraph  above). Lastly, the Court considers particularly noteworthy the Government\u2019s argument, raised in their letter of 4 December 2014, that the applicant\u2019s condition was satisfactory and that there was no threat to his life given the quality of the medical care afforded to him. In their assessment of the applicant\u2019s state of health they relied on certificates issued by the colony administration at the end of November 2014. Without placing too much emphasis on the quality or credibility of the information submitted by the detention authorities, the Court again notes that the applicant\u2019s death occurred approximately four months after they had drafted their certificates.",
