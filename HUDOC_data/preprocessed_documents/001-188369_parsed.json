The Court notes, in particular, that the case was eight times remitted to the first-instance court for a fresh examination, as the lower court incorrectly applied the substantive and procedural law (see paragraphs\u00a012-22 above). The Court reiterates that the right to have one\u2019s claim examined within a reasonable time would be devoid of all sense if domestic courts examined a case numerous times, by shifting it from one court to another, even if at the end the accumulated length of proceedings did not appear particularly excessive (see Svetlana Orlova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a04487/04, \u00a7\u00a047, 30 July 2009, and Palacheva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 39814/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a068-69, 19 June 2014).

The Court has no doubt that the company performed a public function. The Court notes in addition that, even though the GUP was a party to the proceedings, the title to the flat was transferred to the State, the owner of the assets put under the company\u2019s economic control. On the other hand, turning to the authorities\u2019 actual involvement in the company\u2019s activities, the Court observes that, unlike in Liseytseva and Maslov (cited above), neither the Government nor the applicant alleged that the State had in any way interfered with the enterprise\u2019s business at the time of the events. Unlike in Liseytseva and Maslov, the debtor company in the present case was not insolvent or subject to liquidation at the time of the enforcement of the judicial award in the applicant\u2019s favour.

It was not disputed by the applicant that during nine months of that period the writ of execution remained with him (see paragraph\u00a026 above), and the enforcement proceedings were opened, on his request, on 2\u00a0November 2007 only (ibid.). The Court has already found that if the applicant for any reason obtains himself the writ of execution from the trial court, it would appear logical to require that he submits it to the competent authority with a view to enforcement of the judgment (see, mutatis mutandis, Gadzhikhanov and Saukov v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 10511/08 and 5866/09, \u00a7\u00a026, 31\u00a0January 2012). In the absence of any explanation from the parties, the authorities cannot to be held responsible for the applicant\u2019s unexplained failure to follow the domestic enforcement procedure and, notably, for his deliberate refusal to provide the writ of enforcement (see, mutatis mutandis, Gadzhikhanov and Saukov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 27-31). Accordingly, the period between early February 2007 and 2\u00a0November 2007 is attributable to the applicant. The Court further accepts the Government\u2019s argument that the period after 25\u00a0September 2008 (see paragraph\u00a025 above) was also attributable to the applicant, as he failed to provide his correct banking details and only replied to the bailiffs\u2019 repeated requests for an update in February 2009. The remaining period did not exceed ten months, which does not amount to a breach of the Convention requirements (see, mutatis mutandis, Belkin and Others v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no.\u00a014330/07, 5\u00a0February 2009).",
