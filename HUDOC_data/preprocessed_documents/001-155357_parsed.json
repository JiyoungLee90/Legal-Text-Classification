The aforementioned procedure is different from the ordinary criminal procedure. Its main purpose is exerting control over a prosecutor\u2019s orders to discontinue criminal proceedings; only in certain circumstances does it facilitate the institution of a new round of trial proceedings. The procedure in question has a legitimate aim, namely to allow applicants the legal means to obtain a review by a domestic court of orders issued by prosecutors\u2019 offices. In addition, there is a reasonable proportionality between this aim and the means employed, because the courts are given the opportunity to save time and resources in respect of those cases which do not raise any issues under the substantive or procedural criminal law, therefore allowing them the opportunity to focus on relevant legal matters brought before them.",

It will be violated if a statement by a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects the opinion that he is guilty, unless he has been proved so according to law, in particular where he has had the opportunity to exercise his rights to mount a defence (see M\u00fcller v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a054963/08, \u00a7 46, 27 March 2014; Capetti and Maimut v.\u00a0Romania (dec.), no.\u00a013043/05 and 23408/08, \u00a7\u00a7 77 and 78, 15 May 2012 and Allen v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 25424/09, \u00a7 93, ECHR 2013). It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards that person as guilty (see Daktaras v. Lithuania, no.\u00a042095/98, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2000-X; A.L. v.\u00a0Germany, no. 72758/01, \u00a7 31, 28\u00a0April 2005; and Grabtchouk v. Ukraine, no.\u00a08599/02, \u00a7 42, 21\u00a0September 2006). Whether a statement by a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Grabtchouk, cited above, \u00a7 42). The scope of Article 6 \u00a7 2 is moreover not limited to pending criminal proceedings, but extends to judicial decisions taken after a prosecution has been discontinued or after an acquittal (see Capetti and Maimut, cited above, \u00a7 77).",

However, the Court notes that in the present case the prosecutor office\u2019s decision terminating the criminal proceedings against the applicant was couched in terms which left no doubt as to their view that the applicant had committed the offences. In particular, the prosecutor\u2019s office in its decision of 21 March 2005 held that the applicant was guilty of the impugned offences and the Sibiu District Court and the Bac\u0103u County Court also indicated that the applicant had committed the offences. The proceedings before the domestic courts were not ordinary criminal proceedings as the formal outcome was that the proceedings were discontinued. Accordingly, it cannot be concluded that the proceedings before those courts resulted, or were intended to result in the applicant being \u201cproved guilty according to law\u201d. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s and the domestic courts\u2019 express statements in respect of the applicant\u2019s guilt constituted an infringement of the presumption of innocence.",

The Sibiu District Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the prosecutor\u2019s decision. In a final judgment, the Bac\u0103u County Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law. The County Court held, on the basis of the available documentary, testimonial and expert evidence, that the applicant had committed the offences of complicity in fraud and forgery of privately signed documents, but concluded that the case was correctly found to be time-barred.

Germany, 25 August 1987, \u00a7 36, Series A no.\u00a0123; N\u00f6lkenbockhoff v. Germany, 25 August 1987, \u00a7 37, Series A no.\u00a0123; and Lutz v. Germany, 25 August 1987, \u00a7 60, Series A no. 123). All three cases, as was clearly observed in Allen v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no.\u00a025424/09, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2013) concerned prior criminal proceedings which had ended in discontinuance, rather than acquittal. In finding no violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 in those cases, the Court explained that the domestic courts had described a \u201cstate of suspicion\u201d and that their decisions did not contain any finding of guilt.",

                        "content": "5.\u00a0\u00a0In the subsequent case of Sekanina v. Austria (25 August 1993, Series\u00a0A no. 266-A), the Court drew a distinction between cases where the criminal proceedings had been discontinued and those where a final acquittal judgment had been handed down, clarifying that the voicing of suspicions regarding an accused\u2019s innocence was conceivable as long as the conclusion of criminal proceedings had not resulted in a decision on the merits of the accusation, but that it was no longer admissible to rely on such suspicions once an acquittal had become final. Thus the Sekanina principle appears to seek to limit the principle established in Minelli to cases where criminal proceedings have been discontinued. The distinction made in Sekanina between discontinuance and acquittal cases has been applied in most of the cases concerning acquittal judgments which followed Sekanina (see, for example, Rushiti v. Austria, no. 28389/95, 21 March 2000, \u00a7 31; Lamanna v. Austria, no. 28923/95, \u00a7 38, 10 July 2001; Weixelbraun v.\u00a0Austria, no. 33730/96, 20 December 2001, \u00a7 25; Tendam v. Spain, no.\u00a025720/05, \u00a7 36, 13 July 2010, \u00a7\u00a7 36-41; but compare and contrast Del\u00a0Latte v. the Netherlands, no. 44760/98, \u00a7 30, 9 November 2004, and Bok v.\u00a0the Netherlands, no. 45482/06, \u00a7\u00a7 37-48, 18 January 2011).",

It has also indicated that the operative part of an acquittal judgment must be respected by any authority referring directly or indirectly to any criminal responsibility of the interested party. However, the case at hand can be distinguished from those cases in that the voicing of (particularly strong) suspicion is here part of the reasoning in the discontinuance decision itself, while it is subsequently repeated by the courts that are called upon to review the prosecutor\u2019s decision.",

                        "content": "7.\u00a0\u00a0To my mind Article 6 \u00a7 2 should not prevent prosecutors from voicing their conviction concerning the guilt of an applicant when they acknowledge that further examination of the case has become time-barred. But they should be careful in choosing their wording in order to avoid presenting their (professional) conviction as if it were equivalent to a case proven in court. Courts may confirm that the reason for discontinuing a case is merely technical in nature. By doing so they may thereby indicate a point of reference relevant to subsequent proceedings dealing with compensation claims on behalf of the accused person. However, the reasoning in such a context is a delicate matter. In the case of Schreurs v. the Netherlands ((dec.), no.\u00a073058/13, 14 April 2015), a court had acquitted the applicant on technical grounds, noting that a different characterisation of the facts by the prosecution would have led to a different result. The applicant did not challenge that reasoning but came to our Court only when the domestic court in subsequent proceedings refused to award him compensation for having been in pre-trial detention, in support of which the court merely cited the reasoning underlying the earlier acquittal. Whatever the merits of that applicant\u2019s complaint concerning a violation of the right to be presumed innocent, his application was lodged too late, more than six months after the acquittal judgment containing the alleged voicing of suspicion.",

That is why I do agree with the majority in finding a breach of that right in the present case. Although I would have preferred to conclude that the finding of a violation sufficiently compensates the applicant, I see no reason to dissent on such a secondary issue where the majority think it more appropriate to grant a modest monetary award.",
