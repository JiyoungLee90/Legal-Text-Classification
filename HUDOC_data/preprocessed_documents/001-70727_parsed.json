In the present case the global duration of the proceedings, which lasted one year and six months, cannot be said to have exceeded a \u201creasonable time\u201d. As to the complaint concerning the assessment of evidence, the Court reiterates that Article 6 does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts.
