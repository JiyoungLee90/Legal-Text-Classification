Since the applicant had failed to declare the jewellery, she was taken to the airport police station.

However, the Court is not assessing the responsibility of Greece for the lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), but the responsibility of Moldova for that detention, that is the\u00a0international arrest warrant issued by Interpol at the request of the Moldovan authorities for the purpose of enforcing the detention order of 19 June 2009. As indicated above, the applicant takes issue only with the lawfulness of the detention order which was at the origin of her deprivation of liberty in Greece, that is with the lawfulness of the detention order issued by the Botanica District Court on 19 June 2009. It is without doubt that the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty in Greece was a direct consequence of that detention order and that no deprivation of liberty in Greece would have been possible in the absence of that order issued by the Moldovan courts. This fact was expressly noted by the Greek courts in their decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s extradition, where they made specific reference to the Botanica District Court\u2019s decision on 19 June 2009 (see paragraph 15 above).",

Therefore, as regards Moldova, the applicant\u2019s detention is to be examined under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention. In reaching this conclusion the Court bears in mind the principle according to which \u201c[t]he Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective\u201d (see Airey v.

It was after her leaving the country that the authorities initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant. The Court further notes the applicant\u2019s submission, which the Government did not contest, that she had given the police her contact information in Greece at a meeting with them after the events of 15\u00a0September 2008. In spite of that, the prosecutors issued the summons to her Moldovan address in Causeni. Moreover, according to the material in the case-file, the prosecutors contacted the applicant\u2019s adult son and a relative of hers but failed to ask them to inform the applicant that she had to appear before them and made no attempt to follow up the information that she was in Greece.

That was certainly not the case in the present case where the authorities chose to take a very formalistic approach to the problem of summoning the applicant and when the applicant did not show up they hastily concluded that she was absconding. The Court notes that this appears to be contrary to Article 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which states in clear terms that detention pending trial can be imposed only when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect could abscond from the investigating authorities (see paragraphs 17 above). It also appears to be contrary to Article 238 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which states that if the person to be summoned declared another address during the proceedings, then the summons shall be sent to that address (see paragraph 18 above).",
