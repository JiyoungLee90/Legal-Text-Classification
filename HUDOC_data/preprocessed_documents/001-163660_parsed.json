The Social Tribunal firstly outlined that the facts of the case had to be assessed in the light of the newly enacted Law no. 13/2005, which was already in force and deemed constitutional by the tribunal. As to the merits, the Social Tribunal observed that the issue at stake was whether the applicant, as the surviving partner of a same-sex relationship that ended (following his partner\u2019s death) before the entry into force of Law\u00a0no.\u00a013/2005, had the right to a survivor\u2019s pension. The Social Tribunal then reiterated that, according to the well-established domestic case-law, surviving partners of unmarried couples were not entitled to a survivor\u2019s pension under section 174 of the General Social Security Act, marriage being a constitutive element to access any such social-security benefit; that the applicant had been prevented from marrying his partner because same-sex marriage had not been recognised in domestic law at the time his partner died; that the social security administration had relied on the fact that the couple had not married to refuse the applicant a survivor\u2019s pension; and that it was evident that after the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005, surviving spouses of same-sex marriages were entitled to survivors\u2019 pensions on the same footing as survivors of different-sex marriages.",

The Social Tribunal drew attention in this regard to the provisions and the explanatory memorandum of Law no. 13/2005 to contend that this new legislation had a very strong egalitarian purpose, and that from the date it entered into force, that is to say 3 July 2005, all legal provisions concerning marriage should be interpreted on the basis of the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005 as applying fully to same-sex marriage (see paragraph\u00a035 below).

The court referred to constitutional case-law dating from 1994 according to which the requisite of heterosexuality for the purposes of marriage was fully constitutional and that it was within the margin of appreciation of the public authorities to treat heterosexual marriages more favourably than homosexual partnerships. In this connection, the court maintained that despite the reference in the preamble of Law no. 13/2005 (see paragraph 35 below) to the discriminatory treatment to which homosexuals had traditionally been subjected on account of their sexual orientation, the aim of Parliament in passing that law was merely to respond to a new social reality and award homosexuals the right to marry, but not to protect same-sex partnerships which had already ended before its enactment.",

Firstly, that provision could not be considered as among the provisions to which the first additional provision of Law\u00a0no.\u00a013/2005 referred. Additional provision no. 10 (2) was, as the Constitutional Court had established, of a provisional or transitory nature and had been envisaged for those specific cases in which one of the partners had died before the entry into force of Law no. 30/1981. It had not been intended to govern future situations. Secondly, that provision had been envisaged for a totally different situation from that of the applicant. Additional provision\u00a0no.\u00a010\u00a0(2) of Law no. 30/1981 was aimed at guaranteeing a survivor\u2019s pension to those heterosexuals who had been prevented from marrying their out-of wedlock partner because divorce had not been legal at the time of the latter\u2019s death. The inability to remarry for those affected by additional provision\u00a0no. 10\u00a0(2) of Law no. 30/1981 was based on the fact that divorce was not permitted at the time. The institution of marriage was open to them in their capacity as heterosexuals. On the contrary, same-sex couples were absolutely prevented from marrying before Law no. 13/2005 since the institution of marriage was until then restricted to heterosexual couples.",

Moreover, the option reflected in this law has some constitutional foundations that should be taken into account by the legislature. Hence, the promotion of effective equality between citizens in the free development of their personality (Articles 9 \u00a7 2 and 10 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution), the protection of freedom in so far as forms of coexistence are concerned (Article 1 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution) and the establishment of a framework of real equality and enjoyment of rights without discrimination on account of sex, opinion or any other personal or social condition or circumstance (Article 14 of the Constitution), are values established in the Constitution that should be reflected in the rules defining the status of citizenship in a free, pluralistic and open society. From this broad perspective, the regulation of marriage that is hereby established aims at conforming to the manifest reality of Spanish society, in which changes have been brought about in that society with the involvement of groups seeking total equality for all in the enjoyment of rights, regardless of their sexual orientation; this is a reality that demands a framework establishing rights and duties for all those who formalise their partner relationships. In this context, this Law allows marriage to be celebrated between persons of the same or different sex, with full and equal rights and duties, irrespective of its composition. Accordingly, the effects of marriage, which are wholly maintained in respect of the objective make-up of the institution, shall be the same in all spheres, regardless of the sex of the spouses; this includes, amongst other areas, the sphere of social rights and benefits as well as the possibility of being a party to adoption proceedings.",

It stated that \u201cin the same way as a heterosexual couple cohabiting, a partnership between persons of the same biological sex is not a legally regulated institution, nor is its establishment embodied in a constitutional right; quite the opposite to marriage between a man and a woman, which is a constitutional right (Article 32 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution)\u201d. The court upheld the constitutionality of the heterosexual principle as the defining criterion of a marital bond. Consequently, it accepted that the public powers granted privileged status to a family union consisting of a man and a woman, as opposed to a homosexual union. The Constitutional Court relied on the case-law of the Court under Article 12 of the Convention (Rees v. the United Kingdom, 17 October 1986, \u00a7\u00a011, Series\u00a0A no. 106, and Cossey v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1990, \u00a7\u00a022, Series A no.\u00a0184).",

The Constitutional Court was of the view that the difference in treatment established by the law, based on the requirement of having had children together, led to a disproportionate result by denying certain survivors of unmarried couples (homosexual and heterosexual couples who had not had their own or adopted children together, for legal or biological reasons) access to the protection provided by the pension. It therefore concluded that the difference in treatment lacked an objective and reasonable justification. The court considered that it was not necessary to examine whether the impugned provision was also discriminatory on grounds of sexual orientation. As to the effects of this ruling, the Constitutional Court indicated that the fact of declaring unconstitutional the requirement of having had children together, as established by the third additional provision of Law no. 40/2007, did not mean that those persons who had not filed a claim for a survivor\u2019s pension within the deadline of twelve months from the entry into force of the law could now do so.

The Constitutional Court examined this issue in the context of an amparo appeal lodged by an appellant who complained, under Article 14 of the Constitution, about the denial of a survivor\u2019s pension following the death of his homosexual partner in 2002 (before the entry into force of Law no. 40/2007). The court referred to the margin of appreciation of the legislature in the area of social security rights and to the Court\u2019s decision in Mata Estevez v. Spain (cited above), where the Court had accepted that the exclusion of same-sex couples from the survivor\u2019s pensions social security scheme was not in breach of Article 8, taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention. In the view of the Constitutional Court, it was solely for the legislature to decide when to extend the right to a survivor\u2019s pension to other situations, and to what extent to do so. This is what the Spanish legislature had done by introducing same-sex marriage in 2005 (thus allowing same-sex couples to enter into marriage and benefit from survivors\u2019 pensions) and by extending in 2007 the right to a survivor\u2019s pension to stable, de facto unions, both heterosexual and homosexual, under certain conditions. According to the court, this was the legislature\u2019s policy choice and the situation existing before could not, of itself, be considered incompatible with the principle of equality, as protected by Article 14 of the Constitution.",

The Supreme Court noted that Law no. 13/2005 did not contain any transitional provision giving retroactive effect vis-\u00e0-vis situations predating the entry into force of the law. Nor was it possible to apply by analogy additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981, which concerned only cohabiting heterosexual couples who had been prevented from marrying because divorce had not been legal before 1981. The situation of same-sex couples before 2005 was totally different, in that same-sex marriage was not regulated at all and there had been no constitutional right to same-sex marriage before that date. In the view of the Supreme Court, Law no. 13/2005 had not been enacted to put an end to a previous situation of discrimination which ran contrary to the Constitution. Its purpose was to create a new set of rights and obligations for same-sex couples, with only ex nunc effects for the future.",

The dissenting judges considered that additional provision\u00a0no.\u00a010\u00a0(2) of Law no. 30/1981 should be applied by analogy to same-sex couples who had been prevented from marrying before 2005. This application by analogy was based on the similarity between the two situations (existence of a legal impediment to enter into marriage before the entry into force of a new law and impossibility to marry after that date due to the death of one of the members of the couple), and on the fact that in both cases the purpose of the pension was to meet the needs of the surviving partner. The fact that during the legislative process concerning Law\u00a0no.\u00a013/2005 the transitional or retroactive scope of the law had not been discussed did not mean that additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law\u00a0no.\u00a030/1981 was not applicable by analogy. Furthermore, Law\u00a0no.\u00a013/2005 was aimed at securing full equality for same-sex couples in the field of marriage, including for the purposes of social rights and benefits. Accordingly, judges should interpret and apply the legislation in conformity with that purpose, in order to avoid discriminatory treatment.

The Committee considers, that a plain reading of the definition \"member of a couple\" under the Act suggests that the author would never have been in a position to draw a pension, regardless of whether he could meet all the other criteria under the VEA, as he was not living with a member of the opposite sex.

Consequently, it remains for the Committee to decide whether, by denying a pension under the VEA to the author, on the ground that he was of the same sex as the deceased Mr. C, the State party has violated article 26 of the Covenant.",

It recalls that in previous communications the Committee found that differences in the receipt of benefits between married couples and heterosexual unmarried couples were reasonable and objective, as the couples in question had the choice to marry with all the entailing consequences. It transpires from the contested sections of the VEA that individuals who are part of a married couple or of a heterosexual cohabiting couple (who can prove that they are in a \"marriage-like\" relationship) fulfill the definition of \"member of a couple\" and therefore of a \"dependant\", for the purpose of receiving pension benefits. In the instant case, it is clear that the author, as a same sex partner, did not have the possibility of entering into marriage. Neither was he recognized as a cohabiting partner of Mr. C, for the purpose of receiving pension benefits, because of his sex or sexual orientation. The Committee recalls its constant jurisprudence that not every distinction amounts to prohibited discrimination under the Covenant, as long as it is based on reasonable and objective criteria. The State party provides no arguments on how this distinction between same-sex partners, who are excluded from pension benefits under law, and unmarried heterosexual partners, who are granted such benefits, is reasonable and objective, and no evidence which would point to the existence of factors justifying such a distinction has been advanced. In this context, the Committee finds that the State party has violated article 26 of the Covenant by denying the author a pension on the basis of his sex or sexual orientation.\u201d",

It considered that the exclusion of same sex couples from the right to a survivors\u2019 pension under the Colombian legislation applicable at the time of the facts (2002) had been discriminatory on the basis of sexual orientation. The fact that the Constitutional Court had declared that exclusion unconstitutional in 2008 had not remedied the violation, since it was not clear that according to the current legislation the applicant could be granted a survivor\u2019s pension with retroactive effects.",

Accordingly, the final domestic decision relevant to Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 was the decision of 27 June 2007 (served on 26 July that same year) by which the Social Chamber of the Supreme Court declared inadmissible the appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant, not the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision on the alleged violation of the fundamental rights and freedoms for which amparo relief was available, namely those set out in Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention. Conversely, an amparo appeal clearly was required before the complaints of private and family life and of discrimination contrary to Article 14 \u2013which are at the heart of the application to the Court\u2013 could be referred to the Court. Further, the complaint under Article 14 could only be made in conjunction with other rights guaranteed by the Convention. Requiring the applicants to apply to the Court on two different dates in order to comply with that special feature of domestic law, even though they do not rely solely on Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01, would be to construe the six-month time-limit too formally. The Court considers it more in keeping with the spirit and purpose of the Convention to treat the applicant\u2019s complaints together for the purpose of determining when the six-month period started to run in the instant case. In that connection, it reiterates that the six-month rule is autonomous and must be construed and applied according to the facts of each individual case, so as to ensure the effective exercise of the right to individual application (Fern\u00e1ndez-Molina Gonz\u00e1lez and Others v.

As noted by the Government, additional provision no. 10\u00a0(2) of Law no. 30/1981 had the very specific purpose of providing a provisional and extraordinary solution to those couples, giving the surviving partner access to a survivor\u2019s pension under certain conditions (see paragraph 27 above).

In the case of the applicant, he was unable to marry his partner due to the fact that the legislation in force at the relevant time (during his partner\u2019s lifetime) restricted the institution of marriage to different-sex couples. Same-sex couples were consequently ineligible for marriage according to that legislation, which was not deemed unconstitutional by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 24 and 37-45 above). As regards different-sex couples who had been unable to marry before divorce was legalised in 1981, the impediment to marriage was based on the fact that one or both partners were at the relevant time still married to another person whom they could not divorce. The inability of a couple in that situation to marry before 1981 did not result from the sex or the sexual orientation of its members but from the fact that one or both partners were legally married to a third person and that divorce was not permitted at the time of the death of one of the partners. What was at stake was an impediment to remarrying which affected one or both partners, not an impediment to marrying: the specific factual and legal situation addressed by the 1981 legislation cannot be genuinely compared to the position of a same-sex couple who were ineligible for marriage in absolute terms, irrespective of the marital status of one or both of its members.",

The enactment of this legislation cannot be taken as an admission by the domestic authorities that the non-recognition of same-sex marriage, or the exclusion of same-sex couples from some of the rights and benefits available to married couples, was at the relevant time incompatible with the Convention (see also paragraphs 37-45 above as regards the case-law of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court).",

It has also held that the Convention does not oblige Contracting States to grant same-sex couples access to marriage (see Schalk and Kopf, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063 and 101, and H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen v. Finland [GC], no.\u00a037359/09, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2014), marriage being widely accepted as conferring a particular status and particular rights on those who enter it (see Burden, cited above, \u00a7 63, and \u015eerife Yi\u011fit, cited above, \u00a7 72). Therefore, the Spanish legislature cannot be criticised under the terms of the Convention for not having introduced the 2005 or the 2007 legislation at an earlier date which would have entitled the applicant to obtain the benefit of a survivor\u2019s pension (see, mutatis mutandis, M.W. and Courten, both cited above).",
