Turkey, no. 18907/02, \u00a7 50, 15 December 2009), the Court has held that taking into account the uncertainty and confusion typical of such situations, the nature of the ensuing investigations implies that the relatives of a disappeared person may be justified in waiting lengthy periods of time for the national authorities to conclude their proceedings, even if those proceedings are sporadic and plagued by problems. As long as there is some meaningful contact between families and the authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a time when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be, provided. When this stage is reached will depend, unavoidably, on the circumstances of the particular case. Where more than ten years have elapsed since the incident, the applicants have to justify such a delay in lodging their application with the Court (see Varnava, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a016263).",

The Court found that the applicants had justified the delays in lodging their applications with the Court by demonstrating that they had maintained reasonable contact with the authorities, sought information on the progress of the investigation and lodged their applications shortly after having obtained information casting reasonable doubt on the effectiveness of the ongoing proceedings.",

For instance, in the case of Yeti\u015fen and Others v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 21099/06, 10 July 2012), the applicants waited for four years after the disappearance before lodging an official complaint with the competent investigating authorities and for eleven-and-a-half years before bringing their application to Strasbourg; in the case of Findik and Omer v. Turkey ((decs.), nos. 33898/11 and 35798/11, 9 October 2012), the applications were brought to Strasbourg more than fifteen years after the events; and in the case of Ta\u015f\u00e7i and Duman v.\u00a0Turkey ((dec.), no. 40787/10, 9 October 2012), the applicants applied to Strasbourg twenty-three years after the disappearance.

In each of these cases the investigations were formally pending at the time when the applications were lodged with the Court. The criminal proceedings in all the cases were suspended and resumed on several occasions at various time intervals throughout the periods concerned. Each and every time the investigations were suspended and then resumed following criticism of the investigation by supervisors, and the applicants were not always informed thereof. They, in turn, maintained a reasonable level of contact with the authorities, cooperated with the investigation and, where appropriate, took steps to inform themselves of the progress of the proceedings and to speed them up, in the hope of a more effective outcome.",

In the application Shakhbiyeva and Others (no. 62220/10), lodged ten years after the abduction and the initiation of the investigation, the applicants took an active role from the beginning and convinced the authorities to investigate their allegations in spite of their initial refusal to do so (see paragraphs 231 and 232 above). For the next several years the applicants cooperated with the investigators by giving statements and providing necessary information. Then, between May 2005 and January 2010, that is, for almost four years and eight months, the investigation was dormant and was resumed only upon the applicants\u2019 request (see paragraph\u00a0237 above). From the documents submitted it can be ascertained that the applicants, who were not informed of the suspension, did not officially contact the investigation themselves during this period. Such a lengthy period of inactivity could be considered significant enough to raise doubts as to whether the investigation was still effective. However, taking into account the fact that the applicants were not duly informed of the suspension and that the proceedings were resumed as a result of their request and the first applicant having gained access to the investigation file (see paragraphs 237 and 241 above) which allowed them to assess the progress of the criminal proceedings and led to their prompt application to Strasbourg, the Court, bearing in mind the specific context of disappearance cases, accepts the applicants\u2019 explanation for the delay in bringing their application to Strasbourg.",

If\u00a0the\u00a0Government fail to rebut that presumption, this will entail a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive part.

Whether a failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee\u2019s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on specific evidence, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.

Therefore, the Government\u2019s argument concerning the applicability of Article 5 of the Convention instead of Article 2 is inconsistent. However, leaving aside the contradictory nature of the Government\u2019s position in this regard and assuming that the applicants\u2019 abducted relatives were under the control of State agents after abduction, then the period of time which has elapsed since each person was placed in detention, although not decisive in itself, is a relevant factor to be taken into account. It must be accepted that the more time that goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may, along with other elements of circumstantial evidence before the Court, provide grounds to conclude that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. In this respect the Court considers that such a situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere \u201cirregular detention\u201d in violation of Article 5. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life as afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 cited above, \u00a7 86, and Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2000VI). Accordingly, the Court finds that Article 2 of the Convention applies and that the Government\u2019s objection in this respect should be rejected.",
