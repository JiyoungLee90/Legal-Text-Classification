In such circumstances, between 1997 and 2007 Russian passports had been issued to 162.4 million people. Over 126 million passports had been issued before 2004. When people born in other republics of the former Soviet Union obtained Russian passports, they simultaneously acquired the rights and obligations of Russian citizenship: they voted, paid taxes, received education, served in the army, and obtained other documents, including the international passport required for travelling abroad. As in all cases, the issue of a passport followed a check on whether the person was a Russian citizen; all holders of a Russian passport were supposed to have undergone such a check at least once. Those who subsequently applied for an international passport or to exchange their Russian passport had to have successfully undergone the check a number of times. Hence, there could be no fault or bad faith on the part of those persons, by virtue of the fact that they had been granted Russian passports. And yet, several thousand Russian passports had been seized on the grounds that they had been \u201cerroneously issued\u201d, whereas, according to the Ombudsman, breaches of the procedure for issuing passports, if any, were due to the negligence of the staff of the competent State agencies and the fact that they were not appropriately qualified, or even due to crimes committed by them for pecuniary gain.",

According to the prosecutor\u2019s office, since a Russian passport attested to Russian citizenship, it might only be seized where citizenship was revoked on the basis of a court decision establishing that the person in question had submitted false information or documents in order to acquire it. However, the Fedorovskiy District Court had dismissed the application, having found that issues concerning citizenship were in the sole competence of the President and his competent executive agencies.

It limited property rights and also deprived the person in question of judicial remedies, even that of an appeal against decisions of the FMS.

In particular, under Russian law, a person needed proof of identity in order to obtain employment, receive medical assistance, buy plane or train tickets, or receive a pension and other social benefits. A person also needed such proof in relation to bank transactions. Furthermore, without a valid identity document, a person ran the risk of being apprehended by the police.",

The Ombudsman criticised the practice in question, as a result of which several thousand Russian passports had been seized on the grounds that they had been \u201cerroneously issued\u201d, despite no fault having been detected on the part of the passport holders. In the Ombudsman\u2019s view, any irregularities related to the issue of the passports were due to negligence on the part of the staff of the competent State agencies and the fact that they were not appropriately qualified (see paragraph 74 above). In his Annual Report for 2011, the Ombudsman again addressed the ongoing practice. He stated, in particular, that at the time when former Soviet nationals who had found themselves in CIS countries had applied for Russian citizenship through Russian consulate agencies, the fact that they had done so might not have been registered in the corresponding databases, and in addition there was no single database (see paragraph 81 above). In the Ombudsman\u2019s Annual Report for 2012 it was stated that the overall number of Russian passports deemed to be invalid had reached 80,000, with approximately 8,000 being declared invalid each year (see paragraph 83 above).",
