Moreover, the Deputy Minister considered that the applicant's account of his alleged escape lacked credibility: it was hard to believe that someone who had been kept in detention for four months should have been transported unrestrained and been able to get away without being stopped by his guards, both of whom were alleged to have left him alone in the back of an open jeep in order to look at a traffic accident. The applicant was further held not to have substantiated his alleged detention. The comments he had allegedly made at the meeting in August 2000 were not of such a confrontational nature that he had well-founded reasons to fear persecution on that account, the more so bearing in mind that his comments did not particularly deviate from the opinion of the superiors to whom he claimed to have addressed them.

The President considered that the applicant's alleged desertion and his resulting fear of disproportionate punishment had not been established in a sufficiently plausible manner. It was unlikely that the army should still have been mobilised at the time of the applicant's escape in April 2001, given that the war had ended in June 2000 and that the army, by the applicant's own account, had evaluated its performance in the war at a meeting in August 2000. The applicant's claim that he stood accused of incitement was based on pure supposition. In view of the ease with which the applicant had allegedly managed to escape, the President further found it unlikely that the (army) authorities wished to harm him.

Even though this material does not relate to the applicant personally but concerns information of a more general nature, it is difficult to see what more he might reasonably have been expected to submit in the way of substantiation of his account and as a possible explanation for the four-month gap \u2013 used as an argument against him by the respondent Government \u2013 between his allegedly voicing criticism at the evaluation meeting in August 2000 and his arrest in December of that year.",

In this connection, and apart from the efforts made by the Eritrean authorities to apprehend deserters as already mentioned above (see paragraph 52), the Court further takes note of the general information from public sources describing the treatment meted out to deserters in Eritrea (see paragraphs 25 and 31-35 above), which ranges from incommunicado detention to prolonged exposure to the sun in high temperatures and the tying of hands and feet in painful positions. There can be no doubt that this constitutes inhuman treatment. Indeed, the most recent country report on  compiled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the respondent Government also states that there have been reports of ill-treatment of deserters (see paragraph 25 above). Whereas the assumption is made in this report that the severity of the punishment will depend, inter alia, on whether the desertion took place in time of war or in peacetime, the Court observes that such a differentiation is not mentioned by the other sources. It is further to be borne in mind that it remains the applicant's position that he was arrested and detained by the Eritrean military authorities after voicing criticism, and that he is therefore known to the authorities. In this connection, the Court also notes that it would in any event appear that the authorities in  have registered the names of deserters (see paragraph 26 above). Having regard, lastly, to the reports of the treatment meted out to a number of Eritreans deported from Malta, among them deserters (see paragraph 34 above), the Court considers that substantial grounds have been shown for believing that, if expelled at the present time, the applicant would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.",

I would draw a parallel with other procedural aspects which, under the Court's case-law, can be derived from these provisions, such as the obligation to conduct an effective investigation into a homicide or into a credible assertion that someone has been subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. Indeed, the Court has already held that an individual's claim that their deportation to a third country will expose them to treatment prohibited by Article 3 requires rigorous scrutiny (see Jabari v. Turkey, no. 40035/98, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2000VIII).",
