It is in the interests of not only the applicant but also the efficacy of the Convention system that the domestic authorities, which are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention.",

However, the Court considers that in some cases information purportedly casting new light on the circumstances of a killing may come into the public domain at a later stage.

This constituted a significant development in Ms Tasuyeva\u2019s case, and it can be said that at that stage she could have believed that the authorities\u2019 intended to conduct an effective investigation of Mr\u00a0Appazov\u2019s death. In the next three years before the lodging of this application the investigation was suspended and resumed several times, and Ms Tasuyeva\u2019s lawyer wrote to the investigating authorities on multiple occasions to follow its course and to challenge the suspensions. The resumption of the proceedings was at least on some occasions due to his complaints. The Court therefore finds that Ms\u00a0Tasuyeva\u2019s involvement with the investigation in this later period constituted genuine efforts to cooperate with the authorities, and to acquaint herself with and influence the progress of the investigation (see Khadzhimuradov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 76) .",

The Court notes that after the restoration of the case file in September 2007 the investigating authorities asked various military bodies to provide them with information concerning the airforce operations in Elistanzhi on 7 October 1999, but their request was not answered (see paragraph 15 above). The freshly opened investigation was suspended (see paragraph 17 above), and in the three following years it was repeatedly resumed and suspended without any substantive progress being made. In that period several witnesses and victims were questioned (see paragraph 21 above), but no other steps identified by the authorities as necessary were taken. Every time the investigation was resumed, the decisions listed the actions to be carried out, such as establishing the full list of killed and injured persons, joining the medical certificates stating the causes of death and injuries to the case file, establishing which military units had participated in the aerial attack, examining the crime scene, obtaining forensic reports and collecting the unexploded projectiles from the attack left lying in specified locations (see paragraphs 23, 25, 27, 31 and 34 above). However, these actions were not carried out despite the repeated instructions of the investigator\u2019s hierarchical supervisors to do so (see paragraph 35 above). Seemingly, the list of killed and injured people has still not been drawn up in the criminal case. After the unsuccessful enquiries in 2007 the investigators took no steps to identify the army and air force units involved in the operation, or to question their commanders.",

This part of application has been declared inadmissible. This information is therefore irrelevant to the violation of Article 2 found in the present case, which concerns the lack of an effective investigation after September 2007. Accordingly, the Court finds it appropriate to award EUR 15,000 in respect of nonpecuniary damage on account of the failures of the investigation to elucidate the circumstances of the crimes committed against Ms Tasuyeva and Mr Appazov. The award should be paid to the applicant\u2019s heir, Mr Isa Tasuyev.",
