The Town Court's decision of 23 April 2004 did not mention the applicant's detention and its subsequent decision of 13 May 2004, upheld on appeal by the Tula Regional Court on 9 June 2004, merely rejected his application for release rather than constituting a formal detention order required under the domestic law. As the Court has already found in a similar case, applications for release filed by a defendant in custody do not exempt the domestic authorities from the obligation to authorise his or her detention \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d by issuing a formal detention order, as provided by Article 5 \u00a7 1. Finding otherwise would place on the defendant, rather than on the authorities, the burden of ensuring a lawful basis for his or her continued detention (see Melnikova v. , no.\u00a024552/02, \u00a7 61, 21\u00a0June 2007).",

It did not, however, give any grounds for maintaining the custodial measure or fix a time-limit for the extended detention. This situation has also been examined in many cases against Russia, in which the Court found that the absence of any grounds given by judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time was incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1. Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Avdeyev and Veryayev v. Russia, no. 2737/04, \u00a7\u00a7 45-47, 9 July 2009; Bakhmutskiy v. Russia, no. 36932/02, \u00a7\u00a7 112-114, 25 June 2009; Gubkin v.

The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. It considers that the decision of 31 May 2004 did not comply with the requirements of clarity, foreseeability and protection from arbitrariness and that the ensuing period of the applicant's detention was not \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1. This finding makes it unnecessary to examine whether the applicant's detention was also unlawful after 9 October 2004 on account of its being in excess of the maximum six-month period of detention \u201cduring the trial\u201d.",

Moreover, in the present case the applicant's absence from the hearing concerning his detention was at variance with the requirements of the domestic law, in particular Article 109 \u00a7 13 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 33 above), which provided that the personal presence of the defendant was mandatory at extension hearings. The exception envisaged in that Article and relied upon by the appeal court and the Government, namely that the applicant had been admitted for an in-patient examination, had not been applicable in the instant case because the examination had already been completed by 26 December 2003, four days before the hearing took place. It appears therefore that the domestic courts did not exercise adequate care to establish the applicant's whereabouts and take appropriate measures for securing his personal participation at the hearing, as required by Article 109 \u00a7 13 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. While the applicant's transfer would certainly have required some logistical arrangements, they could not have been particularly complex, taking into account the short distance between Moscow and Tula and also the fact that his transfer two weeks later took just one day (from 15 to 16 January 2004).",
