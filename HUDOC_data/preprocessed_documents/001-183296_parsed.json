The applicants agreed, in particular, that it was important and necessary to maintain public order. However, they argued that the governor\u2019s decision had completely disregarded the moral values of their society and had aroused anger. The news that their children would not be buried in Siirt and that their bodies had been confiscated by the soldiers had caused an upsurge of emotion in the people waiting at the cemetery in Siirt and as a result they had attacked members of the security forces and local shops with sticks and stones. When the security forces responded to those attacks heavy handedly, scores of people had been injured and more than a hundred people had been arrested. All of that unrest had been caused by the governor\u2019s unlawful decision.

The decision had been taken because the people who had gathered at the cemetery in Siirt and who were waiting for the bodies to arrive had thrown stones at municipal workers and members of the security forces. The decision to bury the bodies in the town of Eruh had therefore been taken with a view to maintaining public order.

Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, \u00a7\u00a0260, ECHR 2015; emphasis added).
