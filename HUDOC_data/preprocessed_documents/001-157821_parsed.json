We drew up our plan and arrived at Ulucanlar on the morning of 26\u00a0 September; the prisoners riposted with firearms and flame throwers, and we were attacked with knives; so we also used our arms in accordance with the powers conferred by Act No. 2803 [on the organisation of the National Gendarmerie]. My men were injured, and unfortunately on the other side prisoners were also injured or lost their lives. Their deaths have greatly saddened me. I am sad because there should not have been any weapons there. If there had been no weapons there would have been no confrontation and these people would not have died, and my men would not have been injured ... After those events the Ministry of Justice issued the directive of 5 October 1999. Prior to that date, we (gendarmes) were not empowered to search prison guards entering the prison; the prison guards were searched by other prison guards. Imagine two prison guards who have links with the ... prisoners. What sort of links might these be? They might be material, pecuniary or ideological, or be based on fear. Therefore, if the \u2018terrorist\u2019 organisation told those two guards that someone would be bringing a gun from outside and that they had to hand it over to [a given prisoner], they would be certain to obey. The prison guard goes into the prison and [one of his colleagues] searches him, not a gendarme. A lawyer arrives and no one searches him. He has a private conversation with the detainee or prisoner and leaves, after which the detainee or prisoner is taken back to his cell, still without any body searches. Normally no such items should have been brought into the prison ... The prison in question has one more special feature: it is next to the open prison section, where individuals come and go, stroll around and do whatever they want, and they could easily throw whatever objects they wish over the wall. There have been lots of incidents of this kind. We drew up a report and informed the prison authorities that a package had been thrown inside; [the guards] searched the premises but found nothing. After all, we could never have interfered in the running of the prison! ...\u201d",

The Sub-Commission took the view that even though such agreements could be seen as useful for protecting prisoners\u2019 rights, in the instant case it was precisely the issue of implementing the agreement in question which triggered the events at Ulucanlar.

Once the armed confrontation has begun it can no longer be stopped. I am glad that my next-in-command and my lieutenant survived, thanks be to God, but if one of them had been martyred, how could we have explained that to people? ... In the past, when we came here on an operation, we only searched the ordinary convicts\u2019 dormitories, not those of the prisoners convicted of terrorism. When the operation was instigated the latter prisoners resisted to the death. Firearms were the last resort, and we held back until our personnel began to sustain injuries ... That is when you have to react; the longer you hold off the worse the eventual losses [in your own ranks] will be ...; if you wait too long before riposting you will allow the \u2018terrorists\u2019 to adjust their aim and erect barricades ... They even began killing each other; there were burst of gunfire inside the dormitory ... I shouted down from the first floor \u2018but that\u2019s automatic gunfire!\u2019 and the reply came \u2018we know, sir ... we have no hunting rifles, we don\u2019t use them ...\u201d",

In that regard, the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute its own assessment of the situation for that of the security forces and thus to impose the use of other neutralising devices such as stun grenades. It is clearly desirable that such facilities be widely used in order gradually to restrict recourse to methods likely to cause death. However, to establish such an obligation of principle without having regard to the circumstances of the individual case would impose an unrealistic burden on the State and its law-enforcement personnel in the execution of their duty, perhaps to the detriment of their lives and the lives of others, particularly in view of the foreseeability of human nature (see, mutatis mutandis, Andronicou and Constantinou v.

The Court will come back to this point, but at the outset it must disagree \u2013 as did the Sub-Commission (see paragraph 56 above) \u2013 with the applicants when they attempt to minimise the seriousness of the situation by limiting it temporally and factually (see paragraphs 153, 157 and 178 above): the situation could not be explained solely by a purportedly legitimate occupation of dormitory no.\u00a07 by leftist prisoners demanding more room and better conditions of detention, but probably had more to do with a series of acts of disobedience, which were carried out in protest but were also unlawful, and constant breaches of the prison rules, particularly as regards presence checks, curfews, inter-prisoner contact and prison staff security.",
