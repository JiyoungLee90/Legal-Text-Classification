The present case is another example of this unacceptable situation. The applicant was denied the \u201cright to rehabilitation\u201d on the ground that it only accrued to those who have been cleared of the charges. His civil claim for compensation was likewise refused because paragraph 1 of Article 1070 only referred to the specific exhaustively listed situations and the application of paragraph 2 was conditional on the claimant\u2019s ability to produce a final criminal conviction of the judge who had issued the impugned decision.
