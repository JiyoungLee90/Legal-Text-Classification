This was a neutral value judgment; an observation about the child\u2019s inconspicuous conduct.

However, there was no basis for such a conclusion and there was in any event no reason for attaching weight to such a possibility. J\u2019s information about Ms A had emerged after she had given evidence to the High Court for one hour. At that point, the jury, including J, had a good opportunity to form an independent and updated picture of the victim as a person.
