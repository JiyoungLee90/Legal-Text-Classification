As regards the conduct of the parties, and more especially the attempts they made to reach a friendly settlement, the Court observes that, unlike the situation in Laino, where the parties had requested and obtained adjournments while trying to resolve the dispute between them out of court (judgment cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 22), in the present case the attempts in question took place during the trial itself (see paragraphs 9 and 13 above). The Court notes that the applicant did not oppose joinder of the two sets of civil proceedings (cases nos. 83/1993 and 73/1995), which she could have done, thus reducing the length of the case, and that it was often the claimant, not her, who asked the judge to open the next time-limited stage for the presentation of evidence. Furthermore, the purpose of the domestic proceedings was to secure the applicant\u2019s eviction from premises which she continued to occupy until 22 February 1999.",

The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s conduct alone is not sufficient to explain the length of the proceedings, which lasted for approximately eight years and nine months. The length of that period was mainly due to the complexity of San Marino procedure \u2013 marked, where the parties do not waive their rights, by the need to go through all five time-limited stages, namely the first and second termini probatori, the first and second termini reprobatori and the termine di controprova (see paragraph 22 above) both at first instance and on appeal, which does not help to expedite the proceedings \u2013 and to the fact that in civil matters the judge is not empowered to take the initiative in the event of inaction by the parties. Lastly, as regards what was at stake in the proceedings for the applicant, the Court merely notes that, according to the information supplied by the Government and not contradicted by the applicant, she ceased to carry on her business on the premises as early as 1995.",
