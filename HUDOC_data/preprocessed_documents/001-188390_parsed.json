It therefore considers that there are grounds to make an award in respect of pecuniary damage. However, the Court reiterates that, in line with its case-law, the applicants were not entitled to compensation amounting to the full market value of their property, and compensation corresponding to the indexed value established by competent public authorities is in principle in line with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraphs 56 and 59 above). With these considerations in mind, having regard to the indexed value of the land established by the Centre of Registers (EUR 24,432) and the compensation awarded to the applicants at the domestic level (EUR 5,307), the Court awards the applicants jointly EUR 19,125 in respect of pecuniary damage.",
