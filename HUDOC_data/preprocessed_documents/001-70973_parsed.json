He had seen a coloured man with a shaved head come out of the doorway. He had seen the policeman try to grab the coloured man by his arm. The coloured man had made a sideways movement with his arm, as if to indicate that he did not want to go along with the policeman, and the policeman had not been able to hold on to him. The coloured man had then drawn a pistol or a revolver, whether out of his pocket or out of his trouser band Mr van den Heuvel could not see. The weapon was of a silver-grey colour with a dark coloured grip. Mr van den Heuvel\u2019s instinctive reaction had been to dive for cover behind the balustrade of the walkway. As he glanced over briefly out of curiosity, it had appeared to him that the policeman had taken a few steps sideways. The coloured man was still holding the weapon in his hand. He had not pointed it in any particular direction, but he had not dropped it either. All this happened very quickly, perhaps in less than half a minute. In the meantime a second policeman had come running up. He had heard \u201cDrop it\u201d being shouted very loudly at least four times. The coloured man must have heard it, but ignored it.",

He had reached a point about five or seven metres from the thief when the thief managed to tear himself loose and ended up at a distance of about three metres from Officer Bultstra. Suddenly Officer Brons had seen the thief holding a silver-coloured weapon which he had not seen him draw. It was a small pistol and it was pointed towards the ground. Officer Brons had not seen whether or not the pistol was cocked. It had seemed to him that Officer Bultstra had also seen the pistol, because Officer Bultstra had stepped backwards, drawing his service pistol and adopting a defensive posture. He had heard Officer Bultstra shouting \u201cDrop that weapon. Don\u2019t be silly, man.\u201d (\u201cLaat vallen dat wapen. Doe nou normaal man.\u201d) at least twice. The thief had not reacted by dropping his pistol, much to the surprise of Officer Brons seeing that Officer Bultstra had him covered. Given that the thief was armed and apparently had no intention of doing as he was told, Officer Brons had considered that Officer Bultstra was under threat. He had considered it highly possible that the thief would use his weapon against Officer Bultstra. He had been completely fixated on the thief. He had seen only the thief, holding a pistol with his finger on the trigger. At that point Officer Brons had not yet considered it necessary to draw his own service pistol because the thief was covered by Officer Bultstra. His hand had been close to, but not on, the holster.",

Officer Bultstra had taken hold of his service weapon in both hands and, adopting a defensive position, had aimed at the man\u2019s chest.

As far as he could recall, this situation had lasted for about four seconds, during which time he had called out to the man twice to drop his pistol. This the man had not done. Things had happened very quickly; he estimated that the time from the moment he grabbed the man until the fatal shot had been no more than fifteen or twenty seconds.",

This had caused Officer Bultstra to think: \u201cNow I will shoot.\u201d Since the man was raising his hand and arm, Officer Bultstra was convinced that he was about to fire; he had been building up tension in his right hand to pull the trigger of his service pistol when he had heard, on his right, a loud report that he had recognised as a pistol shot. He had immediately thought: \u201c[Officer Brons] has got him.\u201d Officer Bultstra had felt so threatened that he would have fired if Officer Brons had not done so.

The application was signed by Mr Hamer as the applicants\u2019 representative and by each of the applicants individually. They stated that the information available did not admit of the conclusion that the shooting of Moravia Ramsahai by Officer Brons was sufficiently justified. They also pointed out that certain key parts of the investigation after the shooting had been carried out by the Amsterdam/Amstelland police force \u2013 meaning Officer Brons\u2019s direct colleagues \u2013 and argued on that ground that the investigation had not been \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201cindependent\u201d. Further complaints addressed the failure to question Officers Brons and Bultstra until several days after the event, the failure to question all the police officers who had arrived at the scene after the shooting about what had been said by Officers Brons and Bultstra, the failure to determine the precise trajectory of the bullet (which the applicants submitted would have been possible), the failure to secure gunshot residue samples from the hands of Officers Brons and Bultstra, and other alleged lacunae in the investigation. Reference was also made to the statement of Police Commissioner Van Riessen, as reported in the newspaper De Telegraaf, to the effect that he would not allow an independent inquiry, and to the fact that the Chief Public Prosecutor (hoofdofficier van justitie) of  retained overall responsibility for the investigation and the prosecution, if any.",

He expressed complete agreement with an official report prepared by Public Prosecutor De Vries and forwarded to him by the Chief Public Prosecutor on 28 December 1998. He considered it sufficiently clear from the evidence available that Officer Brons had acted in self-defence and was not convinced that Public Prosecutor De Vries, who had decided not to prosecute, was in any way biased. Although perhaps some might have preferred the non-prosecution decision to have been taken by an official body further removed from the  police, that was not a wish which needed to be taken into account by the courts. It followed that the applicants\u2019 complaint of 2\u00a0October 1998 was unfounded.",

There had been no need to make an official record of this conversation. The decision whether or not to make such records was, and remained, in the hands of the State Criminal Investigation Department. It was noteworthy in this connection that the investigating officer had not seen the need to seek more information about the conversation in question. The police had offered its full co-operation in the investigation and an additional independent investigation was unnecessary. An explanation was given for the suggestion in the press release that Officer Brons had fired to protect Officer Bultstra. The discrepancy noted, however, was not fundamental and therefore did not justify an official retraction.",

To hold otherwise would be to impose an unrealistic burden on the State and its law-enforcement personnel in the execution of their duty, perhaps to the detriment of their lives and the lives of others (see McCann and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 27\u00a0September\u00a01995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0324, pp.\u00a058\u201359, \u00a7\u00a0200; more recently, Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, no. 50196/99, \u00a7\u00a0138, ECHR 2005II.

As the Court of Appeal had also stated in that case, the public prosecutor could be considered sufficiently independent and qualified to decide, on the basis of the results of the criminal investigation, whether or not to prosecute. The same applied in the present case, the Public Prosecutor\u2019s position in relation to the Amsterdam/Amstelland police force notwithstanding.",

In the Court\u2019s case-law, a procedural violation of Article\u00a02 has been found in many cases where a substantive violation of the same Article has also been found, and also in cases where the impossibility for the Court to reach a conclusion on the substantive violation was a result of the lack or the insufficiency of investigations carried out by the national authorities (see, for example, Kaya v. Turkey, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I; Ya\u015fa v. Turkey, judgment of 2 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI; and Tanr\u0131kulu v.

In such cases, the compliance of the investigations and national procedures with what the Court\u2019s case-law indicates as appropriate and desirable seems to us irrelevant. The present case illustrates this very clearly. Neither of the criticisms made by the majority with regard to the investigation has any bearing whatever on the effectiveness of the national inquiries and on the Court\u2019s conclusion that no substantive violation of Article 2 has occurred. The lack of independence found in the judgment in relation to the first part of the investigation does not cast doubt on the reliability of the findings. One could add that at least some of the investigative measures were obviously urgent, and that any delay pending the arrival of a different police force would have entailed the risk of impairing the investigation. It was obviously necessary to act immediately, as the police did on the night in question, in order to preserve evidence, request the intervention of forensic experts, seize the pistols, identify witnesses, take witness statements, etc. Subsequently a different and independent police force (see paragraph 405 of the judgment) entered the picture and took responsibility for carrying out the investigation.

In any case, some limits to public scrutiny are admitted (see Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, no. 50196/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0157-158, 17 March 2005, where the Court accepted that the effectiveness of the inquest was not undermined on account of the decision to grant anonymity to Officers A, B, C and D). Furthermore, the necessity of public confidence in the correctness of public authorities\u2019 conduct is a general one and, in the field of justice, is taken into consideration by the Convention in Article 6, in particular; this Article was not, however, applicable to the proceedings before the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 419 of the judgment).",

First of all, the legal system concerned was profoundly dissimilar to the system in issue, and the surrounding circumstances were even less similar. In the Finucane case, the circumstances of Mr Finucane\u2019s killing gave rise to suspicions of collusion with the killers by the security forces and it was not clear that the authorities\u2019 inquiries were in fact concerned with investigating Patrick Finucane\u2019s death with a view to bringing prosecutions as appropriate. There was a lack of independence in the investigation which gave rise to serious doubts as to the thoroughness or effectiveness with which the possibility of collusion was considered. In any event, the reports were not made public and the applicant was never informed of their findings. The necessary elements of public scrutiny and accessibility to the family were therefore lacking.",
