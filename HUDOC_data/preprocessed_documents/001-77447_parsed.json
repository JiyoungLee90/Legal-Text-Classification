As had been noted in the Committee on the Rights of the Child\u2019s second report on  dated 7 July 2002, no facilities for children of the second applicant\u2019s age existed in 2002. Accordingly, no arrangements were in place to attend to the second applicant\u2019s needs and the only assistance she received was from another Congolese minor. Despite all the assistance given by individual members of staff, the fact remained that there had been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention as, at a crucial stage in her development, the second applicant had been denied freedom of movement, had been unable to play or express her feelings, and had been held in precarious conditions in an adult world where liberty was restricted. The Government had had other, more appropriate, options at their disposal. They could, for instance, have placed the second applicant with the Aid to Young People Department. The applicants noted, lastly, that the second applicant had suffered from sleeping disorders after her release from detention.",

They said that the second applicant, who was only five years old at the time, had travelled without anyone being assigned to accompany her and had been forced to wait at Kinshasa Airport from 5 p.m. until approximately 11 p.m., when Ms T. arrived to collect her. In their submission, deporting the child of a person with recognised refugee status was contrary to the fundamental rule that asylum-seekers should not be expelled. There was, furthermore, a danger in such cases that the authorities in the country of origin would use the child\u2019s presence there to compel the refugee to return or even that they would seek to exact revenge on the child. The applicants added that the Government had been aware that neither B., who was a student, nor any other member of the family was in a position to look after the second applicant. In their submission, their case had to be distinguished from the case of Nsona v. the Netherlands (28 November 1996, Reports 1996V), in which a nine-year-old girl had been deported in an aircraft belonging to one of her father\u2019s acquaintances and had been accompanied by a (sufficiently) close relative. The present case was different in that the second applicant had travelled alone. It was not enough to say that an air hostess had been assigned to look after her by the airline. Furthermore, the complications in Nsona had come about following the intervention of counsel for the applicant in that case, which was not the position in the present case. The fact that the Belgian authorities had been aware of the first applicant\u2019s refugee status in Canada and that the second applicant had ultimately returned to Europe after five days indicated that the decision to deport her was disproportionate. Lastly, as the applicants had already stated with regard to the second applicant\u2019s detention, the Government had had other means at their disposal.",

Although the trauma suffered by the child and the lack of anyone to meet her at Kinshasa Airport were regrettable, there had been no problems with the conditions in which the second applicant had travelled as she had been accompanied all the way to the airport by a social worker and there placed in the care of an air hostess who had been assigned to accompany her by the airline, as its report dated 25 October 2002 indicated. The Belgian authorities had, moreover, received assurances that members of the second applicant\u2019s family would collect her at the airport. Nor were the authorities responsible for the fact that her uncle, B., had reneged on his promise at the last minute; in any event, his failure to turn up had been of no consequence because the child was met by a representative of the Congolese authorities, who had accommodated her for the night. The Government considered that primary responsibility for the additional inconvenience that was caused to the child lay with B. Nevertheless, they acknowledged that the deportation was not executed with proper vigilance. In particular, they admitted that they should have anticipated the possibility that B. might not turn up and regretted not having done so. The Government nonetheless considered that the child\u2019s family had no grounds for complaint in that respect, as it was the family, and in particular the first applicant, who were responsible for the situation.",

The applicants argued that family reunification was a fundamental right of refugees and cited, among other authorities, Recommendation 1327 (1997)of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the protection and reinforcement of the human rights of refugees and asylum-seekers in Europe. In their submission, the obligations incumbent on States that were parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child signed in New York on 20 November 1989 (and in particular, Articles 3 and 10 thereof) could be used as a guide when assessing whether the interference with the child\u2019s family life had been necessary. The reasons given by the Government in no way justified the interference, which had consisted of the second applicant\u2019s detention notwithstanding a proposal by her lawyer for her to be placed with foster parents. Her illegal entry was not a reason for denying her fundamental rights; nor did her inability to travel to the  prevent her placement with foster parents. Furthermore, although family reunification in  would have taken some time, there had been no need to keep the child in a closed centre. Nor could the fact that members of her family had been located in  serve to justify her detention since she was the daughter of a person with recognised refugee status and her return to her country of origin placed her safety and even her life at risk.

In the Government\u2019s submission, keeping an alien in detention after he or she had attempted to enter the national territory without complying with the relevant conditions and had asked to be given refugee status while the application for asylum was considered could not in itself be considered to constitute a violation of his or her family life.

The sole aim of the detention in the present case had been to prevent the second applicant from entering  and to facilitate her subsequent deportation to her country of origin. The applicants argued in the alternative that were the Court to consider that the word \u201cperson\u201d referred to in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention included minors, the child\u2019s age and minority would nevertheless remain an important factor in assessing the lawfulness of the detention. In other words, when a minor was detained, a stricter review would be required, in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In such cases, the Government would have to be able to prove that the detention was in the child\u2019s interest. In the second applicant\u2019s case, there had been no need for the detention. Alternatives had been available such as permitting her to enter the country and stay with foster parents under the supervision of the Aid to Younger People in the French Community Department. Furthermore, the second applicant\u2019s deportation could not be regarded as release from detention and so was in breach of the chambre du conseil\u2019s order of 16 October 2002. The applicants added that Crown Counsel had, in fact, had only one aim when he decided to defer his appeal against the order for the second applicant\u2019s release and that was to facilitate her removal by the Government. They said that proof of this was to be found in the letter from the Aliens Office dated 15 October 2002. It followed that the second applicant\u2019s detention subsequent to the order of 16\u00a0October 2002 was unlawful, its sole purpose being to allow her deportation before the order for her release became final.",

There could be no one single answer to the question whether the detention of a foreign minor was lawful: the minor\u2019s age and the particular difficulties with which the Belgian authorities were confronted were essential criteria for deciding on the best solution for the child. In any event, it would be hazardous to work on the premise that if a child was very young, it could \u201cas it were serve as a safe conduct for third parties\u201d, which was the situation that was in danger of arising if a rule was established prohibiting the detention of minors. The detention of a minor was, furthermore, consistent with the provisions of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention. As regards more specifically the detention subsequent to the chambre du conseil\u2019s order of 16 October 2002, while it was true that that court had ruled that the second applicant\u2019s continued detention in Transit Centre no. 127 was unlawful and had ordered her release, Crown Counsel had a right under section 72 of the Law of 15 December 1980 to appeal within twenty-four hours of the date of the decision. It was only on the expiration of that period that the order became final (in accordance with section 73 of the Act) and the alien had to be released. In the present case, the order of 16 October 2002 had not become final until midnight on 17\u00a0October 2002 and it was only at that point, once the time-limit for appealing had expired, that the second applicant had to be released. The Government said that it followed from this that the second applicant\u2019s continued detention until 17 October 2002 \u2013 when she was taken to the airport to be put on the plane to Kinshasa \u2013 complied with the provisions of domestic law. The second applicant could not have been released because Crown Counsel had the right to reserve his decision whether or not to appeal. While it would have been possible to find someone to look after the child for twenty-four hours, this would not have been without difficulty. In the Government\u2019s submission, it was not possible to say that the Belgian authorities\u2019 conduct was dictated by the success of the application for release as the flight had been booked a week previously. Lastly, it was quite clear that the detention had ended when the deportation order was executed.",

In proclaiming the right to liberty, paragraph 1 of Article 5 contemplates the physical liberty of the person and its aim is to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of this liberty in an arbitrary fashion (see, mutatis mutandis, Amuur, cited above, \u00a7 42). The list of exceptions to the right to liberty secured in Article 5 \u00a7 1 is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, K.F. v. Germany, 27\u00a0November 1997, \u00a7 70, Reports 1997VII; \u010conka v. Belgium, no.\u00a051564/99, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2002-I; and D.G. v. Ireland, no. 39474/98, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2002-III). Detention must be lawful both in domestic and Convention terms: the Convention lays down an obligation to comply with the substantive and procedural rules of national law and requires that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5 which is to protect an individual from arbitrariness (see Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, \u00a7\u00a7 39 and 45, Series A no. 33; Bozano v. France, 18 December 1986, \u00a7 54, Series A no. 111; and Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 114).",

It observes that the Government have not sought to argue that the chambre du conseil\u2019s ruling that the detention was illegal affected the second applicant\u2019s victim status. In any event, it notes that the ruling did not bring the detention to an end.
