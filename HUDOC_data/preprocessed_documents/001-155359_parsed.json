He maintained at the outset that he had defended the Turkish Republic and the Turkish military forces throughout his life. He further contended that, had he committed an offence in his article as alleged by the complainant, then he had committed it under severe provocation. He submitted that the complainant had never condemned the PKK\u2019s activities and that he had referred to PKK members as \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d. Mr\u00a0I.E. noted that he had been demonstrating solidarity with the families of the martyrs killed by the terrorists and that, were his solidarity to be regarded as an offence, then as a Turkish nationalist he was proud of committing the offence in question. He also claimed that he had criticised the DTP\u2019s ideology and activities in his article and had intended to inform society. He contended that a case had been brought before the Constitutional Court for the DTP\u2019s dissolution, and that the content of his article had been similar to the indictment brought by the Chief Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation in that case. He had not used the word \u201cKurdish\u201d in his article, since he accepted all citizens of Turkey as Turkish. Until the complainant stated \u201cHow happy is he who says \u2018I am a Turk\u2019\u201d, he would struggle against him. He also maintained that in view of the hundreds of cases brought against DTP members on charges of separatism, aiding and abetting the PKK and hostility towards the State, the complainant had been shameless in daring to file a complaint against him. He further noted that he had targeted those who were terrorists, that is, PKK members, and if the complainant considered himself the subject of the article, then he (Mr I.E.) had been right to identify him as a target. Mr I.E. maintained that nobody had been hurt as a result of his article, but that many people had died as a result of terrorism. At the end of his submissions, he again noted that the applicant had been unable to say \u201cHow happy is he who says \u2018I am a Turk\u2019\u201d and that, therefore, the applicant\u2019s Turkishness was open to doubt.",

In his decision, the public prosecutor stated that the article had been drafted as a reaction to the PKK, an organisation recognised internationally as a terrorist organisation, which had carried out acts of terrorism and killed both civilians and soldiers. According to the public prosecutor, after listing the killings committed by the PKK, the author had stated his opinion as to why society and the State should act together against the killings committed by the PKK and had articulated public reaction and anger in the face of those killings. The author had even criticised the State\u2019s activities in relation to acts of terrorism. The Bolu public prosecutor held that Mr I.E. had severely criticised the DTP, which had not condemned the PKK\u2019s illegal activities and which was considered to have failed to act side by side with society and the State. The public prosecutor considered that the article expressed the author\u2019s opinions and offered a number of proposals with a view to eradicating the terrorist organisation in issue.",

The public prosecutor maintained that articles had also appeared in the press expressing society\u2019s anger and hatred. In spite of all these publications, there had been no armed conflict between different ethnic groups in Turkey, due to the culture of tolerance, respect and understanding which existed in the country. The Bolu public prosecutor stated that in the light of the aforementioned sociological and political background in Turkey, the article should be considered as using freedom to disseminate information, to criticise and to comment within the context of freedom of the media, given that it contained somewhat exaggerated criticism of a political party, its members and activities.",

The State\u2019s obligation in this respect extends beyond its primary duty to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches of such provisions. Article\u00a02 of the Convention may also imply in certain welldefined circumstances a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0October 1998, \u00a7 115, Reports 1998VIII; Opuz, cited above, \u00a7 128; and R.R. and Others v.

For the Court, such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities. Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. In the opinion of the Court, where there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obligation to protect the right to life in the context of their above-mentioned duty to prevent and suppress offences against the person, it must be established to its satisfaction that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk. For the Court, and having regard to the nature of the right protected by Article 2, a right fundamental in the scheme of the Convention, it is sufficient for an applicant to show that the authorities did not do all that could be reasonably expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they had or ought to have had knowledge. This is a question which can only be answered in the light of all the circumstances of any particular case (see Osman, cited above, \u00a7 116, and R.R. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 29).",

For example, in the above-mentioned case of L.C.B. v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, the Court examined, on the merits, the allegations made under Article 2 by the applicant, who was suffering from leukaemia and complained about the State\u2019s failure to warn her parents of the possible risk to her health caused by her father\u2019s participation in nuclear tests (see L.C.B., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36-41). Similarly, in the Osman case, the Court examined the State\u2019s obligation to protect the right to life of Ali and Ahmet Osman, although the latter had not lost his life but was wounded in a shooting incident (see Osman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 115-122).

Given that serious disturbances had raged between the security forces and the members of the PKK since approximately 1984, resulting in very heavy loss of life, it can be concluded that there was a public interest in addressing the issue of the killing of members of the security forces.",

In addition, the author explicitly stated that some members of Parliament were \u201cthe instigators of the terrorists\u201d (see paragraph\u00a010 of the judgment). Although in his statements to the Bolu public prosecutor Mr\u00a0I.E. maintained that he had been referring to PKK members in his article, he also stated that if the complainant considered himself the subject of the article, then he had been right to identify him as a target. Mr I.E. further noted that the DTP had been the object of many sets of criminal proceedings and that its members had failed to condemn terrorist attacks (see paragraph\u00a012 of the judgment). He maintained that as a Turkish nationalist he would be proud of committing an offence against the applicant if his words were to be seen as an offence. It appears from both his article and Mr I.E.\u2019s statements to the Bolu public prosecutor that the author held the DTP members listed in the article, including the applicant, responsible for the killing of security forces in the context of the conflict in south-east Turkey, since, in the author\u2019s view, they had not condemned the killings of the security officers. Moreover, after listing the names of the applicant and other well-known members of the DTP, Mr I.E. stated that those persons were the enemy of the Turkish nation and invited \u201ccivilian patriots\u201d to target them. He claimed that it was the majority\u2019s desire to see that, for every security officer who was killed, one of those people should share the same fate (see paragraph 10 of the judgment).",

I therefore consider that Mr I.E.\u2019s article contained incitement to hatred and violence against a group of persons, including the applicant, on account of their political identity and expressed intolerance towards them through aggressive nationalism. The expressions contained in the article may even be described as hate speech in the light of the definition set out in the Appendix to Recommendation no.\u00a0R\u00a0(97) 20 of the Committee of Ministers to member States of the Council of Europe.",

The Bolu public prosecutor considered that the DTP had not condemned the PKK\u2019s activities and had failed to share the view of society and the State (see paragraph 13 of the judgment). It appears that the Bolu public prosecutor\u2019s conclusion that there was a factual basis for Mr\u00a0I.E.\u2019s statements in his article was founded on this perceived failure by the DTP members to react to the PKK\u2019s activities. In my view, this could not serve as the basis of statements such as \u201cthe real murderers\u201d or \u201cthe instigators of the terrorists\u201d.
