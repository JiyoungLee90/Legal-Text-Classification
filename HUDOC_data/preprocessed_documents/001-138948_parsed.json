The binding nature of Security Council decisions concerning measures taken in accordance with Articles 39, 41 and 42 to maintain or restore international peace and security also stems from Article\u00a048, paragraph 2, of the Charter, which provides that such decisions must be carried out by the members of the United Nations directly and through their action in the appropriate international agencies of which they are members. The mandatory effect of Security Council decisions is the basis for the similar effect of decisions taken by subsidiary organs such as the Sanctions Committees (see Eric Suy and Nicolas Angelet in Jean-Pierre Cot, Alain Pellet and Mathias Forteau, La Charte des Nations Unies, commentaire article par article, 3rd edition, Economica 2005, Article 25, pp. 915 et seq.).",

Some authors take the view that the rights and prohibitions listed in Article 4, paragraph 2, ICCPR and Article 15, paragraph\u00a02, ECHR correspond to the core human rights and could therefore be regarded as peremptory norms of international law (see Stefan Oeter, \u2018Ius cogens und der Schutz der Menschenrechte\u2019, in Liber amicorum Luzius Wildhaber 2007, pp. 499 et seq. and pp. 507 et seq.); for other authors the provisions merely point in that direction (see Eva Kornicker, op. cit., pp. 58 et seq.). The latter opinion seems to correspond to that of the (former) Commission on Human Rights, which found that the list of rights from which Article 4, paragraph 2, ICCPR authorised no derogation might admittedly be linked, but not assimilated, to the question whether certain human rights corresponded to peremptory norms of general international law (General Comments 29/72 of 24 July 2001 based on Article 40, paragraph 4, ICCPR, ch. 11, in Manfred Nowak, U.N.

Similarly, the list of individuals and entities drawn up by Sanctions Committee 1518 is not indicative in nature. It is not a matter of deciding whether the appellant\u2019s name should be, or is legitimately, included on that list, it can only be observed that his name does appear on the list in question, which must be transposed into Swiss domestic law. In asserting that it should be possible to deal separately with the question of the confiscation of his assets, the appellant loses sight of the fact that the measures imposed on member States include the immediate transfer of the frozen assets to the Development Fund for Iraq. This order does not call for any interpretation, nor does it grant any latitude in the result that it requires of member States as to the treatment of the frozen assets of persons who, like the appellant, are included in particular on the list of Sanctions Committee 1518.

Switzerland cannot, by itself, delete the appellant\u2019s name from the list established by the Sanctions Committee, which has sole competence for that purpose, even if the procedure for that purpose is not fully satisfactory (see judgment 1A.45/2007 of 14 November 2007, point 8.3). Moreover, it is not contradictory for the federal authorities to find the system deficient and yet, as in the present case, to advocate and act on a political level in favour of an intangible respect for human rights, especially in respect of the listing and delisting procedures applied by Sanctions Committee 1518. Switzerland\u2019s conduct does not therefore breach Articles 26 and 29 et seq. of the Constitution, Articles\u00a06 and 13 ECHR or Article 14 ICCPR, under that head either.",

The considerations in this respect, set out by the Court of Justice at paragraphs 323 to 325 of Kadi, in particular with regard to the focal point, remain fundamentally valid today, even if account is taken of the \u2018Office of the Ombudsperson\u2019, the creation of which was decided in principle by Resolution 1904 (2009) and which has very recently been set up. In essence, the Security Council has still not deemed it appropriate to establish an independent and impartial body responsible for hearing and determining, as regards matters of law and fact, actions against individual decisions taken by the Sanctions Committee. Furthermore, neither the focal point mechanism nor the Office of the Ombusdperson affects the principle that removal of a person from the Sanctions Committee\u2019s list requires consensus within the committee. Moreover, the evidence which may be disclosed to the person concerned continues to be a matter entirely at the discretion of the State which proposed that he be included on the Sanctions Committee\u2019s list and there is no mechanism to ensure that sufficient information be made available to the person concerned in order to allow him to defend himself effectively (he need not even be informed of the identity of the State which has requested his inclusion on the Sanctions Committee\u2019s list). For those reasons at least, the creation of the focal point and the Office of the Ombudsperson cannot be equated with the provision of an effective judicial procedure for review of decisions of the Sanctions Committee (see also, in that regard, the observations made at paragraphs 77, 78, 149, 181, 182 and 239 of the UK Supreme Court judgment in Ahmed and Others and the considerations expressed in Point III of the Ninth Report of the Monitoring Committee).",

At paragraph 358 of its judgment in Kadi, the Court of Justice had already noted that the measure freezing his funds entailed a restriction of the exercise of the applicant\u2019s right to property that had to be classified as considerable, having regard to the general application of the measure and the fact that it had been applied to him since 20 October 2001. In Ahmed and Others (paragraphs 60 and 192), the UK Supreme Court took the view that it was no exaggeration to say that persons designated in this way are effectively \u2018prisoners\u2019 of the State: their freedom of movement is severely restricted without access to their funds and the effect of the freeze on both them and their families can be devastating.",

The same is true of the statement of the Security Council, repeated on a number of occasions, in particular in Resolution 1822 (2008), that the measures in question \u2018are preventative in nature and are not reliant upon criminal standards set out under national law\u2019. In the scale of a human life, 10 years in fact represent a substantial period of time and the question of the classification of the measures in question as preventative or punitive, protective or confiscatory, civil or criminal seems now to be an open one (see also, in that connection, the Ninth Report of the Monitoring Team, paragraph 34).

Even if the Council itself is not formally bound by international human rights law when acting under Chapter VII (a proposition that is heavily disputed), there is no doubt that Member States are bound by human rights obligations when implementing Council decisions. Experience has shown that the absence of an independent judicial review mechanism at the United Nations level has seriously undermined the effectiveness and the perceived legitimacy of the regime. National and regional courts and treaty bodies, recognizing that they have no jurisdiction to review Council decisions per se, have focused their attention instead on domestic measures of implementation, assessing their compatibility with fundamental norms of due process.

Of much greater practical significance, however, was the Court\u2019s finding of a violation under article 13 of the Convention (the right to an effective domestic remedy). The Court concluded that in the absence of effective judicial review at the United Nations level, there was a duty on State parties to the Convention to provide an effective remedy under national law. This implied a full review on fact and law by an entity with jurisdiction to determine whether the measures were justified and proportionate in the individual case and power to order their removal. The Nada Judgement thus echoes the approach of the European Court of Justice and the General Court in the Kadi litigation, holding that regional implementing measures taken by the European Commission were to be judged against human rights standards binding on the Community institutions. However, the principle in the Nada case has wider geographical ramifications than the Kadi litigation since it applies to all 47 member States of the Council of Europe, including three permanent members of the Security Council.",

The first Ombudsperson, Kimberly Prost, a former ad litem judge of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 with 20 years experience as a federal prosecutor in Canada, was appointed by the Secretary-General on 3 June 2010.

This principle does not depend upon a perception that the existence of such a power might indirectly influence the manner in which such a body handles and decides cases.

G answers to that description because he has been designated by the 1267 Committee. What he needs if he is to be afforded an effective remedy is a means of subjecting that listing to judicial review. This is something that, under the system that the 1267 Committee currently operates, is denied to him. I would hold that article 3(1)(b) of the AQO [al-Qaeda Order], which has this effect, is ultra vires section 1 of the 1946 Act.

The impugned measures were thus taken in the wake of an armed conflict, which originated in 1990. Therefore, more differentiated and specifically targeted measures would probably have been more conducive to the effective implementation of the resolutions (see, to the same effect, Nada, cited above, \u00a7 186, where the Court found that the maintaining or even reinforcement of the impugned measures over the years had to be explained and justified convincingly by the domestic authorities).",

According to the majority, a condition for restricting the applicants\u2019 right of access to a court on account of obligations for the respondent State under other international instruments must be the establishment of \u201can equal protection\u201d within the relevant international organisation.

Such an obligation follows from Article 25 of the Charter, pursuant to which the member States are obliged \u201cto accept and carry out\u201d the decisions of the Security Council.",

Furthermore, in the Nada case (Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no.\u00a010593/08, \u00a7\u00a0180, ECHR 2012) the Court found that Switzerland \u201cenjoyed some latitude, which was admittedly limited but nevertheless real, in implementing the relevant binding resolutions of the UN Security Council\u201d.",

Even if there are no indications in Resolution 1483 (2003) that it was the intention that member States should take measures in conflict with such obligations, it remains nevertheless clear that the resolution imposes an unconditional obligation on member States to freeze certain funds or other financial assets and to transfer them to the Development Fund for Iraq. It is undisputed that the assets of the applicants, who were on the list established under Resolution 1518 (2003), were covered by that obligation. The majority have accordingly, like the Swiss Federal Court, concluded that these resolutions \u201c[did] not confer on the States concerned any discretion in the implementation of the obligations arising thereunder\u201d (paragraph 117 of the judgment).

In this respect I entirely share the detailed and convincing analysis of the Federal Court, which concludes that in case of a conflict between the obligations under Article 103 of the Charter and obligations under the Convention, States parties to both legal instruments are bound to give the Charter obligations priority. According to the interpretation of the International Court of Justice, the obligations under Article 103 of the Charter include those stemming from the measures adopted by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter. I likewise agree that no other result can in the present case be justified by jus cogens, as the right of access to a court clearly does not belong to such norms. I furthermore observe that the case before the Federal Court only concerned the claim that the decision to confiscate the applicants\u2019 assets should be annulled and that they were heard before the decision on confiscation was taken and during the Federal Court proceedings. Even though the proceedings thus did not, as such, concern the question whether the applicants had rightly or wrongly been placed on the list under Resolution 1518 (2003), the Federal Court accorded them further time in order to address to the UN Sanctions Committee a new request to have their names deleted from the list. I have noted the judgments of the European Court of Justice in Kadi and the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in Ahmed and others but have not found that in the circumstances of the present case they could lead to a different result. The Kadi case exclusively related to a measure adopted by an institution within the legal system of the European Union, which is not itself a party to the UN Charter.",

The Resolution states expressly that the situation in Iraq continues to threaten international peace and security, and in any event it is not for the Court to make an assessment of whether the Security Council was justified in prescribing the measures in the Resolution.",

Furthermore in respect of the right of access to a court, this can be said to follow already from the Court\u2019s interpretation of Article 6. The right of access to a court is thus not absolute, but may be subject to limitations permitted by implication. Even if these limitations may normally not restrict or reduce that right to such an extent that its very essence is impaired, there are examples where the Court has accepted limitations which left little, if anything at all, of the right of access to a court (see, for example, concerning State immunity, Al-Adsani v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97, ECHR 2001XI, and concerning parliamentary immunity, A. v. the United Kingdom, no. 35373/97, ECHR 2002X).
