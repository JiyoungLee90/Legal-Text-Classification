If the Judicial Committee had upheld the application, it could only have set aside the impugned orders and remitted the case to the Minister of State, so that he could take a fresh decision.  It could not have ordered repayment of sums paid without legal cause as, under Article 84 of the Constitution, only the ordinary courts were empowered to determine civil rights. Moreover, the Government continued, even if an application to the ordinary courts had been possible, no decision could have been given in Procola's favour, since the association as such had never had a legally enforceable claim.  The application could not have led to either repayment of the additional levies to Procola or the award of any compensation as, under the system adopted by Luxembourg, the levy, although imposed on the purchaser, was passed on by the latter only to those producers who had exceeded their quota (see paragraph 18 above).
