The case originated in an application (no. 9062/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Igor Petrovich Kachanov on 13 February 2004.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 30 May 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Shakhtаrsk, the  region.
On 20 October 2000 the Shakhtаrsk City Court (Шахтарський міський суд Донецької області) awarded the applicant 4,815.28 hryvnyas (UAH) in salary arrears and compensations from his former employer, the Municipal Communal Service Department (“the Company,” Шахтарське міське госпрозрахункове управління комунального господарства).
This judgment was not appealed against, became final and the enforcement proceedings were instituted to collect the judgment debt.
On 7 April 2003 the Company was declared bankrupt and subsequently liquidated.
The applicant unsuccessfully attempted to seek compensation from the Bailiffs for their failure to enforce the judgment.
The judgment remains unenforced to the present date.
The relevant domestic law is set out in the judgment of 27 July 2004 in the case of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-19).
