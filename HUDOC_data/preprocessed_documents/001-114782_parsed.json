The first is functional in nature: where the judge\u2019s personal conduct is not at all impugned, but where, for instance, the exercise of different functions within the judicial process by the same person, objectively justify misgivings as to the impartiality of the tribunal, which thus fails to meet the Convention standard under the objective test. The second is of a personal character and derives from the conduct of the judges in a given case. In terms of the objective test, such conduct may be sufficient to ground legitimate and objectively justified apprehensions, but it may also be of such a nature as to raise an issue under the subjective test and even disclose personal bias. In this context, therefore, whether a case falls to be dealt with under one test or the other, or both, will depend on the particular facts of the contested conduct (Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2005-XIII.",
