The bruising of the applicant\u2019s left arm could have resulted from having arm locks applied to him while he was being moved.

Clearly, the resort to EDW in such situations must be strictly circumscribed. The guidance found by the CPT in some countries, to the effect that these weapons may be used when law enforcement officials are facing violence \u2013 or a threat of violence \u2013 of such a level that they would need to use force to protect themselves or others, is so broad as to leave the door open to a disproportionate response.

In the former, the weapon fires projectiles which attach to the person targeted at a\u00a0short distance from each other, and an electrical discharge is generated. In the great majority of cases, this discharge provokes generalised muscular contraction which induces temporary paralysis and causes the person concerned to fall to the ground. In contrast, when the \u2018contact\u2019 mode is used, electrodes on the end of the weapon produce an electrical arc and when they are brought into contact with the person targeted the electrodes cause very intense, localised pain, with the possibility of burns to the skin. The CPT has strong reservations concerning this latter mode of use. Indeed, properly trained law enforcement officials will have many other control techniques available to them when they are in touching distance of a person who has to be brought under control.",

The prosecutor appeared to acknowledge that no other coercive measures had been used against the applicant (see paragraphs 32-33 and 35 above). The Government contended that the use of coercive measures had been prompted by the applicant\u2019s refusal to follow police orders (see paragraph\u00a064 above). The applicant, on the other hand, claimed that he had followed orders and nonetheless had been hit and kicked by the officers (see paragraphs 20 and 58 above). Having regard to the conflicting evidence as well as to the shortcomings identified in the investigation (see paragraphs\u00a090-94 below), the Court is unable to determine whether the use of force by the police during the first stage of the operation was excessive (see, mutatis mutandis, Karbowniczek v. Poland, no. 22339/08, \u00a7 58, 27\u00a0September 2011).

The forensic expert observed that the bruising of the face and torso could have resulted from kicks. These findings appear to be consistent with the applicant\u2019s account of his arrest. On the basis of the available material, the Court is not in a position to determine exactly how the impugned injuries were inflicted on the applicant\u2019s face, his left arm and the side of his torso. It notes that the prosecutor did not explain the origin of those injuries, but found that she could not attribute them to the actions of the police officers. Instead, the prosecutor somehow suggested that the injuries had been the side-effect of the police operation that had had to be carried out swiftly. The Court cannot accept this assertion. It finds that neither the prosecutor nor the Government provided the evidence that the applicant had engaged in any conduct in the period following his immobilisation that might have justified the use of force against him which had resulted in the impugned injuries. Accordingly, the Government have failed to demonstrate that the use of force by the police during that stage of the police operation was strictly necessary.",

The investigation did not elucidate this important fact, beyond the general finding that the weapon had been used in accordance with the procedure. The applicant claimed that the officers had used the EDW repeatedly on different parts of his body. That claim of repeated use appears to be corroborated by the forensic expert\u2019s finding that the angular abrasions on the applicant\u2019s back could have resulted from the use of this kind of weapon. The manner of the use of the EDW and the marks that it left on the applicant\u2019s back would correspond to the use of EDW in \u201ccontact\u201d (drive-stun) mode. The CPT noted that this mode of use causes very intense, localised pain, with the possibility of burns to the skin (see paragraph 53 above).",
