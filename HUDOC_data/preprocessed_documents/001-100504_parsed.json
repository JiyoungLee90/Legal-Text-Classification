It serves merely to 'remind' the courts of the risks normally posed by those to whom section 25 applies and 'will merely assist the court to adopt a proper approach' in relation to bail in their cases.

He has to rebut a presumption and if he fails to do so is to be denied bail. True it is, as [counsel for the defendant] himself accepted, that in the vast majority of cases the court will reach a clear view one way or the other whether the conditions for withholding bail specified by Schedule 1 to the Bail Act are satisfied. But just occasionally the court will be left unsure as to whether the defendant should be released on bail\u2014the only situation in which the burden of proof assumes any relevance\u2014and in my judgment bail would then have to be granted.

He also observed that the applicant had dispensed with his lawyers and had them reinstated on no fewer than four occasions, two of which had caused delay. A further five months' delay was caused by the applicant's decision to reject the offer of a January 2003 trial date in favour of a date in June 2003, to suit his counsel's convenience. Lord Brown noted that it was unclear, in the absence of a transcript of the court's decision of 7 June 2002 or any further information on the subject, why the lower court was not satisfied that the prosecution had acted with all due diligence and expedition in relation to disclosure. However, he concluded that even where there was a lack of due diligence under domestic law, this was not in itself sufficient to establish the lack of \u201cspecial diligence\u201d required for a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3.

Grisez illustrates the point well: the ultimate question addressed by the court was whether 'the total length of the detention pending trial appear[ed] excessive'. So too in Contrada: the court took account of the trial court's post-delay offer to increase the rate of the hearings (akin perhaps to the offer of a January 2003 trial date in the present case, similarly declined). The domestic court, by contrast, is inevitably having to decide a much narrower question and within a shorter time-frame. And it is doing so within the strict confines of section 22(3) which, despite the marked similarity between its language and that used in Strasbourg, in fact imposes a more rigid formula for the extension of custody time limits than  does with regard to the reasonable time guarantee under article 5(3). For my part I would not expect there to be many cases where, as here, bail is refused notwithstanding the court's refusal to extend the custody time limit. But I conclude that there is no necessary inconsistency between the two and that Article 5(3) is not necessarily breached. Nor, in my judgment, is there any other reason for thinking that this appellant was wrongly refused bail: on the contrary, the case for his continued detention in custody appears to have been a strong one.\u201d",

The court made plain in ex parte McDonald, as indeed is plain on the face of the statute, that when seeking an extension or a further extension of a custody time limit the Crown must show that there is good and sufficient [cause] for making the extension and that it has acted with all due expedition. What, however, was not made plain in ex parte McDonald (because the question did not arise) is that these two provisions are in my judgment linked. It is not in doubt that the Crown must show proper grounds for keeping a defendant in prison awaiting trial for a period longer than the statutory maximum. But the Crown must also show that such an extension is not sought because it has shown insufficient vigour in preparing the case for trial. Put crudely, the prosecution cannot prepare for trial in a dilatory and negligent manner and then come to the court to seek an extension of the custody time limit because the prosecution is not ready for trial. Nor, if the effect of its dilatoriness is to put the defence in a position where the defence is not ready for the trial can the Crown seek an extension and show that it has acted with all due expedition. It is in the ordinary way the business of the prosecution to be ready. If therefore the Crown is seeking an extension of the time limit it must show that the need for the extension does not arise from lack of due expedition or due diligence on its part. It seems clear to me, however, that the requirement of due expedition or due diligence or both is not a disciplinary provision. It is not there to punish prosecutors for administrative lapses; it is there to protect defendants by ensuring that they are kept in prison awaiting trial no longer than is justifiable. That is why due expedition is called for. The court is not in my view obliged to refuse the extension of a custody time limit because the prosecution is shown to have been guilty of avoidable delay where that delay has had no effect whatever on the ability of the prosecution and the defence to be ready for trial on a predetermined trial date.\u201d",

In the applicant's view, at this point, the balancing exercise between the public interest in continued detention and the presumption of innocence tipped in favour of the latter. He did not dispute that the charges against him were serious, but argued that there were a number of flaws in the prosecution case including the delay in the making of the complaint to the police and inconsistent telephone record data. He\u00a0further emphasised that he had no previous convictions for failing to surrender, for interfering with witnesses or for otherwise obstructing the course of justice and that his previous convictions did not support the conclusion that he was likely to commit further offences while on bail.",

He recalled the need to interpret the provisions of the Convention in a manner which was practical and effective and not theoretical or illusory. It was open to Judge Norris, on 7 June 2002, to find that there had been prosecutorial delay but that this had not impacted on the ability to try the applicant within a reasonable time. The applicant pointed out that under the applicable domestic law at the time, it was clear that not every finding of a lack of diligence would result in the domestic courts refusing to extend the custody time limits (citing R (Quereshi and\u00a0Others) \u2013 see paragraph 49 above). He submitted that in that case, Lord Bingham CJ's reference to the requirement for due diligence operating as a protection for defendants by ensuring that they were not kept in custody pending trial for longer than was justifiable was identical to the requirement in Article 5 \u00a7 3 that a defendant is entitled to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial. The applicant argued that this must have been the approach adopted by Judge Norris on 7 June 2002 and that his refusal to extend the custody time limits must therefore have been due to his conclusion that the lack of due diligence by the prosecution had adversely impacted upon the possibility of his trial taking place within a reasonable time.",

Further, the applicant had previous convictions, including for rape and for an offence of violence, and the seriousness of those offences was reflected in the fourteen year prison sentence imposed. He was now accused of another rape, alleged to have been carried out in similar circumstances, where his defence was unclear and changing. Although the applicant had originally denied having sexual intercourse with the complainant, DNA evidence obtained by the prosecution revealed that the child was his. He had announced an intention to challenge this evidence but had failed to take up the opportunity to arrange his own DNA test. At one stage he had referred to a defence of \u201cautomatism\u201d but at the hearing of 9 December 2002, when questioned on the matter by Judge Sanders, his counsel was unable to provide any further particulars (see paragraphs 25-26above).

They further did not accept that it could be inferred from the refusal to extend the custody time limit that the judge had concluded that the applicant had not been, or could not be, tried within a reasonable time. They noted in particular that on 7 June 2002, the applicant had been detained for only six months and that a first trial date set for April 2002 had been vacated as a result of the applicant's conduct in dismissing and then reinstating his legal team. A second trial date in June 2002 was vacated for the same reason. The\u00a0finding that the prosecution had failed to act with all due diligence related to disclosure only, and no other instances of delay were found. The\u00a0applicant does not allege that the prosecution caused delay after 7\u00a0June\u00a02002 and it was clear that all such delay was caused by the conduct and the decisions of the applicant. In this regard the Government emphasised that in assessing whether there has been a breach of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03, this Court takes into consideration the whole period the accused has spent in detention and all the circumstances and special features of his case (citing Punzelt v. the Czech Republic, no. 31315/96, \u00a7 73, 25 April 2000). By contrast, in considering whether to extend the custody time limit the domestic court considers only the position at the point at which the application to extend is made. Accordingly, a failure on the part of the prosecuting authorities which has led to some element of delay in the proceedings could result in a refusal to extend the custody time limit notwithstanding the fact that, if the period of detention were examined in its entirety and all the facts of the case taken into account, there would be no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (citing Contrada v. Italy, 24 August 1998, \u00a7 67, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998V; Grisez v. Belgium, no.\u00a035776/97, \u00a7 53, 26 September 2002; and Wardle, cited above).",

He did not contest that his pre-trial detention prior to 7 June 2002 was in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 3, nor did he complain that, before or after 7 June 2002, there were in his case no specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighed the rule of respect for individual liberty laid down in Article 5 of the Convention. Accordingly, the Court will proceed on the basis that there were sufficient reasons for the applicant's continued detention and will limit its examination to whether the national authorities displayed \u201cspecial\u00a0diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings.",

The period in question thus amounted to one year, three\u00a0months and eighteen days. However, the Court will also bear in mind that as at 7 June 2002, the applicant had already been in detention for a period of six months (see, mutatis mutandis, Jablonski v. Poland, no.\u00a033492/96, \u00a7 66, 21 December 2000; Kalashnikov v. Russia, no.\u00a047095/99, \u00a7 111, ECHR 2002VI; and Sta\u0161aitis v.

No further details of this failing have been provided and no subsequent failing on the part of the prosecuting authorities has been alleged by the applicant. Like the Government, the Court does not consider that \u201cdue diligence\u201d in terms of section 22(3) of the 1985 Act (see paragraph 46 above) can be equated to \u201cspecial diligence\u201d as required by Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. Although in R (Quereshi and Others) (see paragraph 49 above) Lord Bingham CJ explained that there was in his view no obligation on domestic courts to refuse an extension where the prosecution was guilty of avoidable delay, provided that the delay had no effect on the ability of both parties to be ready for trial on a predetermined date, there is no evidence in the present case to suggest that the Crown Court on 7 June 2002 proceeded on the basis that the delay in disclosure by the prosecution had affected the possibility of trial within a reasonable time. It is to be noted in this regard that by the time of the court's June 2002 ruling, the trial had already been vacated twice due to the conduct of the applicant (see paragraphs 11-15 above). In particular, in finding in June 2002 that the prosecution had not acted with all due diligence, there is no evidence that the Crown Court made its assessment by reference to the need for \u201cspecial diligence\u201d under Article 5 \u00a7 3 or with regard to the criteria established in the jurisprudence of this Court. Unlike the approach of the domestic courts to compliance with the 1985 Act, in assessing compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3, this Court will examine the proceedings as a whole and assess any particular periods of inactivity or delay by the authorities within the context of the overall period of pre-trial detention, with particular regard to any recognition by the authorities of the length of time already spent in detention and the need to take additional steps to bring about a more speedy trial (Grisez, cited above, \u00a7 53; Contrada, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067; and Pantano v. Italy, no. 60851/00, \u00a7\u00a7 72-74, 6 November 2003).",

As noted above, within that six month period, the trial had twice been vacated as a result of the applicant's conduct (see\u00a0paragraph 73 above).",

A hearing scheduled for October 2002 to consider preliminary matters of law did not take place as the applicant had once again dismissed his legal advisers (see paragraph 17 above). The trial in November 2002 subsequently had to be vacated due to difficulties with the jury (see paragraph 19 above), a matter in respect of which no blame can be attributed to either party. When the case came before a different court less than a month later, in December 2002, a trial date of January 2003 was offered to the applicant. Despite the fact that the judge made it clear that the applicant would remain in detention until trial and suggested on several occasions that the applicant consider the January trial date, the applicant insisted on postponing the trial until June 2003, some five months after the date offered, in order to ensure the availability of his preferred counsel (see paragraphs 23-27 above). It is clear that even by this stage, the applicant had failed to obtain the DNA evidence which he had previously indicated he required for his defence and had not yet clarified the nature of his defence to the charges (see paragraph 25 above). Neither the applicant nor the Government have explained why the trial in fact commenced on 1 September 2003, and not in June as previously agreed.",

Italy, cited above, \u00a7 72). In particular, the Court considers that the applicant substantially contributed to the overall length of his pre-trial detention through his conduct of his defence and his choices regarding his legal representation. On several occasions, he dismissed his legal advisers shortly before hearings, which resulted in the hearings being postponed. In particular, his decision to refuse the January 2003 trial date had a significant impact on the duration of his detention. While the applicant was entitled to be represented by legal counsel of his own choosing and no blame can be attributed to him for insisting on the presence of his preferred counsel at trial, he must nonetheless bear the reasonable consequences of his choices on the overall length of his pre-trial detention (see, mutatis mutandis, W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 254A). The Court further observes that throughout this period, it was open to the applicant to make a bail application on the traditional grounds, namely to argue that the conditions for refusing bail were no longer valid in his case. Indeed, a total of six bail applications were made on this basis prior to December 2002 (see\u00a0paragraphs 9-11 and 14-16 above).",
