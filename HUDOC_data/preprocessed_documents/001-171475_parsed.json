In particular, since the first applicant had resigned from military service in connection with family circumstances, his situation fell within the ambit of paragraph 3, not paragraph 1 of Article\u00a0132 of the Housing Code. Accordingly, his family could only be evicted from the accommodation reserved for military personnel if they had been provided with other comparable accommodation.

On numerous occasions the Court has held that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. This applies, in particular, to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature such as time-limits governing the submission of documents or lodging of appeals. The Court\u2019s role is, however, to ascertain whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Muscat v. Malta, no.\u00a024197/10, \u00a7\u00a043, 17\u00a0July 2012 with further references). The Court\u2019s approach in this respect has been that procedural limitations will not be compatible with Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 if they do not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved. Overall, procedural rules must not restrict or reduce a person\u2019s access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired (see, as a recent authority, Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2016).",

At the same time, the length of the period during which such a leave can be requested is not short in absolute terms.

Insofar as an allegation has been made that earlier enquiries were made orally and did not yield any meaningful response (see paragraph 17 above), it is to be noted that the applicants, represented by a lawyer in the Convention proceedings, did not provide any details necessary for the Court to establish and examine the relevant facts.

In this regard it observes, firstly, that the 1963\u00a0Code established a number of procedural time-limits for processing appeals at the second instance (see paragraph 27 above). Notably, according to Articles 299 and 300, preparatory measures with a view to scheduling the case for the appeal hearing were expected to be completed within ten days of assigning the case to a judge, and the hearing itself was to be scheduled within one month of the completion of its preparation. It appears that by consulting the text of these provisions, if need be, with the assistance of a lawyer, the applicants could reasonably expect that, in compliance with the statutory time-limits, an appeal lodged in December 2003 could be examined sometimes before March 2004. Accordingly, it appears that absence of any news from the Court of Appeal, which was bound by applicable law to notify the parties of the date of the hearing (see paragraph\u00a027 above) within this period suggested an irregularity in the proceedings, which might have prompted the applicants to take action in order to protect their interests (compare and contrast Zavodnik, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a078 and 80, where the Court decided that it was unrealistic to expect of the applicant to regularly consult the court\u2019s notice board to find out the date of a hearing, which took eight years to be scheduled).",

Having examined the text of the applicable legal provisions, the Court finds it improbable that the applicants would remain unaware of the outcome of the appeal proceedings after having been evicted on 28\u00a0April 2004. It appears from the provisions of the 1963 Code and the Enforcement Act (see paragraphs 33 and\u00a037 above) that, as a precondition for implementing the eviction order, a bailiff was supposed to notify the applicants that this order had gained legal effect following the conclusion of the appeal proceedings on 29\u00a0January 2004, which, in the present case meant that the first applicant\u2019s appeal had been dismissed. Even assuming that it was not done, or that there might have been a misunderstanding, as a result of which the applicants genuinely continued to believe that the appeal proceedings were still pending as of April\u00a02004, it remained open to them to oppose the enforcement, particularly as the 1963 Code expressly prohibited eviction from residential premises while appeal proceedings were pending (see paragraph 33 above). Based on the case file, it appears that the applicants did not take any action to oppose the enforcement or have it stayed. It is true that they were apparently not represented by a lawyer in the appeal proceedings, which may have made it more difficult for them to orient themselves in the procedural rules.

His status was therefore not comparable to that of temporary employees or people who had resigned on non-serious grounds, within the meaning of Article\u00a0132 of the Housing Code and other similar provisions.

It also observes that since the applicants failed to appeal in cassation against the decision of 29\u00a0January 2004 within the one-month statutory time-limit, it became final in February\u00a02004 and was enforced, according to the applicants\u2019 submissions, in April 2004. In the meantime, the present application was not lodged until May\u00a02006. However, the Court does not find it necessary to examine whether the applicants, who alleged that the above-mentioned decision had not been notified to them in good time, complied with the six-month rule in the present case, as it considers that their complaint under Article 8 is in any event manifestly ill-founded.",

The decision-making process leading to the measures of interference must also have been fair. The Court will therefore attach particular weight to the existence of procedural safeguards available to applicants at risk of an interference of this magnitude for protecting their interests (see Rousk v. Sweden, no.\u00a027183/04, \u00a7\u00a0137, 25\u00a0July 2013). At the same time, Article\u00a08 of the Convention does not give a right to be provided with a home or to reside in a particular property (see, among other authorities, Chapman v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a027238/95, \u00a7\u00a099, ECHR\u00a02001-I).",

This entitlement had therefore terminated upon the first applicant\u2019s resignation and his family was accordingly obliged under Article\u00a0132 paragraph\u00a01 of the Housing Code to vacate the disputed premises. In so far as the applicants considered that this conclusion was incorrect, and that they were, in fact, entitled to permanent accommodation under the domestic legal provisions, the Court reiterates that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. It will not substitute its own interpretation for theirs in the absence of manifest arbitrariness (see, among other authorities, Orli\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a048833/07, \u00a7\u00a061, 21\u00a0June 2011).

The Court concludes that the same considerations are pertinent for examining the present complaint under Article\u00a08. It finds that the domestic law contained sufficient procedural safeguards enabling the applicants to contest the purported flaws in the appellate proceedings (such as a one-year time-limit for requesting leave to appeal in cassation out of time and to complain to the Supreme Court about the failure to notify them of the appeal hearing). The fact that the applicants did not avail themselves of the relevant opportunities in good time cannot be imputed to the State. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the decision-making process leading to the applicants\u2019 eviction was accompanied by the requisite safeguards enabling them to defend their interests.",

On a number of occasions the Court has found a violation of the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their home on the grounds that the national courts had not carried out the proportionality test when eviction orders had been issued (see, among other authorities, McCann, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050; Kryvitska and Kryvitskyy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050-52; Yordanova and Others v.

At the same time, the Court has also emphasised in its case-law that the proportionality issue does not arise automatically in each case concerning an eviction dispute. If an applicant wishes to raise an Article\u00a08 defence to prevent eviction, it is for him to do so and for a court to uphold or dismiss the claim (see Orli\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066).",

The second applicant did not avail herself of the opportunity to lodge an ordinary appeal. Moreover, as already mentioned in the Court\u2019s Article\u00a06 analysis, the applicants apparently did not contest the institution of the enforcement proceedings with a view to evicting them, request a stay of execution, or take any active steps to find out about the outcome of the first applicant\u2019s appeal proceedings until more than a year after having been evicted. Based on the material presented, the Court cannot discern that their eviction from the Z. Street accommodation actually constituted a disproportionate burden on them or that they at least raised a relevant argument in a manner obliging the domestic judicial authorities to give full consideration to their personal situation.",
