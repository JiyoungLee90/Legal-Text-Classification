Accordingly, the applicant is still entitled to recover the principal amount of the debt in the course of domestic proceedings. The Court recalls that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Makarova and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a07023/03, \u00a7 47, 24 February 2005 and Poznakhirina v. Russia, \nno. 25964/02, \u00a7 33, 24 February 2005). The Court finds that in the present case the same principle applies, having regard to the violations found. It therefore considers that the Government should secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the award made by the domestic courts. It further considers that the adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value (see Gizzatova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 5124/03, \u00a7\u00a028, 13 January 2005; Metaxas v. Greece, no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 27 May 2004). The applicant produced a certificate by the National Bank of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya) showing the inflation rate in the period from July 1998 to \nJuly 2006. As the Government did not comment on the applicant's method of calculation of compensation, the Court accepts the applicant's claim in respect of the pecuniary damage caused by inflation losses. The Court notes, nevertheless, that the period referred to by the applicant starts when the applicant should have received the award for his work from the debtor, e.g. in July 1999. However, the Court considers that the period to be taken into the consideration starts in June 2002 when the judgment securing the friendly settlement was delivered and entered into force. Having regard to the materials in its possession and the fact that the Government did not furnish any objection as to the applicant's method of calculation of compensation, the Court awards the applicant EUR 750 in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable.",
