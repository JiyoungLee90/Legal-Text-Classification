It observes that the first sentence of Article 2 \u00a7 1 enjoins the State not only to refrain from the unlawful taking of life, but also to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction (see, among other authorities, L.C.B.\u00a0v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 9 June 1998, \u00a7 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998III; Gorovenky and Bugara v.

This positive obligation imposes above all a duty on the State to put in place a legislative and administrative framework for the regulation of dangerous activities, where special emphasis must be placed on regulations geared to the special features of the activity in question, particularly with regard to the level of the potential risk to human life (see, among other authorities, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

The training exercise was aimed at developing skills when searching for and arresting dangerous criminals and involved the use of special means, including firearms and live ammunition, by the police officers involved. The Court considers that holding the police training exercise under such conditions increased the risk to life in respect of both the police personnel involved and all other persons who happened to be in the vicinity, since the training was conducted in the city, and access to the training area had not been restricted in any way. Given the nature of the exercise, the State could not shift all responsibility onto only one of its agents but was under an obligation to put in place adequate regulations to minimise any risk to life.",

Moreover, the decisions to terminate the criminal proceedings were quashed on numerous occasions because of a failure to conduct a proper investigation and, in addition, a key piece of evidence was lost by the investigating authorities, for which an investigating officer was disciplined. Although the reopening of a criminal investigation does not in itself constitute ultimate proof of its \u201cdeficiency\u201d in terms of the Court\u2019s case-law, the numerous reopenings (outlined in paragraphs 35-41 above) do indicate that insufficient attempts to establish the truth were made (see Belenko v.
