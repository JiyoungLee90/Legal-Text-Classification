It further observes that the  assessed certain parts of the impugned press statement as inciting people to hatred and hostility. The Court has examined the reasons given in the \u2019s judgment and does not consider them sufficient to justify the interference with the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression (see, mutatis mutandis, S\u00fcrek\u00a0v.\u00a0 (no. 4) [GC], no. 24762/94, \u00a7\u00a058, 8\u00a0July\u00a01999). It considers that, although certain particularly acerbic passages of the article paint an extremely negative picture of the  and thus give the narrative a hostile tone, they do not encourage violence, armed resistance or insurrection and do not constitute hate speech. In the Court\u2019s view, this is the essential factor (contrast S\u00fcrek v.  (no.\u00a01) [GC], no.\u00a026682/95, \u00a7\u00a062, ECHR 1999IV, and Gerger v.
