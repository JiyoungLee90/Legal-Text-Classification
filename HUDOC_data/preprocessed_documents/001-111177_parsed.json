In deciding to remand a person in custody a court was to examine if there were factual and legal grounds for the application of that preventive measure. If the extradition request was accompanied by a detention order of a foreign court, a prosecutor was entitled to remand the person in custody without a Russian court\u2019s authorisation (Article 466 \u00a7 2 of the CCrP) for a period not exceeding two months, and the prosecutor\u2019s decision could be challenged in the courts under Article 125 of the CCrP.",

To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Jalloh v.

The specificity of its task under Article\u00a019 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment.

According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.

The establishment of that responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of the situation in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention. Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the receiving country, whether under general international law, under the Convention or otherwise. In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may be incurred, it is liability incurred by the extraditing Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment (see Mamatkulov and Askarov v.

The words \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 do not merely refer back to domestic law; they also relate to the quality of this law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a046295/99, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR 2002-IV).

It is therefore immaterial, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national law or the Convention (see \u010conka v. , no. 51564/99, \u00a7\u00a038, ECHR 2002-I, and Chahal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0112).\u00a0Deprivation of liberty under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f) will be acceptable only for as long as extradition proceedings are in progress.

Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention. However, where domestic law provides for appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, for instance as concerns the speediness of the review by appeal proceedings (see Lebedev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 96, 25\u00a0October 2007). At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Where detention is authorised by a court, subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention. Therefore, the Court would not be concerned, to the same extent, with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees (ibid).",

The Court reiterates in that connection that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention does not require that the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or absconding. In this connection, Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d. It is therefore immaterial, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national or Convention law (see, among others, Liu v.

It appears that the major part of the delays \u2013 some ten and thirty days - related to the period of time when the case file was being transferred from the first-instance court to the appeal court.

As an argument against extradition, the applicant argued that he had amassed a significant period of residence in Russia, his spouse and children held Russian nationality, lived in Russia, had property there and the elder daughter needed medical treatment in Russia.",

It was also noted that for some two years his family had continued to reside in Uzbekistan after the applicant had left for  for employment-related purposes. For its part, the Court observes in that connection that it has not been substantiated that the applicant would have any significant difficulty in maintaining his family life after execution of the extradition order. In fact, it does not appear that the applicant\u2019s family members made any supporting statements in the domestic proceedings. On balance, it is unclear how and whether the extradition would particularly affect their relationship with the applicant.",
