The latter conclusion was based on the intelligence data obtained by the police to which neither the courts nor the Prosecutor's Office ever received full access.

Moreover, the authorities principally relied on the mandatory nature of the applicant's detention on remand in view of the charges against him (see paragraphs\u00a025, 26 and 28 above).

However, the issue which needs to be determined in the present case is not whether the law was compatible with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, but whether the authorities gave relevant and sufficient reasons for keeping the applicant deprived of his liberty. In this connection, the Court notes that the courts refused to examine the applicant's subsequent appeals against his house arrest because they found in their decisions of 11 and 28 December 2000 and also of 28\u00a0May 2001, that there were no new circumstances warranting a reevaluation of the imposed restriction on the applicant (see paragraphs\u00a031 and 33 above).",
