The case originated in an application (no. 29808/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Valeriu Avramenko (“the applicant”) on 11 June 2002.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Nagacevschi, from “Lawyers for Human Rights”, a non-governmental organisation based in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr A. Pârlog.
The applicant complained that the failure to enforce the judgment of 26 June 2002 violated his right to have his civil rights determined by a court within a reasonable time, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, and his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions, as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. He also complained about the examination of his case in his absence by the courts, contrary to his rights guaranteed under Article 6 of the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 24 September 2004 a Chamber of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant, Mr Valeriu Avramenko, is a Moldovan national, who was born in 1947 and lives in Bălţi.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
In May 1998 the Ministry of Privatisation and of State Property published its decision to sell shares in a State-owned transport company in Bălţi. An auction was announced for that purpose. The applicant participated in the auction and, through a broker, bought 26.033% of the company’s shares for 180,698.68 Moldovan lei (MDL) (approximately 34,484 euros (EUR)).
The Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications challenged in court the results of the auction, claiming that the correct procedure had not been followed (in particular, the name and address of the State company had been incorrectly presented, which resulted in a low public interest and low share prices).
On 24 July 1998 the Economic Court of Moldova annulled the decision of the Ministry of Privatisation and of State Property to offer the relevant shares at an auction.
The applicant unsuccessfully appealed to the Appeal Chamber of the  and the Supreme Court of Justice. By its final judgment of 10 February 1999 the Supreme Court of Justice rejected his appeal, finding that he had no standing in those proceedings.
The Ministry of Privatisation and of State Property therefore initiated court proceedings to annul the purchase of shares by the applicant at the auction. On 11 April 2001 the Bălţi District Court accepted the Ministry’s claim and annulled the purchase. The applicant was present.
On 3 July 2001 the  rejected his appeal. The  examined the case in his absence, finding that his request for another adjournment based on medical grounds had not been substantiated since he was being treated on an out-patient basis and could thus have appeared at the hearing.
On 7 March 2002 the Court of Appeal rejected his appeal in cassation and upheld the judgment of the Bălţi District Court. The applicant was present.
The applicant asked the Prosecutor General to initiate annulment proceedings for the quashing of all the judgments adopted earlier. On an unspecified date the Prosecutor General initiated such proceedings before the Supreme Court of Justice.
On 26 June 2002 the Supreme Court of Justice rejected the Prosecutor General’s appeal but added to the judgment of the Bălţi District Court of 3 July 2001 the obligation to return to the applicant MDL 180,698.68 (approximately EUR 13,411 at the time), representing the sum of money he had paid for the shares. That judgment was final and enforceable.
The applicant obtained a warrant to enforce the judgment which was sent to the Decisions Enforcement Department of the Ministry of Justice (“the Department”).
On 22 October 2002 he complained to the Department about its failure to enforce the judgment. On 13 November 2002 he received an answer from the bailiff who informed him that the Ministry of Finance, which was responsible for returning the applicant’s money, had refused to pay and that the judgment could not be enforced.
The applicant complained to various State officials (the President, the Speaker of the Parliament, the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance, etc.) requesting enforcement of the judgment in his favour. He was informed that it was impossible for the Ministry of Finances to make the payment, one reason being the Government decision no. 59 of 19 January 1998, which prohibited the enforcement of judgments against the Ministry of Finance.
The judgment of 26 June 2002 was enforced on 18 March 2004.
On 3 June 2002 the applicant initiated court proceedings claiming compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused to him by the failure to enforce the final judgment, including the effects of inflation on the real value of the award and lost profits as a result of his inability to use his money for four years.
On 13 November 2002 the Centru District Court partly accepted the applicant’s claims and awarded him MDL 220,085. That judgment was upheld by the  on 3 March 2003.
On 20 May 2003 the Chişinău Court of Appeal quashed the lower courts’ judgments. It found that damages could only be sought if the debtor was responsible for intentionally not paying the debt. Since it was unclear which State authority should have repaid the debt and, accordingly, whether there had been any intentional failure to enforce, the claim for damages could only be examined after the judgment had been enforced.
On 29 April 2004 the  partly accepted the applicant’s claims and awarded him MDL 285,503 (approximately EUR 20,272) in compensation for the effects of inflation on the value of the original award in his favour. That decision was upheld by the Bălţi Court of Appeal on 5 October 2004. The decision was final and enforceable.
On 3 January 2005 the Ministry of Finance lodged a request for the revision of the judgment of 29 April 2004. On 5 April 2005 the Bălţi Court of Appeal rejected that request as unfounded.
On 12 October 2005 the Supreme Court of Justice quashed the decisions of 5 October 2004 and 5 April 2005 and ordered a re-hearing of the case.
On 9 February 2006 the Bălţi Court of Appeal quashed the decision of 29 April 2004 and awarded the applicant MDL 180,698 (approximately EUR 11,678) in compensation for the effects of inflation on his original award. That decision was final.
