The applicants are the owners of a plot of land of 330,000 square metres (plot no. 1416), in the district of Milas, in Muğla.
On 14 October 1978 the land was officially designated as a first degree conservation area (birinci derece sit alanı) by the High Committee of Ancient Buildings and Monuments attached to the Ministry of Culture, following the discovery of the ruins of an ancient city, Bargylia, in the region.

On 17 July 1987 the applicants applied to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and requested that their land be exchanged for two plots of land in Muğla which belonged to the Treasury.
On 2 May 1988 their request was dismissed as one of the plots that the applicants requested was unavailable for exchange.
