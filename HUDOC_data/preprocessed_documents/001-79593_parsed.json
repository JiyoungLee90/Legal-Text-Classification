Germany, judgment of 15\u00a0July\u00a01982, Series A no. 51, \u00a7 66; for the application of this principle in the context of Article 6, see L\u00fcdi v.

In this regard the mitigation of a sentence on the ground of the excessive length of proceedings does not in principle deprive the individual concerned of his status as a victim within the meaning of Article\u00a034 of the Convention. However, this general rule is subject to an exception when the national authorities have acknowledged in a sufficiently clear way the failure to observe the reasonable time requirement and have afforded redress by reducing the sentence in an express and measurable manner (see Eckle v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7 66, Beck v.\u00a0Norway, no.\u00a026390/95, \u00a7\u00a027, 26 June 2001 and Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a064886/01, \u00a7\u00a077, ECHR 2006-...).",

On this point, the Court notes that the excessive length of the proceedings was taken into account amongst four other factors of mitigating circumstances. While it is true that the applicant's sentence was at the lower end of the scale of punishment authorised by the relevant penal provisions, it is not clear from court's reasoning that the time/delay element stood out as being the primary mitigating factor. The Court cannot find, therefore, that the reduction in sentence on account of the length factor was measurable in the present case, and had a decisive impact on the applicant's sentence. The applicant has, thus, not been afforded express and quantifiable redress for the alleged breach of the reasonable time requirement (see, mutatis mutandis, Beck\u00a0v.\u00a0Norway, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027-29; also Jensen v.

The Convention does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused's behalf (Bricmont v.\u00a0Belgium judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, \u00a7 89; Vidal v.\u00a0Belgium judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, pp. 32-33, \u00a7 33). In respect of witnesses on behalf of the accused, only exceptional circumstances could lead the Court to conclude that a refusal to hear such witnesses violated Article\u00a06 of the Convention (Bricmont v. Belgium, loc. cit).",
