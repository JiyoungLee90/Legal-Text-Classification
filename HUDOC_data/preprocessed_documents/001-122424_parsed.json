The Court observes that the applicant sustained multiple injuries to his chest, left leg and foot. The injuries must have caused him mental and physical suffering. Moreover, it appears that the use of force was aimed at debasing the applicant, driving him into submission and making him confess to a criminal offence. Therefore, the Court finds that the treatment to which the applicant was subjected was sufficiently serious to be considered inhuman and degrading within the meaning of Article\u00a03 of the Convention.",

Accordingly, the Court cannot consider whether or not the first period was compatible with the Convention. The applicant\u2019s complaint should be declared inadmissible as being lodged out of time. However, as it follows from the Idalov judgment (Idalov, cited above, \u00a7 130), the fact that an applicant has already spent time in custody pending the same set of criminal proceedings, should, in a given case, be taken into account by the Court in its assessment of the sufficiency and relevance of the grounds justifying the subsequent period of pre-trial detention, which the Court is competent to examine.",
