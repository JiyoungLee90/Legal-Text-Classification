The case originated in thirteen applications (nos. 51643/08, 54070/08, 20094/09, 35161/09, 4619/10, 62237/10, 67534/10, 73323/10, 29637/11, 32804/11, 41447/11, 46131/11 and 54726/12) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by thirteen Russian nationals. The application numbers, the dates of lodging the applications and the dates of their communication, the applicants’ names, their personal details and the names of their legal representatives, as well as the information concerning the relevant domestic judgments, are set out in the Appendix.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants each alleged that they had been convicted of drug offences following entrapment by the police in violation of Article 6 of the Convention.
.  On 9 February 2015 the applications were communicated to the Government. On the same date the Court informed the Government that the issues raised by these applications are already the subject of wellestablished case-law of the Court, that the Court envisaged assigning them to a Committee of three judges and that the observations were not requested but the Government could submit them if they so wished.
.  On 8 June 2015 the Government submitted observations in the cases of Mr Perfilyev and Mr Sinyayev (application nos. 67534/10 and 46131/11).
The applicants were each targeted in undercover operations conducted by the police in the form of a test purchase of drugs under sections 7 and 8 of the Operational-Search Activities Act of 12 August 1995 (no. 144-FZ). Those operations led to their criminal conviction for drug dealing.
The applicants disagreed with their conviction and argued that the police had incited them to commit drug-related offences.
The relevant domestic law governing the use of undercover operations at the material time is summed up in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Lagutin and Others v. Russia (nos. 6228/09, 19123/09, 19678/07, 52340/08 and 7451/09, 24 April 2014); Veselov and Others v. Russia (nos. 23200/10, 24009/07 and 556/10, 2 October 2012); Bannikova v. Russia (no. 18757/06, 14 October 2010); Vanyan v. Russia (no. 53203/99, 15 December 2005); and Khudobin v. Russia (no. 59696/00, ECHR 2006XII (extracts)).
