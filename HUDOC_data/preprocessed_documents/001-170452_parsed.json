In this respect the Court agrees with the applicant that the Kaunas Regional Court, which examined the case on appeal, did not mention either the public interest or any other reason for examining D.L.\u2019s appeal despite its formal deficiencies (see paragraphs 14 and 30 above). Indeed, it appears that the Kaunas Regional Court was not aware of any reasons why the appeal should not have been accepted for examination. In such circumstances, the Court is more inclined to accept the Government\u2019s first submission that D.L.\u2019s appeal was referred to the Kaunas Regional Court by mistake.",

At the same time, the Court observes that D.L.\u2019s appeal was communicated to the applicant and that he had an opportunity to reply to it (see paragraph 12 above). Contrary to the applicant\u2019s submissions, the foregoing means that there are therefore no grounds to find that the principle of equality of arms was disregarded (see paragraph 30 above, and compare and contrast G\u00fcrkan v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a01154/04, \u00a7\u00a7 34-35, 29\u00a0March\u00a02011). The applicant did not allege that the civil proceedings were unfair for any other reason, and the Court, having examined the material submitted to it, sees no grounds to hold otherwise. Having regard to the proceedings taken as a whole, the Court is of the view that the error committed by the domestic courts was not so significant as to make the proceedings arbitrary or to result in a denial of justice, and that in any event it was counterbalanced by granting the applicant sufficient opportunity to become acquainted with D.L.\u2019s appeal and to comment on it.",
