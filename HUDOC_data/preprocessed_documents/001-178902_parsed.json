He alleged that he had intended to meet \u0160.A. in order to demand that he pay rent for workers who had previously been accommodated in his flat and to cancel their residence registration at that address. Before he set off to a bar where \u0160.A.\u2019s workers met after work (hereinafter \u201cthe bar\u201d), he telephoned his sons and asked them to come and assist him in case he met any trouble from \u0160.A. After \u0160.A. refused to resolve the matter, the applicant left the bar and was followed by between ten and twelve of \u0160.A.\u2019s workers. \u0160.A. and F.M., one of the workers, started hitting the applicant all over his body. His sons, standing nearby, came to his aid. After \u0160.A. hit A.R., the applicant, an electrical fitter by profession, took out the knife he used for work, which had a seven- to eight-centimetre blade, and began brandishing it. Among others, he stabbed \u0160.A. several times in the back. \u0160.A. then backed off and the applicant and his sons fled the scene. Once at home the applicant gave the knife to his wife, who disposed of it. The applicant also stated that the only injuries he had sustained had been some bruises on his head.",

Consequently, the applicant had gone to the bar with a view to get the workers to sign written statements concerning their change of residence.

In the meantime, he had been stabbed several times. As regards the other circumstances of the fight, such as who had hit whom, the court relied on the testimony of S.M., F.M., and the witnesses A.\u010c. and M.H. The court, taking into account the fact that the injured parties could not have been expected to pay particular attention to what was happening to others while they themselves were engaged in the fight, found their testimony mostly consistent, except for the question of when \u0160.A. had joined the fight. The court took the view on that point that the fight had only broken out after \u0160.A.\u2019s arrival, contrary to what he himself had alleged. The court further found M.H.\u2019s initial testimony (see paragraph 16 above) to be the more persuasive of the two, and that it was in line with the findings of the medical experts. It found that E.R. had initially fought with S.M., the applicant with F.M., and A.R. with \u0160.A. \u2013 a fact which the court found confirmed by the testimony of \u201cS.M., F.M., and also the witnesses A.\u010c. and M.H., and \u0160e.A.\u201d Referring to M.H.\u2019s initial testimony and the applicant\u2019s statement during the investigation, which it found was also supported by \u0160e.A.\u2019s testimony, the court rejected the applicant\u2019s statement at the hearing that his knife had only had a three-centimetre blade.",

[and] the evidence produced at the hearing completely excluded that possibility [of self-defence]\u201d. The Court found that only the defendants and the three injured parties had engaged in the fight and that if \u0160.A. had wanted to attack the applicant he could easily have outnumbered the defendants. The applicant and his sons had been motivated by anger towards \u0160.A. and F.M., while S.M. had become involved because he had tried to protect F.M. As the applicant had failed to convince F.M. to cancel his residence status, he had resorted to violence. If the applicant had felt that he was in danger, he could simply have walked away. Instead, he had provoked a fight, together with his sons. The court also found that while the applicant had admitted to stabbing \u0160.A. several times in the back, he and the other two defendants had not addressed the fact that the injured parties had sustained other stab wounds too. Moreover, the court noted that none of the witnesses had testified that the applicant had lain on the floor and been kicked by the other men. The court found that since the defendants had been prepared for a fight in advance the injured parties should be believed when they stated that they had in fact been attacked and that they had responded by fighting back. It considered the injured parties\u2019 description of how they had obtained the wounds to be persuasive. Having regard to the fact that the fight was of short duration, the court found that the defendants had pulled their knives out quickly and had quickly \u201cfinished with\u201d the injured parties. The court further found that as the victims had sustained fourteen stab wounds altogether, it was plausible that the applicant had not been the only assailant, but that all three defendants had inflicted them. Finally, the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s argument that he had pulled the knife out after being attacked by ten people as \u201cunrealistic\u201d.",

It noted that counsel for the applicant had been informed about the hearing with the investigating judge, as confirmed by an acknowledgment of receipt, but had failed to attend it. According to the higher court, the defence had been aware of the notice of the possibility to participate in the questioning of witnesses during the investigation but had consciously disregarded it. Hence, it had accepted the risk that the witnesses would not be available for questioning at the trial. Moreover, the higher court considered that the applicant had failed to comply with paragraph 2 of section 371 of the Criminal Procedure Act (see paragraph 39 below) as he had not substantiated in what way his inability to question the two witnesses at the trial had undermined the legality of the judgment.",

The Supreme Court further found that section 178(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act provided that the investigating judge should have sent the request to attend the questioning directly to the defendants as well as to counsel. However, according to the Supreme Court, the applicant had failed to explain how that error on the part of the investigating judge had affected the legality of the impugned judgment. In the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, the error could only have affected the legality of the judgment if the first-instance court had relied on the testimony of I.B. and \u0160e.A. to a decisive extent, which, however, had not been alleged in the case.",

Secondly, the Slovenian judge, the defendants and counsel could have travelled to the relevant country to examine the two witnesses. Thirdly, under section 244a of the Criminal Procedure Act (see paragraph 39 above), the witnesses could have been questioned by video-conference. Moreover, the trial court could have requested assistance from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under the European Convention on Mutual assistance in Criminal Matters and, in particular, Article 9 of the Second Additional Protocol to that Convention (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). With respect to Italy, the Slovenian authorities could have relied on Article 10 of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union (see paragraph 44 above).

However, the fact that he had waived his right to examine the two witnesses in the pre-trial proceedings should not have precluded him from cross-examining them at the hearing.

However, the court had gathered a large body of evidence by questioning the injured parties and witnesses and engaging two medical experts. M.H., F.M., and even the applicant himself, had confirmed that he had had a knife. The fact of the applicant hitting F.M. had also been confirmed by F.M. and supported by S.M.\u2019s testimony that he had seen F.M. holding his face where he had been hit. Medical records had also confirmed the blow to F.M.\u2019s face, although that in any event had not been decisive for the legal classification of the offence.

In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Schatschaschwili v. Germany [GC], no. 9154/10, \u00a7 101, 15\u00a0December 2015 and Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 84, ECHR\u00a02010-VI, with further references therein). In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole, having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victim(s) that crime is properly prosecuted and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see, amongst many authorities, Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 26766/05 and\u00a022228/06, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2011-VI). It is also notable in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see Seton v. the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, \u00a7 57, 31 March 2016, with further references therein).",

Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 59).",

Such measures form part of the diligence which the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see Gabrielyan v. Armenia, no. 8088/05, \u00a7 81, 10 April 2012).",

I.B. stated that he had no Slovenian visa while \u0160e.A. submitted that he could not travel owing to his father\u2019s illness and his job in Italy (see paragraphs 21 to 23 above). In admitting their statements from the pre-trial proceedings as evidence, the trial court relied on section 340(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act, in the part that provides that witness statements can be read out if they live abroad and have failed to appear at the main hearing despite being duly summoned (see paragraphs 26, 34, 37 and 39 above). Though that provision seems to constitute a proper legal basis for the admission of I.B. and \u0160e.A.\u2019s statements, the Court must observe that the witnesses, though reluctant, were not unable to attend the trial. On that point, the Court must agree with the applicant (see paragraphs 48 and 52 above) that the case does not give rise to exceptional circumstances comparable to those in Gani (cited above, \u00a7 45) and that, unlike in Kostecki (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 64-66), the authorities had managed to locate the witnesses. Indeed, they had gone to great lengths to establish the witnesses\u2019 whereabouts and had been successful. However, once the witnesses declined to comply with the summons, the authorities launched no further initiatives to secure their participation at the hearing (see paragraphs 20 to 23 above). The Court notes that the practical difficulties raised by the two witnesses could possibly have been overcome, for instance, by the Slovenian authorities offering assistance to the two witnesses or calling on the international legal assistance provided for in the \u201cTreaty between Slovenia and Republic of Macedonia concerning Legal Aid in Civil and Criminal Matters\u201d (see paragraph 41 above). As regards \u0160e.A. and Italy, it could have used the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union (see paragraph 44 above). The Government did not provide a convincing explanation as to why the domestic authorities made no use of those possibilities. Furthermore, being aware of the difficulties in securing the right of the applicant to examine the witnesses in the present case, the Court considers that readily available modern technology, such as a video link, could have offered a solution for the questioning of witnesses abroad (see, mutatis mutandis, Zhukovskiy v. Ukraine, no. 31240/03, \u00a7 45, 3 March 2011).",
