In addition, rather wide limitations upon the freedom of movement of members of the armed forces ensue by reason of the specific demands of military service, so that the normal restrictions accompanying it do not come within the ambit of Article 5 either (see Engel and Others v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 22). However, the forms of restriction which clearly deviate from the normal conditions of life in the armed forces of the Contracting States fall within the scope of Article 5. In order to establish whether this is so, account should be taken of a whole range of factors such as the nature, duration, effects and manner of execution of the penalty or measure in question (ibid).",

The Court further observes that these periods were subsequently deducted from the applicant\u2019s prison sentence (see paragraph 13 above). Moreover, the Government have not provided any explanation or details as regards what security or other measures were applicable to the applicant and, apart from the statement that he was in military service, no evidence has been adduced to demonstrate that he remained, more or less, within the ordinary framework of his army life during that time. In view of the above, the Court considers that the applicant was also deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention when he was held in Izmir between 22 February 2003 and 6\u00a0March 2003.",

The applicability of one ground does not necessarily preclude that of another; a detention may, depending on the circumstances, be justified under more than one sub-paragraph (see, for example, Erkalo v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 2 September 1998, \u00a7 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI). However, only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty (see, inter alia, Giulia Manzoni v.\u00a0Italy, 1 July 1997, \u00a7 25, Reports 1997IV).",

By the use of these terms the Convention essentially refers back to national law and an obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see, for example, Elci and Others v. Turkey, nos. 23145/93 and 25091/94, \u00a7\u00a0667, 13\u00a0November 2003). It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond a lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see, for example, Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06871, ECHR 2008... and the cases referred to therein). In particular, to avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention should be appropriate; and the length of the detention should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see, mutatis mutandis, A.\u00a0and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7 164, 19 February 2009, and, mutatis mutandis, Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 74).",

On the one hand, it had the purpose of ensuring his return to his army command in order to secure the fulfilment of his obligation, prescribed by law, to perform compulsory military service pursuant to section 80 \u00a7 1 of Law on Military Service. On the other hand, it also had the purpose of bringing him before a competent authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed the offence of exceeding his leave. On this latter point, the Court observes that section 66 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Military Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence to exceed one\u2019s period of leave by six days without authorisation. It further observes that the applicant was arrested on suspicion of being an army deserter and was questioned within a few hours of his arrest about the reasons for his desertion (see paragraph 6 above). Moreover, he was subsequently transferred to his army command in K\u0131rklareli, where he was once again questioned about his desertion. The applicant\u2019s detention thereafter thus served the purpose of bringing him before a competent authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence. In this connection, the Court notes that he was subsequently brought before a judge, who remanded him in custody. In sum, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s detention between 22 February 2003 and 6 March 2003 in Izmir falls to be examined under both sub-paragraph (b) and (c) of Article 5 \u00a7 1, whereas his detention in K\u0131rklareli falls to be examined under sub-paragraph (c) of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1.",

Nevertheless, it does not deem it necessary to determine this question because, in any event, the key issue to be examined is whether the applicant\u2019s detention was free from arbitrariness. In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant was deprived of his liberty between 22 February and 11 March 2003 for seventeen days. The Court finds no reason to doubt that the national authorities acted in good faith in detaining the applicant in conformity with the purpose of the restrictions permitted by the relevant sub-paragraph of Article 5 \u00a7 1. In this connection, it takes particular note of the Government\u2019s arguments regarding the necessity of securing the necessary material provisions for the applicant\u2019s transfer. However, in the absence of any concrete information or documentation, the Court does not find it convincing that, in order to achieve the aim sought by the applicant\u2019s detention, the authorities needed twelve days to send the applicant to his army unit or that it was necessary to detain him for a total of seventeen days before he could be brought before a judge. Moreover, the Court attaches importance to the fact that no information has been forthcoming from the Government to clarify the place and conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention and the security or other measures which were applicable to him throughout his lengthy detention.",
