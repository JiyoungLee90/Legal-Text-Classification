The just satisfaction awarded by the Constitutional Court corresponds to approximately 9% of the Court\u2019s likely award under Article 41 of the Convention in respect of the period from the introduction of the proceedings until the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment, due account being taken of the particular circumstances of the case. It cannot therefore be regarded as adequate in the circumstances of the case (see the principles established under the Court\u2019s case-law in Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a064886/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a065-107, ECHR 2006... or Scordino v.
