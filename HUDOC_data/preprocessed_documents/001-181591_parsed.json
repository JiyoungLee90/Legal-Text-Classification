It held that the Municipal Court had established the facts correctly (continuous and exclusive possession of the land in good faith since 1912) but had erred in its application of the substantive law. It established, firstly, that the land in question had been in social ownership on 8\u00a0October 1991 and that under the relevant legislation it had not been possible to acquire ownership of socially owned property by adverse possession before that date unless the statutory requirements for doing so had been met by 6 April 1941 (see paragraphs 48, 53-54, 57 and 59-60 below). However, those requirements had not been met in the applicants\u2019 case. That was so because under Article 1472 of the 1811 Civil Code (which was applicable in Croatia from 1852 until 1980, see paragraphs 47-49 and 51 below) immovable property owned by municipal authorities could be acquired by adverse possession only after forty years.

Thus, the Chamber had (a) taken into account the period between 6 April 1941 and 8 October 1991 and had (b) relied on the 1996 version of section 388(4) of the 1996 Property Act. However, the applicants had not relied on the period or the provision in question, neither before the Court nor before the domestic courts. Likewise, before the Court the applicants had not relied on the Trgo case. Rather, in their observations before the Chamber (see paragraphs 41-42 above) the applicants had expressly excluded the said period from the factual basis of their complaint and had objected to the application of (the 1996 version of) section 388(4) of the 1996 Property Act and the Trgo judgment to their cases. While before the Chamber the Government had averred that these arguments should lead the Court to find that the applicants\u2019 property complaints were inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded (see paragraph 35 above), before the Grand Chamber they submitted that the same arguments should result in the Court either declaring those complaints inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies or striking the case out of its list (see paragraphs 71-88 above).",

In their view, the courts of first and second instance and the Constitutional Court had clearly concerned themselves in their decisions also with the question of whether the period from 1941 to 1991 had to be included in the calculation of the period of adverse possession and had wrongly and unlawfully found that the period in question was not to be included in that calculation, specifically because of the amended, 2001 version, of section 388(4) of the 1996 Property Act, which had come into force on 20\u00a0December 2001.

It is true that under the Court\u2019s case-law it is not always necessary for the Convention to be explicitly raised in domestic proceedings provided that the complaint is raised \u201cat least in substance\u201d (see, for example, Glasenapp, cited above, \u00a7 44, and Castells, cited above, \u00a7 32). This means that the applicant must raise legal arguments to the same or like effect on the basis of domestic law, in order to give the national courts the opportunity to redress the alleged breach (see, for example, Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6\u00a0November 1980, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 40, and Azinas, cited above, \u00a7 38). However, as the Court\u2019s case-law bears out, to genuinely afford a Contracting State the opportunity of preventing or redressing the alleged violation requires taking into account not only the facts but also the applicant\u2019s legal arguments (see, for example, Ahmet Sad\u0131k, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a029-34, and Azinas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-42), for the purposes of determining whether the complaint submitted to the Court had indeed been raised beforehand, in substance, before the domestic authorities. That is because \u201cit would be contrary to the subsidiary character of the Convention machinery if an applicant, ignoring a possible Convention argument, could rely on some other ground before the national authorities for challenging an impugned measure, but then lodge an application before the Court on the basis of the Convention argument\u201d (see Azinas, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, even in those fields where the Convention \u201cincorporates\u201d the rules of that law, since the national authorities are, in the nature of things, particularly qualified to settle the issues arising in this connection (see Zagreba\u010dka banka d.d. v. Croatia, no.\u00a039544/05, \u00a7 263, 12 December 2013). This is particularly true when, as in this instance, the case turns upon difficult questions of interpretation of domestic law (see Anheuser-Busch Inc. v. Portugal [GC], no. 73049/01, \u00a7\u00a083, ECHR 2007-I). Unless the interpretation is arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable, the Court\u2019s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of that interpretation are compatible with the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a083 and 86). It is for that reason that the Court has held that, in principle, it cannot be said that an applicant has a sufficiently established claim amounting to an \u201casset\u201d for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, where there is a dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law and where the question whether or not he or she complied with the statutory requirements is to be determined in judicial proceedings (see, for example, Kopeck\u00fd, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 58, and Mila\u0161inovi\u0107 v.

It is rooted in some imbalance that appeared in the assessment of the applicants\u2019 arguments vis-\u00e0-vis the Government\u2019s submissions. With regard to the former the majority have been extraordinarily critical; they have interpreted each and every doubt to the disadvantage of the applicants, and where the doubt was not notable, they have made it salient. In contrast to that, the majority have come to the aid of the Government where the latter have omitted certain arguments which, in the opinion of the majority, could have supported their case. The result of this imbalance is that it is not only the Government who have won their case and not only the applicants who have lost theirs. The Chamber has been reprimanded, even if not explicitly, for what, in the opinion of the majority, amounted to excessive activism. The exclusion, in the instant judgment, of the period between 6 April 1941 and 8 October 1991 from the scope of consideration effectively means that the Chamber had decided the two cases (which now comprise one case) ultra et extra petita and had thus acted ultra vires. This is quite a harsh assessment by the Grand Chamber of the Chamber\u2019s methodology in examining the two cases (and, by extension, of that employed by the Grand Chamber\u2019s minority). But the question of the proper reasoning in this (now joined) case is not only about the reading of facts as presented by the parties or of the law as relied upon by them. No less is it a matter of logic, and in the domain of logic there is no majority or minority. However, if one would prefer to resort to the majority\u2013minority perspective, the ratio of votes in favour of the admissibility of the complaints, in so far as they encompass the 1941-1991 period, speaks for the Chamber: six votes to one (as one can infer from the separate opinions of Judge Lemmens in Radomilja and Others v. Croatia (no. 37685, 28 June 2016) and Jakelji\u0107 v. Croatia (no. 22768/12, 28 June 2016)), versus six to eleven in the Grand Chamber (as one can infer from the two separate opinions of six judges annexed to the present judgment).",

True, some substantiation for that can be drawn from the Court\u2019s case-law. The judgment, namely its sub-section \u201cThe scope of the case\u201d, is well furnished with useful citations. On the other hand, comfortable citations can always be found and employed to support one methodology over another, thus, even if inadvertently, pouring water on the mill of the extreme realist doctrine whereby judges first decide the cases and only then search for proper substantiation. The choice of supporting citations must not, however, depend on whether the Court is inclined to keep strictly to the parties\u2019 arguments (including the explicit mentioning or non-mentioning of certain facts) or to go beyond and outside them (which may mean dealing solely with the Government\u2019s objections or finding proprio motu other grounds on which to dismiss the applicants\u2019 claims). We do not doubt that the Court is indeed \u201cmaster of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case\u201d and that it is not \u201cbound by the characterisation given by an applicant [or] a government\u201d. What raises concerns (in particular, but not only, in the instant case) is that this may be seen as a carte blanche. It should not be. In order to attain legitimacy, the Court\u2019s \u201cmastering\u201d must be consistent in choosing a narrower or broader, a stricter or more lenient approach. In order to come to a correct and just outcome, judges should look at the facts of the case (as well as the applicable law) through a magnifying glass \u2013 but it should not be so that each of their eyes uses its own magnifying glass, only for one to be pink and the other grimy.",

How then could it be that, as the majority hold, a line of reasoning which took into consideration, directly or indirectly, the period so artificially excluded would amount to \u201cchanging the substance of [the applicants\u2019] complaints\u201d (see paragraph 135, emphasis added)? We fail to see this \u201cchange\u201d. Just like a good physician would always carefully and attentively inquire of a patient about the latter\u2019s medical history and would never confine himself or herself to the examination of only the most recent complaints (as if they had nothing to do with the anamnesis), no court would be able to reasonably examine any case of alleged adverse possession without taking into consideration the whole period during which the property was said to have been possessed by the claimant. This is what the Croatian courts did when deciding the applicants\u2019 cases. This is what the Strasbourg Court should have done. The exclusion of the period between 6 April 1941 and 8 October 1991, that is to say, the most relevant fact which had to be considered in order to understand what subsequently happened \u2013 both in fact and in law \u2013 on the ground that it was ostensibly not covered by the applicants\u2019 complaints, amounts to the setting, by the Court itself, of a new factual basis for the case.

Croatia (both cited above), and the Trgo case (cited above), or with the conclusion that this was, in essence, sufficient for finding a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

The latter presumption seems to be a misunderstanding, if not from the point of view of the Croatian law, then from the point of view of the most fundamental principles of legal order. That is not how title to property (especially land) is normally acquired. It is very difficult to comprehend how one can be considered to be legally the \u201cfinal\u201d owner of a concrete (i.e. having, inter alia, clearly delimited boundaries) plot of land which is nominally still under the ownership of another person and with respect to which, in terms of the recognition of adverse possession, no act of any public authority (executive, municipal, judicial, etc.) had been adopted; especially in view of the fact that, until such an act is adopted, the exclusiveness and continuity of possession of the land in question, as well as the good faith of its acquisition by adverse possession, may still be contested by whoever that person might be (even if it ultimately transpires that there is no sufficient factual and/or legal basis for such contestation, and therefore unsuccessfully). If the possibility of such contestation is excluded ex lege, then the rule of law is an empty phrase. In our opinion, in Trgo and the two subsequent cases which have now been reconsidered by the Grand Chamber, the Court confounded the possession of land as an already legally established and therefore undisputed (or no longer disputed) fact of ownership, on the one hand, with the possession of land, or any \u201casset\u201d, for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, on the other. For the admissibility of the applicant\u2019s complaint in Trgo, the latter would have sufficed. The same goes for the instant case: the applicants\u2019 title could not merely derive from the statute in question.",

At the time when the applicants brought their civil actions before the domestic authorities, that provision was no longer the valid law and therefore was not applicable, owing to the decision of 17 November 1999 by the Constitutional Court. Although that decision was formally an ex nunc decision (see paragraph 15 of the judgment), it defended the rights of third parties (including those who were entitled to the restitution of nationalised property). This was the principle underlying the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision, but then the Court re-read and re-interpreted the domestic law, without paying heed to whether the third parties should have had any right to present their claims in respect of the property, the ownership by adverse possession of which had not yet been established in any due legal procedure (see paragraph 11 above). Even conceding (which would be a hard thing to do because of the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph) that the Trgo judgment (cited above) suggests that that applicant\u2019s claim had a sufficient basis in domestic law to qualify as an \u201casset\u201d, because he instituted relevant proceedings as soon as the Property Act in its original version entered into force in 1997 and thus had some expectations which at the material time might have been seen, at least from some perspective, as legitimate, and which he retained over the next three years until the Constitutional Court declared section 388(4) of that Act unconstitutional, and that all this triggered the applicability of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in Trgo, the legal situation in the instant case is different in at least one crucial respect. In the instant case, the applicants had not instituted any proceedings regarding the adverse possession of the land in question while section 388(4) of the 1996 Property Act was still in force. Once it was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court (in our opinion, very reasonably), the applicants had no legitimate expectation whatsoever in respect of the land in question. But it was exactly then (and with a not insignificant delay) that they presented their claims to the domestic authorities, already in the absence of any legal basis in domestic law for legitimation of their expectations. Expectations they might have had (and we have no doubt that they did have them) \u2013 but expectations and legitimate expectations are not necessarily two matching realities. Very often they do not match, just like in the instant case.",

Furthermore, the Government argued that the very same facts and legal arguments had not been part of the applicants\u2019 complaints before the domestic courts either, and they invited the Court alternatively to declare the applications inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies.",

On the basis of certain statements that could be found in the applicants\u2019 respective replies to the Government\u2019s Observations before the Chamber, the majority concluded that the applicants had intended to exclude the said period from their complaints (see paragraphs 130 and 134 of the judgment). On this basis the majority further concluded that by taking into consideration the said period the Chamber had acted beyond the scope of the case as delimited by the applicants (see paragraph 133 of the judgment).

The majority treated the applicants\u2019 clarifications as a request to include that period in the scope of the case before the Grand Chamber.

The majority established that the scope of the case \u201creferred to\u201d the Court is determined by the applicant\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d or complaint (see paragraph 109 of the judgment). According to the majority, a \u201cclaim\u201d or complaint in Convention terms comprises two elements, namely factual allegations and the legal arguments (see paragraphs 110, 115 and 126 of the judgment). This definition of the components of the complaint is, for the purposes of determining the scope of the case, both overly broad and vague. This is in part recognised by the majority themselves when they concede that \u201cwhile it is not possible to state in the abstract the importance of legal arguments, a complaint is always characterised by the alleged facts\u201d (see paragraph 115 of the judgment).",

It is a common understanding in national and international courts that, for instance, facts which serve as evidence or background information do not constitute petitum. Furthermore, as the majority themselves have noted, not all legal arguments are equally relevant for characterising the complaint. In this respect the distinction between legal grounds and legal arguments is essential. According to Article 34 of the Convention only legal grounds and not the supporting legal arguments characterise the complaint.

In addition, the Government, in their comments on the applicants\u2019 observations, themselves saw the impugned statements by the applicants as arguments related to legitimate expectations and not as statements that would amend their original complaint (see paragraph 43 of the judgment). In part because it was not clear from the applicants\u2019 submissions before the Chamber whether their intention was to withdraw their request in relation to the period from 1941 to 1991 and to waive the application of the Trgo precedent, the Grand Chamber explicitly asked the applicants and the Government to address these issues in their submissions before it.",

By preventing the Court from deciding on what it has not been asked (extra petita), or from granting more than it has been asked (ultra petita), or from failing to rule on the request (infra petita), the extra/ultra/infra petita rule reinforces the principle of free disposition. In general terms, both the disposition principle and its corollary the extra/ultra/infra petita rule are considered to be an expression of individual autonomy. Consequently, the question whether and to what extent an individual asserts his or her rights before the Court ultimately depends on that individual\u2019s intention. Whenever applicants implicitly express their intentions regarding the scope of the case, the Court should establish those intentions in an unequivocal manner to be able to act upon them, otherwise the Court risks setting itself up instead of the applicants as dominus lites, contrary to the disposition principle embedded in the Convention system.",

In the Convention system this role is to a certain extent fulfilled by the case-law developed on the basis of Article 37 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention. The Government indeed, in their written submissions before the Grand Chamber, referred to that Article (see paragraph 71 of the judgment). When an applicant explicitly or implicitly expresses an intention to exclude certain facts or legal grounds from the scope of the case, this is tantamount to the withdrawal or waiver of his or her application, or part of it, and thus in such situations the criteria the Court has developed under Article 37 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention should apply. For our purposes, two criteria under that Article are of particular importance: first, the requirement that the intention to withdraw a complaint or part of it must be established unequivocally (see Association SOS Attentats and de Boery v.

Russia, (dec.), no 78386/4, \u00a7 20, 15 September 2015); second, the criterion that a waiver will not be considered unequivocal if the applicant gives a clear indication that he or she intends to pursue his or her application (see Pisano v. Italy (striking out) [GC], no.\u00a036732/97, \u00a7 41, 21 October 2002; see also, inter alia, Ohlen v.

That is to say, from the judgment it transpires that, according to the majority, the period from 1941 to 1991 is a fact that determined the scope of the two original cases (see paragraph 135 of the judgment). Furthermore, the majority themselves have acknowledged that the applicants\u2019 initial complaints before the Court, as formulated in their application forms, were rather open-ended and referred to the whole period over which they had possessed the land in question (see paragraph 128 of the judgment). Thus, if the period from 1941 to 1991 is regarded as determining the scope of the two cases, it is not possible to take the position, as the majority did, that the applicants\u2019 impugned statements related to that period were mere clarifications of their alleged initial intentions and that the respective complaints from the very beginning had thus not covered the period from 1941 to 1991. Any explanation provided by the applicants that might actually narrow or expand the scope of the case as defined in the application form would be such as to withdraw, expand or change the initial complaint and thus could not be treated as mere clarification of that complaint. Therefore, by \u201cclarifying\u201d that they never really wanted this period to be part of their initial complaint (according to the majority\u2019s interpretation) the applicants would have actually (if the said period is taken as being determinative of the scope of the case, as the majority found) implicitly expressed their intention to waive the part of the application related to that period. Thus, as emphasised above in paragraph 12, the majority should have established unequivocally, in accordance with the case-law developed under Article 37 \u00a7 1 (a), the applicants\u2019 intention to withdraw all or part of a complaint.

Thus, while the applicants could freely dispose when it came to the principal facts, they do not and should not have the same powers over subsidiary facts and circumstances. They were not entitled to direct the Court as to which subsidiary facts it could take into account and which it could not. Applicants cannot withdraw such facts from the case on the basis of the principle of free disposition and the related principle of extra/ultra petita. Put simply, the reach of the principle of free disposition and its corollary the non ultra petita principle is not and should not be unlimited. Judge Fitzmaurice famously stated that \u201cunless certain distinctions are drawn, there is a danger that [the non ultra petita rule] might hamper the tribunal in coming to a correct decision, and might even cause it to arrive at a legally incorrect one, by compelling it to neglect juridically relevant factors\u201d. The danger of failing to make a distinction between these two types of facts for the purposes of establishing jurisdiction ratione materiae was certainly evident in the present case, whose end results border on absurdity \u2013 an absurdity to which the applicants contributed in part with their imprudent statements.",

However, courts are bound to apply the rules of procedure avoiding both excessive formalism that would impair the fairness of the proceedings and excessive flexibility such as would render nugatory the procedural requirements laid down in statutes (see Bulena v. the Czech Republic, no. 57567/00, \u00a7 30, 20 April 2004, and E\u015fim v. Turkey, no.\u00a059601/09, \u00a7 21, 17 September 2013). In trying to find the balance between the two, the Court has often stressed that \u201cthe right of access to a court is impaired when the rules cease to serve the aims of legal certainty and proper administration of justice and form a sort of barrier preventing the litigant from having his or her case determined on the merits by the competent court\u201d (see Kart v.

The existence of formalism unjustifiably restricting an applicant\u2019s access to a court will depend on the assessment of the case as a whole (see Bulena, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069). The Court has also stressed that the relevant procedural rules cannot be construed in a manner which does not take into account the particular circumstances of the case (see Stagno v.

Moreover, the due process rights of the Government had not been undermined in any way. Both parties were treated with full respect for their equality and for their right to be heard and to present their own arguments and their views on the arguments of their opponent. The Government did not even complain in that connection (compare Scoppola (no. 2) v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a010249/03, \u00a7 56, 17 September 2009). We could not see any good reason to strike down the Chamber\u2019s judgments for violating the extra/ultra petita rule in such circumstances, especially as the scope of the case was never precisely determined, there is no incontrovertibly clear evidence that the Chamber exceeded its powers, the applicants actually denied that their intention was to narrow the complaint (see paragraphs 17-18 above) and they have adopted the Chamber\u2019s arguments as their own by asking the Grand Chamber to confirm the Chamber\u2019s judgments (see paragraph 97 of the judgment). For all these reasons, we consider the approach by the majority to the application of the extra/ultra petita rule in the circumstances of the present case to be unduly formalistic and therefore unjustified (compare Delcourt v. Belgium, no. 2689/65, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40, 17\u00a0January 1970).",

The Court is not bound by the legal arguments of the parties and especially not by the application and interpretation of its own cases (see paragraphs 124 and 126 of the judgment). This is well established in the international arena. For example, the International Court of Justice has sometimes had recourse to arguments that are quite different from those proposed in order to resolve the case. An example of this is furnished by the North Sea Continental Shelf cases (Judgment of 20 February 1969, ICJ Reports 1969), where the ICJ shaped a doctrine on the legal handling of continental shelf delimitations which went largely beyond what the parties had in effect pleaded.",
