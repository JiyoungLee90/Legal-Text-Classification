Neither is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately be charged or taken before a court.

(extracts), the Court accepted that the applicant\u2019s liberty had been restricted, inter alia, for a purpose other than those mentioned in Article\u00a05. The Court in that case based its findings on an agreement signed between the detainee and a federal minister of the press. It was clear from that agreement that the applicant\u2019s detention was applied in order to make him sell his media company to the State. In Cebotari v\u00a0 (no.\u00a035615/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046 et seq., 13\u00a0November 2007) the Court found a violation of Article\u00a018 of the Convention in a context where the applicant\u2019s arrest was visibly linked to an application pending before the Court. However, such cases remain rare (see,\u00a0as an opposite example, Sisojeva and Others v.\u00a0Latvia\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a060654/00, \u00a7\u00a0129, ECHR\u00a02007-II, and Khodorkovskiy v.\u00a0, no.\u00a05829/04, \u00a7\u00a0261, 31\u00a0May 2011).",
