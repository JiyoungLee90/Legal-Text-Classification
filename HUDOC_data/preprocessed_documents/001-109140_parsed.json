However, in the present case, the Court agrees with the domestic courts and considers that the applicant\u2019s letters contained specific allegations of fact, which as such were susceptible to proof (see, McVicar v. the United Kingdom, no. 46311/99, \u00a7\u00a083, ECHR 2002-III). What is more the applicant\u2019s allegations appear quite serious as she, in fact, accused Z.W. of dishonesty, greed and tricking her son-in-law out of a significant sum of money. Those allegations therefore required substantial justification. Nevertheless, it would appear that the applicant based them mainly on guess-work. In this respect the Court notes that the applicant alleged in her letters to the chief editor of the television programme that Z.W. owed J.D. PLN 240,000 (see paragraph 7\u00a0above). However, in the civil proceedings J.D filed a claim against Z.W. seeking payment of a significantly smaller sum: PLN 40,492 (see\u00a0paragraph 16 above). Furthermore, in the civil proceedings the courts confirmed that the construction works carried out by J.D\u2019s company were defective and Z.W. in fact had a claim against J.D. for reimbursement of repair costs (see\u00a0paragraph 16 above).",

However, it should be noted that while the limits of acceptable criticism as regards politicians are wider, yet, it does not follow from this that politicians should not be given an opportunity to defend themselves when they consider that publications about them are erroneous and capable of misleading public opinion (see Sanocki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a028949/03, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62, 17\u00a0July 2007).",

Ukraine, no.\u00a06428/07, 31 March 2011). In the first case, Kazakov v. Russia, the Court unanimously found that the defamation proceedings against the applicant, in particular the order made against him to issue an apology, had been excessive and disproportionate and therefore in breach of his Article\u00a010 rights. In the second case, Zakharov v. Russia, the Court considered that the expressions used by the applicant, such as \u201coutrageous conduct\u201d, \u201cantisocial behaviour\u201d, \u201costensibly makes an exemption\u201d, were value judgments that represented the applicant\u2019s subjective appraisal of the moral dimension of the behaviour of the leader of the town council. The Court found that the burden of proof in respect of these expressions was obviously impossible to satisfy and that the Russian authorities had failed to adduce \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d grounds for the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to impart information and found a violation of Article 10. In the third judgment, Sofranschi v. Moldova, the applicant complained about civil proceedings brought against him for defamation in which he had been ordered to pay compensation to the leader of a collective farm and candidate in local elections for the office of mayor. The applicant had criticised the latter in a letter addressed to the President of Moldova and other authorities. The letter contained indeed strong and intemperate statements, with a very weak factual basis. The applicant described the plaintiff in the following terms: \u201cshameless\u201d, \u201ccannot even read properly\u201d, \u201cillegally possesses shares in the collective farm\u201d, \u201che has guns and threatens people with them ...\u201d All the same, the Court unanimously found a violation of Article 10. In the last case, Siryk v. Ukraine, the applicant sent a letter to the tax authorities in which she accused officials of corruption, for which she was condemned by the national court.

Greece, 25\u00a0November 1997, \u00a7 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 VII, and Bezymyannyy v. , no. 10941/03, \u00a7 42 , 8 April 2010). Although the letters were addressed to the media in the present case, but  officials, similar considerations must apply. The real impact, if any, of the letters on Z.W.\u2019s reputation could only have been very limited given that their content was never made known to the public.

In addition, while accepting that some of the statements made regarding the financial relations between Z.W. and the applicant\u2019s son-in-law may indeed have been highly inaccurate, it cannot be said that they were completely devoid of any relevant factual basis, having in mind that there was an on-going financial dispute between the two.",
