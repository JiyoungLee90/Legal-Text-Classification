In a statement given on 29 January 2000 to the public prosecutor, the applicant stated that he had refrained from signing his statements before the police since they had contained expressions which had not been used by him.

Furthermore, on 27 January 2000, following the initiation of the criminal investigation against the applicants, the Mardin Directorate of Education (\u201cthe Directorate\u201d) initiated a disciplinary investigation against the applicants and a number of other civil servants into their political and ideological activities. Among those questioned within the context of that investigation were the applicants, about six to nine of their colleagues, as well as the principal and vice-principal of the primary school. In respect of the first applicant, three teachers briefly stated that they had been aware that the applicant was a Hizbullah supporter or had heard such rumours. One teacher colleague stated that he believed the applicant was a Hizbullah supporter as he had seen his wife wearing a \u00e7ar\u015faf (chador). In respect of the second applicant, the teachers said that they knew him to be religious but that they had not witnessed him engaging in any ideological propaganda at school. One teacher submitted that the second applicant was rumoured to be a Hizbullah supporter. In respect of both applicants, most of the teachers submitted that their suspension from the school had disrupted the working order of the institution in so far as the applicants\u2019 students had had to be transferred to the rest of the teachers, resulting in merged classes of sixty to seventy pupils. The principal and vice-principal stated that they had not witnessed or been made aware of anything to suggest that the applicants had connections with the illegal organisation. The applicants denied the allegations and stated that they wanted to return to their duties as soon as possible.",

They also went on to add that this conclusion was corroborated by the statements of the applicants\u2019 teacher colleagues. They then decided that the nature of the criminal proceedings against the applicants on charges of membership of a terrorist organisation fell within the ambit of section 125 (E) (a) of the Law on Civil Servants (Law no. 657), which provides for the dismissal of a civil servant for disrupting the peace, tranquillity and working order of an institution for ideological and political purposes.

The Regional Administrative Court then went on to examine the different types of offences that may be committed by civil servants, differentiating between acts amounting to disciplinary offences exclusively, acts considered to be offences under both disciplinary and criminal laws and, lastly, acts defined as offences only under the Criminal Code. In the light of this classification, the Diyarbak\u0131r Regional Administrative Court decided that the act attributed to the second applicant, that is, membership of a terrorist organisation, fell under the third category of acts punishable only under the Criminal Code, the determination of which could only be made by a competent criminal court. Bearing in mind that the relevant criminal proceedings were still pending before the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court, the Regional Administrative Court concluded that the second applicant could not, for the time being, be lawfully dismissed from the civil service on account of membership of a terrorist organisation.

Considering that none of the people questioned at the school had witnessed such propaganda by the second applicant there, and bearing further in mind that \u201cmembership of a terrorist organisation\u201d was not one of the exhaustive grounds for dismissal from the civil service listed in the relevant section, the second applicant\u2019s dismissal had had no legal basis.",

Referring to the second applicant\u2019s statements given to the police, his CV obtained from the Hizbullah safe house in Istanbul and the bill of indictment filed against him by the Mardin public prosecutor, the Supreme Administrative Court then found it established that the second applicant was a member of a terrorist organisation who in addition had recruited members to the organisation and pursued the ideology of the terrorist organisation in the classroom. It continued that even if his colleagues had not witnessed such action on the part of the second applicant at the school, his dismissal had still been justified under a different subsection of section 125 (E), namely subsection (g), which authorised the dismissal of civil servants who were found to engage in \u201cdisgraceful and shameful conduct incompatible with the position of a civil servant\u201d.",

The Court has acknowledged in its caselaw the existence of two aspects to the protection afforded by the presumption of innocence: a procedural aspect relating to the conduct of the criminal trial, and a second aspect, which aims to ensure respect for a finding of innocence in the context of subsequent proceedings, where there is a link with criminal proceedings which have ended with a result other than a conviction (see, generally, Allen v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a025424/09, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94, ECHR 2013). Under the first aspect, the principle of the presumption of innocence prohibits public officials from making premature statements about the defendant\u2019s guilt and acts as a procedural guarantee to ensure the fairness of the criminal trial itself. However, it is not limited to a procedural safeguard in criminal matters: its scope is broader and requires that no representative of the State should say that a person is guilty of an offence before his or her guilt has been established by a court (see Konstas v. Greece, no. 53466/07, \u00a7 32, 24 May 2011). In that connection the presumption of innocence may be infringed not only in the context of a criminal trial, but also in separate civil, disciplinary or other proceedings that are conducted simultaneously with the criminal proceedings (see Kemal Co\u015fkun v. Turkey, no. 45028/07, \u00a7 41, 28\u00a0March 2017). While the scope of the first aspect under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention covers the period in which a person has been charged with a criminal offence until the criminal proceedings are finalised, the second aspect of the protection of the presumption of innocence comes into play when the criminal proceedings end with a result other than conviction, and requires that the person\u2019s innocence vis-\u00e0-vis the criminal offence is not called into doubt in subsequent proceedings (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 94).",

The Court observes in that connection that disciplinary and criminal proceedings were initiated simultaneously against the applicants following the allegations that they were members of an illegal organisation. The disciplinary decisions to dismiss them were taken while the criminal proceedings were still pending. In the case of the first applicant, the reasoning of the disciplinary decision was endorsed by the administrative court in its judgment of 14 April 2005 and by the Supreme Administrative Court on 6 June 2006, that is, after the decision had been taken on 13 September\u00a02004 to suspend the criminal proceedings against the applicant on charges of membership of an illegal organisation. Moreover, those judgments were upheld during the subsequent rectification proceedings, even though by that time the criminal proceedings against the applicant had been formally discontinued. In the case of the second applicant, the Supreme Administrative Court in its decision of 20 June 2008 endorsed the findings of the disciplinary authorities and held that the legal classification of the applicant\u2019s conduct corresponded to the disciplinary offence of disgraceful and shameful conduct that was incompatible with the position of a civil servant. The reasoning of the Supreme Administrative Court was followed by the Mardin Administrative Court in its judgment of 24\u00a0November 2009. The Court notes that those decisions also post-dated the decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against that applicant on charges of membership of an illegal organisation and to acquit him of the murder of two individuals and the wounding of a third.",

However, this overlap in time between the proceedings does not lead to an automatic application of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 to the subsequent proceedings; there must also be a link between two such sets of proceedings to justify extending the principle of the presumption of innocence to subsequent proceedings. The Court notes in that connection that the parties do not dispute the fact that the dismissal of the applicants from the civil service was directly related to the events leading to the criminal proceedings. The fact that the disciplinary authorities and administrative courts examined the criminal file and based their reasoning to a great extent on its contents is sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that a strong link existed between the criminal and disciplinary proceedings (see Alka\u015f\u0131 v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 21107/07, \u00a7 28, 18 October 2016).

They argued in that connection that the findings of the disciplinary and judicial authorities had only concluded that the applicant had a link with the illegal organisation without suggesting that he had been aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation from a criminal law perspective. In the case of the second applicant, they contended that since the Mardin Administrative Court in its judgment of 24 November 2009 had limited its reasoning to the disciplinary sphere by expressly indicating that the criminal charges against the applicant had been discontinued, it could not be said that that court\u2019s reasoning ran contrary to the presumption of innocence. Lastly, they argued that where there were serious suspicions against civil servants, the disciplinary bodies should not have to await the outcome of criminal proceedings, which could take years to finalise.

Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuation decision in any other proceedings, the fair trial guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person\u2019s reputation and the way in which he or she is perceived by the public.

Much will depend on the nature and context of the proceedings in which the impugned decision was adopted (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 125, and Vella v. Malta, no. 69122/10, \u00a7 55, 11 February 2014). In cases concerning disciplinary proceedings, the Court accepted that there was no automatic infringement of Article 6 \u00a7 2 where an applicant was found guilty of a disciplinary offence arising out of the same facts as a previous criminal charge which had not resulted in a conviction. It emphasised that the disciplinary bodies were empowered to, and capable of, establishing independently the facts of the cases before them and that the constitutive elements of the criminal and disciplinary offences were not identical (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 124, and the cases cited therein). The Court has held in that connection that it is neither the purpose nor the effect of the provisions of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 to prevent the authorities vested with disciplinary power from imposing sanctions on a civil servant for acts with which he has been charged in criminal proceedings where such misconduct has been duly established. The Court further reiterates that the Convention does not preclude that an act may give rise to both criminal and disciplinary proceedings, or that two sets of proceedings may be pursued in parallel. The Court reiterates in that connection that even exoneration from criminal responsibility does not, as such, preclude the establishment of civil or other forms of liability arising out of the same facts on the basis of a less strict burden of proof (see, for example, Moullet v. France (dec.), no.\u00a027521/04; 13 September\u00a02007; \u00c7elik (Bozkurt) v. Turkey, no. 34388/05, \u00a7\u00a032, 12 April\u00a02011; Erkol v.

However, in the absence of a final criminal conviction, if the disciplinary decision were to contain a statement imputing criminal liability to the applicant for the misconduct alleged against him in the disciplinary proceedings, it would raise an issue under Article 6 \u00a7 2 (see Kemal Co\u015fkun, cited above, \u00a7 53, and the cases cited therein).",

The Court considers that the purpose of that qualification by the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court was to assess whether, on the basis of the case file before it, the offence for which the first applicant was being tried fell within the scope of offences to which Law no. 4616 was applicable. Indeed, the wording of Law no. 4616 is unequivocal, in that it requires criminal courts to suspend criminal proceedings in respect of certain offences without reaching a definitive conclusion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt (see, in particular, \u00c7elik (Bozkurt) v. Turkey, no. 34388/05, \u00a7 33, 12 April 2011). Against this background, the Court therefore concludes that the suspension decision in the case of the first applicant did not constitute a finding of guilt.

The second part of the judgment, which reiterates the principle that exoneration from criminal liability does not preclude the finding of a disciplinary offence, is likewise not problematic from the angle of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. Thus it remains for the Court to determine whether the last sentence where the court finds the first applicant\u2019s disciplinary liability to be established on the basis of the alleged facts, namely that the first applicant had given the organisation his profile and that he had attended its lessons and meetings, could be said to impute criminal guilt to the first applicant. The Court considers that the language used in the statement cannot be equated to a finding of criminal liability for the offences with which the first applicant had been charged in the criminal proceedings. The meaning that flows from the impugned statement is not that the first applicant had been a member of the terrorist organisation \u2013 which had been the charge in the criminal proceedings \u2013 but merely that he had handed his CV to the organisation and attended its lessons and meetings, which was found sufficient by the administrative court to entail his disciplinary liability. For this reason, the Court cannot find that the language used by Diyarbak\u0131r Administrative Court in finding against the first applicant in the disciplinary proceedings at issue offended the presumption of innocence guaranteed to him under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

The thinking underlying this notion of \u201cerreur manifeste d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation\u201d (a concept of French administrative law), as used in the context of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, is doubtless that if the error of law or fact by the national court is so evident as to be characterised as a \u201cmanifest error\u201d \u2013 that is to say, is an error that no reasonable court could ever have made \u2013, it may be such as to disturb the fairness of the proceedings (see Bochan (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7 62). In Khamidov, the unreasonableness of the domestic courts\u2019 conclusion as to the facts was \u201cso striking and palpable on the face\u201d that the Court held that the proceedings complained of had to be regarded as \u201cgrossly arbitrary\u201d (see Khamidov, cited above, \u00a7 174). In An\u0111elkovi\u0107, the Court found that the arbitrariness of the domestic court\u2019s decision, which principally had had no legal basis in domestic law and had not contained any connection between the established facts, the applicable law and the outcome of the proceedings, amounted to a \u201cdenial of justice\u201d (see An\u0111elkovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 27). In Carmel Saliba v. Malta (no. 24221/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a069-79, 29 November 2016), the Court criticised the domestic courts for having relied on the inconsistent testimony of one witness and having failed to adequately comment on the remaining evidence; combined with other less significant shortcomings of the civil proceedings, this meant that those proceedings had not been fair. In Tel v. Turkey (no. 36785/03, \u00a7\u00a075, 17\u00a0October 2017), the Court held that the administrative court\u2019s dismissal of the request to rectify a decision which had been based solely on a document that that court had set aside with retroactive effect in a related set of proceedings had been a manifest error of assessment.",

What therefore remains for the Court to determine is whether the reasons advanced by the domestic court were based on a manifest factual or legal error. In determining this issue, the Court has to bear in mind that a civil standard of proof, that is balance of probabilities, was applicable to the administrative proceedings in question. That effectively meant that the trial court had to determine on the basis of the evidence provided by the parties whether the factual allegation supporting the claim was more probable than not. In that respect, while the crucial piece of evidence was the fact that criminal proceedings had been lodged against the applicant following the discovery of his CV in a safe house, the case as examined by the administrative court hinged on whether the first applicant\u2019s alleged misconduct could require his disciplinary liability on the legal grounds cited by the administrative authority. The first applicant challenged the findings of the administrative authorities by denying the allegations and submitting that the profile found in the safe house could not have been handed over by him since it contained obvious spelling errors and inaccurate information. No other fact was submitted by the applicant although it was open to him to adduce any evidence or argument to persuade the trial court in the proceedings which were conducted adversarially. In the Court\u2019s view, it cannot therefore be said that the applicant was put in a situation of extreme and unattainable standard of proof so that his claim, could not, in any event have had even the slightest prospect of success (compare Khamidov, cited above, \u00a7 174). Neither is it the case that the trial court gave an unreasonable weight to one piece of evidence by excluding other evidence which had called into question the credibility and relevance of the evidence presented by the other party (compare Carmel Saliba, cited above, \u00a7 69).",
