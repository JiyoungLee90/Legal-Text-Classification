While the first applicant started these proceedings on 6 September 1978 together with Jakob Bachmayer by filing a request for exchange, the second applicant only joined the proceedings on 16 January 1991, when he concluded a contract with Jakob Bachmayer for transfer of the rights to him (see paragraph 10 above). Thus the period to be taken into consideration is different for the two applicants. In respect of the first applicant the relevant period started on 27 June 1985 when the Salzburg Office of the Regional Governor in its capacity as Agricultural Authority partially dismissed the request, as it was from that moment that a \u201cdispute\u201d arose within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see K\u00f6nig v.

In respect of the second applicant it started when he became the successor of Jakob Bachmayer (see Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a064886/01, \u00a7 113, ECHR 2006V).",
