G. checked the left pocket of the applicant\u2019s jacket and took out two small white plastic bags. It was later established that the plastic bags contained amphetamines.

The court relied on statements made by police officers G. and M. who claimed that in February 2016 they had received information from their sources that the applicant and an unidentified person had been selling amphetamines that the applicant had been storing in his flat. They further submitted that on 17\u00a0February 2016, during a surveillance operation, they had detained the applicant. It had taken them approximately forty minutes to find lay witnesses so that they could conduct a search of the applicant, during which they had found amphetamines on him. The court also questioned P. and Ch. who had been the lay witnesses present during the search of the applicant. The court further relied on a record of the search, a report of 17 February 2016 of the medical examination of the applicant, and a forensic report identifying the substances contained in the plastic bags as amphetamines. As regards the applicant\u2019s allegation that G. had planted the drugs on him, the court interpreted it as an attempt on the applicant\u2019s part to avoid criminal liability.",

It took place more than an hour later, at 9.36 p.m., on the same date.

For over an hour the applicant was under the control of the police officers. Moreover, there is nothing to suggest that there were any special circumstances rendering it impossible to carry out a search immediately after the applicant\u2019s arrest.
