The District Court also held that the police officers V.S. and G.G. had exceeded their authority by acting violently against the applicant, which had caused serious damage and grave consequences to the applicant and his family. In particular, the applicant had been taken to the police station unlawfully and had been arrested on the basis of false information provided by traffic-police officers V.S. and G.G. The police officers had subjected the applicant to beatings, as a result of which the latter had sustained injuries, including a concussion and a fractured cheek bone. Furthermore, they had forced the applicant into the police car and driven him to the police station leaving the applicant\u2019s car, with his eightyear-old son inside, in the outside lane of the road. As a result, the applicant\u2019s son had suffered psychological trauma and damage to his health. In spite of the fact that the applicant had not violated the conditions of his written undertaking not to leave his place of residence and that he had been a disabled person and had had two minors as dependants, the investigator had applied to a court with an unfounded application seeking to have him detained. As a result, the applicant had been detained from 5 May to 20 June 2005. Moreover, the grounds for his release on 20 June 2005 under a written undertaking were the same as those which had already been used on 16\u00a0April 2005 to justify his release under a written undertaking as opposed to placing him in pre-trial detention. The District Court lastly found that the investigator had taken an unfounded decision not to prosecute the police officers by assessing their actions as lawful and asked the Prosecutor General, with reference to Article 184 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d), to institute criminal proceedings against them under Article\u00a0309 \u00a7 3 of the CC for exceeding their authority, resulting in grave consequences.",

In such circumstances, he had not been required to lodge an appeal and the prosecutor had been obliged to institute a criminal case against the police officers pursuant to Articles 175 and 176 of the CCP. Thereafter, because of the inaction of the investigative authorities, he had lodged a complaint with the courts on 27 November 2007, seeking to institute a criminal case on the basis of the final judgments and to bring the perpetrators to justice. The final decision in those proceedings had been taken by the Court of Cassation on 8 April 2009. Thus, he had complied with the requirements of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. As regards his civil claims, Armenian law at the material time had not envisaged compensation for non-pecuniary damage under any circumstances.

Turkey (dec.) [GC], nos. 46113/99 et al., ECHR 2010).

Lithuania [GC], no. 34932/04, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). It is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Kennedy v. the United Kingdom, no. 26839/05, \u00a7 109, 18 May 2010). Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see Selmouni v.

This could be seen as a first step towards launching a fresh investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment. The Court notes, however, that that decision was quashed upon appeal by the Criminal Court of Appeal on 12\u00a0November 2006, which, while accepting the fact of the applicant\u2019s illtreatment, nevertheless refused to request an investigation into that fact and instead applied the provisions concerning the reopening of a criminal case and found the possibility of reopening to be prohibited under Article 21 of the CCP (see paragraph 20 above). The applicant neither lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment, nor \u2013 assuming that such an appeal was not an effective remedy \u2013 applied to the Court within six months from the date of that judgment, and instead tried to raise that issue once again before the courts, using a procedure which had no prospects of success (see paragraphs 22-28 above).

The applicant, however, had failed to avail himself of this opportunity by not lodging a timely appeal against the investigator\u2019s decision of 21 June 2005. Thus, the final domestic decision concerning the applicant\u2019s alleged ill-treatment had been the decision of 21 June 2005, according to which the actions of the police officers had been found to be lawful, and consequently his civil claims had had no prospects of success. Accordingly, in the absence of a finding by a relevant authority of a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention, he had no \u201carguable claim\u201d under Article 13 in relation to his allegations of ill-treatment.",

Article 13 guarantees the availability of a remedy at national level to enforce \u2013 and hence to allege non-compliance with \u2013 the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. Thus, for Article 13 to apply it is sufficient for an individual to have an arguable claim in terms of the Convention (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, 27 April 1988, \u00a7\u00a052, Series A no. 131, and Poghosyan and Baghdasaryan v. Armenia, no.\u00a022999/06, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2012).",

The Court notes, in this connection, that there is nothing in the domestic law that appears to have automatically deprived the applicant\u2019s civil claims of any prospects of success in the absence of a criminal prosecution of the police officers. Moreover, the Government\u2019s argument contradicts the circumstances of the case and the findings of the domestic courts. In particular, as already noted above, even if the police officers\u2019 actions were never a subject of criminal prosecution and the domestic courts consequently never established the fact of the applicant\u2019s illtreatment in a criminal case against them, the courts in the applicant\u2019s trial found it established that the police officers had acted violently against the applicant and had beaten him, causing him serious injuries and damage. The applicant was found to have acted in self-defence and the investigator\u2019s decision, characterising the police officers\u2019 actions as lawful, was found to have been unfounded (see paragraph 18 above). Pursuant to Article 52 of the Code of Civil Procedures, those findings were binding on the civil courts (see paragraph 48 above), while Article 1063 of the Civil Code provided that the State was liable for any \u201cunlawful actions\u201d of the public authorities and their officials (see paragraph 52 above). It is notable that none of the applicant\u2019s civil claims were dismissed by the courts for the reasons specified by the Government. His claim for compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage was dismissed on the grounds that that type of compensation was not provided for by the domestic law, while his claim for pecuniary damages was dismissed because the courts found no causal link between the ill-treatment and the specific medical costs claimed by the applicant (see paragraphs 30, 32 and 35 above). Moreover, in the latter proceedings the trial court explicitly stated that the applicant had a case for damages under Article 1063 of the Civil Code, taking into account the unlawfulness of the police officers\u2019 actions (see paragraph 35 above).",

The Court notes that it has already found, in similar circumstances, the unavailability of compensation for non-pecuniary damage under Armenian law to be in violation of the guarantees of Article\u00a013 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 45-48).

In the present case, the documentary evidence submitted by the applicant concerned only the amount of EUR 3,000. The remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim is therefore not supported by any proof and must be dismissed. As regards the EUR 3,000 payable under the contract, the Court has previously dismissed a similar objection by the Government (see Saghatelyan v. Armenia, no. 7984/06, \u00a7\u00a7 61-63, 20\u00a0October 2015). On the other hand, legal costs are only recoverable in so far as they relate to the violation found (see Beyeler v. Italy (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7\u00a027, 28 May 2002). The Court notes that the majority of the applicant\u2019s complaints have been declared inadmissible. Hence, the legal costs claimed by the applicant cannot be awarded in full. Regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR\u00a0500 to cover the costs under this head.",
