The applicant and her neighbours who witnessed the events of 5 February 2000 were questioned for the first time as late as in April 2001, that is, more than a year after Yakub Iznaurov's disappearance. In 2003-2004 the investigating authorities questioned five more witnesses who also confirmed the events as presented by the applicant. These delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",

The Court notes firstly that Yakub Iznaurov's sister was granted victim status in April 2001 and his father in April 2003, that is, more than a year and more than three years respectively after the events in question. The Court further observes that, in any event, neither the applicant nor her relatives were duly informed of the progress of the investigation. Almost no information concerning the investigative actions was provided to them and they were informed about suspensions and resumptions of the investigation either with significant delay or not at all.",

Inasmuch as it concerns complaints that might be lodged by the applicant within the criminal proceedings, the Court observes that the applicant, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged actions or omissions by investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, taking into account that the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in its early stages, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedies relied on by the Government were ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicant's failure to exhaust domestic remedies.",

A failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their possession without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention. In a case where the application raises issues of the effectiveness of the investigation, the documents of the criminal investigation are fundamental to the establishment of the facts and their absence may prejudice the Court's proper examination of the complaint both at the admissibility and at the merits stage (see Tanr\u0131kulu v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7 71, ECHR 1999-IV).",

However, its judgments are essentially declaratory in nature and, in general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment (see, among other authorities, Scozzari and Giunta\u00a0v.

In particular, the Assanidze judgment ordered the respondent State to secure the applicant's release so as to put an end to the violations of Article 5 \u00a7 1 and Article 6 \u00a7 1, whereas in the Tahsin Acar\u00a0judgment the effective investigation was mentioned in the context of the Court's examination of the respondent Government's request for the application to be struck out on the basis of their unilateral declaration. The Court further notes its above finding that in the present case the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined at its early stages by the domestic authorities' failure to take meaningful investigative measures (see paragraphs 111-113 above). It is therefore very doubtful that the situation existing before the breach could be restored. In such circumstances, having regard to the established principles cited above and the Government's argument that the investigation is currently under way, the Court finds it most appropriate to leave it to the respondent Government to choose the means to be used in the domestic legal order in order to discharge their legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention.",
