They secondly contended that, even after failing to appeal on time, the applicant could have applied to have the administrative proceedings reopened, because the Jurbarkas District Court had breached domestic law by ordering an administrative penalty while the criminal proceedings were ongoing. The Government argued that, in line with domestic law, the district court\u2019s error had warranted the reopening of the administrative proceedings and an annulment of the penalty (see paragraph\u00a029 above), and provided examples of domestic case-law in which individuals had succeeded in having their administrative penalties annulled.

As submitted by the Government, punishment for minor hooliganism served to protect public order and peace (see paragraph 38 above) \u2013 values and interests which often fall within the sphere of protection of criminal law (see Sergey Zolotukhin v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no.\u00a014939/03, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2009). Furthermore, that provision of the Code of Administrative Offences was directed towards all citizens rather than towards a group possessing a special status, and its primary aims were punishment and deterrence, which are recognised as characteristic features of criminal penalties (see Sergey Zolotukhin, ibidem, and Milenkovi\u0107 v.

Where that penalty involves the loss of liberty, there is a presumption, which can be rebutted entirely exceptionally, that the charges against the applicant are \u201ccriminal\u201d. While the actual penalty imposed on the applicant is relevant to the determination, it cannot diminish the importance of what was initially at stake (see Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056). In the present case, Article\u00a0174 of the Code of Administrative Offences provided for thirty days of detention as the maximum penalty (see paragraph 26 above). Thus, irrespective of the fact that the applicant was given a warning (see paragraph 11 above), the Court considers that the maximum potential penalty for the offence of minor hooliganism was of sufficient severity to make those proceedings \u201ccriminal\u201d within the meaning of Article 4 \u00a7 1 of Protocol No. 7 (see Milenkovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 36).\u00a0The Court also observes that the Government did not submit any arguments to the contrary.",

Meanwhile the criminal proceedings against him, which had been opened on 23\u00a0July 2006 (see paragraph 9 above), continued until 6\u00a0September 2011, before being terminated as time-barred (see paragraph 18 above). Thus, the two sets of proceedings coincided in time, and the criminal proceedings continued after the decision ordering the administrative penalty had become final. The Court observes that the domestic authorities acknowledged on multiple occasions that the applicant had already been given an administrative penalty, although they eventually decided that it did not preclude the continuation of the criminal proceedings (see paragraphs\u00a01316 above; compare and contrast A and B v.\u00a0Norway, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012134 and\u00a014447). Accordingly, it finds that the domestic authorities permitted the duplication of proceedings against him in the full knowledge of his previous administrative penalty. In this connection the Court also observes that, contrary to the Government\u2019s submissions (see paragraph 40 above), it is immaterial that the criminal proceedings did not end in conviction because Article\u00a04 \u00a7\u00a01 of Protocol No. 7 contains not only the right not to be punished twice but also extends to the right not to be prosecuted or tried twice (see Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7 83, and Kapetanios and Others v.

The Court observes, however, that the administrative and criminal proceedings against the applicant addressed the same words and statements spoken in the hospital on the same night in the presence of the same officers \u2013 it was alleged that the swearwords had contained threats and insults towards those officers. It cannot therefore be said that the applicant was given an administrative penalty for some of his statements and charged with criminal offences for some other statements (see, mutatis mutandis, Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a097; Butnaru and\u00a0Bejan-Piser v.\u00a0Romania, no. 8516/07, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 23 June 2015; and Milenkovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040-41; contrast with Dungveckis v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 32106/08, \u00a7 44, 12\u00a0April\u00a02016). Furthermore, although the criminal charges also included additional facts, namely the telephone conversation between the applicant and an officer (see paragraphs\u00a07 and 49 above), that does not change the fact that the criminal charges embraced the facts of the administrative offence of minor hooliganism in their entirety and that, conversely, the administrative offence did not contain any facts not contained in the criminal charges (see, mutatis mutandis, Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7 97, and Khmel v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a020383/04, \u00a7 65, 12 December 2013).",

It stresses in this respect that neither the text of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 nor the Court\u2019s case-law allows for any exceptions to the ne bis in idem principle. While it is in the first place for the Contracting States to choose how to organise their legal systems, including their criminal justice procedures (see A and B v. Norway, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0120), the system chosen must not contravene the principles set forth in the Convention (see Taxquet v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2010, and the case-law cited therein). In this connection the Court also observes that Lithuanian law appears unambiguous in stating that a person who has been held administratively liable cannot be held criminally liable for the same offence (see paragraph\u00a028 above) and that the annulment of a previous administrative penalty after a criminal conviction would not render the proceedings in compliance with the ne bis in idem principle (see paragraph\u00a029 above). The Court therefore cannot accept the Government\u2019s submission (see paragraph\u00a040 above) that the duplication of proceedings against the applicant for the same offence was justified.",
