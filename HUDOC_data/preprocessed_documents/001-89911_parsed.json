Given a considerable number of reported enforced disappearances of persons in the  and persistent confrontation between illegal armed groups and federal troops in the region in the early 2000s, the Court considers that the disappearance of Movsar Tagirov could be regarded as life-threatening.

Inasmuch as it concerns the fact that the domestic investigation is still pending, the Court notes that the authorities' failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures undermined the effectiveness of the investigation in its early stages. Moreover, the Government mentioned the possibility for the applicants to apply for judicial review of the decisions of the investigating authorities in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court observes that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged actions or omissions of the investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, taking into account the finding that the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the criminal-law remedies relied on by the Government were ineffective in the circumstances and rejects their objection concerning the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
