The Court of Appeal went on to examine whether these conditions were met. As to section 6 of the Media Act, it found that the applicant had not denied that criminal proceedings on suspicion of intentionally causing danger by explosives were pending against him. Given this uncontested factual basis, the description of the suspicion against the applicant in specific terms did not constitute defamation. A right of action under section 7 of the Media Act was excluded in any case, as this provision protected only the strictly personal sphere. Section 7b provided for a compensation claim if someone was depicted as the perpetrator of an offence and not merely as a suspect. However, the article did not claim that the applicant had committed the letter bomb attacks; it only described him as being a suspect while drawing the reader\u2019s attention to the criminal proceedings which were pending against him. In conclusion, the Court of Appeal found that the  had, albeit with insufficient reasoning, rightly discontinued the proceedings. The decision was served on 25 January 1996.",

The Government claimed that, upon such a complaint, the appellate court would have ordered the first-instance court to continue the proceedings and to hold a hearing. Although there was no example for such a practice in compensation proceedings under the Media Act, this followed from the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 30 June 1999 and the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 10 December 1999 which were both given in the light of the Court\u2019s Werner v.

In this context, the Court reiterates that the public character of court hearings constitutes a fundamental principle enshrined in paragraph 1 of Article 6. Admittedly, neither the letter nor the spirit of this provision prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or tacitly, the entitlement to have his case heard in public, but any such waiver must be made in an unequivocal manner and must not run counter to any important public interest (see, among other authorities, the Schuler-Zgraggen v.

Nor is the Court convinced by the Government\u2019s argument that the appeal court would, upon a complaint by the applicant, have ordered the court of first instance to continue the proceedings and to hold a hearing. The Court notes in particular that the proceedings at issue came before the appeal court in late 1995 and early 1996, respectively, while the case-law relied upon by the Government, namely judgments of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court were only given in 1999 in the light of the Court\u2019s Werner case (loc. cit.).
