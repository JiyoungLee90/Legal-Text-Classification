The court observed that the prosecutors\u2019 decisions had been based only on statements by the two doctors and on the forensic report and held that the investigators in the case needed to clarify whether the patient\u2019s state of health had required his admission to the gastroenterology unit and whether treatment in that unit could have influenced the course of the victim\u2019s illness. The court ordered that such questions should be answered by way of a more thorough investigation, taking statements from doctors specialising in gastroenterology, as well as from other employees of the hospital. In addition, the court requested the prosecutors to clarify, by way of witness statements and confrontations, what was the practice of the hospital in dealing with cases of gastrointestinal bleeding and whether the two doctors had observed that practice. The judgment became final on 10 October 2008 when an appeal on points of law by the two doctors was rejected by the Timi\u015f County Court.",

The court held that, bearing in mind the seriousness of the case, which involved the death of a man, the investigation should have been more detailed and the applicant\u2019s allegations should have been more thoroughly checked. More specifically, the court noted that the applicant had maintained, among other things, that L.M. had been healthy and had never previously been admitted to hospital and that there had been delays in the administration of a particular drug and in giving blood transfusions. However, the medical reports had said that the deceased was suffering from an ulcer and cirrhosis. The court also reasoned that, even if it could be accepted that rapid changes could occur in such conditions, it was hard to believe that the victim had had no previous symptoms and had not been under the supervision of medical professionals prior to 22 August 2005. In view of the above, the court further requested that the prosecutors take statements from the family doctor and gather evidence about the victim\u2019s state of health prior to his admission to the Sibiu County Emergency Hospital.",
