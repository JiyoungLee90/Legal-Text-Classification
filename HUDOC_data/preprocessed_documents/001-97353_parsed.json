The Court reiterates that quashing of a judgment by means of supervisory review is an instantaneous act, which does not create a continuing situation (see Sardin v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no.\u00a069582/01, 12 February 2004). The Court observes that on 13 May 2004 the applicant received the money awarded to him in non-pecuniary damage by the appeal decision of 28 November 2001 (see paragraph 11 above), the validity of which had been restored by the supervisory review of\u00a026\u00a0September 2003. This fact permits the Court to conclude that the applicant must have learnt about the supervisory review in question on 13\u00a0May 2004 at the latest. It\u00a0follows that the complaint about the quashing of 26 September 2003 has been introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and\u00a04 of the Convention.",
