The case originated in three applications (nos. 54322/14, 60765/14 and 73407/14) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Russian nationals, Mr Oleg Dmitriyevich Sergunin, Mr Dmitriy Gennadyevich Isupov and Mr Sergey Vasilyevich Prokudin (“the applicants”), on 24 July, 16 October and 15 November 2014 respectively.
Mr Sergunin was represented by Ms N. Mirsaitova, a lawyer practising in Kazan. Mr Isupov was granted leave to present his own case. Mr Prokudin was represented by Mr A.

The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, former Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.

The applicants were owners of plots of land. The municipal authorities reclaimed the plots of land, and the applicants’ title to the real property in question was annulled. The details pertaining to each application are provided below.
The applicant in this case is Oleg Dmitriyevich Sergunin, who was born on 10 December 1967 and lives in Kazan.
On 5 September 2009 the local council transferred the title to a plot of land in Privolzhskiy district, Kazan, to G. The relevant documents confirming that the plot of land had been earlier assigned to G. had been prepared by Gib. The State land registry verified the legitimacy of the transaction and registered G.’s title to the plot of land.
On 10 December 2009 G. sold the plot of land to M. On 8 February 2010 M. sold the plot of land to N. On 16 March 2012 N. sold the plot of land to the applicant. Each time the transfer of the title to a new owner was verified and registered by the State authorities with the issuance of the relevant certificate.
On 13 March 2013 the Privolzhskiy District Court of Kazan found Gib. guilty of having committed fraud in respect of the transfer of the plot of land to G.
On 5 July 2013 a prosecutor acting on behalf of the local council brought an action seeking invalidation of the decision of the local council of 5 September 2009, invalidation of the applicant’s title to the plot of land and return of the plot of land to the municipality.
On 17 October 2013 the District Court granted the claims in full.
On 23 January 2014 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Tatarstan upheld the judgment of 17 October 2013 on appeal.

On an unspecified date the district prosecutor brought an action on behalf of the Kirov City Council with the aim of reclaiming the real property.
On 14 May 2014 the Novovyatskiy District Court of Kirov delivered two judgments, allowing the prosecutor’s claims in full. The court noted that the decisions allegedly issued by the local council assigning the plots of land to T. and S. had been forged and could not have served as a legal basis for the transactions in respect of the plots of land.
