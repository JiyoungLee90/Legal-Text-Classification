According to Section 193 of the Code of Civil Procedure, non-competent civil courts in Turkish law do not ex officio refer the case to competent administrative courts. The complainant may appeal against the decision of the civil court and subsequently choose to initiate new proceedings before the competent courts. Given that the initiative to introduce new proceedings rested with the applicant, the Court considers that the two sets of proceedings should be examined separately (see, \u00c7akmak and Others v. Turkey, no. 53672/00, \u00a7\u00a030, 25\u00a0January 2005; mutatis mutandis, Rezgui v. France (dec.), no. 49859/99, 7\u00a0November 2000). In this connection, the Court observes that the proceedings before the Diyarbak\u0131r Civil Court of First Instance ended on 12\u00a0February 1998. The present application was introduced on 9 June 2005. The Court finds, therefore, that this part of the applicant's complaint has been lodged outside the six-month time-limit and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",
