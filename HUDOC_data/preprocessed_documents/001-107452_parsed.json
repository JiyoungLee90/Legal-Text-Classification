On 20\u00a0May 2009 the asylum proceedings in respect of the applicant\u2019s first application came to an end; the applicant thus no longer enjoyed the status and rights of an asylum seeker in . In this connection it must be noted that the Government maintained the argument that the applicant lost his asylum-seeker status only on 9 June 2009. The Government relied in support of their argument on release order no. 4 and detention order no. 25. The Court considers that the Government have failed to explain the legal grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention after 20 May 2009, especially in view of the ruling of the Administrative Regional Court and the fact that the domestic law clearly provided that the ruling of 20 May 2009 was final (see paragraph 72 above) and that after that date the applicant could not have been considered as an asylum seeker (see\u00a0paragraph 70 above).",

Thus, the court order of 24 April 2009 could not possibly justify the applicant\u2019s detention after 20\u00a0May 2009 as this would be in breach of the time-limit set in domestic law. In the absence of any submissions from the Government indicating that the applicant\u2019s detention from 20 May to 9 June 2009 was carried out on some other legal basis, the Court cannot speculate as to whether his detention during this period was justified under the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention (detention with a view to deportation).

Hence, the applicant\u2019s detention after 10\u00a0July 2009 was not effected in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law, since it was in breach of the time-limit laid down by domestic law that did not allow for an asylum seeker\u2019s detention beyond the date of a final decision. The Court should add at this point that detention beyond the date of a final decision within asylum proceedings remained prohibited also under the new Asylum Law, which took effect on 14\u00a0July\u00a02009 (see paragraph 82 above). The Court is aware that on 17 July 2009 it was a court which authorised the applicant\u2019s detention; however, the Court considers that it was authorised in breach of the domestic time-limit laid down in the new Asylum Law (ibid.). Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s detention after 14 July 2009 was likewise not authorised in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law.",

The Court notes that the second set of proceedings commenced with the applicant\u2019s asylum application and lasted until 23 October 2009, when the final decision was adopted. It is true that when the appeal against the decision not to examine the asylum application was reviewed, the applicant did not enjoy the status of asylum seeker under domestic law (see paragraph\u00a075 above). Nevertheless, his detention during that period did not exceed the time-limit set down by domestic law, as the proceedings in question remained pending (contrast with paragraphs 125 and 128 above). It is regrettable that the applicant received contrasting information about his status as an asylum seeker (see paragraph 46 above), but that information did not affect the lawfulness of his detention as authorised by a court on 16\u00a0September 2009, because no final decision had been taken within the second set of asylum proceedings. As a result the Court is satisfied that the applicant\u2019s detention from 16\u00a0September to 23\u00a0October 2009 was effected in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law and was justified.",

His asylum application had been examined under the ordinary procedure (see paragraph\u00a014 above); the reference to regulations no. 29 (2003) in the applicant\u2019s deportation order, no. 2957 (see paragraph 26 above), therefore lacks pertinence in the Court\u2019s view.",

On the other hand, the office was authorised to issue a deportation order if an alien had been detained by the State Border Guard Service for having infringed the rules on entry into and residence in the country (see paragraph 93 above). It follows that the domestic authorities were authorised under national law to act with a certain degree of flexibility when choosing one of the two possible removal procedures to be applied to a failed asylum seeker. It should be noted at this point that the remaining legal grounds for issuing a deportation order, which were set out in the Immigration Law, could not be applied to a failed asylum seeker because of their specific nature (see paragraph 94 above).",

The Court notes, contrary to what has been suggested by the Government (see paragraph 113 above), that the applicant was not initially detained by the State Border Guard Service for infringing the rules on entry into and residence in the country, which could have triggered the second removal procedure (see paragraph 93 above). Instead, the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs proceeded directly to issue a deportation order, in connection with which the applicant was then detained; this removal procedure was not expressly prescribed by the Immigration Law. The domestic courts accepted implicitly that the applicant\u2019s removal under this procedure was authorised by national law, since neither in the judicial review proceedings concerning deportation order no.\u00a02957 nor in the proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s detention in that connection did they give any indication that the national law had not been complied with. This highlights the vagueness of the provisions in question, which was such that their practical effect for a failed asylum seeker could not be anticipated. The applicant could not have foreseen that a removal procedure other than that expressly provided for in the Immigration Law would be applied to him. Accordingly, the Court considers that the domestic law concerning the deportation procedure was not sufficiently precise and foreseeable in its application and fell short of the \u201cquality of law\u201d standard required under the Convention; hence, the underlying detention orders issued in respect of the applicant cannot be considered to have been \u201cprescribed by law\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Although in the present case the delay in the applicant\u2019s removal, which was caused by a misinterpretation of the domestic law, was not excessive, the Court considers that such errors could in other cases raise serious concerns of arbitrariness.",

The applicant\u2019s detention during this period was also based on section 51, paragraph 1, part 1 of the Immigration Law on account of the fact that he had infringed the rules on residence in the country (contrast paragraph 140 above). The choice of this legal ground for the applicant\u2019s detention allows the Court to distinguish the period under consideration (2\u00a0November 2010 to 9 January 2010) from the period scrutinised above (9\u00a0June to 10 July 2009). By referring to the applicant\u2019s stay in Latvia in violation of national law, the domestic authorities chose the second removal procedure \u2013 detention by the State Border Guard Service followed by a deportation order (see paragraph 93 above) \u2013 a procedure that was expressly laid down in law. This procedure did not offer any possibility for the alien concerned to leave the country voluntarily. The domestic law in this connection was sufficiently clear and precise \u2013 if an alien was detained for having infringed the rules on residence in the country, he faced deportation. This was the case for the applicant. In addition, an order for his deportation had already been issued and was still valid under domestic law; there was no need to issue a new one. The Court therefore considers that by following the removal procedure expressly laid down in law the national authorities on 2\u00a0November 2009 corrected their previous error in connection with the applicant\u2019s detention with a view to his deportation. It follows that the applicant\u2019s detention from 2 November 2009 to 9 January 2010 was effected in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law and was justified.",

In the Government\u2019s submission, the State Border Guard Service learned about the suspension of the applicant\u2019s deportation only on 11\u00a0January 2010. The Court cannot accept this argument for two reasons. Firstly, the State Border Guard Service had been aware as far back as 5\u00a0January 2010 that the applicant had applied for asylum on humanitarian grounds, since they received a copy of his application. Secondly, under domestic law he enjoyed the status of asylum seeker from the date of his application (see paragraph 75 above) and as such could not be deported (see paragraph 58 above). It follows that the State Border Guard Service did not act in good faith in deporting the applicant on 9\u00a0January 2010, before his application for asylum on humanitarian grounds was ever examined by the competent domestic authority. Therefore, his detention for that purpose was arbitrary.",
