In view of the above, the Presidium concluded that the lower courts incorrectly applied the substantive law and amended their judgments in the part concerning the applicant\u2019s immediate reinstatement by declaring that he should be considered as dismissed as a result of the liquidation of the employer organisation as from 17\u00a0January 2005 and that there was no need to send the matter to a new consideration.

As regards the last criterion, it has been the Court\u2019s constant approach that employment disputes require the authorities to act with particular expedition (see, mutatis mutandis, Obermeier v. Austria, judgment of 28 June 1990, Series A no. 179, \u00a7 72). The same approach is adopted by the domestic legislation which provides that such judgments are subject to immediate enforcement (see paragraph 44 above). Turning to the present case, the Court observes that the execution of the relevant part of the judgment of 17\u00a0January 2005 was not particularly complex, as the Plenum of the Supreme Court had issued specific guidelines in this respect (see paragraph 41 above). Despite that, it took the authorities almost one year and four months to resolve the applicant\u2019s employment situation, a period during which he remained in a particularly uncertain situation. Given what was at stake for the applicant and that the judgment of 17 January 2005 in this part was subject to immediate enforcement requiring special diligence, the Court finds that this delay was unreasonable (see, mutatis mutandis, Kopnin and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 2746/05, \u00a7 33, 28 May 2014). It consequently finds a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
