In one decision of 9 March 2006, a domestic court noted that the cells in the relevant prison had been designed to accommodate a large number of inmates and only the prison infirmary had been able to accommodate a lower number of inmates. Therefore, as the applicant in that case had not had any medical need to be placed in the infirmary, he was required to remain in a large cell. In another decision of 16 June 2006, a domestic court dismissed a prisoner\u2019s complaint concerning overcrowded cells and the fact of having to share a bed with another person. The court\u2019s reasoning was that the claimant\u2019s state of health had actually improved since he had been placed in detention, he had received adequate medical treatment and therefore that none of his rights had been violated.",

The Court notes that the applicant did not contradict the Government\u2019s submissions on the size of the cells. What is contested between the parties is the actual occupancy of those cells: while the Government submitted that the number of prisoners in a cell was always inferior or equal to the cell\u2019s designated occupancy, the applicant claimed that, at times, prisoners had had to share beds. The applicant also indicated that part of the surface of the cells had been occupied by the bathroom facilities.",

Poland, no. 17885/04, \u00a7 122, ECHR 2009... (extracts)). Thus, taking as a base of reference the figures indicated by the Government, during the few months spent in Jilava Prison the applicant had less than 1 sq. m available to him as personal space, during the seven-and-a-half years spent in Rahova Prison he had around 2.9 sq. m available to him on average, whereas in the few months spent in Margineni Prison he had less than 2 sq. m available to him. The Court further underlines that, in reality, these figures are even lower, taking into account that some of the room was occupied by the toilets and different items of furniture.",
