The Court observes that the requirements of Article 13 of the Convention are less strict than, and are in such situations absorbed by, those of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, among other authorities, Vasilescu v. Romania, 22 May 1998, \u00a7 43, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998III, and Fazliyski v. Bulgaria, no. 40908/05, \u00a7 45, 16\u00a0April 2013). The Court, being master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case, will therefore examine this complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:",

In laying down such regulation, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, but the final decision as to observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court. Limitations on the right to a court are compatible with Article 6 only if they do not restrict or reduce the access left to the litigant in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired; lastly, such limitations will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if they do not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0May 1985, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 93).",

This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature, such as time-limits governing the submission of documents or lodging of appeals (see, among other authorities, P\u00e9rez de Rada Cavanilles v.
