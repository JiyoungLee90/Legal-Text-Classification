When deciding about the applicant\u2019s complaints in the adversarial proceedings in which the State was represented by the competent State Attorney\u2019s Office (see paragraph 18 above) the domestic courts had full access to all the relevant case files and documents. Based on their assessment of relevant facts they found that the proceedings had not been unreasonably long and dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint (see paragraph 19 above). It remained, however, unclear what was the effect of the payments made to the applicant on the enforcement proceedings. Even if it would be accepted, as the Government suggested, that the decision of the competent court attesting to the termination of the proceedings had only declaratory meaning, the facts remains that such decision was never adopted (see paragraph 22 above).",
