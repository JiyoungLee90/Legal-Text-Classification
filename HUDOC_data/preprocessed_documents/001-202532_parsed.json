The applicant submitted that Article\u00a0179.4 of the CCrP was not applicable in this case and that the civil claim should have been examined under the relevant provisions of civil law, under which all the statutes of limitations had long expired for any types of civil claims. He argued that, for these reasons, the claim should have been dismissed.",

Such a civil claim was to be examined by the trial court hearing the criminal case from which the civil claim stemmed (see Article 187 of the CCrP in paragraph 27 above). Any periods for lodging a civil claim provided for by civil law and other fields of law did not apply to claims lodged under this procedure (see Article 179.4 of the CCrP in paragraph 28 above). It therefore appears that Article 179.4 of the CCrP precluded defendants in criminal proceedings from raising an objection that the civil claim lodged within the framework of those criminal proceedings was time-barred under civil law. However, in the applicant\u2019s case, there were no active criminal proceedings pending against him at the time the civil claim was lodged. The claim was lodged with and examined by the civil court. This was done despite the clear language of the CCrP, according to which a civil claim could be lodged on the basis of the CCrP only within the criminal procedure, before the court examining the criminal charges. Thus, the applicant\u2019s submissions concerning the lack of a lawful basis for the court\u2019s acceptance of that claim for examination under the procedure established by the CCrP for \u201ccivil claims within the framework of criminal proceedings\u201d and concerning the inapplicability of Article 179.4 of the CCrP were potentially decisive for the outcome of the case, as they might have led to dismissal of the claim.",

A \u201ccriminal charge\u201d, within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 of the Convention, exists from the moment that an individual is officially notified by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence, or from the point at which his situation has been substantially affected by actions taken by the authorities as a result of a suspicion against him. It is the actual occurrence of the first of the aforementioned events, regardless of their chronological order, which triggers the application of Article 6 in its criminal aspect (see Simeonovi v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a021980/04, \u00a7\u00a7 110-11, 12 May 2017, with further references; see also Allenet de Ribemont v.

The authorities intended to question him, albeit at that stage in the formal capacity of a witness, but clearly in connection with their suspicion that he had committed those offences (see paragraph 6 above). As expressly stated in the prosecuting authorities\u2019 decision of 21 January 2006, following the investigation, the authorities considered that the applicant should be formally charged under Articles 308.1, 179.2.3, 179.2.1, 179.3.2 of the Criminal Code, all of which provided for prison sentences in the event of a finding of guilt, but they were precluded from doing so owing to the expiry of the criminal prescription period (see paragraph 8 above). Lastly, the prosecuting authorities lodged a civil claim under the provisions of the CCrP on the procedure for \u201ccivil claims within the framework of criminal proceedings\u201d. As discussed in paragraph 39 above, that procedure required, inter alia, the existence of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d, as it could be lodged only against an \u201caccused\u201d person or a person who could be held materially liable for the criminal actions of the accused (and, in the present case, as noted above, the authorities considered that the applicant should have been charged as an \u201caccused\u201d).",

The question before it is whether the applicant was a person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. In order to answer that question, the Court is compelled to look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the situation before it (see Batiashvili v. Georgia, no. 8284/07, \u00a7 79, 10 October 2019). It notes once again that it is true that the applicant was never formally charged with a criminal offence in the discontinued criminal proceedings and that he became aware of the allegations made against him in those proceedings only sometime between February and May 2006 (see paragraph 10 above), after the civil claim under the CCrP had been lodged against him on 16 February 2006, less than a month after their discontinuation on 21 January 2006. However, having regard to the case-specific sequence of closely inter-connected events, described in paragraph 48 above, considered as a whole, as well as to the relatively close temporal proximity between the relevant events in question, the Court considers that, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the combined effect of the authorities\u2019 actions taken as a result of a suspicion against the applicant was that his situation was \u201csubstantially affected\u201d by the conduct of the authorities (compare, mutatis mutandis, Batiashvili, cited above, \u00a7 94) and that therefore, for the purposes of the present complaint, he must be considered as a person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 2.",

In their claim, the prosecution authorities relied on the evidence collected by the investigation, arguing that the defendants, including the applicant, had committed embezzlement of State funds in large amounts but could not be held criminally liable owing to the expiry of the prescription period, and requested the court to order these individuals to compensate the State for the \u201cembezzlement\u201d.
