In the Court's view, there is no doubt that the allegations of ill-treatment by the police amount to such a criminal offence. The applicant's complaint was submitted to a judge of the Dubrovnik County Court, which was in compliance with Article 173(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It follows that the applicant duly informed the relevant national authorities of the substance of his complaints under Article 3 of the Convention. A question now arises as to whether in the specific circumstances of the case at issue the applicant's complaint contained a credible assertion that he had suffered treatment infringing Article 3 at the hands of the police and consequently whether an obligation arose for the relevant State authorities to investigate the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment.",

This statement was recorded in the transcript of the hearing before the investigating judge and the applicant signed it. The Court, however, accepts that the applicant might have done so because of his fear of further beatings since, as he argued, he had been taken to the investigating judge by the same police officers who had allegedly beaten him. However, on 25 May 2004, about a month after the alleged ill-treatment, the applicant was again interviewed by the investigating judge, this time in the presence of his officially appointed defence counsel and he made no complaints about police brutality.

Thus, Article\u00a06\u00a0-especially paragraph 3 \u2013 may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions (see Imbrioscia v.\u00a0Switzerland, 24 November 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 275, and Salduz v.\u00a0\u00a0 [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 50, 27 November 2008). As the Court has already held in previous judgments, the right set out in paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 of the Convention is one element, amongst others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in paragraph 1 (see Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 37, and Brennan v. the , no.\u00a039846/98, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2001X 45).",

Therefore, the Court has no reason to examine compliance with the Article\u00a06 requirements as to the police interview. On the other hand, the statements the applicant gave, on three occasions, before the investigating judge were relied on by the trial court in establishing the facts of the case and finding the applicant guilty of murdering his wife. Hence, the Court must examine whether the manner in which these statements were given complied with the guarantees of fair trial under Articles 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Convention. In this connection, the Court stresses that the role of establishing the facts relevant to the assessment of the applicant's guilt is in the sole province of the national courts. The Court's task is to ascertain whether the proceedings considered as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see Kova\u010d v. Croatia, no. 503/05, \u00a7 25, 12\u00a0July 2007).",

Before the first interview the applicant expressly stated that he understood the warnings and that he chose to defend himself in person, without being legally represented. Although in his letter of 6\u00a0October 2004 the applicant stated that he wanted to retract his confession given on that occasion, the Court notes that the applicant did not confess to having murdered his wife, but only to having disposed of her dead body. During the second interview on 25 May 2004 when the applicant was legally represented, he repeated his statement from 24 April 2004. During the interview of 8 June 2004, also in the presence of the applicant's defence counsel, the applicant again admitted to having disposed of D.K.'s dead body and gave some further details about it.",

The Court accepts that these arguments might carry some weight in relation to the applicant's interview on 24 April 2004, shortly after he had allegedly been ill-treated by the police and in circumstances where the police officers had actually brought him before the investigating judge and where the applicant knew that they would also return him to custody, and in view of the fact that at that stage the applicant was not legally represented. However, at the second and third interviews, on 25 May and 8 June 2004, the applicant had legal representation. The Court reiterates that although not absolute, the right of everyone charged with a criminal offence to be effectively defended by a lawyer, assigned officially if need be, is one of the fundamental features of a fair trial (see Poitrimol v. France, 23 November 1993, \u00a7 34, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0277-A, and Demebukov v. Bulgaria, no. 68020/01, \u00a7 50, 28\u00a0February 2008). Nevertheless, Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) does not specify the manner in which this right should be exercised. It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court's task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial. In this connection, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to \u201cguarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective\u201d and that assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance such counsel may afford an accused (see Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 51).",

Also, the Court notes that the officially appointed defence counsel, acting on behalf of the applicant, lodged an appeal against a decision ordering investigation and also against a decision on extending the applicant's pre-trial detention. He also attended hearings held on 24 and 30 April 2004 before the Dubrovnik County Court investigating judge, at the latter of which three witnesses gave their evidence, and a hearing on 8 June 2004, thus showing that the officially appointed counsel actively defended the applicant's interests at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings and that his conduct gave no reason for the courts to doubt the quality of his representation of the applicant in any respect.",

However, the findings in that respect were corroborated by the evidence given by O.M. who stated that the applicant had told him that he had killed D.K. and asked him to help him dispose of her dead body as well as by the expert's report establishing that the bloodstains found in the applicant's flat belonged to D.K. These items of evidence were duly produced before the trial court when the applicant was represented by two counsel of his own choosing and where he had had the opportunity of challenging all the evidence against him as well as the prosecution's allegations.",
