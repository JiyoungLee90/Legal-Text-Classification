The only crime at issue was bribery resulting from the pact struck (patto corruttivo) between B. and the applicants. That pact had involved, on the one hand, a promise not to create problems for the construction companies in question, that is, favourable treatment for friends, and, on the other hand, it had been done in exchange for the making and receiving of regular payments of money. Such favouritism had had specific corresponding rewards according to comparative tables adjusted for the purpose. Indeed, the duration of the pact had required various amendments to the applicable tariffs, which had also depended on the rotation of the people and companies involved. However, it had consisted of one crime (unicit\u00e0 di reato) perpetrated over time, as each payment resulting from the original pact meant the renewal of the pact. In connection with the date on which the punishable act had been committed (tempus commissi delicti), with all the elements of the offence being present, the court considered that the period in question was the whole time from the initial pact and lasting throughout the execution of each act constituting its renewal. The prolonged nature of the act in question had had various consequences: (i) third persons who had not been involved in the original pact had nevertheless become accomplices in the offence of bribery; (ii)\u00a0limitation periods had to start running from the date of the last payment involving the accused and (iii) as in the case of continuing offences, an amendment to the relevant law during the period of the crime had to be applied also to the continuing offence of bribery of which the applicants had been accused.",

However, that was not the case as the applicants had been paid also to carry out acts which were contrary to the duties of their office, which was covered by the \u201cold\u201d Article 373 [\u00a7 1]. According to the Judge of Criminal Appeals, the amended Article\u00a0373, which expressly provided for the crime of direct bribery to include the promise of an omission or payment for a past omission, did not create a new crime but amounted solely to a more serious legal classification of acts which already constituted a crime.

That was because the applicants had not only been found guilty of omission of acts arising from their office, but also of having a general attitude of favouritism towards the companies de facto controlled by B. by sometimes not carrying out the necessary safety checks, doing fewer than necessary or ignoring possible irregularities. In doing so, they had been acting contrary to the duties related to their office in the interests of a private corruptor. It followed therefore that the more limited formulation of Article 373 before 2008 also covered the facts of the applicants\u2019 case.",

According to the judge, that opinion had been confirmed by the fact that in San Marino, as distinct from other systems of criminal law which provided for continuing offences (for instance, in Italy), a continuing offence could be constituted only from multiple violations of the same criminal provision (and not by the commission of different offences). Moreover, while the relevant Article of the Italian Criminal Code provided for the existence of the same criminal scheme (medesimo disegno criminoso), in San Marino the acts had to be connected by the same criminal plan (medesimo programma criminoso). Behaviour constituting a continuing offence had to be considered by the accused as the execution of a deliberate, previous plan, while acts which had not been regarded by the accused as being components of the plan should not be covered by the classification of a continuing offence.",

The Italian doctrine is inclined to consider a continuing offence as a fictitious legal unit (unit\u00e0 giuridica fittizia), inspired by the principle of favor rei and relevant in order to determine the punishment and for other particular purposes (inter\u00a0alia, the calculation of the limitation period of a crime and the territorial competence), while, in general terms, single violations retain their autonomy and must be considered as distinct offences ... the legislative unification represented by a continuing offence leaves the structure of each offence intact and completely autonomous, with many different and distinct events being considered as a single offence and as criminal activity over a long period. Consequently, each offence is subject to the limitation period provided for it by law. Such limitation period starts running from the cessation of the criminal activity\u201d.",

They pointed out that the relevant provision came under Chapter VII of the Criminal Code, which was entitled \u201cExtinction of the crime\u201d.

In the light of such caselaw, the applicants argued that each single episode of corruption, even if it was considered as part of a continuing offence, maintained its autonomy. Thus, in order to identify the provision and the penalty to apply to the case, each episode of corruption which had been attributed to the applicants had to be considered as having been committed on the date of the acceptation of each promise, or on the date of receipt of each payment (or gift) if such receipt had been prior to the promise (see Relevant domestic law, paragraph 25 above). In the opinion of the applicants, even the Judge of Criminal Appeals had confirmed such interpretation (see paragraph\u00a018 above).",

Thus, in the opinion of the Government, there had not been a retroactive application of the law. The Government referred to Articles 50 and 55 of the Criminal Code concerning continuing offences (see paragraph 22 above). Pursuant to Article 50, the criminal conduct of the applicants, constituting violations of the same criminal provision and being linked by the same criminal plan, had been characterised as a continuing offence. Pursuant to Article 55, in the event of a continuing offence, the latter had to be considered as having been committed until the last criminal act had been carried out, namely 1\u00a0January 2010 (see paragraph 10 above). In that light, the amended version of the relevant law on corruption, resulting from a combined reading of Articles\u00a050, 55 and 373 of the Criminal Code, was, in the Government\u2019s view, the only applicable law in the instant case.",

As a result, the amendment had not had any practical effect on the position of the applicants. Referring, in particular, to the firstinstance judgment, the Government pointed out that the judge had stated that the conviction had been based on the fact that the applicants had used their discretionary powers in a distorted way, thus constituting the offence of direct bribery under Article 373 \u00a7 1 (see paragraph 13 above), namely conduct which had been contrary to their official duties. So, even if the applicants\u2019 argument (namely, that it was necessary to consider each of their actions or omissions individually) had been accepted by the domestic courts, there would not have been any significant change as regards the position of the applicants, owing to the fact that the acts carried out before 23\u00a0September 2008 had also been acts of commission.",

The Government considered that both, the old and the new formula of Article\u00a0373 of the Criminal Code, provided for the same penalty. The difference between the two versions of the provision lay solely in the fact that a more specific definition of the punishable conduct (specificazione della condotta punibile) had been provided. Thus, in the Government\u2019s view, even assuming that the domestic courts had applied the old version of Article\u00a0373 instead of the new one, the punishment would have been exactly the same.

Rather, they argued that their conduct prior to the 2008 amendments did not amount to an offence at all, and thus they should not have been punished also for the acts committed prior to 2008. Thus, the Court notes that even accepting that Article 50 of the Criminal Code obliged the domestic courts to apply the post2008 amendment in cases of a continuing offence, the application of the concept of a continuing offence was of no consequence to the applicants\u2019 case because the law both before and after the amendments covered the same offence and was foreseeable. The Court will thus revert to the matter, which was referred to in the applicants\u2019 observations at a later stage if necessary.",

It was thus for the national judge to classify their conduct as falling under one or more of the said subparagraphs. In this connection, the Court refers to its general principles set out at paragraph 43 above concerning the assessment of facts and their legal classification. However, in the present case, it remains for the Court to examine whether there was a contemporaneous legal basis for the applicants\u2019 conviction and that the result reached by the relevant domestic courts was compatible with Article 7 of the Convention (compare the approach taken in Rohlena, cited above, \u00a7 52).",

Thus, the firstinstance judge characterised bribery inducing omission as a form of direct bribery, namely a type of bribery in which a corrupt public official received an undue payment in order to carry out an act contrary to the duties arising from his or her office. On this basis, the Court notes that the firstinstance judge implicitly considered that, with respect to the offence of bribery, omissions had to be considered as acts and that there was therefore no need to distinguish between omissions and commissions, both being acts contrary to the duties arising from a public official\u2019s office.",

Those provisions explicitly referred to the receipt of undue profit or a promise of such in order to carry out an act contrary to the duties arising from the functions of a public official. The Court has no doubt that the applicants were aware that payment to avoid carrying out their duties by failing to inspect construction sites and abstaining from sanctioning violations and irregularities was conduct which amounted to acts that were contrary to their duties and thus that they would constitute the offence of bribery, whatever its qualification. Thus, the Court considers that the consequences of failure to comply with the relevant criminal law were adequately foreseeable, not only with the assistance of legal advice, but also as a matter of common sense (see, mutatis mutandis, Moiseyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a062936/00, \u00a7 241, 9 October 2008 and, a contrario, Pessino v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a040403/02, \u00a7\u00a7 36-37, 10 October 2006). The domestic courts\u2019 interpretation was thus consistent with the essence of that offence.",
