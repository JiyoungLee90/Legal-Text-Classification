Thus, the situation calling into question the binding judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour could have been avoided, had the Commission lodged an ordinary appeal. It is noteworthy, however, that the Russian Codes of Civil Procedure, both that of RSFSR and that of the Russian Federation, permitted a party to apply for supervisory review even if it had not previously exhausted an ordinary appeal. In the present case the Commission failed to exercise its right to lodge an ordinary appeal and permitted the statutory ten-day time-limit to expire without challenging the judgment of 3 December 2002. The Government did not point to any exceptional circumstances that would have prevented the Commission from exposing its arguments to the District Court or making use of an ordinary appeal in good time (see Nelyubin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 27-28; Sergey Petrov, cited above, \u00a7 29; and Zvezdin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30-31).",

The Court notes that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article\u00a06 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 85, p. 16, \u00a7 12, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, \u00a7 27, 23 October 2003). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violations found (see Dovguchits v. Russia, no. 2999/03, \u00a7\u00a048, 7\u00a0June 2007). In the present case the Court recalls that the applicant received the arrears of his pension on 26 December 2002 and also, until August 2004, an increase based on a coefficient of 1.4. It was not, however, until 10 June 2005 that the Moscow City Court finally dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim for an increase to his pension which means that the quashing of the previous judgment deprived the applicant of the 1.4\u00a0coefficient increase from August 2004 until 10 June 2005. Having regard to this the Court awards the applicant 950 euros in respect of pecuniary damage.",
