Such a scheme, in which at least three seemingly unconnected undertakings in different countries cooperate to defraud the exchequer, entails selling cheap products at an artificially high price to a domestic trader. The seller charges turnover tax on the price and would normally have to pay the tax to the exchequer. The trader would then export the goods. Since export sales are exempt from turnover tax, the trader could claim reimbursement of the turnover tax he had paid to the seller. However, the seller had never paid the tax to the exchequer, and \u2013 in cases where the scheme is successful \u2013 the trader receives reimbursement, and the seller receives turnover tax he has not paid to the exchequer. The foreign buyer often sends the cheap products back to the seller and a new circle begins, hence the name \u201ccarousel fraud\u201d.",
