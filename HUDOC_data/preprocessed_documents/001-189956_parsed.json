In this connection, the Court has held that applicants\u2019 delay in lodging a complaint is not decisive where the authorities ought to have been aware that an individual could have been subjected to ill-treatment, especially when the ill-treatment might have been inflicted by State agents (see Mocanu and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0265; Mafalani, cited above, \u00a7 78; and \u015eakir Ka\u00e7maz v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a08077/08, \u00a7 70, 10 November 2015). Following the applicants\u2019 arrest after their unsuccessful attempt to flee from prison, there were clear indications that violence may have been used against them. In particular, the authorities must have been alerted of such a possibility on the basis of the results of the applicants\u2019 forensic medical examination, which had been conducted in the presence of the investigator (see paragraphs 9-14 above). Thus, the obligation to investigate had arisen from the very beginning, even without an express complaint on the part of the applicants (see\u00a0Mafalani, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, with further references therein).",

With the above consideration in mind and also having regard to the worrying findings of various reports of the PDO and local human rights NGOs about the prisons in which the applicants were detained at all material times, namely, that the prison authorities systematically resorted to violent or otherwise unlawful measures to prevent abuses being reported (see paragraphs 36-38 above) and also the fact that all of the applicants had openly voiced their ill-treatment grievances at the earliest opportunity when they testified before the court in an open session (see paragraph 16 above), the Court cannot but conclude that the applicants would have faced difficult barriers in bringing their grievances before the competent authorities, as some of them indeed claimed (see paragraphs\u00a016 and 27 above).",

It notes in this connection that the two applicants concerned were convicted of resisting prison officers (see paragraph 17 above). These circumstances count heavily against the applicants concerned, with the result that the burden placed on the Government to prove that the use of force was not excessive in this case is less stringent (see Spinov v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a034331/03, \u00a7\u00a049, 27\u00a0November 2008; Rehbock v.\u00a0Slovenia, no.\u00a029462/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06578, ECHR\u00a02000XII; and Barta v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a026137/04, \u00a7\u00a071, 10\u00a0April 2007).",

Estonia, no.\u00a066393/10, \u00a7 75, 13 February 2014). It observes that the three arresting officers sustained a variety of injuries during the incident (see Dilek Aslan v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 34364/08, \u00a7 48, 20 October 2015, and, a contrario, Dedovskiy and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a07178/03, \u00a7\u00a082, ECHR\u00a02008\u00a0(extracts)). The injuries sustained by the two applicants, on the other hand, were classified cumulatively as minor ones with no long-lasting effects on their health (see Spinov, cited above, \u00a7 50, and T\u00fcz\u00fcn v. Turkey, no.\u00a024164/07, \u00a7 37, 5\u00a0November 2013; also compare Mikiashvili and Dvalishvili, both cited above, in which, in addition to bruising and abrasions, the applicants were diagnosed with head injuries and concussion with a long-term impact on their health). In any event, the degree of bruising on an applicant\u2019s body alone cannot rule out the possibility that the injuries originated from the use of necessary force (see Sapo\u017ekovs, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66, in which the Court found that \u201cmany\u201d bruises on the applicant\u2019s body and extremities could not alone sufficiently prove that the authorities had used excessive force). It is also worth noting that it appears from the materials in the case file that the events surrounding the escape attempt were unfolding spontaneously. Hence, the prison officers engaged in the arrest operation might have been unable to take measures to minimise any attendant injury (see Berli\u0144ski v.\u00a0Poland, nos. 27715/95 and\u00a030209/96, \u00a7 62, 20 June 2002; and, a contrario, Kurnaz and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 36672/97, \u00a7 55, 24 July 2007, in which there had been earlier indications that the prisoners were staging a riot).",

Georgia [Committee], no. 2316/09, \u00a7\u00a7 23-24, 17 January 2019; see also \u0160titi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia [Committee], no. 16883/15, \u00a7 64, 6 September 2018, with further references therein). The Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicants also alleged that their beating had continued in a punishment cell of the prison after their surrender (see paragraphs 7 and 26 above). It notes, however, that the scarce medical evidence in the case-file did not differentiate the injuries resulting as a response to the initial force used during the arrest and the injuries that allegedly followed due to the subsequent ill-treatment. In such circumstances and given its findings above, the Court is not in a position to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicants had been beaten in a punishment cell. It particularly emphasises on that point that its inability to reach a conclusion as to whether there had been treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention subsequent to the applicants\u2019 arrest derives considerably from the failure of the domestic authorities to effectively investigate the applicants\u2019 complaint (see in this connection paragraphs 65-70 below; see also Thuo v.\u00a0Cyprus, no.\u00a03869/07, \u00a7\u00a7 148-149, 4 April 2017).",

Its findings were then simply endorsed by the Office of the Chief Prosecutor, without the latter having made any additional enquiries of its own, as the basis for dismissing the case. This institutional connection between the investigator and those implicated by the applicants in the incident, in the Court\u2019s view, raises legitimate doubts as to the independence of the investigation conducted (see Mikiashvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a087, with further references therein). The fact that the prosecutor made no attempts to scrutinise the investigator\u2019s account of the incident further undermines the effectiveness of the investigation (see Matko v.

Nor did the forensic medical examination of the applicants\u2019 injuries comply with the requisite standards of independence, as it was conducted in the presence of the investigator who was later implicated by the applicants in the misconduct (see Dvalishvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a047; Akko\u00e7 v.

In the instant case, notwithstanding the fact that the authorities promptly arranged a forensic examination of the applicants\u2019 injuries, even if it was not unproblematic, the Court cannot overlook the length of time it took before an official investigation got under way and statements from pertinent witnesses were obtained (see paragraphs 18-24 above; see also Identoba and\u00a0Others v.

The credibility of the prison officers\u2019 statements should have been questioned, as the investigation was supposed to establish whether they were liable to face criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v.

Furthermore, the questioning of the arresting officers was superficial. Having examined the substance of their statements, the Court notes that all of them made formulaic statements to the effect that they had not participated in any illtreatment and the physical force they had used to arrest the applicants had been necessary (see Dvalishvili, cited above, \u00a7 49, and Buntov v. Russia, no. 27026/10, \u00a7 131, 5 June 2012).
