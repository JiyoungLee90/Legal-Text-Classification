The payments were supposed to go through a commercial bank situated in Krasnodar [a city in southern ].

On 29 April 1999 a consultation meeting took place in the office of the head of the Yagodninskiy District [of Magadan Region], where the question of payment of the local taxes due by Kolymaenergo Plc was discussed. It was no accident that that question was on the agenda of the meeting: by that time the outstanding fiscal debt of the energy industry [vis-a-vis the local authorities], including the carryovers from previous years, amounted to 228,700,000 roubles \u2013 a very significant amount for the District [budget]. As a result of the discussion an agreement was reached which provided, in particular, that (direct quote) \u201cthe administration of the Yagodninskiy District discharges Kolymaenergo Plc from the payment of 228,700,000 roubles in local taxes. In return, Kolymaenergo Plc transfers [to the administration] its shares worth 228,700,000 roubles, at the market rate applicable at the moment of the transfer\u201d. Both parties signed the minutes of the meeting containing that clause. Naturally, among the signatures were those of Mr\u00a0F.I.T., the head of the local administration, and Mr G.I.S., the managing director of Kolymaenergo.

On different dates, all within the period of open distribution of the shares, a number of potential investors concluded standard acquisition agreements with Kolymaenergo Plc. Edinye Energeticheskiye Systemy Rossii [the biggest State-controlled energy company at that time], for good reason, bought shares for almost 1,680,000,000 roubles, thus investing in the construction of the Ust-Srednekanskaya HEPP. However, the situation has since changed, for the worse as regards most of the investors. One of the local companies, Regiondragmet Ltd, expressed an interest in purchasing shares for 1,200,000,000 roubles. When the director of Kolymaenergo Plc. Mr G.I.S., learned about that offer, he requested that all previous offers and the book where they were registered be destroyed, and decided that henceforth he would take care of the distribution of the shares.",

And then that amount was passed ten times through the corresponding bank accounts, with the use of the same photocopied bank payment order.

Indeed, as the decision established, \u201c... owing to the absence of the bank account and of a recipient in the bank the money in the amount of 2,000 roubles was returned\u201d. To all appearances, that fact is established. However, on the same page, a few paragraphs below, one can read one of the arguments which the defendant put forward: \u201c... in breach of the agreement on the acquisition of shares the claimant had made the payment before the conclusion of the agreement.\u201d On the next page we see the court's conclusion, which was the central reason for dismissing the tort action: \u201c... at the moment of conclusion of the agreement the claimant had been required to transfer to the defendant no less than 200,000 roubles. The defendant, in accordance with section\u00a03.3 of the agreement, was to forward to the claimant the documents confirming the payment together with a signed copy of the agreement. However, in breach of the agreement, the claimant only transferred 2,000 roubles for the shares\u201d.",

In fact, contrary to what the court established, the payment had been made on 25 December, i.e., after the conclusion of the agreement, which had been signed on 9 December. What does this mean? First of all, it means that the materials in the case file were not duly studied by the court. Furthermore, what difference would it make if the claimant transferred 200,000 roubles and not 2,000? Would the correct bank account appear in the issue plan? Would it allow the company to become the lawful owner of the shares? Unfortunately, miracles are impossible, especially when nobody wants to produce a miracle. And please pay attention to the phrases which are underlined [in the quote above]. It is hard to reconcile the argument of the defendant (that the payment should have been made after conclusion of the agreement) and the argument of the court (that the buyer was under an obligation to send a signed copy of the agreement together with a document confirming payment). I will further note that the acquisition agreement required [the buyer] to pay 50 per cent of the overall sum of the transaction, but did not specify whether such payment had to be made in instalments or in one go.",

Since it had been an act of political censorship, the recall of the copies could not be regarded as a \u201cvoluntary withdrawal\u201d as the Government suggested.

The Government argued that Magadan municipality was not a \u201cState authority\u201d within the Convention meaning. However, the Court is not convinced by that argument.\u00a0Firstly, in a number of cases the Court has regarded the debts of municipal enterprises as State debts (see, for example, Gizzatova v. Russia, no. 5124/03, 13 January 2005). In a very recent case, also concerning State responsibility for the debts of a municipal enterprise, the Court held that local (that is, municipal) authorities were linked to the State administration (see Yershova v. Russia, no. 1387/04, \u00a7\u00a7 54 et seq., 8\u00a0April 2010). The Court's reasoning in Yershova clearly implied that it did not regard municipalities as not being part of the State authorities in the broad sense, even if in domestic terms municipal authorities were independent from regional and federal government. In Russian law municipal authorities are treated on the same footing as federal or regional bodies for many purposes (see, for example, the full text of Article 1070 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation concerning strict liability of State bodies for certain types of civil wrongs, quoted in Matveyev v. , no.\u00a026601/02, \u00a7 30, 3 July 2008; see also the analysis of the word \u201cState body\u201d employed in section 57(4) of the Media Act in Romanenko and Others v. Russia, no. 11751/03, \u00a7 45, 8 October 2009). The municipal bodies are formed by the local population; they have wide-ranging powers in various areas of life, examples of which can be found in the Court's caselaw concerning Russia (see, for example, Kimlya and Others v. Russia, nos. 76836/01 and 32782/03, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2009...; Kuimov v. Russia, no.\u00a032147/04, \u00a7 30, 8\u00a0January 2009; and Kukalo v. , no. 63995/00, \u00a7\u00a033, 3 November 2005). Even if their competence is limited (see, mutatis mutandis, Cherepkov v.  (dec.), no. 51501/99, ECHR 2000I, where the Court analysed whether municipal bodies had \u201clegislative power\u201d within the meaning of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 of the Convention), their powers cannot be characterised as anything other than \u201cpublic\u201d. Therefore, Magadan municipality was a \u201cpublic authority\u201d within the Convention meaning and the Court has competence ratione personae to examine its actions.",

France [GC], no.\u00a029183/95, \u00a7 45, ECHR 1999-I). However, in the specific case at hand the domestic courts did not analyse the content or the form of the article at all.

Furthermore, the Court has established that the copies of the newspaper were withdrawn because of the viewpoint expressed in the applicant's article. However, the domestic courts did not consider that the rights of the author of the article required any special protection under Article 10 of the Convention. Basing their findings on the mistaken assumption that the case was basically about the right of the owner to freely dispose of his property, they failed to examine the reasons for the withdrawal of the copies and to balance the applicant's freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention against any other interests that may have been at stake (for instance, the reputation of the person targeted by the article). Accordingly, the decision-making process in this case was deficient from the standpoint of Article 10 of the Convention.
