The discussion ended with [the accused's refusal] and a scuffle; [the accused] hit L.S. in the face. That incident was observed, from the very beginning, by M.C. and W.K. [also present at the train station] who decided to inform the police. After their intervention two uniformed police officers arrived. Seeing them, the accused started to run away. He was apprehended after a while. He behaved aggressively and tried to get away. The police officers handcuffed him and took him to the police station (testimony of W.K., p.\u00a014, 182-183, 321; M. C., p.13, 184; J.S., p. 45, 157; A.M., pp. 44, 156).",

As the Court has stated on a number of occasions (see, among other authorities, L\u00fcdi, cited above, p.\u00a021, \u00a7\u00a047), it may prove necessary in certain circumstances to refer to statements made during the investigative stage.

The corollary of that, however, is that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on statements that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see Sa\u00efdi v.

This understanding is confirmed in other cases where the Court has found a breach although the evidence was not considered the sole evidence or the decisive evidence. Thus, in L\u00fcdi v.\u00a0Switzerland (cited above, \u00a7 47) the Court emphasised that even though it was not the sole evidence the impugned statements \u201cplayed a part in establishing the facts which led to the conviction\u201d and on that account found a breach of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 3 (d).",

On the same occasion, as further stated, he made a deposition which fully confirmed his deposition made on 30 August 1992 ... and admitted \u201cthat the accused had threatened him and his wife and that he had been using some sort of instrument at that time, but did not remember whether it had indeed been a knife.

The majority notes that the  had prepared a list of questions to be put to L.S. and his wife for the purposes of their questioning before the Ukrainian court. Furthermore, the applicant was aware of these questions and did not contest them.

We submit, without casting any doubt on the seriousness of the attempts made by the Lublin Regional Court to overcome the procedural difficulties stemming from L.S. and his wife's failure to appear before it, that the steps taken by that court ultimately turned out to be partly unsuccessful and partly inadequate and they cannot as such compensate for the applicant's real lack of opportunity to question L.S. and his wife before the Lublin Regional Court.",
