It followed that the reasonable suspicion did not have to be shared by the magistrate. The applicant noted that in the cases of Aquilina v. Malta (see GC judgment of 29 April 1999, Reports 1999-III) and T.W. v Malta (see GC judgment of 29\u00a0April 1999, Reports 1999-III) the Court found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention on the ground that the Court of Magistrates had no power to establish whether the deprivation of the individual\u2019s liberty was justified and to order release. The Maltese law had consequently been amended, but the practice before the Court of Magistrates as a Court of Criminal Inquiry had remained substantially the same, as shown by the events in his own case. Appearing before a duty magistrate was a ritual and a mere formality. Indeed, the applicant failed to see how such a fundamental issue as jurisdiction could be considered as having no impact on the lawfulness of the arrest, given that an arrest not justified by jurisdiction was clearly unlawful. If there was no jurisdiction, then the courts lacked competence, and if the issue of jurisdiction was postponed then the element of promptness required by Article 5 \u00a7 3 would be disrespected.",

This was the procedure followed in the applicant\u2019s case as evidenced by the minutes of the proceedings. According to the Government, the Court of Magistrates had both the competence and a legal obligation to deal with such matters.

Malta [GC], no.\u00a025642/94, \u00a7 47, ECHR 1999III). It is structurally concerned with two separate matters: the early stages following an arrest when an individual is taken into the power of the authorities and the period pending eventual trial before a criminal court during which the suspect may be detained or released with or without conditions. These two limbs confer distinct rights and are not on their face logically or temporally linked (see T.W. v.  [GC], no. 25644/94, \u00a7 49, 29 April 1999). Thus, what is described in the case-law as \u201cthe opening part of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03\u201d guarantees the right to be brought promptly before a judge or \u201cother officer\u201d; the second part of the provision guarantees the right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial (see Assenov and Others v.

When the detention does not, or is unlawful, the judicial officer must then have the power to release (see McKay v. the  [GC], no.\u00a0543/03, \u00a7\u00a040, ECHR 2006...). According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the review of the merits of the detention must be prompt and automatic (see the above-mentioned Aquilina judgment, loc. cit.). Whereas promptness is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, judgment of 22 May 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a077, p. 25, \u00a7\u00a052), the significance to be attached to those features can never be taken to the point of impairing the very essence of the right guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03, that is to the point of effectively negativing the State\u2019s obligation to ensure a prompt release or a prompt appearance before a judicial authority (see Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 29 November 1988, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0145B, p.\u00a032-33, \u00a7\u00a059).",
