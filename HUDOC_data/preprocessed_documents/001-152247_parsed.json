The court found that it was clear that a withdrawal of a driving license on the basis of a conviction or other equivalent decision concerning a traffic offence was not considered as new criminal proceedings. This situation differed from that of tax surcharges and criminal proceedings for tax fraud for the same incorrect information and did not therefore violate against the ne bis idem principle in Article 4 \u00a7 1 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention.",

The applicant was not therefore tried, sentenced or punished twice as the driving ban based on his operating a vehicle without a licence had been imposed in proceedings other than those leading to other sanctions.

Otherwise, the application of this provision would be left to the discretion of the Contracting States to a degree that might lead to results incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention (see for example Storbr\u00e5ten v.

In the case Escoubet v. Belgium, the Court found in the context of Article 6 of the Convention that the temporary withdrawal of the applicant\u2019s driving licence for six days, before the commencement of any proceedings, on account of a suspected drink-driving offence did not concern a criminal charge (see Escoubet v. Belgium [GC], no. 26780/95, \u00a7\u00a038, ECHR 1999VII). A similar approach was followed in the case Mulot v. France. In that case the applicant\u2019s driving licence was temporarily withdrawn by a prefect for six months for safety reasons before the commencement of any court proceedings (see Mulot v. France (dec.), no.\u00a0, 14 December 1999). Also in the case Hangl v. Austria, the driving ban imposed by the police authorities for two weeks was considered to be of a preventive nature and not of criminal character (see Hangl v.\u00a0Austria (dec.), no. , 20 March 2001). However, in the case Nilsson v. Sweden (cited above), the Court found that although under Swedish law the withdrawal of a driving licence had traditionally been regarded as an administrative measure designed to preserve road safety, withdrawal on the ground of a criminal conviction constituted a \u201ccriminal\u201d matter for the purpose of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. What was more, in the view of the Court, the severity of the measure \u2013 suspension of the applicant\u2019s driving licence for 18 months \u2013 was in itself so significant, regardless of the context of his criminal conviction, that it could ordinarily be viewed as a criminal sanction.",

The first driving ban had already been imposed by the District Court during the criminal proceedings. Following the line of interpretation adopted in Nilsson v.\u00a0Sweden and taking into account the applicant\u2019s situation, the Court considers that the second driving ban issued by the police in the administrative proceedings is to be regarded as criminal for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention.

Russia [GC], no. 14939/03, \u00a7\u00a7 81-84, ECHR 2009) the existence of several approaches to the question of whether the offences for which an applicant was prosecuted were the same. The Court presented an overview of the existing three different approaches to this question. It found that the existence of a variety of approaches engendered legal uncertainty incompatible with the fundamental right not to be prosecuted twice for the same offence. It was against this background that the Court provided in that case a harmonised interpretation of the notion of the \u201csame offence\u201d for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. In the Zolotukhin case the Court thus found that an approach which emphasised the legal characterisation of the two offences was too restrictive on the rights of the individual. If the Court limited itself to finding that a person was prosecuted for offences having a different legal classification, it risked undermining the guarantee enshrined in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 rather than rendering it practical and effective as required by the Convention. Accordingly, the Court took the view that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 had to be understood as prohibiting the prosecution or trial of a second \u201coffence\u201d in so far as it arose from identical facts or facts which were substantially the same. It was therefore important to focus on those facts which constituted a set of concrete factual circumstances involving the same defendant and inextricably linked together in time and space, the existence of which had to be demonstrated in order to secure a conviction or institute criminal proceedings.",

A\u00a0driving ban is considered to be both an administrative security measure as well as a criminal sanction. Even if the different sanctions are imposed by two different authorities in different proceedings, there is nevertheless a unity between them, in substance and in time. This is illustrated by the fact that, according to the wording of the relevant legislation, namely section\u00a046\u00a0\u00a7 1 (c) of the Driving Licence Act of the Province of \u00c5land, the imposition of a driving ban on the basis of that provision presupposes that a person has already been found guilty of a traffic offence or of operating a vehicle without a licence. In the present case, the police decision, shortly after the judgment in the criminal proceedings, to impose the second driving ban was directly based on the applicant\u2019s final conviction by the District Court for traffic offences and thus did not contain a separate examination of the offence or conduct at issue by the police. Therefore, it must be said that, under the \u00c5landic system, the two proceedings, namely the criminal proceedings against the applicant and the proceedings to impose a driving ban, were intrinsically linked together, in substance and in time, to consider that these measures against the applicant took place within a single set of proceedings for the purpose of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention. In conclusion, the Court finds that the applicant was not convicted twice for the same matter in two separate sets of proceedings.",

Furthermore, it may be necessary to assess whether the specific purposes of a procedure require special knowledge on the part of the adjudicating body. At any event, dividing the imposition of sanctions for the same acts between different State bodies requires appropriate justification. Dividing the imposition of sanctions may be justified in particular where the different procedures do not \u201coverlap\u201d in their aims and effects but are established to achieve complementary aims which would be more difficult to achieve in a unified procedure before the same court.",

Moreover, whereas I fully respect the freedom of the States to choose and shape their substantive and procedural criminal law, I would observe that the concern to secure just punishment for an illegal act is an argument against dividing the imposition of the same type of sanctions between different State bodies and proceedings. I further note that the police have some discretion in imposing sanctions under section 46\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c) and 3 of the Driving Licence Act of the Province of \u00c5land: they may impose a driving ban of up to 6 months. If the driver has a valid driving licence, the police \u2013 instead of imposing a driving ban \u2013 may order the person concerned to retake the driving test. Although the punishment may appear relatively mild and a margin of discretion is needed to achieve the aims of the procedure, for some time the applicant nonetheless suffered additional uncertainty about the final outcome of the different proceedings. I also regret that the majority decided not to consider in greater detail the purposes of the two procedures and the rules relating to their articulation and interaction.",
