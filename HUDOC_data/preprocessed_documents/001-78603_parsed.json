The dealings around Slovensk\u00e1 pois\u0165ov\u0148a surfaced in public on Monday 3 June 1996. To put it simply: the ten managers of Slovensk\u00e1 pois\u0165ov\u0148a \u2013 let us call them Mr [T.] and Co. \u2013 were pushed out of their building after the weekend by a private security service. These security guards had been summoned by the new management team of Slovensk\u00e1 pois\u0165ov\u0148a \u2013 let us call them Mrs [B.] and Co. Mr [T.] and Co. were supported by the police and, as documented by the taped phone conversation, it is evident that the President of the Police Corps, Major [H.] is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Slovak National Party. The former management team, [T.] and Co., seized the building with police assistance and, as has been clear from the start, this was the building of Slovensk\u00e1 pois\u0165ov\u0148a. This happened on Tuesday last week, and on the very same day these managers were again sitting in their chairs. As follows from the taped phone conversation, it is clear that the persons spoke together last Monday, 3 June, and that the State Secretary at the Ministry of Justice, [Mr D.], was a somewhat easier partner for Minister [K.] than the Minister of Justice, [Mr L.], who was in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica that day. We have verified this fact. Just to complete the information, it should be noted that last week\u2019s Tuesday government session was chaired by Mr [K.]. Owing to the poor technical quality of the recording of the phone conversation between [Mr K.] and [Mr D.], I think it would be worthwhile listening to it once again.\u201d",

(no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999-IV). Moreover, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider as regards a public figure, such as a politician, than as regards a private individual. Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his words and deeds by journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see, for example, Incal v.
