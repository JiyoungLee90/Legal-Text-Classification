Yesterday, on 22 March 2012, at about 9 p.m. my brother Abubakar Tsechoyev, who was born in 1978, was abducted from his place of work (he worked as the operator of the Vodokanal water-pumping station). The abductors were a group of ten persons, all armed with automatic weapons, dressed in camouflage uniforms and with balaclavas covering their faces. Three more men who were at work at the pumping station with my brother (an electrician, a machinist and a guard), were tied up and prohibited from moving under threat of being shot. One of them was beaten using the butt of a sub-machine gun. At least three persons attacked Abubakar; they beat him with their guns, hands and kicked him; they handcuffed him and dragged him from the pumping station. Then they drove away in a vehicle, presumably, a UAZ. Overall, the abductors spent about an hour at the pumping station. According to our information, the abductors drove through a checkpoint situated on the road between Ordzhenikidzevskaya and Sernovodsk.",

In particular, they stressed that the applicant\u2019s allegations were based on suppositions, as he had not witnessed the incident. The three eyewitnesses to the abduction had been blindfolded and, therefore, could not provide reliable statements. The fact that the abductors had been wearing camouflage uniforms and military-type boots did not imply that they were State agents as such items were freely available for purchase; no traces of firearms (with which the abductors had been allegedly armed) having been used had been found at the crime scene; the perpetrators used regular, nonmilitary-type, vehicles, commonly used in the area. The logbooks of the checkpoints situated in the vicinity of Ordzhenikidzevskaya did not contain any records concerning the passage of a vehicle carrying law-enforcement officers on the night of the abduction. The events in question had taken place in 2012, when no counterterrorist operations had been taking place and no limitations on free movement for civilians had been in place. Referring to the case of Shafiyeva v.\u00a0Russia (no.\u00a049379/09, 3 May 2012) the Government contended that the applicant had failed to make a prima facie case of State agents\u2019 involvement in the abduction. The applicant had furnished no evidence of the alleged violation of the positive obligation by the State either. Furthermore, the authorities had demonstrated prompt and effective reaction to the report of the abduction. The Government further claimed that the investigation met the Convention requirement of effectiveness, as all possible measures available under national law were being taken to have the crime solved.",

In support of his complaint, he referred to the following facts. The abductors\u2019 uniforms and military boots had been similar to those of State agents. The abductors, who had spoken unaccented Russian and had arrived as a group of ten persons in an UAZ-brand vehicle, had been physically well-trained and had not displayed any fear of being caught. After the incident, which resembled a sweeping-up operation and lasted for at least fifty minutes, the perpetrators had driven away in the direction of Chechnya. Their vehicle would have had to pass through one of checkpoints stationed on each road leading to and from the settlement and it would have had free passage through only if it had been of a State agency. In spite of the information that a large group of armed men had just committed such a serious crime, the authorities had not organised an immediate large-scale operation to apprehend the culprits, which meant that the relevant State agencies must have been aware of the events. Besides this, Mr Abubakar Tsechoyev did not belong to a lawenforcement agency and so would not have become a target of an illegal armed group. In sum, the manner in which the abduction had been carried out demonstrated that lawenforcement officers or other State agents had been involved in it. In addition, the applicant referred to reports of NGOs, such as Amnesty International, concerning a number of abductions allegedly perpetrated by State agents in Ingushetia in 2012.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the authorities cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin to request particular lines of inquiry or investigative procedures. They must show their commitment by taking all steps on their own initiative and demonstrating that they have taken every reasonable step available to them to secure the evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the identity of the person responsible will risk falling below this standard (see, for example, Tanr\u0131kulu v.

The Court considered in those cases that the disappearances of persons in life-threatening circumstances had required the State, pursuant to the obligation stipulated in Article 2 of the Convention, to take operational measures to protect the right to life of the disappeared persons in question because following their abductions their lives had been at more real and immediate risk than those of other persons at that time. It stated that the action which had been expected from the domestic authorities was not to prevent the abductions \u2013 which had already taken place \u2013 but to take preventive operational measures to protect their lives (see Turluyeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 97-101, and Makayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7102-05).",
