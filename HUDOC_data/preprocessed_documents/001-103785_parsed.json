Notwithstanding the entry into force of the Property Act 2004 the situation did not change. It was not until 28 April 2005 that Parliament passed an Act determining the methodology for the valuation of property for compensation purposes. Section 5 of that Act left the task of implementing this methodology to the State Committee on Property Restitution and Compensation, which should have issued the appropriate site plans to allow the properties to be valued.

They require the adoption and implementation of measures of a legislative and administrative character, involving various authorities. The Court considers that the respondent State should take adequate legislative, administrative and financial measures in order to provide for awards of compensation, without undue delay, ordered by a final court decision in lieu of the restitution of property. The respondent State should, for example, designate a competent enforcement body, provide sufficient human and material resources, establish clear and simplified rules of procedure for the collection of claims, lay down realistic and binding time-limits for their processing and enforcement, allocate the necessary budgetary funds, and remove all obstacles with a view to securing the expedient award of financial or in-kind compensation, having regard to the principles established in the Court's case-law.",

The State's failure to enforce res judicata judgments undermines public confidence in the judiciary and respect for the rule of law, which is one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society and an inherent element in all the Articles of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Stere and Others v. Romania, no. 25632/02, \u00a7 53, 23 February 2006).",
