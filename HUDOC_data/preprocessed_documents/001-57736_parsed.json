The Court of Appeal held that the designation of a third court-appointed defence counsel had corresponded to a pressing need - ensuring an adequate defence -, on account of the scope and complexity of the case and in view of the probable duration of the trial. If the court, when making the appointment, had also purported to secure that the trial would take its legal course, it had rightly done so since that was a legitimate interest to be taken into account as well. As to the applicant\u2019s arguments based on Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) of the Convention, the court endorsed the reasons given by the . It added that the financial means of the defendant are immaterial for deciding whether or not the court should appoint a defence counsel.

On 23 June 1987 the , sitting as a panel of three judges, refused to entertain Mr Croissant\u2019s constitutional appeal (Verfassungsbeschwerde), taking the view that it had no prospect of success. In the light of the Commission\u2019s case-law, the court considered that it did not follow from Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) of the Convention that legal assistance was definitively provided free. It held that a convicted person\u2019s obligation to pay costs and expenses derived from the fact that proceedings had been brought as a result of his own conduct. The principle of the \"social state\" (Sozialstaatsprinzip) and the right to a fair trial no doubt guaranteed that, where necessary, legal assistance be accorded to an indigent accused, but they did not require him to be definitively dispensed from paying the fees incurred. The law on legal costs and expenses made available other possibilities (arrangements for payment or stay of execution) to take effective account of the financial difficulties of the convicted person. Finally, the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion regarding the necessity of appointing Mr Hauser as the third lawyer (see paragraph 15 above) was coherent and in any event had not been arbitrary.",

In 1985 the applicant had already requested an extension of the time-limit for payment (Stundung), but this was refused by the President of the Stuttgart District Court (Amtsgericht) on 8 February 1988. After a first appeal (Beschwerde) had failed, his further appeal (weitere Beschwerde) was allowed on 18 August 1989, when the Stuttgart Court of Appeal quashed the earlier decisions and remitted the matter to the District Court. It considered that a decision to grant such an extension was primarily intended to facilitate the rehabilitation of a debtor who had already served his sentence. It was accordingly necessary to take account of the appellant\u2019s argument that a rejection of his request would force him to make a declaration of assets (Offenbarungseid) and would hamper his efforts to resume practising as a lawyer. It was also necessary to bear in mind that the applicant had agreed to the inspection of his documents and accounts by a member of the Berlin Bar, in order to assess his income, and that the Federal Ministry of Justice had proposed to ask him to make a confidential statement under oath before a notary instead of a declaration of assets. Even though granting the extension would mean in reality that a large part of the debt would remain unpaid indefinitely, that did not justify a refusal; in any event it was unlikely that the total amount could ever be recovered. It was therefore necessary to reconsider the question and to determine whether it was possible to authorise smaller payments by instalments.",

It was based, according to the Regional Court\u2019s decision of 1 March 1978 (which was upheld by the Stuttgart Court of Appeal), on the need to ensure that Mr Croissant was adequately represented throughout his trial, having regard to its probable length and to the size and complexity of the case; the Regional Court stressed that its selection of Mr Hauser was grounded on its view that he possessed the qualifications called for by those special features (see paragraphs 9-10 above).",

When appointing defence counsel the national courts must certainly have regard to the defendant\u2019s wishes; indeed, German law contemplates such a course (Article 142 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; see paragraph 20 above).
