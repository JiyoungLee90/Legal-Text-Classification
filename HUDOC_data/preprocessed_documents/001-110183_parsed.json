The Court arrived at the same conclusion in the above-mentioned case, Aharon Schwarz (\u00a7 106), where the examination of the applicant\u2019s request for the suspension of the prison sentence took two years and three months. In the present case, the applicant\u2019s request for suspension was dismissed after seven months, because in the meantime the applicant had been granted a presidential pardon due to his special situation.
