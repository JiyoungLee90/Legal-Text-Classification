It based its assessment on the visits that had been carried out in the place of residence of the children, in September and October 2003, and on the opinion of the Pozna\u0144 Family Consultation Centre of 27 October 2003. The court established that during their six-year stay in Poland the girls had fully assimilated in the country, spoke Polish, and had forgotten their life in . Their emotional bond with their mother was very strong. The emotional tie between A and her father was distorted as she rejected him, disapproved of him and wished to stay with her mother in . The bond between the younger B and the applicant was considered by the experts as suppressed. In those circumstances the court found that the best interest of the children required quashing the decisions ordering their return to Italy, as separating A and B from their mother could be dangerous for their mental state and could place them in an intolerable situation.",
