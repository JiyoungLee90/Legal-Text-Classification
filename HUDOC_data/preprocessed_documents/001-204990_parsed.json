The Prosecutor General submitted that the protection of the rights and interests of the State required the bringing of an extraordinary appeal, and could not be achieved by other legal means. He thus requested the Supreme Court to quash the relevant parts of the judgments of the lower courts and to remit the case to them for a fresh examination.",

It found that the Supreme Court had failed to properly examine the scope of the applicant\u2019s claim for damages, including the relevant considerations about the objective limb concerning statutory limitation, criticising it for having merely referred to the Constitutional Court\u2019s previous judgment (III. \u00daS 339/08). It held that, in the light of the existence of a specific legal framework concerning compensation claims stemming from unlawful detention, the ordinary courts should not have included those claims within the overall calculation of damages because the applicant had not submitted any arguments in that connection. The Constitutional Court ruled that the Supreme Court had also failed to sufficiently address the arguments about the lack of a causal link between the criminal investigation and the damage suffered, including the loss of profits from the failed property sale. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, all of the above had rendered the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment arbitrary and insufficiently reasoned; therefore, it was necessary to quash it and remit the relevant part of the case to it for a fresh examination.",

Invoking Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as well as their constitutional equivalents, he argued that the quashing by the Supreme Court of the final judgment in his favour, after more than five years and following an extraordinary appeal on points of law lodged by the Prosecutor General, was contrary to the principles of equality of arms, legal certainty and impartiality of a tribunal. He pointed out that the State had not lodged an appeal on points of law and therefore had not exhausted all available remedies. He also complained that he had not been allowed to participate in the proceedings before the Constitutional Court preceding the Supreme Court\u2019s impugned decision. His complaint was declared admissible on 2\u00a0February 2016 and assigned to the Constitutional Court\u2019s third chamber.",

It follows from the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning that the defects identified by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 13 November 2013 concerned the lower courts\u2019 judgments and that therefore those judgments had to be quashed. The reasons for the quashing thus included the failure to examine the scope of the applicant\u2019s claim for damages and the objective limb of the statutory limitation, and the failure to sufficiently address the arguments about the lack of a causal link between the criminal investigation and the damage suffered.",
