The court held that the applicant\u2019s detention between 20 October 2001 and 24 June 2003 had been unlawful in so far as the arrest warrant had been issued by a prosecutor who was not a \u201cmagistrate\u201d within the meaning of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and who had not clearly established the charges against the applicant. The prosecutor had also failed to hear the applicant prior to his detention or to provide reasons for his detention and had failed to immediately bring him before a judge following his arrest. At the same time, it considered that the assessment of lawfulness carried out by the domestic courts following the applicant\u2019s arrest could not have remedied the abovementioned failures. Furthermore, it held that the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention between 25 June and 4 July 2003 had also been unlawful in so far as following the final judgment of 2 July 2003 the applicant\u2019s arrest had not been based on any express or valid court order. It considered that the previous decisions delivered by the domestic courts in respect of the same issue were not res judicata, because the said principle did not apply to issues such as the applicant\u2019s detention which were separate from the merits of the case concerning the existence of the offence and the guilt of the accused. Moreover, it considered that its argument flowed from the provisions of the domestic procedural law which required courts to regularly assess the lawfulness of pretrial detention even if other domestic courts had previously delivered final judgments in respect of the same issue and to revoke ex officio the measure if it had been rendered unlawfully. The court further held that the applicant\u2019s detention after 4 July 2003 had also been unlawful on the ground that the judgment of 4 July 2003 could not simply extend his pretrial detention which had started on 20 October 2001 since the applicant had not been lawfully detained at the time. In so far as the judgment could be perceived as a new detention order, the court considered that the legal conditions for such an order had not been met: there were no new grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention, the court had not provided any reasons for it, no new detention order had been issued and the transcript of the applicant\u2019s evidence given to the court in respect of his detention had been missing from the file. Finally, the court held that in any event the extension of the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention could no longer be justified. There was no evidence that the applicant was a danger to public order or that his release would interfere with the criminal investigation and his continuous pretrial detention of two years and seven months was excessive and did not comply with the guarantees set out by Article 5 of the ECHR. The court also adjourned the hearing on procedural grounds and ordered the resummoning of some of the witnesses. The Prosecutor\u2019s Office appealed against the decision.",

On 2 July 2003, the T\u00e2rguMure\u015f Court of Appeal quashed in part the judgment of 17\u00a0June 2003 and ordered a retrial in respect of the extension of the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention on the ground that the decision had been taken by a twojudge bench although the applicable procedural rules required that the decision be taken by a single judge. However, the Court of Appeal did not declare the previous detention order of 17 June 2003 void and did not retrospectively declare the applicant\u2019s detention from 25 June until 2 July 2003 unlawful. As a consequence, the applicant\u2019s detention from 25 June 2003 until the fresh detention order of 4 July 2003, which was issued in compliance with the applicable procedural rules concerning the composition of the bench of judges, was not unlawful as it was based on the initial detention order of 17 June 2003. It being in the first place for the national authorities to interpret domestic law, the Court is prepared to accept that the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention remained lawful under domestic law even after the Court of Appeal quashed in part the interlocutory judgment of 17\u00a0June 2003 and ordered a retrial in respect of the extension of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention on account of the composition of the bench of judges.",
