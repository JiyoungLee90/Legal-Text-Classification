She explained that she had been sexually and physically assaulted by her father since sharing a bedroom with him after her mother had left the family home. Her mother was interviewed but said that she was unaware of any such incidents and refused to lodge a criminal complaint. The investigation established, however, that she had reported incidents of violence and sexual abuse against her daughters to a high-school supervisor. M.\u2019s sister, S., confirmed that she had heard friends of her sister mention obscene acts; the friends in question confirmed, as did the school bus driver, that M. had confided in them. M.\u2019s half-brother, K.P., and half-sister, S.P., from their mother\u2019s first marriage, were also interviewed. K.P. stated that he had received a letter from M. revealing that she had been raped. S.P., born on 8 August 1973, said that she had been raped by the applicant on several occasions while on holiday in Belgium aged only thirteen, and described the violent atmosphere the applicant had created within the family. She lodged a criminal complaint at the same time as making her statement. A., born on 20 June 1977, the applicant\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage, stated that after her parents had separated, she had been raped on several occasions by her father, who had made her sleep in his bed when she had been just six years old.

The applicant contended that the differences between the Belgian and French systems were minor: in both systems, the accused was charged following an investigation, an indictment was drawn up and then read out at the trial, the questions to the jury had to derive from the indictment and meet certain formal requirements, questions were put to the jury by the president of the assize court at the end of the oral proceedings and the court had to give a reasoned judgment in the event of a dispute regarding the questions.",

Accordingly, while the indictment specified the evidence justifying a trial, it did not explain the reasons why the jury subsequently found the accused guilty. The reform resulting from the Law of 10 August 2011 made it clear, moreover, that the statement of reasons form appended to the question sheet consisted precisely of a \u201cstatement of the main items of evidence against the defendant which persuaded the assize court in respect of each of the charges against him\u201d (Article 365-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).",

They stated firstly that the requirement to give reasons for court decisions, which did not appear in the Convention, was to be seen as just one aspect of the proceedings, which needed to be examined as a whole. As a result, the Court had not criticised the fact that in French law, judgments of assize courts did not contain reasons; the finding by a Chamber to that effect in the Papon v. France decision of 15 November 2001 (no. 54210/00, \u00a7 26, ECHR 2001-XII) had thus been confirmed by the Grand Chamber in the Taxquet judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 90 and 93). A statement of reasons was not the only means of understanding the decision, since the assize court\u2019s finding as to guilt resulted from reasoning which the defendant could understand and reconstruct through a set of safeguards afforded during the trial (they cited Taxquet, cited above, \u00a7 92).",

In these circumstances, Article 6 requires an assessment of whether sufficient safeguards were in place to avoid any risk of arbitrariness and to enable the accused to understand the reasons for his conviction. Such procedural safeguards may include, for example, directions or guidance provided by the presiding judge to the jurors on the legal issues arising or the evidence adduced, and precise, unequivocal questions put to the jury by the judge, forming a framework on which the verdict is based or sufficiently offsetting the fact that no reasons are given for the jury\u2019s answers (ibid.; see also Papon, cited above).
