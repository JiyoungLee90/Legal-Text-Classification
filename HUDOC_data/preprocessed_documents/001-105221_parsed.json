In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be \u201clawful\u201d and be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the \u201cquality of the law\u201d, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. \u201cQuality of the law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur v. , 25 June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports 1996III; and Nasrulloyev, cited above, \u00a7 71).",

As a consequence, a deprivation of liberty which is lawful under domestic law can still be arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention. While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute \u201carbitrariness\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis. It is moreover clear from the case-law that the notion of arbitrariness in the context of Article 5 varies to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a067-68).",

The Court has considered the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time to be incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Sta\u0161aitis v. Lithuania, no.\u00a047679/99, \u00a7 67, 21 March 2002; Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no. 55669/00, \u00a7 70, 2\u00a0March 2006; and Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, \u00a7 91, 1 March 2007). Conversely, it has found that an applicant\u2019s detention could not be said to have been arbitrary if the domestic court gave certain grounds justifying the continued detention on remand (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 131), unless the reasons given are extremely laconic and without reference to any legal provision which would have permitted the applicant\u2019s detention (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 157).",

Thus, the Court considered in the context of sub-paragraph (c) that a period of less than a month between the expiry of the initial detention order and the issuing of a fresh, reasoned detention order following a remittal of the case from the appeal court to a lower court did not render the applicant\u2019s detention arbitrary (see Minjat, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 48). In contrast, a period of more than a year following a remittal from a court of appeal to a court of lower instance, in which the applicant remained in a state of uncertainty as to the grounds for his detention on remand, combined with the lack of a time-limit for the lower court to re-examine his detention, was found to render the applicant\u2019s detention arbitrary (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 136-37).",

The detention order of 21 April 2009 was not quashed because the County Court had not given reasons to justify the necessity of holding the applicant in custody, but rather owing to a procedural flaw. The Court notes that the County Court did not summon the defence counsel to the panel session on 21 April 2009 because the case file had been forwarded to the panel of that court at 3.45\u00a0p.m. that day, that is to say after regular working hours. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the procedural flaw in question did not amount to a \u201cgross or obvious irregularity\u201d in the exceptional sense indicated by the case-law (compare Lloyd and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 29798/96 et seq., \u00a7 114, 1 March 2005).",

There is no doubt that an appeal court is empowered to quash a decision subject to its review and to remit the case for fresh examination. Indeed, as a matter of domestic law, it had the authority to quash the first-instance decision on detention under Article 398 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As regards the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to maintain the applicant\u2019s detention, the Court notes that in the reasoning of its decision, the Supreme Court, as stated above, relied on formal defects in the procedure leading to the impugned decision of the County Court. On the other hand, the Supreme Court in no way questioned the grounds for ordering the applicant\u2019s detention, namely, the danger that he would reoffend. Furthermore, it in no way called into question that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed a criminal offence. Thus, the Court accepts that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to maintain the applicant\u2019s detention was based on these grounds. It can therefore be presumed that the decision of the Supreme Court accepted the reasons given by the County Court for maintaining the applicant\u2019s detention (see, Ha\u0111i v.

Thus, the period in question amounted to seven days which, in the Court\u2019s view, appears reasonable in the given circumstances.
