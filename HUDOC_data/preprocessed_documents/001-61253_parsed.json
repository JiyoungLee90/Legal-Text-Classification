K\u2019s claim was upheld by the domestic courts on the ground that the applicants had been unable to rebut the presumption of undue influence created by the discrepancy in the price they had paid K for the property and its value at the time of transfer and by the doctor-patient relationship between the first applicant and K. It is moreover clear from the judgment of the Court of Appeal that the first applicant had enjoyed possession of the property in dispute during the course of the proceedings and had been in receipt of rents from the letting of the property since the date of completion of the sale, subject only to the agreement to allow K to use part of it in the early months following the sale. As is further pointed out in the judgment, the applicants took no steps to apply to the court to expedite the proceedings, although it was open to them to do so if they considered that insufficient progress was being made.
