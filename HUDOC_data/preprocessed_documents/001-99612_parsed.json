Austria, no. 30428/96, \u00a7 20, 6 February 2001).

Therefore the proceedings in the instant case cannot be compared to appeal proceedings on a cost order in domestic law pursuant to Article 521a \u00a7 4 of the Austrian Code of Civil Procedure. In the present case the Supreme Court in its decision merely clarified that not only the decisions themselves but also the cost orders of the first-instance decisions were reinstated and gave no decision on the amount of the costs. Since the decision did not affect the actual content of the judgment and alter its legal effect, but merely added part of a phrase which had inadvertently been omitted, there was no need to hear the parties. Therefore the equality of arms principle had not been violated.",
