Although he was being detained on suspicion of stealing mobile telephones, he was interrogated by police officers from the homicide squad who tried to make him admit to having committed a murder. Since he refused to make any confession and denied the accusations, he was taken on 31 October 2005 to an office in the General Police Headquarters, where five police officers tortured him for several hours. His hands and legs were tied together behind his back and he was suspended on a metal bar. The police officers put a gas mask on his head and periodically closed the air tube. Two wires were placed under the gas mask and attached to his ears and he was given electric shocks. He was beaten on his head with two-litre plastic bottles filled with water and was hit on his ears. Periodically, the applicant lost consciousness. After reviving him the police officers continued the acts of torture. They attached wires to his hips and administered electric shocks to him and beat him. He was later taken off the metal bar and laid on the floor. A weight of thirty-two kilograms was placed on his back and he was left lying on the ground for approximately ten minutes. The applicant\u2019s hands and feet were subsequently untied; he felt severe pain in the region of his lower back and was unable to move his feet. He was made to sit on a chair; however, he fell down. He was put back on the chair by two police officers, who kept telling him something, but he could not hear them. He was then taken to his cell. His cellmates put him on a bed, where he was left lying for two days. The allegations of beatings are disputed by the Government.",

In the region of both knees and below the right patella, numerous abrasions covered by dark brown scabs, partly detached from the skin at their edges, ranging in size from 0.6 x 0.5 cm to 3.5 x 2.5 cm in one place ... Conclusions: the neurologist\u2019s findings have not reached us as at 24 November 2005, nor have the X-rays of the lumbar section of the spinal column, to which examination certificate no. 92894 refers .... It is therefore impossible to determine the reasons why the victim is unable to move unassisted. The abrasions visible in the patellar region of the knee joints and the bruises visible on the left arm could have been caused by a blunt instrument and are not less than six or seven days old at the time of examination .... It is impossible to establish with greater accuracy from how long ago the bruises and abrasions date because of the delay in presentation for medical examination. Hospitalisation of the victim in a specialised medical establishment would enable a more accurate diagnosis to be made and the consequences for his state of health to be assessed.\u201d",

On the next day, he had been transferred to the Municipal Police Headquarters EDP, from where he had, during the period for which he was held (until 2 November according to the relevant registers), been transferred on several occasions, sometimes to the Riscani police station and sometimes to the Municipal Police Headquarters (transfers confirmed by the examination of the relevant registers). He alleged that he had been ill-treated on these premises. In particular, he alleged that, on 31 October, in a second-floor office at the Municipal Police Headquarters, he was subjected to several forms of ill-treatment: an attempt to suffocate him by placing a gas mask over his face; suspension in what is known as the swallow position; slaps on his ears; electric shocks administered via electrodes placed behind his ears and on his hips; placement of a heavy dumbbell weight on his back. As a consequence of the ill-treatment inflicted, he had briefly lost consciousness, and, furthermore, had been unable to move for the next four days.",

As noted in previous cases, it appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see Ireland, cited above, \u00a7 167). The fact that pain or suffering was deliberately inflicted for the purpose of obtaining a confession is a further factor to be taken into account in deciding whether ill-treatment amounted to torture (see Aksoy v.\u00a0Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 64, Reports 1996VI, and Salman, cited above, \u00a7 114).",

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. As with an investigation under Article 2, such investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2000-IV).

The Court will confine itself to the following matters which it finds of particular concern. In the first place, despite the applicant\u2019s complaint of 4 November 2005 about ill-treatment, he was only seen by a forensic doctor on 11 November 2005, that is, more than one week after the last alleged acts of ill-treatment. The forensic doctor concluded that due to the delay in presentation for medical examination it was impossible to establish with precision the age of the applicant\u2019s injuries. He recommended hospitalisation in order to determine the causes of the applicant\u2019s condition; however, despite this clear recommendation, the applicant continued to be detained and was only able to be hospitalised after his release, on 9 December 2005. In the medical report which followed his hospitalisation some very serious injuries were found on the applicant\u2019s body, including a broken skull and a spinal injury. The prosecutor\u2019s office considered it necessary to order an additional medical examination of the applicant by a medical panel, to be carried out on the basis of existing medical reports. The prosecutor\u2019s office addressed four questions to the medical panel, none of which was aimed at finding out the origin of the injuries to the applicant\u2019s head or spine. The medical panel appears to have limited its findings to the questions put by the prosecutor\u2019s office and did not refer to the earlier findings concerning the applicant\u2019s broken skull and injured spine. Regrettably it did not pay attention to the findings concerning the fracture to the applicant\u2019s skull bones because it had not been presented with the original radiographic images. The panel also added that simulation by the applicant could not be ruled out and that only a psychiatric investigation could exclude that possibility. No such psychiatric investigation was ever conducted. On the basis of the medical panel\u2019s report and the statements of some of the applicant\u2019s cellmates, the prosecutor\u2019s office dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment on 18 January 2006. The prosecutor\u2019s office did not give any assessment of the findings in the medical report of 10\u00a0December 2005, a report which was made by doctors who had examined the applicant in person and on the basis of medical documentation.",

This time it addressed ten questions to the panel, none of which was aimed at finding out the origin of the applicant\u2019s skull fracture and spinal injury noted after his release. In a report of 6 June 2008 a medical panel issued a report based on the applicant\u2019s medical history. The report did not contain any reference to the medical reports of 10 December 2005 and 15 February 2006 and focused mainly on the findings contained in the report of 11 November 2005 concerning the bruises and scratches on the applicant\u2019s knees and arms. Therefore it is not surprising that it found that \u201cno clear clinical symptoms of head or spinal trauma can be found on Mr\u00a0Gurgurov\u201d.",
