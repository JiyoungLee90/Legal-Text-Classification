The defence filed by the army authorities in those proceedings accepted that the applicant had not been charged until 16 June 1995, initially because the investigation of the charges had been impeded by his absence and, subsequently, due to an error associated with the replacement of the applicant\u2019s commanding officer. The authorities therefore accepted that the applicant\u2019s detention between 27 May and 16\u00a0June 1995 was unlawful. Various other admissions were made by the army authorities as regards the failure properly to complete certain delay reports, but it was denied that these latter omissions rendered the applicant\u2019s subsequent detention unlawful.
