The case concerns the alleged lack of reasoning of the judicial decisions ordering the applicants’ arrest and continued detention, the allegedly unreasonable duration of their detention on remand and the alleged absence of a right to compensation for the alleged violations of their Article 5 rights.
The applicants’ details appear in the appended table below.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna from the Ministry of Justice.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On various dates the applicants were arrested in the context of criminal investigations against them. Shortly afterwards the courts ordered their detention on remand. The relevant judicial decisions stated that the applicants were accused of serious crimes and could otherwise escape and hinder the investigation or continue with their criminal activities. The courts did not provide specific details explaining the persistence of the mentioned reasons.
In addition to the reasons mentioned above, the courts noted, without providing specific details, that:
-  in application no. 19095/12, the applicant had no family and permanent job;
-  in application no. 73451/13, the crime imputed to the applicant had been committed by a group, and not all the members of a group had been identified;
-  in application no. 44349/16, the crime imputed to the applicant had been committed while he had been on probation for a similar crime.
In the course of the proceedings the courts extended the applicants’ detention a number of times, referring to the reasons indicated in the initial decisions on the applicants’ detention. The courts furthermore noted that there were no reasons for the applicants to be released, since no new circumstances warranting release had been identified or the circumstances that had led to the decision to place the applicants in detention pending their trial persisted.
The first applicant remained in detention until 13 June 2016, when he was released under a personal commitment not to abscond.
The second applicant remained in detention until 19 November 2015, when he was released in the course of the proceedings.
On 6 December 2017 the trial court convicted the third applicant and sentenced him to eleven years’ imprisonment.
On 8 February 2016 the trial court acquitted the fourth applicant and released him.
On 15 April 2016 the trial court convicted the fifth applicant and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment.
The provisions of the 1960 Code of Criminal Procedure concerning pre-trial detention can be found in Yeloyev v. Ukraine (no. 17283/02, § 35, 6 November 2008); Makarenko v. Ukraine (no. 622/11, § 50, 30 January 2018); and Shavel v.Ukraine ((dec.), no. 25486/03, 8 January 2007).
The Code of Criminal Procedure of 28 December 1960 was repealed, losing force from 19 November 2012, when the 2012 Code of Criminal Procedure came into force. The relevant provisions of the new Code concerning pre-trial detention can be found in Ignatov v. Ukraine (no. 40583/15, § 25, 15 December 2016).
