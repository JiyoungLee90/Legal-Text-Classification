The Court is of the opinion that there was a substantial risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding which persisted throughout his pre-trial detention. This risk was confirmed by a number of relevant factors, such as the fact that the applicant was a foreigner without an abode in , lacking links or property in the country. It was therefore reasonable to believe that the applicant was under considerable temptation to evade trial, especially in view of the heavy prison sentence to which he was liable. In view of the above, the Court is persuaded that the danger of absconding constituted, in the particular circumstances of the present case, a relevant and sufficient ground for refusing the applicant\u2019s applications for release and to remand him in custody for the relevant period (see, mutatis mutandis, Van\u00a0der\u00a0Tang\u00a0v.

It further observes that, pursuant to section 16 of the 2004 Act, it was open to persons such as the applicant to seek compensation in tort from the State Treasury, relying on Article\u00a0417 of the Civil Code for damage caused by the allegedly excessive length of proceedings in which a judicial decision on the merits of the case had already been given (see Turzy\u0144ski v. Poland (dec.), no.\u00a010453/03, 22\u00a0November 2005). The Court has already examined whether a civil action for damages brought under section 16 of the 2004 Act read together with Article\u00a0417 of the Civil Code was an effective remedy in respect of the length of judicial proceedings. It held, having regard to the characteristics of these remedies and notwithstanding the absence of established judicial practice in respect of such claims, that these remedies were effective in respect of persons who on 17 September 2004, when the 2004 Law entered into force, could still lodge such an action with the competent domestic court (see Krasuski v. Poland, judgment of 14 June 2005, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06972). However, the applicant has failed avail himself of this remedy.
