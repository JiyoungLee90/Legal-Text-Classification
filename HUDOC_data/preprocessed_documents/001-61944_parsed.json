The case-law appears to indicate, however, that where no effective investigation has been carried out, an application for compensation cannot be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 taken in conjunction with Article 2 and within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 (see Hugh Jordan and McKerr, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0111 et seq. and 159 et seq., and \u00a7\u00a7 117 et seq. and 170 et seq. respectively).",

In the end, her only means of gaining access to the documents in the domestic proceedings was through the Court proceedings. In theory, the question whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is judged on the basis of the date on which the application is lodged (see, for example, Zutter v. France, no. 30197/96, decision of 27\u00a0June 2000; Van der Kar and Lissaur van West v. France, nos. 44952/98 and 44953/98, 7 November 2000; and Malve v. France, no. 46051/99, decision of 20 March 2001). In addition, there may be special circumstances which absolve applicants from the obligation to exhaust the domestic remedies at their disposal: the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see, for example, Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 40, p. , \u00a7\u00a7\u00a036-40, and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 75 et seq., ECHR 1999V). Thus, in any event, on the date when the application was lodged with the Court the applicant was not in a position to use the remedies theoretically available to her. I deduce from this that there was no problem of exhaustion in the present case and that the Court was required to examine on the merits the complaint lodged under Article 2 and relating to the authorities\u2019 responsibility for Mr\u00a0Sliti\u2019s death.",
