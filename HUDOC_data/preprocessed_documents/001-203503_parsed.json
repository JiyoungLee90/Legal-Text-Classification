However, the Municipal Court had not agreed with this assessment and had acquitted T.M. The State Attorney\u2019s Office still believed that the classification of procuring prostitution using coercion was appropriate and it had therefore lodged an appeal against the first-instance judgment (see paragraph 80 above). In these circumstances, it did not consider that it should have amended the indictment.

The situation may also be compounded by the hidden nature of the crime and the lack of concrete records or indicators of criminal activity. It is important to acknowledge that substituting victim testimony with alternative evidence may not allow for full and effective prosecution.

It recalled, in particular, that the ACHR used the expression \u201cslave trade and traffic in women\u201d. However, it stressed that, considering the evolution of international law, the most favourable interpretation and the pro persona principle, that expression was to be understood as \u201ctrafficking in persons\u201d, which would also bring its current definition into line with the Palermo Protocol.",

The applicant also briefly explained the course of the domestic proceedings, which had eventually led to T.M.\u2019s acquittal due to the fact that the domestic courts had not found that he had forced her into prostitution. In the light of these facts \u2013 albeit not set out in a completely coherent manner \u2013 the applicant raised an issue of the State\u2019s procedural obligation complaining, in particular, of impunity for the acts of abuse to which T.M. had allegedly subjected her. She stressed that it was the State\u2019s responsibility to investigate criminal acts and subsequently to conduct proceedings against the relevant individuals and, if they were found guilty, to punish them in accordance with the law. In her view, this meant that the State must put in place an effective criminal justice system. The applicant further argued that if the domestic courts had considered that T.M. had not forced her into prostitution, they should have convicted him at least of the procuring of prostitution under the relevant domestic law. The applicant also complained of a lack of appropriate assistance provided to her as a victim during the proceedings. Lastly, the applicant argued that procuring prostitution, as a form of gender-based violence, should not go unpunished. The applicant relied on Articles 3, 6, 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 12.",

She also argued that her allegations of forced prostitution before the domestic authorities had been justified. Also, in reply to the Government\u2019s submission, she elaborated on the domestic legal framework and argued that it was inadequate to address the problem of human trafficking. Moreover, in her view, the relevant domestic authorities had failed to recognise her case as human trafficking and had erroneously subsumed her allegations under a provision relating to forced prostitution. In particular, she argued that T.M. should have been prosecuted and convicted for human trafficking under Article 175 of the Criminal Code. In any event, in her view, even if he had been erroneously prosecuted for procuring prostitution using coercion under Article 195 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code (and not human trafficking), after the domestic courts had found the element of coercion not to be established they should have convicted him at least under Article 195 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code (procuring of prostitution). The fact that T.M. had eventually been acquitted showed, in the applicant\u2019s view, the lack of an effective application of the criminal-law mechanisms in her case. The applicant also insisted that she had not been provided with adequate assistance or with the possibility of participating effectively in the proceedings as a victim of human trafficking.",

In particular, the Government pointed out that T.M. had not confiscated the applicant\u2019s papers, that he had not deprived her of her liberty, that she had had her mobile phone and the possibility to contact others, that she had not been without any income as she had shared her earnings with T.M., and that she had voluntarily decided to engage in prostitution in order to earn money.

Such a position would bring uncertainty as regards the scope of Article 4 and would also run counter to the spirit of that provision and the Court\u2019s earlier case-law on the matter (referring to V.T. v. France, cited above). Moreover, it would mean that all forms of prostitution were prohibited conduct under Article\u00a04. Such a position could raise an issue as regards the practice of those States that had not criminalised prostitution and could lower the rights of the victims, who also enjoyed protection under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention.

Moreover, GRETA\u2019s findings suggested that judges were reportedly not sufficiently aware of the particular vulnerability of victims of human trafficking. GRETA had also been provided with examples of cases where other offences, in particular procuring prostitution, had been prosecuted instead of human trafficking, and perpetrators had been given lighter sentences in such cases, as well as instances where victims of sexual exploitation acting as witnesses had not been treated with the required sensitivity.

GRETA stressed that establishing the existence of victim vulnerability was important for many aspects of a trafficking case, as vulnerability could be a critical indicator when identifying victims, and accurate assessment of vulnerability could help to ensure that victim witnesses were appropriately supported and protected. In criminal prosecutions, both the existence of vulnerability and the abuse of that vulnerability should be established by credible evidence. In this context, GRETA also referred to a UNODC study according to which the mere existence of vulnerability might suffice to satisfy the means element and thereby help support a conviction. Thus, GRETA had insisted in the country evaluation procedures that the \u201cabuse of vulnerability\u201d be properly addressed. In sum, GRETA stressed that evidence of an abuse of a position of vulnerability might be less tangible than for other means used to commit a human-trafficking offence, such as the use of force. It was therefore important to involve specialists, such as psychologists, social workers or NGO representatives working with victims of trafficking, at the investigative phase to ensure that evidence was effectively and appropriately collected and presented at the trial.",

For instance, at the national level in France, it was recognised that abuse of vulnerability referred to a totality of situations of distress that could lead a person to accept his or her exploitation. In the intervener\u2019s view, this vulnerability needed to be taken into account in the context of the duty to investigate and in the context of the taking and assessment of the victim\u2019s evidence. In particular, in connection with the latter aspect, the third-party intervener stressed that it was a well-known fact that the victim\u2019s evidence could be incoherent and contradictory as a result of the treatment to which the victim had been subjected and that this was insufficient to conclude that the victim had provided false evidence. Thus, emphasis should be placed on the essential aspects of the victim\u2019s evidence and it was important to obtain further evidence concerning the impugned situation.",

In this context, the domestic practices also differed and in the V.T. v.\u00a0France case (cited above) the Court had not wished to take a stance on this particular matter. In these circumstances, in the intervener\u2019s view, when relying on the 1949 Convention, which had a very ambivalent approach towards prostitution and exploitation of prostitution, the Chamber judgment had essentially raised an issue of the Court\u2019s neutrality in this debate.",

As regards the Court\u2019s approach to these phenomena, the third-party interveners considered its case-law as representing a \u201cgradation model\u201d where slavery was not considered to be a distinct phenomenon from forced labour but the most severe form of it, while servitude constituted an intermediate form of abuse.

France (no. 73316/01, ECHR 2005VII). However, they noted that in the Rantsev case (cited above), the Court had brought an additional concept within the ambit of Article 4: that of human trafficking. For the interveners, there was no doubt that the concept of human trafficking was inherently linked to that of human exploitation. Indeed, the blameworthiness of human trafficking stemmed from its purpose, namely severe exploitation of human beings. Thus, there was no doubt that such conduct fell within the scope of Article\u00a04 of the Convention. However, the third-party interveners asserted that the Court\u2019s reasoning in Rantsev was incoherent as it confused the concepts of human trafficking and slavery.

It was finally decided to leave the concept undefined. Eventually, however, UNODC had attempted to define the concept of \u201cexploitation of prostitution of others\u201d but linked it to an issue of unlawfulness in domestic law (see\u00a0paragraph 117 above). For the third-party interveners, this created a problem of circular reasoning and the risk that States through their national laws might preclude characterising a particular situation as exploitation.

As to the concept of \u201cservitude\u201d, the Court had regard to the European Commission of Human Rights\u2019 earlier case-law and the 1956 Convention to Suppress the Slave Trade and Slavery, according to which that concept related to a \u201cparticularly serious form of denial of freedom\u201d and included \u201cin addition to the obligation to perform certain services for others ... the obligation for the \u2018serf\u2019 to live on another person\u2019s property and the impossibility of altering his condition\u201d. In sum, having regard to these elements, the Court held that the concept of \u201cservitude\u201d had to be understood as \u201can obligation to provide one\u2019s services that is imposed by the use of coercion\u201d (see Siliadin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 122-25).

However, the Court considered it evident that the text of Article 4 was to a large extent based on the ILO\u2019s 1930 Forced Labour Convention (No. 29). Thus, in view of the fact that this legal instrument was binding on nearly all the member States of the Council of Europe, the Court considered that the ILO\u2019s definition of \u201cforced or compulsory labour\u201d should be taken as a starting-point for the interpretation of Article 4 of the Convention (see also Siliadin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 115-16, and Stummer v. Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, \u00a7 117, ECHR 2011, where the Court more recently confirmed this approach). According to this definition, \u201cforced or compulsory labour\u201d means all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered him or herself voluntarily (see paragraphs\u00a0140-43 above).",

As to the \u201cforced or compulsory\u201d nature of such labour, the Court noted that the adjective \u201cforced\u201d brought to mind the idea of physical or mental constraint and the second adjective (\u201ccompulsory\u201d) referred to a situation where work was \u201cexacted ... under the menace of any penalty\u201d and also performed against the will of the person concerned, that is work for which he \u201chas not offered himself voluntarily\u201d.

It should also be noted that it follows from the comparative law material available to the Court that there is universal recognition of human trafficking as a serious crime that involves, inter alia, sexual exploitation. Indeed, all thirty-nine Council of Europe member States for which the comparative information is available criminalise human trafficking (see\u00a0paragraph 210 above).",

Firstly, this is dictated by the fact that excluding a group of victims of conduct characterised as human trafficking under the Anti-Trafficking Convention from the scope of protection under the Convention would run counter to the object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings, which requires that its provisions be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see, for instance, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v. Cyprus and Turkey [GC], no. 36925/07, \u00a7 234, 29 January 2019). In this connection it should be noted, as follows from the international material and as pointed out by one of the third-party interveners (see paragraph 269 above), that internal trafficking is currently the most common form of trafficking. Secondly, the Court has already held that the member States\u2019 positive obligations under Article 4 of the Convention must be construed in the light of the Council of Europe\u2019s AntiTrafficking Convention (see Chowdury and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104). Thirdly, the limited definitional scope of the Palermo Protocol is relative as, when read in conjunction with its parent instrument (UNCTOC), the Protocol in fact proscribes trafficking irrespective of a transnational element or the involvement of an organised criminal group (see paragraphs\u00a0111 and 120 above).",

However, it stressed that prostitution was incompatible with the dignity of a person if it was coerced. It held that it was where a person was coerced to engage in, or continue with, prostitution that an issue arose under Article 3.

In order to comply with this obligation, member States are required to put in place a legislative and administrative framework to prohibit and punish trafficking. The Court observes that the Palermo Protocol and the Anti-Trafficking Convention refer to the need for a comprehensive approach to combat trafficking which includes measures to prevent trafficking and to protect victims, in addition to measures to punish traffickers ... It is clear from the provisions of these two instruments that the Contracting States, including almost all of the member States of the Council of Europe, have formed the view that only a combination of measures addressing all three aspects can be effective in the fight against trafficking ... Accordingly, the duty to penalise and prosecute trafficking is only one aspect of member States\u2019 general undertaking to combat trafficking.

It is relevant to the consideration of the proportionality of any positive obligation arising in the present case that the Palermo Protocol, signed by both Cyprus and the Russian Federation in 2000, requires States to endeavour to provide for the physical safety of victims of trafficking while in their territories and to establish comprehensive policies and programmes to prevent and combat trafficking ...

Such special treatment of a potential victim of human trafficking does not necessarily presuppose an official confirmation that the offence has been established, and may be independent of the authorities\u2019 duty to investigate. Indeed, (potential) victims need support even before the offence of human trafficking is formally established; otherwise, this would run counter to the whole purpose of victim protection in trafficking cases. The question whether the elements of the crime are present has to be answered in subsequent criminal proceedings (see J. and Others v. Austria, cited above, \u00a7 115). In this connection, the Court would also stress the necessity of the protection of the rights of the suspects or accused, in particular the right to the presumption of innocence and other fair-trial guarantees under Article 6 of the Convention (see, for instance, Schatschaschwili v.

Indeed, the prosecuting authorities never sought to inspect the applicant\u2019s or T.M.\u2019s Facebook accounts and thus to ascertain the nature of their first contact and further exchanges. Moreover, the available evidence suggested that T.M. used Facebook to threaten the applicant after she had left him (see paragraphs 37 and 67 above), but there is no indication that the authorities followed this lead to determine the real nature of their relationship and whether those threats suggested the use of a means of coercion by T.M.",

Moreover, although later in the course of the criminal proceedings the applicant stated that the owner of the flat used to come and visit the flat (see paragraph 63 above), the State Attorney\u2019s Office did not seek to have the owner questioned in order to establish her impression of the atmosphere in the flat and the relationship between the applicant and T.M. during the critical period.",

In fact, the criteria for an effective investigation (independence, thoroughness, promptness, public oversight and the victim\u2019s involvement, see paragraph 305 of the judgment) should be the same across all the Articles of the Convention (for example, in the context of Article 5, in situations such as the arrest of a person of whom all traces are subsequently lost, or arbitrary deprivation of liberty; and also in the context of serious violations of the rights guaranteed by Articles 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Convention, such as sexual abuse, insults and threats, the illegal search of an apartment, attacks on members of certain religious groups, attacks on journalists or protesters, violence motivated by discrimination under Article 14 of the Convention, and the violation of property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention).",

As the Court has put it, none of the criteria amounts to an end in itself (see paragraph 319 of the judgment). However, only significant flaws in the fulfilment of any of these criteria, that is, flaws that are capable of undermining the investigation\u2019s capability of establishing the circumstances of the case or the person responsible, merit finding that the investigation was not effective (see paragraph 320 of the judgment).

Turkey GC, no. 48939/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09596, ECHR 2004XII; Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran v. Turkey, no. 42942/02, \u00a7\u00a061, 8 April 2008; and Chowdury and Others v.

Compliance with a State\u2019s procedural obligation under the Convention requires the domestic legal system to demonstrate its capacity and willingness to apply the criminal law against those who have unlawfully taken the life of another, violated his or her physical integrity (see A\u011fda\u015f v.

Criminal proceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal in which the principle of deliberation is respected usually provide sufficient possibilities for establishing the facts and criminal responsibility (see A\u011fda\u015f, cited above, \u00a7 102, and McKerr, cited above, \u00a7 134).",

The Court is increasingly recognising victims\u2019 rights in criminal proceedings as human rights, and as it has demonstrated in this case, it is ready to acknowledge the need to protect them not only under Article 8, as part of the effective respect of private life and personal integrity (see Y. v.

It would be too strict, in our view, to conclude, as the dissenting Judge did at Chamber level, that the applicant raised no issues regarding the investigation of her forced prostitution complaint or in relation to the collection of evidence. If the trial court failed to establish the constituent element of coercion, the applicant in challenging the acquittal was perhaps implicitly, but nevertheless logically, impugning the investigation which led to that result.

Individuals engaged in prostitution may realise subsequently that this activity does not correspond in any way to how they previously imagined it, particularly where they are carrying it out in exhausting conditions, earning less than they had hoped, or in view of the devastating impact on their physical and mental health. The possibility for them to change their minds must be genuine and not merely theoretical. If prostitution is the result of a true choice then it must be possible to leave it behind at any time and without any lasting effects. Likewise, there can be no consent where there is a lack of options. Prostitution is frequently an activity of last resort. Where someone is in a situation of economic hardship, prostitution is not a genuine solution.

It is true that some States regulate the exploitation of prostitution (Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland, for example). However, detailed legal regulation of an activity does not suffice to make it compatible with the Convention. The fact that it is regulated does not in any way mean that the person\u2019s consent is entirely free, informed and express, and above all verified. I note in that connection the legislation initiated by several European countries which have opted to define sexual violence on the basis of lack of consent rather than just on the basis of violence or threats (Sweden, Iceland, the United Kingdom and Ireland, for example).

The intension of the term \u201cforced or compulsory labour\u201d is any labour which can be characterised as forced or compulsory and therefore taking place against the will of the individual. \u201cHuman trafficking\u201d and \u201cexploitation of prostitution\u201d undoubtedly fall within the extension of the term, but its extension is not limited to just these two examples. These are only some instances falling within the extension or breadth of the term \u201cforced or compulsory labour\u201d and, as stated above, they do not cover the full breadth of the latter.",

Not seeing the whole extension of \u201cforced or compulsory labour\u201d, by fixating on two of its sub-categories, can be likened to not seeing the wood for the trees.",

This will have the end result of removing the distinction between intension and extension since both will be identified with \u201chuman trafficking\u201d and \u201cforced prostitution\u201d. As will be explained below, such a result runs counter to the relationship required by logic between the extension and intension of a term as well as to the principle of effectiveness which supports this relationship for the benefit of the effective protection of a right.",

In brief, to use the words of Horace William Brindley Joseph, \u201cthe extension and intension of words vary inversely\u201d. The less specific the definition, the more instances and objects are likely to fit within the scope of that definition. A good example given by A. Wolf of the inverse relationship between intension and extension is the following. If we qualify the intension of the word \u201ctriangle\u201d by adding the adjective \u201cequilateral\u201d, the intension of \u201ctriangle\u201d increases and its extension decreases. Conversely, if we omit from the term \u201cequilateral triangle\u201d the adjective \u201cequilateral\u201d, the intension of the term decreases and its extension increases.",

However, if instead one were to identify \u201cforced or compulsory labour\u201d as \u201chuman trafficking\u201d and \u201cexploitation of prostitution\u201d, then this would severely restrict the extension, and consequently the term would not cover other instances of \u201cforced or compulsory labour\u201d. Such an interpretation would be a contra legem since the generic term contained in Article 4 \u00a7 2 would be unjustifiably qualified. Instead, the direct methodological approach outlined above allows Article 4 \u00a7 2 to protect individuals from exploitation of labour occurring against their will.",

Unlike the approach taken in the judgment, the proposed direct methodological approach is compatible with the principle of effectiveness, which after all is based upon logic and fairness. This principle, both in its capacity as a norm of international law and as a method of interpretation, serves to make a term in the Convention wider, within, of course, the limits of the text and the object of the relevant Convention provision. This can be achieved either by decreasing its intension or increasing its extension. By doing either, the result will be the same, namely the widening of the overall meaning of the term.",

To my mind, however, this breach was the result of failure to apply the criminal-law mechanism allowing for the investigation, prohibition and punishment of \u201cforced or compulsory labour\u201d in such a way as to facilitate protection using the entire breadth of this term, instead of limiting protection to the framework of \u201chuman trafficking\u201d or \u201cforced prostitution\u201d as the judgment did.",
