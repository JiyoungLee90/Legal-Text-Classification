The Committee recalls that, in the airport sector, only air traffic control can be regarded as an essential service justifying restrictions on the right to strike. Neither the distribution of fuel to ensure that flights continue to operate, nor transport per se, can be therefore considered essential services in the strictest sense of the term. Moreover, economic consideration should not be invoked as a justification for restrictions on the right to strike. However, the Committee has, in the past, had cause to consider that when a service that is not essential in the strict sense of the term but is part of a very important sector in the country \u2013 as could be said of passenger and goods transport \u2013 is brought to a standstill, measures to guarantee a minimum service may be justified. Such a service could also be a potential alternative solution in situations in which a substantial restriction or total prohibition of strike action would not appear to be justified and where, without calling into question the right to strike of the large majority of workers, one might consider ensuring that users\u2019 basic needs are met or facilities operate safely or without interruption.\u201d",

This not only allows a careful exchange of viewpoints on what in a given situation can be considered to be the minimum services that are strictly necessary, but also contributes to guaranteeing that the scope of the minimum service does not result in the strike becoming ineffective in practice because of its limited impact, and to dissipating possible impressions in the trade union organizations that a strike has come to nothing because of over-generous and unilaterally fixed minimum services.\u201d",

The Court notes that section\u00a024 of the 1998 Resolution of Labour Disputes Act, which concerns labour disputes in all sectors, prohibits strikes in the following cases: \u201cif the cessation of work by employees endangers human life or health or the environment, or if it hinders prevention of a natural disaster, an accident, a catastrophe, an epidemic or an epizootic outbreak, or hampers rectification of their consequences\u201d (see paragraph 28 above). Nothing in the wording used suggests that this list is not exhaustive. At the same time, section\u00a018 of the 1994 Transport Act, which has not been amended since its adoption and which concerns the transport sector alone, also stipulates in which situations strikes must be prohibited. This provision is much more restrictive: in addition to cases where a strike endangers human life or health, it must be prohibited \u201cwhere passenger transportation or maintenance of a continuous production cycle are concerned\u201d (see paragraph 29 above).",

Ukraine, no.\u00a020372/11, \u00a7\u00a055, 11\u00a0April 2013).
