To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d, but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see, among many others, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2000IV, and S\u00fcleyman Erkan v. Turkey, no. 26803/02, \u00a7 31, 31\u00a0January 2008).",

It further takes note of the applicant\u2019s allegation concerning the death of one of the detainees, who was held in custody on the same ground, while he was in detention (see paragraph 9 above). However, the Court observes that the applicant did not specifically set out in his application to the Court the details of the alleged ill-treatment. These only emerged in the applicant\u2019s observations of 16 May 2008, and even then only by reference to the form which the alleged ill-treatment had taken without any further details.",

He gave no details as to the kind of treatment which he had allegedly sustained and did not provide the authorities with any physical or other identifying details as regards the alleged perpetrators. The Court considers that a mere allegation of ill-treatment, without any credible details, is insufficient to constitute an arguable claim giving rise to a positive obligation. Therefore the applicant could not legitimately demand that an in-depth investigation be carried out into his complaints of illtreatment when neither he nor his lawyer had provided the relevant authorities with a reliable starting point for their inquiries (see, for example, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v. Turkey (dec.), no. 33396/02, 30\u00a0August 2007).",

The Court is aware that this report lacks details and falls significantly short of the standards recommended by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), which are regularly taken into account by the Court in its examination of cases concerning ill-treatment (see, inter alia, Akko\u00e7 v. Turkey, nos. 22947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7\u00a0118, ECHR 2000X), as well as the guidelines set out in the Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, \u201cthe Istanbul Protocol\u201d, submitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (see Bat\u0131 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 100). Nevertheless, it notes that there is no material in the case file which could call into question the findings in this report or add probative weight to the applicant\u2019s allegations. In particular, the fact that the applicant was prescribed an unspecified medication following his examination by a doctor on 12\u00a0November 1999 cannot be regarded, in view of the contents of the doctor\u2019s note and subsequent laboratory analysis, as affording strong support for the applicant\u2019s allegations. In addition, although the applicant contested the veracity of the medical report established at the end of his detention, there is no indication in the case file that the applicant requested and was refused permission to see another doctor during or at the end of his detention. Consequently, the Court considers that the applicant has not submitted any medical evidence of either physical injuries to his person or mental trauma consistent with having been tortured and ill-treated as alleged (see, among others, Ya\u015far v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no. 55938/00, 22 June 2006; K\u00fcnk\u00fcl v.
