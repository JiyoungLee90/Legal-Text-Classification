The case originated in an application (no. 36852/03) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Anatoliy Grygorovych Zhmak (“the applicant”), on 3 October 2003.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs V. Lutkovska.
On 24 March 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
On 1 April 2006 this case was assigned to the newly constituted Fifth Section (Rule 25 § 5 and Rule 52 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Kyiv.
In 2001 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Moskovskyy District Court of Kyiv against the Kvant Scientific Research Institute (the “KSRI”), a State-owned entity, seeking recovery of salary arrears and compensation. By decision of 8 October 2001, the court awarded the applicant UAH 3,424.98 in salary arrears and other payments. On 26 November 2001 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal changed in part the decision of the first instance court and, in addition to the aforementioned sum, awarded the applicant UAH 1,500 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.
On 21 January 2002 the Shevchenkivskyy District Bailiffs’ Service instituted enforcement proceedings.
In January 2003 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Shevchenkivskyy District Court of Kyiv against the Bailiffs’ Service for failure to enforce the decision of 26 November 2001. On 6 March 2003 the court found against the applicant, finding no fault on the part of the Bailiffs’ Service. On 1 July 2003 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal quashed the decision of the first-instance court and ordered the Bailiffs’ Service to seize the movable property of the KSRI. According to the applicant, this decision has not been enforced.
On 15 October 2003 the applicant received the amount due to him in full.
