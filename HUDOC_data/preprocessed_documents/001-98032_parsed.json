As the applicant's constitutional complaint was essentially aimed at remedying the violation of the Convention alleged before the Court, the costs incurred in respect of this remedy may be taken into account in assessing the claim for costs (see Scordino, cited above, \u00a7 22; and Medi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 31). In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, though the applicant did not specified the costs of his legal representation, the Court awards him a sum of EUR 680 for costs and expenses before the Constitutional Court proceedings and EUR 1,200 in respect of the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant on these amounts.",
