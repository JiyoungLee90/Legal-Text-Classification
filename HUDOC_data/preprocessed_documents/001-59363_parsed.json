The programme in issue was broadcast on a nationwide radio station at the end of a long campaign against the managers of the woodlands. Furthermore, since  was a small country with few forestry engineers and forest wardens, the persons concerned were clearly identifiable to those who heard the programme. It was clear too that the applicant had made the allegation that the Water and Forestry Commission officials were corruptible right from the start of the programme. By quoting the offending passage by his fellow journalist he was thus merely providing an illustration of the allegation which he had by then already made and which he proceeded subsequently to make worse, notably by referring to the provisions concerning the offence of \u201cintermeddling\u201d. In that connection, the Government referred more particularly to Janowski, cited above, in which the Court, after noting that public servants required the confidence of the general public in order to discharge their duties, held that the margin of appreciation had not been overstepped when Mr Janowski was convicted of offensive verbal attacks against acting civil servants. In the same way, the Government submitted that the interference had been necessary in the light of the importance of protecting the reputation of the forest wardens and of the lack of proof supporting the applicant\u2019s allegations. It had also been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued as damages had been nominal and the judges had not ordered publication of the judgment.",
