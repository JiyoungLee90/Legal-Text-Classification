Stating that it objected only to satellite dishes mounted on or outside the fa\u00e7ade of the house, while allowing, for instance, dishes placed on a balcony, the landlord claimed that the ban on such installations was of considerable importance as the installations a) risked causing injuries to persons and property for which the landlord would be held responsible, b) damaged the house physically and aesthetically and c) obstructed rescue workers' and the landlord's access to the flat.",

The applicants further claimed that they had now complied with the landlord's demand that the earlier satellite installation be dismantled.

The Board noted in general that the assessment of whether tenants had failed to comply with their obligations by mounting satellite dishes had to involve the balancing of the interests of the landlord \u2013 which could be more or less strong depending on how the actual installations had been made \u2013 and the interests of the tenants in using a satellite dish \u2013 which could also vary depending on whether there were alternative means of receiving the television channels in question. In the applicants' case, the Board found that the fact that the new satellite installation extended through a window did not involve a breach of Rule 13 of the tenancy agreement. With regard to the general obligation to maintain good sanitary conditions, order and good practice in the house, the Board considered that the actual installation did not and could not damage the house. Moreover, the landlord's liability for damage to persons and property could not reasonably be incurred unless it were able to prevent the mounting and use of the satellite dish, which was not the case if the Board found that the landlord had no right to such prevention. Moreover, having regard to Mr Tornefelt's opinion and its own inspection, the Board considered that the risk of damage caused by the installation was negligible. Nor could it not find any evidence that the installation would obstruct rescue workers' access to the flat. The only inconvenience for the landlord was the aesthetic aspect. However, the applicants' interest in being able to watch television programmes that were not accessible by other available means weighed more heavily, and the satellite installation could not therefore be considered as contrary to good sanitary conditions, order and good practice.",

The court held an oral hearing at which, inter alia, Mr Tornefelt gave evidence. It also made an inspection of the applicants' satellite installation. By a final decision of 20 December 2005, the court found that the applicants had disregarded their obligations as tenants, under the tenancy agreement and Chapter 12, section 25 of the Land Code, to such a degree that the agreement should not be extended, pursuant to Chapter 12, section 46, subsection 1(2) of the Code. They were given a respite until 31 March 2006 to move from the flat. The court found that the landlord had made a reasonable distinction between acceptable and unacceptable satellite installations and had submitted weighty reasons for prohibiting dishes mounted on the fa\u00e7ade or otherwise extending outside of it. It noted that the evidence showed that the applicants' dish was virtually always positioned outside the kitchen window and thus constituted a permanent installation, and concluded, contrary to the findings of the Rent Review Board, that its placement breached Rule 13 of the tenancy agreement. In assessing the seriousness of this breach of contract, the court first concluded, with reference to Mr\u00a0Tornefelt's testimony, that the satellite installation met the reasonable requirements of stability and safety. However, noting that the landlord's main reason for not allowing the installation was the safety aspect, the court considered that the landlord was entitled to make general risk assessments and should not have to determine whether an individual installation was unsafe or inconvenient. It went on to state that, while the applicants' interest in receiving the broadcasts of the television channels in question had to be taken into consideration and that it was desirable that technical solutions for such reception be found, the right to freedom of information relied on did not have such a bearing on the case that it could be considered to have any real importance. It noted, finally, that the applicants had been fully aware of the importance that the landlord attached to the issue of the placement of satellite dishes and of the consequences that could follow from a refusal to comply with the landlord's instructions in this respect. Although their satellite installation did not pose any real safety threat, their interests could not be allowed to override the weighty and reasonable interest of the landlord that order and good custom be upheld.",

The alleged interference had not arisen as an effect of a ruling by a public authority on the right to receive information or even the right to use or own a satellite dish. Instead, it had come about only as an effect of the Court of Appeal's interpretation and application of an obligation in a contract between two private parties within the framework of private litigation. In any event, the Swedish authorities would only be responsible to the extent that the State had a positive obligation to protect the rights of the applicants in a case of this nature. In this connection the Government were of the opinion that the Court of Appeal had struck a fair balance between the competing interests of the landlord and the applicants and that there did not exist a positive obligation to protect the applicants' right to receive information from the interference of others. There had therefore not been an interference by a public authority within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention.",

As to the question whether the measure had been \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Article 10, they claimed that a fair balance had been struck between the landlord's right to property and its interest in maintaining order and good conditions on the property, on the one hand, and the applicants' right to receive information by means of a private satellite dish, on the other. Moreover, the proceedings had been fair at every level, the two instances involved having given extensive and detailed reasons after holding hearings and inspecting the satellite installation in question.

They further claimed that the Court of Appeal had not balanced the various interests in any real or meaningful sense. It had not attached proper significance to the applicants' right to freedom of information and had failed to take into account that there had been no safety risks in the individual case, instead allowing the landlord to make general risk assessments. The applicants therefore claimed that there had been an interference with their rights under Article 10.

Furthermore, the interference in the case had not been \u201cnecessary\u201d, as a fair balance between the competing interests had not been struck.

Moreover, broadcasts from certain TV channels \u2013 of particular importance to them on account of their cultural background \u2013 were available exclusively via a satellite dish. This had not been disputed in the domestic proceedings. Finally, there had been no margin of appreciation, as no vital State interests had been at issue.
