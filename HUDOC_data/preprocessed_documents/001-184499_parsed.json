He wishes to underline, however, that a major lesson learned in the fight against terrorism in Europe has been the importance of public confidence in the justice system. This means that any allegation of terrorist activity must be established with convincing evidence and beyond any reasonable doubt. Experience has shown time and time again that any deviation from established human rights principles in the fight against terrorism, including in the functioning of the judiciary, ultimately serves the interests of terrorist organisations.",

The mere fact of being present at ten demonstrations during a period of one year, allegedly organised in line with the PKK\u2019s strategies, and of acting in a manner and expressing opinions which the domestic courts deemed to be in favour of the leader of that organisation, were considered by those courts to be sufficient to conclude that the applicant, a local politician, had aided the PKK and could therefore be punished as an actual member. The Court notes in contrast that when Article 314 of the Criminal Code is applied alone, the domestic courts must have regard to the \u201cdiversity and intensity\u201d of the acts of the accused along with their \u201ccontinuity\u201d (see paragraph 100 of the Venice Commission\u2019s Opinion on Articles\u00a0216, 299, 301 and 314 of the Penal Code of Turkey in paragraph\u00a022 above).

In sum, as the applicant\u2019s case demonstrates, the array of acts that potentially constitute a basis for the application of a severe criminal sanction in the form of imprisonment, under Article 220 \u00a7 7 of the Criminal Code, is so vast that the wording of the provision, including its extensive interpretation by the domestic courts, does not afford a sufficient measure of protection against arbitrary interference by the public authorities (see I\u015f\u0131k\u0131r\u0131k, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067).",

Such extensive interpretation of a legal norm cannot be justified when it has the effect of equating the mere exercise of fundamental freedoms with membership of an illegal organisation in the absence of any concrete evidence of such membership. The Court does not underestimate the difficulties to which the fight against terrorism has given rise (see Incal v. Turkey, 9 June 1998, \u00a7 58, Reports 1998IV; D\u00f6ner and Others v.

                                                "content": "58.\u00a0\u00a0The Court further observes that the applicant was given a prison sentence of six years and three months under Articles 220 \u00a7 7 and 314 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Criminal Code. The length of his prison sentence was subsequently reduced to five years, two months and fifteen days and the applicant served his sentence. The Court notes that when demonstrators, such as the applicant, face the charge of membership of an illegal armed organisation, they risk an additional sentence of between five and ten years in prison, a sanction which is strikingly severe and grossly disproportionate to their conduct. The Court finds therefore that Article 220 \u00a7 7 of the Criminal Code, as applied in the instant case, would inevitably have a particularly chilling effect on the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. Moreover, the application of the provision at issue was not only likely to deter those who were found criminally liable from exercising their rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention in the future, but also had a great deal of potential to deter other members of the public from attending demonstrations and, more generally, from participating in open political debate (see, mutatis mutandis, Huseynli and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 67360/11 and 2 others, \u00a7 99, 11 February 2016; S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi and Others v.

Turkey, no. 3111/10, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2012, and I\u015f\u0131k\u0131r\u0131k, cited above, \u00a7 70). Hence, the interference resulting from the application of Article 220 \u00a7 7 was not prescribed by law. That being so, the Court is not required to determine whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim and, if so, whether it was necessary in a democratic society.",
