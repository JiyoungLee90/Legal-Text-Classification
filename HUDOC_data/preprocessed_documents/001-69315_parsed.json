The plant was, and remains, the largest iron smelter in  and the main employer for approximately 60,000 people. In order to delimit the areas in which the pollution caused by steel production might be excessive, the authorities established a buffer zone around the Severstal premises \u2013 \u201cthe sanitary security zone\u201d. This zone was first delimited in 1965. It covered a 5,000-metre-wide area around the site of the plant. Although this zone was, in theory, supposed to separate the plant from the town's residential areas, in practice thousands of people (including the applicant's family) lived there. The blocks of flats in the zone belonged to the plant and were designated mainly for its workers, who occupied the flats as life-long tenants (see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d below). A decree of the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR, dated 10 September 1974, imposed on the Ministry of Black Metallurgy the obligation to resettle the inhabitants of the sanitary security zone who lived in districts nos. 213 and 214 by 1977. However, this has not been done.",

The programme listed a number of specific technological measures to attain this goal.

Moreover, due to the relative scarcity of environmental information at that time, the applicant may have underestimated the seriousness of the pollution problem in her neighbourhood. It is also important that the applicant obtained the flat lawfully from the State, which could not have been unaware that the flat was situated within the steel plant's sanitary security zone and that the ecological situation was very poor.

The conditions of her rent were much more favourable than those she would find on the free market. Relocation to another home would imply considerable financial outlay which, in her situation, would be almost unfeasible, her only income being a State pension plus payments related to her occupational disease. The same may be noted regarding the possibility of buying another flat, mentioned by the respondent Government. Although it is theoretically possible for the applicant to change her personal situation, in practice this would appear to be very difficult.

The applicant insisted that the Russian legislation required immediate resettlement of the residents of such zones and that resettlement should be carried out at the expense of the polluting undertaking. However, the national courts interpreted the law differently. The Cherepovets City Court's decisions of 1996 and 1999 established that the polluting undertaking is not responsible for resettlement; the legislation provides only for placing the residents of the zone on the general waiting list. The same court dismissed the applicant's claim for reimbursement of the cost of resettlement. In the absence of any direct requirement of immediate resettlement, the Court does not find this reading of the law absolutely unreasonable. Against the above background, the Court is ready to accept that the only solution proposed by the national law in this situation was to place the applicant on a waiting list. Thus, the Russian legislation as applied by the domestic courts and national authorities makes no difference between those persons who are entitled to new housing, free of charge, on a welfare basis (war veterans, large families, etc.) and those whose everyday life is seriously disrupted by toxic fumes from a neighbouring plant.",

Spain (judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 303-C), referred to in the judgment, the Court found that the State had not succeeded in striking a fair balance between the interest of the town's economic well-being and the applicant's effective enjoyment of her right to respect for her home and her private and family life. In its Grand Chamber judgment in Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no.\u00a036022/97, ECHR 2003-VIII), also cited, the Court adopted the same line of reasoning (although the Grand Chamber did not ultimately find a violation of Article 8). In a recent case concerning noise pollution ( G\u00f3mez v. , no. 4143/02, ECHR 2004-X), the problem was again regarded as having an effect both on the applicant's private life and on her home.",

Italy (judgment of 19\u00a0February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I), where access to information on industrial hazards was in issue, the Court found a violation only of the applicants' right to private and family life, without mentioning their \u201chomes\u201d. I would be inclined to agree with the latter approach and to consider that \u201cenvironmental rights\u201d (in so far as they are protected by Article 8) relate more to the sphere of \u201cprivate life\u201d than to the \u201chome\u201d. In my view, the notion of \u201chome\u201d was included in the text of this provision with the clear intention of defining a specific area of protection that differs from \u201cprivate and family life\u201d. In support of this interpretation, I would quote from a dissenting opinion by Judge Greve annexed to the Chamber judgment in Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a036022/97, 2 October 2001), in which she stated that \u201cenvironmental rights are ... of a different character from the core right not to have one's home raided without a warrant\u201d. Therefore, without casting doubt on the Court's finding of a violation of Article 8, I would prefer to describe the violation as an unjustified interference with the applicant's private life.",

The State has a margin of appreciation in devising measures to strike the proper balance between respect for Article 8 rights and the interests of the community as a whole. In the present case, therefore, the resettlement of those living near the plant may be regarded as only one of many possible solutions, and, in my view, not the best one: had the authorities been stricter and more consistent in applying domestic environmental regulations, the problem",
