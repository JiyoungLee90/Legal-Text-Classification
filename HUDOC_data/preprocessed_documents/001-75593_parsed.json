That being so, those proceedings serve as a functional equivalent to enforcement. Furthermore, regardless from the fact whether Article 6 is applicable to the inheritance proceedings or not, the Court recalls that an enforcement title determining civil rights does not necessarily have to result from proceedings to which Article 6 is applicable (see, mutatis mutandis, Estima Jorge v. Portugal, cited above, p.\u00a0773, \u00a7\u00a038). The Municipal Court\u2019s decision of 8\u00a0June 1999 constituted an enforcement title, regardless of the nature of the inheritance proceedings. Even though the inscription of the applicant\u2019s right to ownership in the instant case would under the domestic law not be considered a constitutive one, the ensuing proceedings in the land registry were decisive for the effective exercise of his rights, i.e. the free enjoyment of his ownership.
