Actions of an accused in criminal proceedings are examined and assessed in accordance with criminal laws and procedures. In civil proceedings, actions of the same individual are assessed in accordance with civil laws and procedures. Criminal and civil proceedings usually require different matters to be proved. Under Article 182 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a court examining a civil case does not need to establish afresh criminal acts and the consequences thereof which have already been established by a final judgment in a criminal case, nor whether those acts were committed by the individual with respect to whom that judgment was given; by contrast, other facts established in a court judgment [in criminal proceedings] do not have a res judicata effect in a civil case ... According to the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law, court judgments which establish facts that do not have a res judicata effect in civil proceedings have to be assessed as written evidence, in accordance with the general rules on the assessment of evidence ...\u201d",

The Court is of the view that the same principle is applicable in situations such as the present one, in which the applicant\u2019s minor son could not be held criminally liable because of his age. Consequently, establishing the applicant\u2019s and her son\u2019s joint civil liability arising out of the assault in respect of which her son had not been held criminally liable was not in itself incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention.

The Klaip\u0117da District Court stated that in the criminal proceedings A.K. had \u201cconfessed\u201d and that his \u201cguilt\u201d had been proved; at the same time, it held that \u201cthe defendants [had] not provided any facts\u201d challenging A.K.\u2019s role in the assault and made a reference to Article\u00a0182\u00a0\u00a7\u00a05 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which allows a court to dispense with proving circumstances acknowledged by the parties and therefore does not appear to concern a res judicata effect of judgments adopted in different proceedings (see paragraphs 19 and 35 above). In any event, the decision of the Klaip\u0117da District Court was appealed against, and the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court which examined the appeals made it explicit that in that court\u2019s view it was not necessary to carry out a fresh assessment of the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s role in the assault against V.M. because it had already been established (see paragraph 23 above; see, mutatis mutandis, Erkol v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 50172/06, \u00a7\u00a041, 19 April 2011). In particular, while the applicant explicitly argued that the judgments given in the criminal proceedings should not have had a res judicata effect in the civil proceedings because they had not concerned her son\u2019s criminal liability (see paragraphs\u00a017, 18 and 22 above), the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court rejected that argument. It held that the courts in the criminal proceedings had \u201cestablished that unlawful actions [had been] committed by the defendant A.K. as well\u201d and that thus, in line with Article\u00a0182\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Code of Civil Procedure, those actions did not need to be proved (see paragraphs\u00a023 and\u00a035 above).",

France, no. 18851/07, \u00a7\u00a041, 12 April 2012, and the cases cited therein). It nonetheless observes that the Supreme Court of Lithuania has held in its case-law that not all facts established in final judgments in criminal proceedings have a res judicata effect in subsequent civil cases. The Supreme Court has ruled that a court examining a civil case does not need to establish afresh the criminal acts, their consequences and whether they were committed by the individual with respect to whom the judgment was given; by contrast, any other facts established in criminal proceedings have been found to not have a res judicata effect in a subsequent civil case (see paragraph 37 above).",
