The applicants could not be recognised as bona fide purchasers of the flats given that they had bought them for a price significantly lower than the flats\u2019 market value. In addition, Ms Titova had bought the flat only a month a half after the previous transaction. The applicants had done nothing to minimise their losses. They had not asked the city authorities for provision of social housing.

The Court further reasoned that such restitution of property to the State or municipality, in the absence of any compensation paid to the bona fide owner, imposed an individual and excessive burden on the latter and failed to strike a fair balance between the demands of the public interest on the one hand and the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions on the other.",

The Court notes that the flats left the City\u2019s \u201cpossession\u201d as a result of the alleged fraud committed by a group of perpetrators. The Court further notes that there were safeguards in place to ensure that the flats changed hands in accordance with the domestic law. The lawfulness of each transaction and title in respect of the flats were subject to control by registration authorities. The Government, however, did not proffer any explanation, as to why those safeguards had not been effective in detecting the fraud and protecting the City\u2019s interests. In particular, neither the domestic judicial authorities nor the Government clarified why it had been possible for the registration authorities to approve the transfer of title to the flats to new owners while the flats had always been the City\u2019s property and the City had not been a party to the relevant transactions. The Government did not proffer any explanation, as to why the state registration authorities had failed to detect the fraud, had accepted the forged judgment as authentic and had approved the transactions with the flat. In such circumstances, the Court concludes that it was the faulty registration procedure that led to the loss of property title by the City in respect of the flats. The registration authorities failed to detect the fraud and protect the City\u2019s interests.",

As to the action for damages against the sellers of the flats, the Government essentially suggest that the applicants pass their burden on to another bona fide owner, and it is hard for the Court to see how that would improve the balance between the public interest and the need to protect individuals\u2019 rights. As to the action for damages against the perpetrators or their insurance companies, the Court is not convinced that the Government have demonstrated that such an action would have any prospect of success. In this respect, the Court notes that the City of Moscow was recognised as the victim in the course of the criminal proceedings against those persons. However, the City chose not to sue the perpetrators or their insurance companies to recover its own losses. In any event, the Court reiterates that any compensation the applicants might receive would be relevant for the evaluation of their losses, potentially for the purposes of Article 41 of the Convention (see paragraph 28 above).",

The Court reiterates that mistakes or errors on the part of State authorities should serve to benefit the persons affected. In other words, the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova, cited above, \u00a7 49). It concludes that the forfeiture of the title to the flats by the applicants and the transfer of the ownership of the flats to the City of Moscow, in the circumstances of the case, placed a disproportionate and excessive burden on them.

Belgium (Article\u00a050), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85; Tchitchinadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a018156/05, \u00a7 69, 27 May 2010; Fener Rum Patrikli\u011fi (Ecumenical Patriarchy) v.

Consequently, having due regard to its findings in the instant case and to the fact that the applicants did not receive compensation for loss of title to the flat in the domestic proceedings, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to restore the applicants\u2019 title to the flats. Thus, the applicants would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which they would have been had there not been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (compare, Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106). In the alternative, if the Government no longer own the flats, or if they have been otherwise alienated, the Government should ensure that the applicants receive equivalent flats.",
