Contrary to the applicant\u2019s allegations, that provision did not specify in detail which compulsory medical measure should be imposed by a court for a particular dangerous act. Rather, it defined the basic criteria to be considered by a court. In-patient observation regimes differed and were imposed taking into account the person\u2019s mental disorder and its severity, the nature of the act committed and the danger likely to be caused by the person to his own life or health or that of others. As concerns the applicant, the need to keep him under a particular regime each time had been confirmed by the domestic courts, and strictly on the basis of objective expert opinions, which was one of the guidelines for deciding on the issue. In addition, due emphasis in the applicant\u2019s case had to be given to such aspects as his prior escape from the hospital, where, according to the Government, the applicant had been placed under general observation, a regime under which patients are free to walk around and are hardly controlled at all. In that connection the Government also noted that after his escape from the hospital the applicant had committed more criminal acts.",

Incomplete and therefore misleading information may also amount to an abuse of the right of application, especially if the information concerns the very core of the case and no sufficient explanation is given for the failure to disclose that information (see Bekauri v.  (preliminary objection), no. 14102/02, \u00a7 21, 10 April 2012 and the case-law cited therein).

It requires in addition, however, that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely, to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see Herczegfalvy v. , 24 September 1992, \u00a7 63, Series A no. 244; also see, most recently, Stanev v.  [GC], no. 36760/06, \u00a7 143, ECHR\u00a02012). Furthermore, the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained. That means that it does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is in conformity with national law; it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see Witold Litwa, cited above, \u00a7\u00a078).",

Having reviewed the circumstances surrounding his arrest and placement in detention pending trial, the Court finds nothing to suggest that the measures depriving him of his liberty were applied in an arbitrary fashion or unlawfully. In particular, it notes that at the time of his pre-trial questioning the applicant did not provide a document allowing the authorities to establish his true identity; he misled them by presenting himself under a false name and, as the domestic court noted, he had no source of income and was suspected of having committed rather serious crimes (see paragraphs 10-12 above).

In setting out its reasons, the court relied on expert report no.\u00a0354, expert testimony in court and other evidence. The Court also notes that on 20\u00a0July 2005 the district court had received a letter from the , which drew attention to the applicant\u2019s aggressive behaviour towards hospital staff and other patients. Taking into account the applicant\u2019s history of mental troubles, his prior escape from an institution while under general observation and his commission of fresh crimes soon thereafter (see paragraphs 5-8 and 18 above), the Court can accept the Government\u2019s position that the compulsory medical measure applied to him by the trial court was lawful and appropriate. Lastly, the Court takes note of the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that the appropriateness of the applicable compulsory medical measures should be verified every six months (see paragraph 33 above). Indeed, this is how the events evolved in the applicant\u2019s case, given that the Roki\u0161kis District Court periodically reviewed the medical measures applied, each time relying upon fresh medical examination reports, according to which the applicant\u2019s mental condition had not improved (see paragraphs 34-39 above).",

The Jonava District Court\u2019s decision of 27\u00a0January 2006 showed that the applicant had not complained about any alleged ill-treatment. No complaints in relation thereto had been filed during the pre-trial investigation either. Above all, the criminal case contained no data as to the applicant\u2019s confession, and this evidence had not been relied upon at all. The accusation had been based on the records of inspection of material evidence, the statements of other suspects, and expert opinions. In this context the Government also considered it worth noting that, in order to find the applicant guilty, the Lithuanian courts had been barred from relying on his testimony, given that under the Code of Criminal Procedure a person may not be questioned if, because of his mental defects, he is unable to fully understand the circumstances of the case. The applicant\u2019s mental state had been in doubt from the very beginning of the investigation. Moreover, on 10\u00a0September 2004 a psychiatric examination of the applicant had been conducted in order to assess his ability to understand the pre-trial proceedings. Lastly, in the view of the Government, the applicant had had plenty of opportunities to challenge the evidence he considered to be false, given that his case had been decided at three levels of jurisdiction. The principle of an adversarial trial had been respected. It followed that the applicant\u2019s complaint that he had not had a fair trial was manifestly \nill-founded.",

As regards this last element, which includes the accountability of the perpetrator for the offence, the Lithuanian Criminal Code, like in fact the majority of contemporary criminal codes, lays down rules governing legal incapacity resulting from mental illness. A person will be regarded as \u201clegally incapacitated where, at the time of commission of an act forbidden under this Code, he was unable to understand the dangerous nature of the act or to control his behaviour as a result of a mental disorder\u201d (Article 17 \u00a7\u00a01). This provision thus sets out a ground for non-accountability, which precludes the establishment of criminal responsibility and allows the court to order compulsory medical treatment: \u201cA person found legally incapacitated by a court shall not be held liable under this Code for having committed a dangerous act. The court may order that compulsory medical treatment as provided for in Article 98 of this Code be applied\u201d (Article\u00a017 \u00a7\u00a02). It is on that basis that the Jonava District Court, on 27 January 2006, held that the applicant had committed the offences in question while lacking criminal responsibility and relieved him from serving the sentence.",

Whereas Article 141 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows for admission to a medical examining institution pending criminal proceedings, it is Article 98, paragraphs 2\u20135 of the Criminal Code that provides the relevant provisions for the deprivation of liberty during compulsory medical treatment of persons recognised as legally incapacitated or of diminished capacity (in-patient treatment under general observation, increased observation and strict observation; see our paragraphs 14-17).",

Since the charges levelled against the applicant did not match the requirements mentioned in Article 98, paragraph\u00a05, of the Criminal Code, he should not have been submitted to the most stringent form of internment. In our view, the principle of legality does not allow the application during criminal proceedings of a form of internment more stringent than that applicable at the end of the proceedings.",

No new criminal charges were brought against him based on these alleged new criminal acts. Thus, when on 27 January 2006 the Jonava District Court found that the applicant had committed the offences with which he was charged (theft, unlawful possession of a firearm and fraudulent use of bank cards), but relieved him from serving his criminal sentence and ordered his in-patient treatment \u201cunder strict observation\u201d, the cumulative conditions set forth in Article 98, paragraph 5 were clearly not met. In view of the nature of the crimes the applicant was found to have committed, after 17 January 2005 Article 98 of the Criminal Code only allowed for him to be placed under general observation (Article 98, paragraph 3) or increased observation (Article 98, paragraph 4), the principle of legality impeding the application of a security measure more stringent than the one provided for by the strict conditions set out in the Criminal Code.",

In so doing, the domestic court not only based the applicability of the most stringent security measure on a vague non-legal criterion, but it also used new non-proven criminal facts which had allegedly occurred after the applicant had been charged. That interpretation of Article 98, paragraph 5 does not respect the principle of legality. Yet the Supreme Court, like the majority of this Court, confirmed that assessment. The majority of the Court put forward three motives for considering the treatment under strict observation \u201clawful and appropriate\u201d: the applicant\u2019s history of mental troubles, his prior escape from an institution while under general observation and his commission of fresh crimes soon thereafter (see paragraph 60 of the judgment). These motives do not correspond to the strict conditions required for the application of the security measure provided for in Article 98, paragraph 5 of the Criminal Code. While being sufficient for the application of a security measure of internment under increased observation, they are not sufficient to justify the application of internment \u201cunder strict observation\u201d, for which the requirements are more demanding. Hence, the interpretation of the disputed provision advanced by the domestic courts and confirmed by the majority breaches the principle of nulla poena sine lege stricta, which is applicable to security measures (on the applicability of the principle of legality to security measures, see M. v. Germany, no. 19359/04, \u00a7\u00a7 125-133, 17\u00a0December 2009).",

It follows that the psychiatric confinement of the applicant \u201cunder strict observation\u201d after 4\u00a0November 2004 failed to comply with the principle of legality of security measures. We are therefore of the opinion that the deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty was not \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d as required by Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
