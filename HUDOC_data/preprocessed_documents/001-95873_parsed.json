The continuous nature of his detention, his identical descriptions of the general conditions of detention in all the cells in the detention facility and the allegation of severe overcrowding as the main characteristic of conditions in all those cells warrant the examination of the applicant's detention from 6\u00a0April 2004 to 27 June 2006 as a whole, without dividing it into separate periods (see, for similar reasoning, Guliyev v.

The Government accepted that at times the applicant had less than 2 sq. m of personal space, while in cells nos. 51 and 56 his personal space was at times reduced to less than 1.4 sq. m (see paragraphs 56 and 55 above). The applicant was confined to his cell day and night, save for one hour of daily outdoor exercise.

He thereby gave an opportunity to the regional court to consider whether his detention was compatible with his Convention right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.

Until his conviction, the accused must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continued detention ceases to be reasonable. A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons to justify the continued detention (see, among other authorities, Castravet v.

Russia, no.\u00a054071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005; and Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 84-85, 26 July 2001).

It is not the Court's task to establish such facts and take the place of the national authorities who ruled on the applicant's detention.

Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Belevitskiy\u00a0v. , no.\u00a072967/01, \u00a7\u00a0101, 1\u00a0March 2007; Ilijkov v.

This is particularly relevant in the Russian legal system where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of the issue whether the evidence that has been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7 180, 8 November 2005).",

In this connection the Court reiterates that any system of mandatory detention is incompatible per se with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7 84, with further references). It is incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish and demonstrate the existence of concrete facts outweighing the rule of respect for individual liberty.

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v.\u00a0France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7\u00a028, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273-B; and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per level of jurisdiction may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 \u00a7 1 cases, Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003-IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4\u00a0October 2001).",
