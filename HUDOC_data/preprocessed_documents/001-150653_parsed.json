The Court accepts the applicant\u2019s argument that those witnesses might not have seen injuries on the body, as he had been fully clothed during the seizure of the drugs. Furthermore, the attesting witnesses were not medical practitioners, and it was not their task to assess the applicant\u2019s medical condition. The Government then contended that the applicant had undergone a medical examination on 2\u00a0January 2007, following which no injuries had been documented.

Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such a restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will, in principle, be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during questioning by police without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 55, 27\u00a0November 2008). The manner in which Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) is to be applied during the preliminary investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings involved and on the circumstances of the case. In order to determine whether the aim of Article 6 \u2013 a fair trial \u2013 has been achieved, regard must be had to the entirety of the domestic proceedings conducted in the case (see Panovits v. Cyprus, no. 4268/04, \u00a7 64, 11 December 2008).",

That offence was initially classified as administrative. Regardless of whether that initial domestic classification was justified or not, the Court notes that the administrative proceedings involved a possible sanction of imprisonment of up to fifteen days. Having regard to the nature and severity of the sanction, the Court considers that Article 6 of the Convention covered those proceedings (see Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a058-60, 15\u00a0November 2007 and Luchaninova v. Ukraine, no. 16347/02, \u00a7 39, 9 June 2011). Furthermore, nothing suggests that any exception for the specific requirement of Article 6\u00a0concerning access to a lawyer as from the first questioning should apply in the circumstances of the present case. The procedural measures taken in the beginning of the administrative offence proceedings produced serious consequences for the applicant, having particular regard to the potential sanction for the administrative offence which involved deprivation of liberty. In addition, the importance of the primary investigating actions cannot be underestimated in view of a particular correlation between the two sets of the domestic proceedings. The distinction between the initial administrative and further criminal charges essentially amounted to the difference in the quantities of narcotic drugs, which might not have been evident from the very beginning, and the applicant\u2019s self-incriminating statements, obtained for the purpose of administrative charges, could be and were in fact entirely pertinent for the subsequent criminal prosecution involving even more serious sanction.",

That right was however subject to the applicant\u2019s waiver since Article 6 of the Convention does not prevent a person from waiving of his own free will the entitlement to the guarantee of a fair trial (see Strza\u0142kowski v. Poland, no. 31509/02, \u00a7 42, 9 June 2009). However, a waiver must, among other things, be established in an unequivocal manner and must be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7\u00a086, ECHR 2006II). The requisite safeguards for the right to legal assistance imply, among other things, the obligation of the authorities to establish that the person did not wish to exercise that right in a particular period of time (see Yerokhina v.

As soon as the results of the expert report proved that the seized cocaine was of a large quantity, criminal proceedings were instituted and a lawyer attended the first interrogation of the applicant as a suspect. It is significant that, when interrogated in the presence of a lawyer on 2 January 2007, the applicant repeated the same confession statement as the one he had made on 29\u00a0December 2006.",
