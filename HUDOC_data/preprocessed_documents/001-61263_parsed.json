Thus, in contrast to the position under Article 33 \u2013 where, subject to the other conditions laid down, the general interest attaching to the observance of the Convention renders admissible an inter-State application \u2013 Article 34 requires that an individual applicant should claim to have been actually affected by the violation he alleges (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, pp. 90-91, \u00a7\u00a7 239-40, and Klass and Others v. Germany, judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A \nno. 28, pp. 17-18, \u00a7 33). Article 34 does not institute for individuals a kind of actio popularis for the interpretation of the Convention; it does not permit individuals to complain against a law in abstracto simply because they feel that it contravenes the Convention (see Norris v. Ireland, judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, pp. 15-16, \u00a7 31, and Sanles Sanles v.\u00a0Spain (dec.), no. 48335/99, ECHR 2000-XI).",

As a rule, and in particular in cases which primarily involve pecuniary, and, for this reason, transferable claims, the existence of other persons to whom that claim is transferred is an important criterion, but cannot be the only one. As the Court pointed out in Malhous (decision cited above), human rights cases before the Court generally also have a moral dimension, which must be taken into account when considering whether the examination of an application after the applicant's death should be continued.

It follows, however, from the submissions of the applicant's lawyer that there are a number of parallel cases in Austria, especially in Vienna, that could easily be brought before the Austrian courts and hence before this Court. Against the background of the decision of the Austrian Supreme Court in this case, it may even be doubtful whether future applicants would have to introduce a remedy before that court in order to fulfil the requirements of Article 35 of the Convention.

Article 41 tells us that just satisfaction can only be awarded to an \u201cinjured party\u201d. This reflects again the notion that the Convention system serves to protect individuals. In this case we have no injured party any more, and there is still some doubt about whether heirs might still turn up (see paragraph 18 of the judgment). To award the specified sum to the applicant's \u201cestate\u201d where there are no heirs does not solve the problem.
