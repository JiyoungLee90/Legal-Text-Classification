Firstly, it notes that in the first two decisions on the applicant\u2019s detention the \u017byrard\u00f3w District Court and the  held that the risk of obstruction was justified by the fact that the applicant had not confessed and that he and his co-suspects had given contradictory evidence. In so far as those courts appear to have drawn adverse inferences from the fact that the applicant had not confessed, the Court considers that their reasoning showed a manifest disregard for the principle of the presumption of innocence and cannot, in any circumstances, be relied on as a legitimate ground for deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty (see G\u00f3rski v. Poland, no. 28904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4\u00a0October 2005). Secondly, the Court observes that the judicial authorities appear to have presumed the risk that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings by basing themselves on the likelihood that a heavy sentence would be imposed on the applicant as well as on the nature of the offences in question. It notes however that the relevant decisions did not mention any argument capable of showing that these fears were well-founded. The Court considers that such a generally formulated risk based on the nature of the offences with which the applicant had been charged may possibly have justified his detention in the initial stages of the proceedings. Nevertheless, in the absence of other factors capable of showing that the risk relied on actually existed, the Court cannot accept those grounds as a justification for holding the applicant in custody for the entire period under consideration. Furthermore, it appears that this risk did not materialise following his release under police supervision on 10 February 2004.",

It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the charges against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such a risk existed. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001).
