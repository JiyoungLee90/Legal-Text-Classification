State liability for the damage caused by such procedural acts or failures to act, such as a breach of the reasonable time of court proceedings, could arise even in the absence of a final criminal conviction of a judge if the fault of the judge has been established in civil proceedings. The  emphasised, however, that the constitutional right to compensation by the State for the damage should not be tied in with the individual fault of a judge. An individual should be able to obtain compensation for any damage incurred through a violation by a court of his or her right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention.

The first remedy to exhaust was a claim for compensation for depreciation of the judgment debt due to inflation. The Government pointed out that in certain earlier cases the Court had found that the exhaustion of this remedy had deprived the applicants of their victim status (see Nemakina v. Russia (dec.), no. 14217/04, 10 July 2007; Derkach v. Russia (dec.), no. 3352/05, 3 May 2007; Yakimenko v. Russia (dec.), no. 23500/04, 15 May 2007; and Sarmina and Sarmin v. Russia (dec.), no. 58830/00, 22 November 2005). When domestic courts had upgraded a judgment debt in those cases, they had closely followed the official rate of inflation and compensated any loss caused by inflation. In the instant case the applicant had lodged such claim, although he had only done so on 14 November 2005, after his application to the Court. By judgments of 20 December 2005 and 18 August 2006 in the proceedings concerning compensation for inflation losses the domestic courts had recognised the applicant\u2019s right to obtain compensation for delayed enforcement and made pecuniary awards. Although those judgments had subsequently been quashed, the main reason for that had been a necessity to determine an exact amount to be paid, whereas the applicant\u2019s right to compensation had been recognised in principle by the domestic courts. The Government thus asserted that the remedy was effective and capable of providing redress at the national level. However, the domestic proceedings in respect of the claim had been pending and no final judgment had been adopted. Accordingly, the remedy had not been exhausted. The second remedy suggested by the Government was a claim for non-pecuniary damage for delayed enforcement of the judgment. According to the Government, this remedy had proven to be effective in practice. For example, a family from Tatarstan had received 1,800 euros (EUR) for delayed enforcement of a judgment in their favour (judgment of the Novo-Savinovskiy District Court of Kazan, no. 2-1962/2006, 23 October 2006).",

Nothing suggests that domestic law barred the applicant\u2019s access to a court. Accordingly, Article 6 is applicable to the present case (compare with Dovguchits v.

The Court held in those cases that the payment without undue delay of such compensation together with the acknowledgement of the violations by the authorities had deprived the applicants of their victim status (see Derkach, Yakimenko, Nemakhina, cited above). However, these decisions do not establish a general principle that mere compensation for inflation losses is sufficient to afford redress required by the Convention for late enforcement of a judgment. In all aforementioned cases the Court reached its conclusions in the specific circumstances where the applicants\u2019 claims for compensation were limited to pecuniary losses resulting from the inflation or the applicants\u2019 position in the domestic proceedings was considered as an implicit waiver to claim compensation for further pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage. The Court considers that the mere upgrading of judicial awards pursuant to Article 208 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not suffice to satisfy the Convention requirement of effectiveness as it would only compensate for possible inflation losses and not for further damages, either pecuniary or non-pecuniary.",

No final judgment was adopted by the domestic courts until at least 28 March 2008, and it appears that the proceedings are pending to date. Accordingly, it cannot be said that as a result of more than two years of the proceedings the domestic courts have either recognised the violation of the applicant\u2019s rights on account of non-enforcement of the judgment in his favour or granted him adequate compensation. The Court notes in this respect that a failure to hear an action for compensation within reasonable time constitutes a factor which, inter alia, may affect the effectiveness, adequacy or accessibility of a remedy (see, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v.\u00a0Italy (no.\u00a01) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a0195, ECHR 2006-...).",

The Court observes that such action had only produced repetitive results, namely a writ of execution which had not been enforceable for a considerable period of time, and had not brought the applicant closer to the liquidation of his debt. In these circumstances the Court is unable to conclude that the remedy suggested has proved to be effective in practice in the present case.",

While accepting the Government\u2019s view that the possibility of such compensation is not, in principle, excluded under the existing general provisions of the Civil Code, the Court is not satisfied that this possibility is sufficiently certain in practice so as to offer the applicant reasonable prospects of success as required by the Convention. The Court notes at the outset that Russian law does not have a special compensatory remedy for complaints stemming from an excessive length of enforcement proceedings. Although the  \u2013 already in 2001 \u2013 called on the legislature to determine the procedural rules governing actions for compensation for a violation of the right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention (see paragraph 29 above), the state of the Russian law has not evolved since. The doubts about the effectiveness of this remedy are corroborated by the Government\u2019s failure to demonstrate before the Court the existence of sufficiently established and consistent case-law proving that this remedy is effective both in theory and in practice. The domestic judgment cited by the Government as awarding non-pecuniary damage on the basis of the existing provisions does not allow the Court to depart from its conclusion. Accordingly, a claim for non-pecuniary damage cannot be said to constitute an effective remedy either. The Court therefore rejects the Government\u2019s argument about the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

During that phase the Ministry had faced considerable difficulties in managing payments in respect of over 7,500 writs from all over the country which had lead to certain delays. The applicant maintained his claims.",

However, that delay may not be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 (see Burdov v. Russia, no.\u00a059498/00, \u00a7\u00a035, ECHR 2002-III). The Court notes that, by contrast to the case of Inozemtsev v. Russia (cited above), in which the domestic judgment had been enforced within approximately one year, in the present case the award in the applicant\u2019s favour remained without execution for two years and eleven months. The Court further recalls that the applicant should not be prevented from benefiting from the success of the litigation on the ground of alleged difficulties experienced by the State enforcement services and the complexity of the budgetary arrangement (see Lykov v. Russia, no.\u00a018557/06, \u00a7\u00a020, 12\u00a0July 2007). Finally, the Court reiterates that it is incumbent on the State to organise its legal system in such a way that ensures co-ordination between various enforcement agencies and secures honouring of the State\u2019s judgment debts in good time (see, insofar as relevant, Reynbakh v. Russia, no.\u00a023405/03, \u00a7\u00a023, 29\u00a0September 2005). The Court accordingly finds that the arguments advanced by the Government do not justify such a delay in execution of the judgment of 5 November 2001.",

Furthermore, the applicant had failed to lodge an action for non-pecuniary damage with the domestic courts. Accordingly, he had not exhausted the domestic remedies in respect of his claim under Article 41. However, should the Court find it necessary to award damages, the amount of pecuniary damage should not exceed RUB 41,528.75. The Government argued that the applicant had claimed the latter amount in the domestic proceedings, and on 3 October 2007 such claim had been allowed by the Mozdokskiy District Court, and there would be no reason to award him a bigger sum. As regards the claims for non-pecuniary damage, they submitted that these claims were excessive and unsubstantiated.
