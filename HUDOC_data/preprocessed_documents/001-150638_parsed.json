Furthermore, the Republika Srpska undertook to pay EUR 50 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. This amount was to be paid first in respect of final judgments which had already been enforced in the form of government bonds. The non-pecuniary damage in respect of other judgments was to be paid in the same year in which the judgment in question would be enforced in accordance with the settlement plan.

In that respect, the Court finds that the interval proposed by the initial settlement plan, in October 2012 (see paragraph 28 above), was far more reasonable, at the time it was introduced. In any event, the Court considers that in the cases in which there had already been a delay of more than ten years, the judgments need to be enforced without further delay. Lastly, within the same time-limit, the respondent State should also undertake to pay default interest at the statutory rate in the event of a delay in the enforcement of judgments in accordance with the settlement plan as amended following this judgment.",
