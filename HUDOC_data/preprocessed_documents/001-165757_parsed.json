It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic rules of a procedural nature. However, limitations to a person\u2019s access to court must pursue a legitimate aim and be proportionate and must not restrict access to court in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired (see, mutatis mutandis, Levages Prestations Services v.

However, the Court also notes that this timelimit does not concern the motivation of the appeal which is subject to another timelimit, set in motion, in general, upon receipt of the reasoned judgment. For lodging an appeal on points of law a single written line suffices. What is more, the applicant had the right, and in fact availed himself of the possibility, to apply for the reinstatement of the proceedings.

For this purpose the Court considers it decisive whether the applicant\u2019s mistake, in lodging the appeal with the wrong court, and the amount of negligence attributable to the applicant in this regard, justified denying him access to a second instance court (see mutatis mutandis, Miragall Escolano and Others v. Spain, nos.\u00a038366/97, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2000I).",

Even though counsel to the applicant had only briefly mentioned the applicant\u2019s mental health problems in his observations of 9 April 2013 (see paragraph 15 above) the circumstances of his illness, leading to the applicant\u2019s admission to hospital, were well documented in the case files available to the Federal Court of Justice.",

However, the Court notes that counsel \u201cterminated\u201d the \u201cmandate\u201d with the applicant (see paragraph 9) at the time when the applicant wanted to lodge his appeal. Under German law neither the accused nor courtappointed counsel may terminate mandatory appointment of defence counsel, pursuant to Article 140 of the CCP (see paragraph 19 above). Counsel to the applicant had therefore still been in office at the time the appeal had to be lodged. This does not imply that counsel had the obligation to lodge an appeal on points of law proprio motu. Counsel may only lodge an appeal if the accused does not disagree (see Article 297 of the CCP \u2013 paragraph\u00a019 above). In the instant case, the applicant had made it clear that he did not want counsel to act, but preferred to lodge the appeal himself. However, knowing the applicant\u2019s confusion at the time the judgment was delivered, as well as his mental illness and commitment to hospital, counsel still did not ensure that the applicant was indeed able to lodge the appeal alone. Counsel limited himself to written advice about the possibilities of how to lodge the appeal. While the Court finds, with the Federal Court of Justice, that the advice which counsel gave does not appear incorrect, it takes the view that it was potentially misleading. The letter\u2019s third paragraph (see paragraph 9) begins with the sentence:",

Furthermore, the letter was delayed as postal services, already strained during Christmas time, observed holidays. Lastly, at the Rheine District Court the appeal was received and forwarded to reach the M\u00fcnster Regional Court five days later, while it could have reached the Regional Court on the same day if it had been sent by fax to M\u00fcnster, a form of communication not only acceptable under German law but which seems to be common practice.",

In the light of the accumulation of extraordinary factors affecting the lodging of the applicant\u2019s appeal, and bearing in mind that the applicant in instant case had already announced in the courtroom that he wished to appeal, the Court takes the view that the Federal Court of Justice\u2019s decision to refuse reinstatement of the proceedings was not proportionate to the purpose of the procedural limitation at issue.
