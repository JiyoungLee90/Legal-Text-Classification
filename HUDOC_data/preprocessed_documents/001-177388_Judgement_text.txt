The case originated in an application (no. 43868/06) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Ekrem Taşçı (“the applicant”), on 27 October 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr E. Şahin, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 5 September 2014 the complaint concerning the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Military Administrative Court was communicated to the Government, and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Ankara.
In 1995 the applicant, who had been serving as a non-commissioned officer, was dismissed from the army. Subsequently, proceedings were initiated before the Supreme Military Administrative Court to have the decision regarding his dismissal annulled. The applicant also asked to be awarded pecuniary compensation.
On 20 December 2005 the Supreme Military Administrative Court annulled the dismissal decision and accepted the applicant’s compensation claims in part.
On 18 April 2006 the applicant’s rectification request regarding the remaining compensation claims was rejected by the Supreme Military Administrative Court.
A detailed description of the relevant domestic law and practice may be found in the cases of Yavuz v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 29870/96, 25 May 2000), and Tanışma v. Turkey (no. 32219/05, §§ 29-50, 17 November 2015).
Following a referendum held on 16 April 2017, Law no. 6771 was adopted; Articles 145 and 157 of the Constitution were repealed and the following paragraph was added to Article 142 of the Constitution:
“... No military courts shall be formed other than disciplinary courts. However, in a state of war, military courts may be formed with jurisdiction to try offences committed by military personnel in relation to their duties.”
