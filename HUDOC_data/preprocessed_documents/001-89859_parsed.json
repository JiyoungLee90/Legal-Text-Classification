Reiterating this complaint in his later submissions lodged in November 2004, the applicant referred to both periods of the same overall period of detention during judicial proceedings. The Court considers that by lodging his complaint when he was still in detention prior to conviction, the applicant interrupted the running of the six-month period stated in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and it was open to him to submit any additional arguments in support of his original complaint about the alleged unlawfulness of his detention without any court order.

The lawyer repeated those arguments in further requests for his client\u2019s release. However, the domestic courts did not address any of those points in their decisions maintaining the applicant\u2019s detention. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the domestic courts, by ignoring those arguments altogether, despite the fact that they were specific, pertinent and important, fell short of their obligation under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention to review the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention.",
