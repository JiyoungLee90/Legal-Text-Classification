The applicants submitted that that they had complained to the authorities shortly after the incidents and had hoped that the criminal investigations initiated thereafter would produce results, just as they would in any other official investigation initiated by the authorities in the Russian Federation. They lodged their applications with the Court after realising that the domestic investigations had been ineffective. The applicants further maintained that the armed conflict in Chechnya had led them to believe that investigative delays were inevitable. Moreover, owing to their lack of legal knowledge and financial means to hire a lawyer, and in the absence of any domestic provisions for free legal assistance to victims of enforced disappearances, they had been unable to assess the effectiveness of the investigations. It was only with the passage of time and a lack of information from the investigating authorities that they began to doubt the effectiveness of the investigation and started looking for free legal assistance to assess the effectiveness of the proceedings and then, subsequently, to lodge their applications with the Court without undue delay.",

Taking into account the applicants\u2019 explanations concerning their compliance with the six-month rule and their efforts to resume the dormant proceedings (see paragraphs 22, 43, 55, 80 and 104 above), keeping in mind the overall time frame for lodging their applications with the Court and having regard to the complexity of the cases and the nature of the alleged human rights violations at stake, the Court concludes that it was reasonable for the applicants to wait for developments that could have resolved crucial factual or legal issues (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no.\u00a039630/09, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2012). The Court notes that having no information on the progress of the proceedings, the applicants or their relatives either lodged requests for information, asked to familiarise themselves with the contents of the investigation files or complained about the investigations in the hope of expediting the proceedings (see paragraphs 24, 41-42, 55-56, 75, 75, 99 and 104 above). Further to their requests, the authorities resumed the dormant proceedings and took steps to obtain evidence (see paragraphs 22, 43, 56, 62, 80 and 104 above). The Court therefore considers that the breaks in the domestic investigations cannot be held against the applicants or interpreted as their failure to comply with the six-month requirement by unreasonably waiting for the pending investigation to yield results (see, for a similar situation, Sultygov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0375-80).",
