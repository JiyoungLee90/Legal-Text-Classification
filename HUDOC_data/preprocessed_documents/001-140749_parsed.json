It reiterates, in particular, that ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article\u00a03; the assessment of this minimum is, in the nature of things, relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the treatment, the manner and method of its execution, its duration, its physical or mental effects and, in some instances, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a091).",

Lithuania, no. 53254/99, \u00a7 39, 7\u00a0April\u00a02005). In a series of cases, the Court considered that a clear case of overcrowding was a sufficient element for concluding that Article 3 of the Convention had been violated (see Colesnicov v. Romania, no. 36479/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a078-82, 21\u00a0December\u00a02010, and Budaca v. Romania, no. 57260/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040-45, 17\u00a0July\u00a02012). Moreover, it has already found violations of Article\u00a03 of the Convention on account of the material conditions of detention in Jilava Prison, especially with respect to overcrowding and lack of hygiene (see, for example, Cucu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 82; Goh v. Romania, no.\u00a09643/03, \u00a7\u00a066, 21 June 2011; Gy\u00f6rgyp\u00e1l v.\u00a0Romania, no. 29540/08, \u00a7\u00a073, 26\u00a0March\u00a02013; and Constantin Tudor v.\u00a0Romania, no. 43543/09, \u00a7\u00a075, 18\u00a0June\u00a02013).",
