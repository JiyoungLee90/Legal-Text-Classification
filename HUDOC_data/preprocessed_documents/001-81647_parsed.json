The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article\u00a06 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position in which he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Poznakhirina v. Russia, no. 25964/02, \u00a7 33, 24\u00a0February 2005, with further references). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violation found. It therefore considers that the Government should secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the award made by the domestic courts.",

The adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value, such as an extended delay in enforcement (see, mutadis mutandis, Gizzatova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a028; Metaxas v. , no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 27 May 2004). The Court notes that on 22 September 2002 the domestic courts awarded the applicant a sum of money for housing construction. The sum was calculated by multiplying the number of square metres to which the applicant was entitled by the average market price per square metre in  in 2002. To date, the applicant has not received this sum. By 2006 the average market price per square metre had increased, making the housing grant concerned insufficient to buy a flat of the surface area indicated in the judgment. The Court accepts that the judgment debt depreciated as a result of the continued non-enforcement of the judgment. Having regard to the materials in its possession and noting that the applicant's calculation contained an arithmetical mistake, the Court awards the applicant RUR\u00a0172,872, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount, and dismisses the remainder of the claim for pecuniary damage.",
