He further stated that there were marks of physical violence on the applicant's body and considered that he should be examined by an urologist. The medical report dated 12 September 1999, however, indicated that there were no signs of ill-treatment on the applicant's body. Nevertheless, the Court observes that the signs on the applicant's body reappeared on 14 September 1999, when the doctor who examined the applicant observed that there were two scarred incisions of 0.5 cm each on his nose and on his left heel, a scarred incision of 2-3 cm on his left elbow and an ecchymosis of 2 cm on his abdominal region. The marks on the applicant's body were further confirmed by the medical report dated 15 September 1999, which was prepared by two medical experts from the Human Rights Foundation. In their report, the experts concluded that there was a scabbed wound of 2 x 1 cm on the left elbow, a scabbed wound of 0.5 x 1 cm on the right side of the lower lip, an old wound of 0.5 cm in diameter on the forehead, a scabbed wound on the left heel, a dark brown ecchymosis of 3 x 1 cm on the left lower part of the sternum, haemorrhage on the upper part of the external part of the outer ear. Having regard therefore to its inconsistency with the other medical evidence, the Court attaches no weight to the findings of the report dated 12\u00a0September 1999.",
