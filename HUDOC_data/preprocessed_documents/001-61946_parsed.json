In the present case, however, the debtor is a State body and the enforcement of judgments against it, as it appears from the case file, can only be carried out if the State foresees and makes provision for the relevant expenditures in the State Budget of Ukraine by taking the appropriate legislative measures. The facts of the case show that, throughout the period under consideration, the enforcement of the judgment in question was prevented precisely because of the failure to take the any budgetary measures, rather then by a bailiff\u2019s misconduct. The applicant cannot therefore be reproached for not having taken proceedings against the Bailiffs\u2019 Service (see Shestakov v. Russia (dec.), no. 48757/99, 18\u00a0June\u00a02002).
