While fulfilling the objective and subjective constitutive elements of a criminal offence may be the basis for both criminal and civil liability, there are further steps in tort law to give rise to civil liability, which differ from the elements of a criminal offence. The injured party must additionally prove causation, damage and the amount of the financial loss in accordance with the principle of civil law. Finally, while similar exonerating circumstances may exclude both criminal and civil liability, the concepts of criminal guilt and civil fault are not only embedded in different laws, namely the Criminal and the Civil Code, but are also different.",

The applicant\u2019s own correspondence with the District Court shows that he knew about his procedural obligations. Nevertheless, he continued to insist on discontinuation of the civil proceedings instead of asking for further evidence or naming witnesses. Moreover, the applicant never argued that there had been any misunderstanding concerning his and his wife\u2019s correspondence with the District Court.

The Court takes the view that it was therefore sufficient to refute the applicant\u2019s statements by referring to the submissions and testimony in the criminal judgment. The applicant did not argue that he had expected that the plaintiff\u2019s or the co-defendants\u2019 testimonies before the District Court would have been different from those given during the criminal proceedings.

It reiterates that there is no single approach to ascertain the circumstances in which Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention will be violated in the context of proceedings which follow the conclusion of criminal proceedings. Much will depend on the nature and context of the proceedings in which the impugned decision was adopted (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 125). In this context, the Court has repeatedly emphasised that while exoneration from criminal liability ought to be respected in civil compensation proceedings, it should not preclude the establishment of civil liability to pay compensation arising out of the same facts on the basis of a less strict burden of proof (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 123, with further references). Nevertheless, it emerges from the Court\u2019s case-law that the language used by the domestic courts is of critical importance (see Vella, cited above, \u00a7 57, and Allen, cited above, \u00a7 126, with examples of language used). A distinction has been drawn between cases where a final acquittal judgment has been handed down and those where criminal proceedings have been discontinued. In cases after an acquittal, the voicing of suspicion regarding an accused\u2019s innocence is no longer admissible. In contrast, the presumption of innocence will only be violated after a discontinuation, when a judicial decision concerning him reflects an opinion that he is guilty (see Bikas, cited above, \u00a7 44, and Allen, cited above, \u00a7 122).",

In Orr v. Norway (no. 31283/04, \u00a7 51, 15\u00a0May 2008), the Court has for example found in a case of an alleged rape involving two persons, that the domestic courts had overstepped the bounds of the civil forum by using criminal terms. However, it has subsequently held that the terminology as such may not be decisive in finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention when regard is had to the nature and context of the particular proceedings (see M\u00fcller v. Germany, no. 54963/08, \u00a7\u00a046, 27 March 2014; A.L.F. v. United Kingdom (dec.), no. 5908/12, \u00a7\u00a024, 12 November 2013; Adams v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 70601/11, \u00a7\u00a041, 12 November 2013; and Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0126). Even the use of expressions from the sphere of criminal law, such as \u201cdeprivation of liberty\u201d and \u201ccoercion\u201d in the present case, has not led the Court to find a violation of that provision where, read in the context of the judgment as a whole the use of the said expressions could not reasonably have been understood as an affirmation imputing criminal liability (see, mutatis mutandis, N.A.\u00a0v.\u00a0Norway, no. 27473/11, \u00a7 48, 18 December 2014).",

These features became decisive factors in the assessment of whether that statement gave rise to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.\u00a0The Court considers that these features are also applicable where the language of a judgment might be misunderstood but can, on the basis of a correct assessment of the domestic law context, not be qualified as a statement of criminal guilt.",

Not only were the civil proceedings instituted later, but they also took place before a different court with a different composition of judges. They were therefore neither an accessory to the criminal proceedings (a contrario, Lagard\u00e8re, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 81) nor merely a continuation of the criminal proceedings (see Ringvold, cited above, \u00a7 41).",

By reference to the relevant articles of the Civil Code, which for their part referred to the relevant articles of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 21 above), the District Court made it clear that it had to examine a compensation claim and no acknowledgment of criminal liability was intended. Furthermore, pursuant to German tort law, stating that the constitutive elements of deprivation of liberty and coercion had been fulfilled was not sufficient to establish civil liability. The injured party had additionally to prove causation, damage and the amount of the financial loss in accordance with the principles of civil law (see paragraph 33 above). The District Court focused also on elements that were exclusively relevant for ascertaining civil liability (see N.A.\u00a0v.\u00a0Norway, cited above, \u00a7 47) because its reasoning included the finding of liability as joint debtors, the calculation of the amount of compensation and an examination of possible counterclaims (see paragraph\u00a023 above). Moreover, the District Court had to determine the compensation claim on the basis of the general principles on civil proceedings and in a different framework from that of the criminal proceedings (see Vella, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060). Unlike criminal procedural law, the civil courts had to rely on the evidence presented by the parties and rules on the burden of proof applied (see paragraph 33 above).",

In this context, it must be reiterated that even though the events resulting into the applicant\u2019s civil liability were connected with those in respect of which the applicant had been charged in the criminal proceedings, compensation was primarily awarded for retrieving A\u2019s money. That had been not the subject of the criminal proceedings. Thus, the civil proceedings did not concern the \u201csame facts\u201d (see paragraph 61 above). Since the outcome of the criminal proceedings was not binding for the civil courts (see, mutatis mutandis, N.A. v. Norway, cited above, \u00a7 51), the District Court made a separate assessment of the facts in order to determine whether the constitutive elements of an offence had been fulfilled, but also assessed the additional elements for establishing civil liability. It did not set out first to demonstrate that the applicant had in fact committed a criminal offence in order then to be able to rule on the compensation claim (a contrario, Lagard\u00e8re, cited above, \u00a7 81).",
