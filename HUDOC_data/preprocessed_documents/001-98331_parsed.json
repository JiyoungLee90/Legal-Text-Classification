He stressed that since his eyesight had deteriorated after his arrest, he needed an examination by an ophthalmologist to obtain a prescription for new glasses.

The Court recalls in this respect that ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention. Previously the Commission has held that a few days spent in detention without glasses did not amount to ill-treatment (see A.K. v the Netherlands (dec.), no. 24774/94, 6 April 1995; cf. Jamal-Aldin v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 19959/92, 23 May 1999), and the Court does not see any reason to disagree with that.

The Court recalls that, indeed, in certain contexts the behaviour of the alleged victim may be taken into account in defining whether the authorities can be held responsible for the treatment complained of. As a rule, Article 3 prohibits ill-treatment irrespective of the circumstances and the victim's behaviour (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV). However, this rule is not without exceptions. Thus, if a prisoner does not receive requisite medical assistance from the authorities, it may entail the State's responsibility only if he made reasonable steps to avail himself of such assistance (see Vala\u0161inas v. , no. 44558/98, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2001VIII, and Knyazev v. , no.\u00a025948/05, \u00a7 103, 8 November 2007).

On 9 September 1998 the investigator ordered an examination of the applicant by an ophthalmologist \u2013 apparently in response to a request lodged by the defence some time earlier. It is unclear when such a request was lodged, but the Court is prepared to conclude that as from early September 1998 the prosecution knew about the difficult situation of the applicant. In any event, on 14 September 1998 the applicant's wife requested the district prosecutor to return the glasses to her husband (see paragraph 15 above).",
