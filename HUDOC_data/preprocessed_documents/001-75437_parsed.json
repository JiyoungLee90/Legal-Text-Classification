It is true that the provision in question does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention and for hearing applications for release. Nevertheless, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to the detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see, mutatis mutandis, Rapacciuolo v. Italy, no. 76024/01, \u00a7 31, 19 May 2005; Singh v. the Czech Republic, no. 60538/00, \u00a7 74, 25 January 2005; and Navarra v. France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 273-B).",

However, in calling for that decision to be quashed, the public prosecutor\u2019s office had sought, through the cassation and remittal procedures, to have the detention order upheld. If the prosecution\u2019s appeal was dismissed, the decision to release the applicant would become final. But if it was allowed, the question whether it was appropriate to remand the applicant in custody would be referred back to the court below, which would be required to adhere to the legal principles laid down by the Court of Cassation. In those circumstances, the Court considers that the outcome of the proceedings in the Court of Cassation was crucial to the decision as to the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention. It cannot therefore subscribe to the Government\u2019s argument that Article 5 \u00a7 4 was not applicable to the proceedings before the Court of Cassation when it ruled on the appeal by the public prosecutor\u2019s office.",

Equality of arms is not ensured if counsel is denied access to those documents in the investigation file which are essential in order to challenge effectively the lawfulness of his client\u2019s detention. In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), a hearing is required (see, among other authorities, Lamy v. , 30 March 1989, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 151, and Nikolova, cited above, \u00a7 58).",

Switzerland, 24 November 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 275). It thus follows that, in view of the dramatic impact of deprivation of liberty on the fundamental rights of the person concerned, proceedings conducted under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention should in principle also meet, to the largest extent possible under the circumstances of an ongoing investigation, the basic requirements of a fair trial, such as the right to an adversarial procedure. While national law may satisfy this requirement in various ways, whatever method is chosen should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment thereon (see Garcia Alva v.

In the present case the Court notes that, prior to the proceedings before it, the applicant had brought an action before the Specialised Division of the Palermo District Court seeking to have the judgment of 15 February 2000 set aside and had lodged an appeal on points of law after the dismissal of that action. The Court thus acknowledges that the applicant incurred certain expenses in seeking redress for the violation of the Convention at the level of the domestic legal system (see Rojas Morales v. Italy, no. 39676/98, \u00a7 42, 16\u00a0November 2000). However, it finds excessive the costs claimed in respect of the proceedings before the Italian courts (see, mutatis mutandis, Sakkopoulos v. Greece, no. 61828/00, \u00a7 59, 15 January 2004, and Cianetti, cited above, \u00a7 56). Having regard to the information in its possession and to its practice in such matters, the Court considers it reasonable to award EUR\u00a01,500 to the applicant under this head.",
