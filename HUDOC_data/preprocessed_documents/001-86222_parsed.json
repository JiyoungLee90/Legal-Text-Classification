Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v.

This is particularly relevant in the Russian legal system, where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of the issue of whether the evidence that has been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov, loc. cit.). This systemic deficiency is particularly salient in the circumstances of the second criminal case against the applicant, where the prosecutor charged him with aggravated theft, a \u201cserious\u201d offence in the domestic classification, because the items stolen \u2013 about eight euros in value \u2013 amounted to \u201csubstantial damage\u201d. The District Court did not scrutinise whether the prosecutor\u2019s designation of the offence was reasonable and whether it was supported with appropriate evidence, although this was a crucial element in determining whether the imputed crime was indeed \u201cserious\u201d and consequently warranted the applicant\u2019s placement in custody. Only four months later, further to a complaint by counsel, the District Court acknowledged that there had been no evidence supporting the charge of \u201csubstantial damage\u201d, redesignated the offence as non-aggravated theft and discontinued the second criminal case against the applicant by virtue of the Amnesty Act.",
