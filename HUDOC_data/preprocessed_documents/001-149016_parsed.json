They noted that whilst there was no statutory requirement that newborn babies or their parents remain in hospital for a certain period of time after the birth, the guideline issued by the Ministry of Health in 2005 \u2013 which the applicants deemed obsolete and ill-founded as it had not been shown that the risks run by newborn babies decreased when they were placed in hospital \u2013 had indicated at the time that newborn babies could usually leave the hospital 72 hours after the birth. In their view, the problem lay in the fact that, like Doctor D. in the present case, doctors regarded the fact of remaining in hospital for 72 hours after the birth as an obligation, and not a recommendation.",

Furthermore, while there had been possible alternatives in the present case, such as signing a statement refusing treatment, the possibility of finding a paediatrician outside the hospital able to take immediate charge of the child or prior consultation at the hospital, the first applicant had deprived herself of those possibilities by her failure to act. Lastly, the measure in question had been a temporary one in that the applicants had left the hospital two days after it had been applied and it had been lifted the day after they had left the hospital.",

Furthermore, regard should be had to the problems facing the national authorities in such situations (Haase, cited above, \u00a7 101); moreover, their decisions could only be examined in the light of the situation such as it presented itself to the domestic authorities at the time those decisions were taken (B.B. and F.B. v.\u00a0Germany, nos.\u00a018734/09 and 9424/11, \u00a7 48, 14 March 2013).

Italy, no.\u00a052763/99, \u00a7 108, 9 May 2003). Furthermore, the taking of a newborn baby into care at the moment of its birth is an extremely harsh measure. There must be extraordinarily compelling reasons before a baby can be physically removed from its mother, against her will, immediately after birth as a consequence of a procedure in which neither she nor her partner has been involved (see K. and T., cited above, \u00a7 168, and Haase, cited above, \u00a7 91).",
