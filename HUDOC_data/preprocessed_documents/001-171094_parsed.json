The Court has regarded a judicial appeal against a decision not to open a criminal case as a remedy (see, among many other authorities, Borgdorf v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 20427/05, \u00a7\u00a027, 22 October 2013; Dzhamaldayev v.\u00a0 Russia (dec.), no. 39768/06, \u00a7 28, 22 January 2013; and Trubnikov v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 9790/99, 14 October 2003). However, taking into account that, as submitted by the applicant and not disputed by the Government, she was unaware of any subsequent decision given by the investigating authorities in her case on the issue, she was not in a position to challenge it (see paragraphs 31 and 37 above). The Court therefore dismisses the Government\u2019s objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies (see mutatis mutandis Vladimir Fedorov v. Russia, no. 19223/04, \u00a7 75, 30 July 2009, and Oleg Nikitin v. Russia, no. 36410/02, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, 9\u00a0October 2008).",
