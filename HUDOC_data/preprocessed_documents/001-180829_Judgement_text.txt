The case originated in two applications (nos. 16088/06 and 41644/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals, Mr Denis Aleksandrovich Zelik (“the first applicant”) and Mr Ruslan Aleksandrovich Kel (“the second applicant”), on 4 March 2006 and 5 May 2009, respectively.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 23 February 2017 the complaints concerning absence of the applicants’ lawyers from appeal hearings in their criminal cases were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court. The parties submitted written observations on the admissibility and merits.
Between 2005 and 2008 the two applicants were convicted of various criminal offences. Following appeals, their cases were examined by the appeal courts in the absence of the applicants’ legal counsel. Their convictions were upheld.
Personal details and information relevant to the criminal proceedings against the applicants appear in the appendix.
