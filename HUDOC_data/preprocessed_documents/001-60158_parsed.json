The provisions of paragraph 3 (a) of Article 6 point to the need for special attention to be paid to the notification of the \u201caccusation\u201d to the defendant. Particulars of the offence play a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of their service that the suspect is formally put on written notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him. Article 6 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the \u201ccause\u201d of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts. That information should be detailed (Dallos v. Hungary, no. 29082/95, 1.3.2001, \u00a7 47). ",

In this respect it is to be observed that Article 6 \u00a7 3 (a) does not impose any special formal requirement as to the manner in which the accused is to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. The Court further recalls that sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article 6 \u00a7 3 are connected and that the right to be informed of the nature and the cause of the accusation must be considered in the light of the accused\u2019s right to prepare his defence (P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v.

It has not been alleged that the appeal court lacked power to quash the conviction and acquit the applicant, or that at the appeal level the applicant was unable to defend himself against the reformulated charge. It must also be noted that the conviction became effective under the domestic criminal procedure only after the pronouncement of the decision of the Court of Appeal (see \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 21 above). Furthermore, even following the unsuccessful outcome of the appeal procedure, the applicant\u2019s case was reviewed at the level of cassation jurisdiction by the Supreme Court which also examined the substantive and procedural elements of the reclassification, and was competent to afford the applicant the relief he sought (see \u00a7\u00a7 18 and 22 above). The fact that at both appeal and cassation levels the applicant\u2019s pleadings against the reclassification were unsuccessful does not indicate that the review procedures were not capable of remedying the shortcomings of the first instance proceedings.",
