They emphasised that they had complained to the authorities shortly after the abduction and maintained contact with them throughout the investigation. Between 2003 and 2012 the applicants informed the investigators about new developments, for example, when the fifth applicant saw her brother in a television programme, she informed the authorities thereof shortly after. The applicants further maintained that the armed conflict in the area had led them to believe that investigative delays were inevitable and it was only with the passage of time and the lack of information from the domestic authorities that they had begun to doubt the effectiveness of the investigation. Overall, the applicants considered that there had been no excessive delay in lodging their application with the Court within nine years after the incident.",

Even when the investigation was dormant between March 2004 and August 2008, the applicants consistently complained to various law-enforcement authorities and requested assistance in the search for their relative (see paragraph 38 above). They also maintained contact with the investigators between 2009 and 2011 by asking to be provided with copies of the investigation file documents and requesting information about progress in the proceedings (see paragraphs 36, 37 and 39 above).",

Furthermore, it transpires that they took no steps in order to provide the investigation with information pertaining to the circumstances of their relative\u2019s disappearance. As can be seen from the fifth applicant\u2019s submissions to the Court, the third, fourth and fifth applicants were aware of Mr Umarov\u2019s abduction (see paragraph 40 above).

Even assuming that Ms Z.U. had shared this information with the third, fourth and fifth applicants, none of those applicants took the requisite initiative in order to keep informed about the pending investigation. Moreover, they remained passive even after the broadcast of the interview with Mr Umarov on television in 2008, although they could have asked the investigators to establish whether he had indeed been convicted and sentenced to twentyfive years\u2019 imprisonment. For some reason, they did not even inform the investigators about the interview, unlike the second applicant, who drew the authorities\u2019 attention to that broadcast (see paragraph 40 above).",

In the circumstances of the case, such inactivity on the part of the third, fourth and fifth applicants seems to indicate that they were not expecting any important developments which could have resulted in establishing Mr Umarov\u2019s whereabouts, identifying the perpetrators of his abduction, or making significant progress towards the elucidation of the crime.",

Accordingly, the Court finds that the third, fourth and fifth applicants failed to demonstrate due diligence and to comply with the six-month time-limit set out in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for similar reasoning, Doshuyeva and Yusupov v.
