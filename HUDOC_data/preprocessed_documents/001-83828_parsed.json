However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 4\u00a0December 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0336, pp. 25-26, \u00a7\u00a034, Salman v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR\u00a02000VII).",

In addition the arrest occurred after the applicant had been involved in a fight. While fourteen police officers outnumbered the applicant and five other men involved in the struggle, account must be taken of the fact that the applicant effectively resisted the actions of the police officers by refusing to comply with their orders, resisting the attempts of the policemen to apprehend him and behaving aggressively (see paragraphs 6, 7 above). Thus, it could be considered reasonable for the police officers to use a certain degree of physical force in order to overpower him and carry out the arrest and detention (see.
