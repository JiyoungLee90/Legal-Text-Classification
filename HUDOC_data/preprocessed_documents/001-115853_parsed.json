Lithuania ([GC], no. 74420/01, ECHR 2008) and Malininas v. Lithuania (no. 10071/04, 1 July\u00a02008). The Government emphasised that only a few months after the applicant\u2019s previous conviction the law-enforcement authorities had received unofficial information indicating that he had resumed illegal drug-related activities, and the investigators had launched an operational verification exercise (operat\u012bv\u0101 p\u0101rbaude) in the course of which, over a period of nine months and in accordance with the provisions of the LOA, they gathered information from various sources such as police informants and telephone tapping. Therefore, according to the Government, the investigators had verified the unofficial information and had had good reasons to suspect the applicant of committing or being prepared to commit a drug-related offence when they sought authorisation to carry out the investigative test. The Government further referred to the applicant\u2019s behaviour during the investigative test and contended that he himself had been eager to increase the quantity of drugs.",

In this regard the Court\u2019s task is not to determine whether certain items of evidence were obtained unlawfully, but rather to examine whether such \u201cunlawfulness\u201d resulted in the infringement of another right protected by the Convention (ibid.). The requirement of the fairness of a trial embodied in Article 6 would be compromised by the use of evidence obtained as a result of police incitement (see Teixeira de Castro v.

Under the substantive limb, the Court has assessed whether the investigative activity of the police officers went beyond that of undercover agents (see Teixeira de Castro cited above, \u00a7 38, and Ramanauskas cited above, \u00a7 55), in other words, whether the offence would have been committed without the authorities\u2019 intervention. In this regard the Court has in previous cases examined, inter alia, whether the investigating authorities had good reasons to suspect the applicant of prior involvement in particular unlawful activities (see Teixeira de Castro cited above, \u00a7 38), at what stage of the offence the undercover agents carried out the undercover operation (see Vlachos v. , no. 20643/06, \u00a7 26, 18 September\u00a02008), and whether the conduct of the undercover agent was essentially passive (see Malininas cited above, \u00a7\u00a037, and Ramanauskas cited above, \u00a7 67).",

The Court has also noted that where the reliability of evidence is in dispute the existence of fair procedures to examine the admissibility of the evidence takes on an even greater importance (see Bykov v.  [GC], no. 4378/02, \u00a7\u00a095, 10 March 2009). In this regard the Court has emphasised that it falls to the prosecution to prove that there was no incitement, provided that the defendant\u2019s allegations are not wholly improbable. If an arguable claim in this respect has been raised, the Court must ascertain whether the applicant was able to argue the incitement plea effectively and whether the domestic courts took the necessary steps to establish that no police incitement had taken place (see Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, \u00a7\u00a0135-137, ECHR\u00a02006XII (extracts)). For the national courts this entails establishing, inter alia, the reasons why the operation was mounted, the extent of the police\u2019s involvement in the offence and the nature of the activities to which the applicant was subjected (see Ramanauskas cited above, \u00a7 71).",

In this regard the Government emphasised the applicant\u2019s predisposition to commit drug offences (see paragraph 50 above). The Court notes at the outset that, although the applicant had previously been convicted of storing drugs, nothing in the case file suggests that he had been convicted of drug trafficking (see paragraph 7 above). The Court also notes that under section 4(4) of the LOA, undercover operations were to be carried out only after other means of attaining the aims laid down in the LOA had been exhausted. As is clear from the Government\u2019s observations, the investigators had unofficial information about the applicant\u2019s alleged illegal activities and they had taken steps to verify it (see paragraph 50 above). In contrast to, for instance Milinien\u0117 (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-38), where the police deployed the contested undercover activities in response to information which was later scrutinised by the domestic court (see also Vanyan v. , no. 53203/99, \u00a7 49, 15 December 2005), in the present case no objective evidence showing the reasons for police officer I.\u2019s attempts to establish contact with the applicant was ever subjected to the domestic courts\u2019 scrutiny (see paragraphs 10-13, above). Moreover, the information in the criminal file does not make it clear whether the investigators \u201cjoined in\u201d an already ongoing offence (contrast, for instance, Bannikova cited above, \u00a7\u00a069). Lastly, as in Malininas (cited above, \u00a7\u00a037), with each offer the undercover agent asked the applicant to procure larger quantities of drugs and offered him a substantial monetary inducement; this raises doubts as to whether the conduct of the undercover agent remained purely passive.",

In such circumstances the role of the courts\u2019 scrutiny of whether the evidence was obtained without the use of incitement becomes even more important, in order to eradicate any reasonable doubts in that regard. Moreover, it becomes particularly important where no assessment has been made by the courts prior to the launching of an investigative test, as in the case of investigative tests regulated by the LOA which, in contrast to similar measures regulated by the Law of Criminal Procedure, are not subject to prior authorisation by the courts.",

When called upon to examine the incitement plea, the court of first instance, without further assessment, concluded that all the evidence brought before it was admissible (see paragraphs 21-22 above), while the appellate court found that the applicant had raised the plea with the aim of evading criminal responsibility. Disregarding the lower courts\u2019 failure to address the incitement complaint on the merits, the Supreme Court concluded that it had already been established that prior to carrying out the undercover activities the investigators had had sufficient information to suspect the applicant of drug trafficking (see paragraph 26 above). The Court observes that there is no information whether the Senate reached the above conclusion by examining the authorisation and the reasons contained therein, or by relying on any other objective information which might have justified the launching of the investigative test.",

In any event, there is no indication that the domestic courts attempted to obtain such access to the classified materials. Where it falls to the prosecution to prove that there was no incitement (see Ramanauskas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070), the domestic courts\u2019 powers to guarantee a fair trial would be undermined if, in assessing an incitement plea, they reached their conclusions by relying on unverified information which was in the exclusive possession of the prosecution.",
