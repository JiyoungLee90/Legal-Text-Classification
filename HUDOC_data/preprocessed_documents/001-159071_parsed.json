Referring to section 122(3) of the Protection of State Classified Information Act, the court held that the Authority, which had disclosed to the applicant the source of the classified information and the general conclusions that it had drawn from that information but not the content thereof, had acted neither arbitrarily nor unlawfully. Furthermore, the fact that the impugned decision was amenable to judicial review had enabled the court to examine the information in question and rule on whether it justified the conclusion that the applicant posed a security risk, which was the case here. The court also observed that there was no fundamental individual right to hold a post in the civil service, that the State was authorised to restrict the access of individuals to such posts and that it could also determine the conditions in which those individuals could have access to confidential information necessary for the performance of their duties. The applicant had not satisfied those conditions in the present case. According to that rationale, an individual could not have knowledge of the confidential information on the basis of which his right of access to confidential information had been refused. The court considered, lastly, that the confidentiality of the information that had led to the applicant\u2019s security clearance being revoked prevented it from examining his submission that the information in question had concerned his refusal to co-operate, beyond his statutory obligations, with the military intelligence service. In any event that submission was deemed to be speculative because unsupported by verifiable documents.",

It observed that the possibility, provided for in section 133(3) of the Protection of State Classified Information Act, of prohibiting access to part of the file was not limited to a specific category of confidential information. In the present case the conditions for prohibiting access were met because communication of the information in question to the applicant could have led to the disclosure of the intelligence service\u2019s working methods, the disclosure of its sources of information or attempts on the applicant\u2019s part to influence possible witnesses. Referring to the judgment of the Constitutional Court no. II. \u00daS 377/04, the Supreme Administrative Court held that the applicant\u2019s complaints of unfairness of the proceedings were unfounded because, having regard to the special nature of the proceedings on account of the nature of the confidential information in question, not all the applicant\u2019s procedural rights could be guaranteed. Whilst the executive did indeed, in certain circumstances, have the right not to inform the individual concerned of the reasons for not issuing him or her with security clearance, that restriction was counterbalanced by the guarantee of having that decision examined by the administrative courts, which had unlimited access to the documents contained in the administrative file. In the present case the Supreme Administrative Court observed that the confidential document emanating from the intelligence service contained specific, comprehensive and detailed information concerning the conduct and lifestyle of the applicant on the basis of which the court was satisfied in the present case as to its relevance for determining whether the applicant posed a national security risk. It observed, further, that the information did not in any way concern the applicant\u2019s refusal to co-operate with the military intelligence service.",

Referring to its judgment no.\u00a0Pl.\u00a0\u00daS\u00a011/2000, it observed that, having regard to the special nature and the importance of decisions adopted in connection with confidential information where there was a clear national security interest, it was not always possible to apply all the procedural guarantees of fairness in such proceedings. In the present case the Constitutional Court held that in so far as the courts\u2019 conduct was duly justified and the reasoning in their decisions comprehensible and in conformity with the Constitution and they had not departed from procedural standards and constitutional principles to an inordinate degree, the Constitutional Court was not required to intervene in their decision-making process.",

Pl. \u00daS 11/2000 on a law governing confidential information (no.\u00a0148/1998), since largely replaced by the aforementioned Act (Law no. 412/2005), ordering the National Security Authority never to communicate to the person concerned the reasons for not issuing security clearance. The court observed that, in the event of a conflict between the interests of an individual and those of the State, the interests of national security, which were fundamental and justified imposing a certain restriction on an individual\u2019s private sphere, had to be taken into account and respected. In order to protect national security, the State had to have the appropriate tools, including the ability to protect classified information to which only persons meeting the statutory conditions had access. That did not mean, however, that the State could act arbitrarily towards its citizens and restrict their fundamental rights beyond the necessary extent. The Constitutional Court acknowledged that providing detailed reasons for a decision not to issue security clearance could in some cases seriously endanger the interests of the State or third parties. However, in those specific cases, it was not possible to waive the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, it was moreover not always necessary to withhold from the person concerned the reasons for which he or she was deemed unfit to have access to confidential information, as it was actually exceptional for such disclosure to really endanger the State\u2019s interests. Otherwise it would be practically impossible for that person to eliminate the reasons for which they were refused security clearance, even in cases where he or she was in a position to do so and where their disclosure would not compromise the interests of the State or of third parties. It was clear, however, that a decision not to issue security clearance had considerable repercussions for the personal sphere of the person concerned, whether legally (professional disqualification, grounds for dismissal) or factually (negative reactions from colleagues and family). Whilst the law could stipulate the conditions for, and restrictions on, holding certain posts or carrying out certain activities, those conditions had to be transparent and foreseeable and the person whose rights were at stake had to be able to duly defend him or herself against interference.",

Accordingly, a blanket prohibition on communicating the reasons for not issuing security clearance was unacceptable. On the other hand there was a duty to comply with the legitimate public interest in protecting confidential information and not communicate reasons whose disclosure would endanger that interest or affect the legitimate interests of third parties. It was incumbent on the legislature to enact new legislation providing an appropriate means of reflecting and reconciling private and public interests.",

However, merely excluding that type of administrative procedure from the general rules in the Administrative Code was not contrary to constitutional principles since the only decisive question was whether or not the special procedure protected the constitutional rights of the persons concerned. In the present case the issue was whether the decision (not) to issue security clearance concerned fundamental rights and freedoms, in which case it would be unconstitutional to bring it outside the realm of a judicial review. The fact that a decision not to issue security clearance could lead to the loss of a particular job was a consequence of the provisions of Law no.\u00a0148/1998 according to which the ability to hold a post requiring knowledge of confidential information was subject to obtaining security clearance. If the person concerned did not obtain security clearance, he or she could no longer carry on his or her initial profession and could be transferred to another post (where possible), dismissed from his or her post, or even dismissed from the public service. A decision not to issue security clearance therefore represented a substantial interference with the working (or public-service) relationship and, accordingly, with the fundamental right to freely choose one\u2019s profession.

They had to contain specific information or a summary thereof in order for the National Security Authority and, where applicable, the court to be able to actually verify the relevance of facts established by the intelligence services, that is, the credibility of the information established by them, the weight attached thereto and their connection with decisive questions for the security procedure.

More than in \u201cclassic\u201d proceedings, where the parties had the same information as the court, the latter was here the guarantor of the right to a fair hearing, which required increased vigilance on the part of the court vis-\u00e0-vis the public administration. This, moreover, was why the courts had access, throughout the exercise of their functions, to all categories of secret information, without clearance. Thus, a judicial review, which must extend to the information relevant for the outcome of the administrative proceedings, could provide adequate protection against arbitrariness, while protecting to the extent necessary the confidentiality of the information. The court also observed that the facts established must, overall, constitute a convincing basis for concluding that, in a specific case, the facts actually indicated a risk for national security. What was important was the informative value of the facts established, the credibility of which must be assessed and regard had to whether they had been interpreted correctly and did not in reality have a different significance from that which appeared at first sight.",

Luxembourg [GC], no. 37575/04, \u00a7 93, ECHR 2012). They submitted that neither a civil right of access to confidential information, nor to security clearance allowing access to that information nor the exercise of a specific public function could be inferred from the Czech legislation and practice. The highest courts considered that issuing security clearance amounted to granting an extraordinary privilege, which was exclusively a matter for the relevant administrative authority on the basis and within the limits of the power conferred on it by law and within its discretion. In deciding whether or not to issue security clearance, the National Security Authority was thus endowed with a particular discretionary power since that privilege could only be granted, on certain conditions, to a limited number of persons who did not represent a risk for national security\u00a0(the Government referred, mutatis mutandis, to Ankarcrona v. Sweden (dec.), no. 35178/97, ECHR 2000VI). The same considerations applied to the revocation of that security clearance where the person concerned ceased to meet the statutory conditions. At the same time domestic law provided sufficient guarantees against arbitrary interference so that the executive\u2019s discretionary power was not unlimited.",

If the subject of the court proceedings in question was a discretionary decision which interfered with the applicant\u2019s rights, the Court has held Article 6 to be applicable (see Pudas v.

However, where the national authority had a discretionary power concerning the question whether the applicant should be granted certain advantages or was entitled to request action on the part of the authorities, the Court has held that conferring unlimited freedom or even a wide discretion on a national authority indicated that domestic law did not recognise any \u201cright\u201d to those advantages or actions.

Where evidence had been withheld from the defence on public interest grounds, it was not the role of this Court to decide whether or not such non-disclosure was strictly necessary, nor to attempt to weigh the public interest in non-disclosure against that of the accused in having sight of the material. The Court\u2019s task was to scrutinise the decision-making procedure to ensure that, as far as possible, it complied with the requirements to provide adversarial proceedings and equality of arms and incorporated adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the accused (the Government referred to Fitt v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29777/96, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2000II).

That also applied to the principle enshrined in section 133(2) of Law no.\u00a0412/2005 according to which access to confidential information could only be refused, at the stage of judicial review, if its disclosure was liable to endanger or seriously compromise the activities of the intelligence services or the police (they referred to Vereniging Weekblad Bluf! v. the Netherlands, 9 February 1995, \u00a7 40, Series A no. 306A). Furthermore, the information had to be specified as confidential by the Authority, whereupon it was incumbent on the President of the Chamber to assess whether the same aim could be achieved by less restrictive means. In no event did the law confine that approach to information of a certain category of confidentiality as affirmed by the applicant. Accordingly, it was only in exceptional cases that procedural rights could be restricted to the point of not communicating even the content of the confidential information to a party to the proceedings, as had been the case here. In that situation the Court had to confine its examination to the question of the existence of adequate safeguards to protect the applicant\u2019s interests.",

The applicant was not dismissed from his job. Nor was his contract cancelled by his employer; instead, it was terminated by mutual agreement. The dispute thus did not concern the applicant\u2019s right to an employment contract with the Ministry but a decision in which he had been considered not fit to be trusted with certain information. It is true that security clearance may be valuable for the applicant in obtaining and maintaining other jobs. On the other hand \u2013 unlike in cases concerning licensing disputes, where an individual\u2019s private rights are directly affected (the authority to practise a certain profession, such as that of a lawyer or a physician) or property rights are at stake (for example, a restaurant owner who is dependent on a licence to serve alcohol) \u2013 the applicant in this case has not demonstrated any such consequences, let alone shown that he would be directly affected in the same way. The conclusion by the majority that the applicant\u2019s reputation would be affected may well be right, and it may also be true that the decision could have pecuniary effects. However, it is not possible to assess the latter aspect as the applicant left his job voluntarily. As regards the applicant\u2019s reputation, it should be noted that the revocation of his security clearance amounted to a statement of distrust as regards his handling of information that concerned State security. Whether or not a State should trust a person employed within its central government offices from a security perspective is one of the prerogatives of the State in question and does not concern that person\u2019s \u201ccivil\u201d rights for the purposes of Article 6.",
