In particular, they had failed to identify and question federal servicemen on duty at the checkpoint between Urus-Martan and Martan-Chu on the night of Apti Elmurzayev's kidnapping. Neither had they identified and questioned heads of law-enforcement agencies of the Urus-Martan District who had authorised movement of military vehicles during curfew hours. The investigators had not identified \u201cpower structures\u201d that had owned APCs and UAZ vehicles and had not studied records on the use of military vehicles and on the organisation of special operations. The town court granted the first applicant's complaint in the part concerning the access to the investigation file in case no. 61105 but did not allow him to make copies of documents and dismissed his request for resumption of the proceedings in that case as the district prosecutor's office had reopened them on 1 August 2006. The request for access to the investigation file in case no. 34017 was dismissed because the first applicant had not been granted victim status in that case.",

A civil court is unable to pursue any independent investigation and is incapable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings regarding the identity of the perpetrators of fatal assaults or disappearances, still less of establishing their responsibility (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a057942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0119-121, 24 February 2005, and Estamirov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077).

The Government mentioned the possibility for the applicants to apply for judicial review of the decisions of the investigating authorities in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court observes that the applicants did make use of this remedy, which proved to be futile. In any event, the effectiveness of both sets of the investigation had already been undermined in its early stages by the authorities' failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures. In such circumstances the Court considers that the applicants could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the district prosecutor's office. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy relied on by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",

In such circumstances, and in particular in the absence of any proof to confirm the very fact of the detention, even assuming that the remedy referred to by the Government was accessible to the applicants, it is more than questionable whether a court complaint of the unacknowledged detention of the applicants' relatives by the authorities would have had any prospects of success.

According to the Court's settled case-law, the effect of Article 13 of the Convention is to require the provision of a remedy at national level allowing the competent domestic authority both to deal with the substance of a relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they comply with their obligations under this provision. However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III, p. 1020, \u00a7 64).",
