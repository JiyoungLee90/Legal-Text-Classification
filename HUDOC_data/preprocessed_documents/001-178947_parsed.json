The Government did not demonstrate that in the applicant\u2019s case that had been impossible, and the domestic court did not establish any obstacles to drawing up the report on the spot, either (see paragraph 9 above and, for a similar reasoning, Lashmankin and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 57818/09 and 14\u00a0others, \u00a7 489, 7\u00a0February 2017, and Navalnyy and Yashin v. Russia, no.\u00a076204/11, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 93, 4 December 2014). It follows that depriving the applicant of his liberty for the purpose of escorting him to the Goragorsk station was unlawful and arbitrary.",

In the absence of any specific and compelling reasons for not releasing the applicant and escorting him instead to the Nadterechnyi police station, the Court considers that his further detention was also arbitrary (see Frumkin, cited above, \u00a7 150).",

The domestic court indicated that the passport-issuing authority was primarily responsible for the contents of the passport and for the way it had been filled out (see paragraph\u00a011 above). It was not alleged that the applicant had somehow spoilt the document by, for instance, adding unauthorised notes or scribbling on it. It is also relevant that the applicant has not been tried or convicted for using an invalid identity document either on that occasion, or at any other time in the sixteen years he has been using that passport.",
