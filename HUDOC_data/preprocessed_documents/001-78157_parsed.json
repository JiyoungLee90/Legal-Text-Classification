The respondent State is expected to make all feasible reparation for the consequences of the violation in such a manner as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach. Furthermore, it follows from the Convention, and from Article 1 in particular, that in ratifying the Convention the Contracting States undertake to ensure that their domestic legislation is compatible with it. Consequently, it is for the respondent State to remove any obstacles in its domestic legal system that might prevent the applicant\u2019s situation from being adequately redressed (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 198, ECHR 2004II, and Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2004I).",
