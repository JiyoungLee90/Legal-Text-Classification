It found that the applicant was the founder and principal leader of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK (the Workers\u2019 Party of Kurdistan \u2013 hereafter \u201cthe PKK\u201d). The National Security Court found that it had been established that, following decisions taken by the applicant and on his orders and instructions, the PKK had carried out several armed attacks, bomb attacks, acts of sabotage and armed robberies, and that in the course of those acts of violence thousands of civilians, soldiers, police officers, village guards and public servants had been killed. The court reiterated that the applicant had acknowledged that the Turkish Government\u2019s estimate of the number of those killed (almost 30,000) or wounded as a result of the PKK\u2019s activities was fairly accurate, that the actual number might even be higher, and that he had ordered the attacks as part of the armed struggle being waged by the PKK. The court did not accept that there were mitigating circumstances allowing the death penalty to be commuted to life imprisonment, having regard, among other things, to the very large number and the seriousness of the acts of violence and the major, pressing threat to the country that those acts posed.",

The fact that the applicant was incarcerated in a prison located on a remote island inevitably caused major problems of access for the family members as compared with high-security prisons on the mainland.

The Court takes the view that this was such an extraordinary measure that a State could not be reasonably expected to provide details in its legislation on the regime to be applied in such cases.",

The mere fact that such prisoners may have already served a long period of imprisonment does not weaken the State\u2019s positive obligation to protect the public; States may fulfil that obligation by continuing to detain such life sentenced prisoners for as long as they remain dangerous (see, for instance, Maiorano and Others, cited above).\u201d",

This would be contrary both to legal certainty and to the general principles on victim status within the meaning of that term in Article 34 of the Convention.

Although it did consider, in line with CPT\u2019s recommendations, that the long-term effects of the applicant\u2019s relative social isolation should be mitigated by providing him with the same amenities available to other inmates of high-security prisons in Turkey, including television and telephone communication with his family, it did not consider it necessary to adopt the relevant measures in the short term in order to avoid violating Article 3.",

This time the point at issue is the sentence applied to the convicted leader of a terrorist organisation, and the scope of the case also includes the very strict prison regime applied to the applicant, and in particular the restrictions in his access to relatives and legal assistance and the lack of proper medical care. The discussion of the fundamental problem of a life sentence has, in the present case, the benefit of the knowledge of the particulars of the prison regime applied to the applicant from June 1999 to March 2012. Both reasons would have sufficed to justify my separate opinion. But there is a third reason.

In Vinter, the Grand Chamber held that a \u201cwhole life order\u201d (i.e. an irreducible life sentence) irretrievably breaches Article 3 of the Convention, because it contradicts the resocialisation purpose. In fact, an irreducible life sentence is per se incompatible with international law, insofar as it disregards the clear prohibition set out in Article 37 (a) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 9 of the Inter-American Convention on extradition, and the international obligation of resocialisation of offenders sentenced to prison terms laid down in Article 10 (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 5 (6) of the American Convention on Human Rights, and Article 40 (1) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. As the US Supreme Court once put it, \u201ca sentence of life imprisonment without parole, however, cannot be justified by the goal of rehabilitation. The penalty forswears altogether the rehabilitative ideal. By denying the defendant the right to re-enter the community, the State makes an irrevocable judgment about that person\u2019s value and place in society.\u201d In blunt terms, an irreducible life sentence is akin to inhuman treatment because of the desocialising and therefore dehumanising effects of long-term imprisonment. In fact, this also holds true for any kind of open-ended, indeterminate sentence, any fixed-term sentence which exceeds a normal life span, or any extremely long fixed-term. Human dignity is incompatible with these forms of punishment. Restricted access to, or even denial of, drug treatment and vocational and educational programmes for life prisoners only aggravates the inherent inhumanity of the penalty.",

Even if there were a proven correlation between life imprisonment and lower crime rates, or at least lower rates of murder and other violent crime, punishing the offender for the purposes of deterring other people\u2019s behaviour and strengthening the social authority of the legal norm would reduce the offender to an instrument of a state strategy. But there is no such correlation. On the contrary, not only do countries with a longstanding practice of life imprisonment, such as the U.S. and Russia, have high crime rates, and in particular, high murder and violent crime rates, but countries which do not have life imprisonment actually have low crime rates. The best example is Portugal. Life imprisonment was first abolished in Portugal under the prison reform of 1884. This longstanding tradition was enshrined in Article 30 of the Portuguese Constitution itself, which prohibits life or indeterminate imprisonment. Yet Portuguese murder and violent crime rates have long been among the lowest in the world. The fact that other European countries, such as Andorra (Articles 35 and 58 of the Criminal Code), Bosnia and Herzegovina (Article 42 of the Criminal Code), Croatia (Articles 44 and 51 of the new Criminal Code), Montenegro (Article 33 of the Criminal Code), San Marino (Article 81 of the Criminal Code), Serbia (see Article 45 of the Criminal Code) and Spain (Articles 36 and 76 of the Criminal Code), and non-European countries, such as Angola (Article 66 of the Constitution), Brazil (Article 5 (XVVII) of the Constitution), Bolivia (Article 27 of the Criminal Code), Cape Verde (Article 32 of the Constitution), China (Article 41 of the Criminal Code of the Autonomous Region of Macau), Colombia (Article 34 of Constitution), Costa Rica (Article 51 of the Criminal Code), Dominican Republic (Article 7 of the Criminal code), East Timor (Article 32 of the Constitution), Ecuador (Articles 51 and 53 of the Criminal Code), El Salvador (Article 45 of the Criminal Code), Guatemala (Article 44 of the Criminal Code), Honduras (Article 39 of the Criminal Code), Mexico (Article 25 of the Federal Criminal Code), Mozambique (Article 61 of the Constitution), Nicaragua (Article 52 of the Criminal Code), Panama (Article 52 of the Criminal Code), Paraguay (Article 38 of the Criminal Code), S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (Article 37 of the Constitution) and Uruguay (Article 68 of the Criminal Code), have taken the same step, shows that societies in different continents with different cultures can survive without life imprisonment.

But this presumption is based on a faith in highly problematic prediction scales that are closer to a form of divinatory anticipation of the future than to a scientific exercise, as the experience of many \u201cfalse positives\u201d has shown. Moreover, the net-widening effect of the concept of dangerousness of the offender, which has gone so far as to include \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d, \u201cmental abnormality\u201d or \u201cunstable character\u201d, blurs the borderline between responsible mentally fit offenders and irresponsible mentally unfit offenders, with the serious risk of mislabelling offenders. Worse still, this presumption borders on arbitrariness in the case of automatic or mandatory penalties, such as in the case of automatic application of life sentence to certain types of offences, regardless of the particular circumstances of the offender, or to certain types of repetitive offenders, regardless of the specific gravity of the crimes committed. The goal of eliminating arbitrariness and discrimination from criminal law enforcement can never be achieved without securing a fundamental component of fairness: individualised sentencing. Automatic or mandatory penalties are the opposite of an individualised response to crime.",

If life imprisonment conflicts with the purpose of resocialisation of the offender and the basic principle of individualised sentencing, the next question to be put is whether pure incapacitation of the offender is tolerable in a democratic society. The question is not rhetoric. Life imprisonment may work, and indeed has worked in the past, as a privileged instrument of abuse of civil liberties. Montesquieu rightly argued that the length of prison penalties is in direct correlation to the more or less liberal nature of State: \u201cIl serait ais\u00e9 de prouver que, dans tous ou presque tous les Etats d\u2019Europe, les peines ont diminu\u00e9 ou augment\u00e9 \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019on s\u2019est plus approch\u00e9 ou plus eloign\u00e9 de la libert\u00e9.\u201d (\u201cIt would be an easy matter to prove, that, in all, or almost all, the governments of Europe, penalties have increased or diminished in proportion as those governments favoured or discouraged liberty.\u201d) Labelling political opponents as \u201cpublic enemies\u201d and punishing them with life imprisonment has been an irrefutable temptation in many States in the past, and still is today. Recent history provides two good examples. \u201cPreventive detention\u201d (Sicherungsverwahrung), which provides for the extension of the prison term imposed on mentally fit offenders in accordance with their dangerousness, was introduced into German law by the Nazi regime, and was used and abused to target all those who opposed the regime or simply did not fit into the Nazi pattern of a lawful citizen. The other universally known example is former President Nelson Mandela, who in 1962 was convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the State and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial. But political opponents are not the sole target of a penal policy aimed at long-term incarceration of those considered as \u201chighly dangerous to society\u201d. History has also taught that many other social groups, like members of racial, ethnical and religious minorities have felt particularly severely the detrimental effects of punitive policies centred on life-long imprisonment. The over-representation of these groups in the prison population serving life sentences is a clear sign of a disproportionate State reaction to crime. And this temptation is not the monopoly of totalitarian regimes. Democracies have also been mesmerised by the populist rhetoric of life sentence as the only effective means of the fight against the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d .",

Under the assumption that the offence is so heinous that it can never be atoned for, the only way to punish the offender is to deprive him or her of liberty for the rest of his or her natural life. The heinousness of the crime calls for life-long retribution. The community indulges its thirst for revenge by imposing a sentence on a par with or worse than death itself. The state declines any interest in human life other than the prisoner\u2019s strict bodily survival. Being seen as a \u201cbeast\u201d, a \u201cpredator\u201d or a \u201cmonster\u201d who should \u201crot in jail\u201d, the prisoner is compared, subliminally and sometimes even explicitly, to an animal, a being \u201cunfit for or beyond rehabilitation\u201d. Infinity is not enough jail time for him or her. The impulse to impose life imprisonment converges, in its blind retributivism, with the impulse to impose the death penalty. To put it bluntly, the life prisoner suffers \u201ccivil death\u201d. Life imprisonment is justified in the \u201cdelayed death penalty\u201d logic, thus reducing the prisoner to a mere object of the executive\u2019s power.",

Neither the \u201cexceptionally high dangerousness\u201d of the offender nor the \u201cheinousness of the crime\u201d provides a legitimate ground for life imprisonment. Any State interference with liberty must be limited by the principles of proportionality and necessity, of which the principle of the least intrusive interference is one of the corollaries. Prison is, precisely, the ultima ratio state instrument of interference with the liberty of citizens. It must be used when no other state measure is adequate, to the least extension possible both in its length and severity, and in proportion to the gravity of the actus reus and the mens rea. The gravity of the offender\u2019s objective conduct and the degree of his personal culpability are the absolute limits of proportionate sentencing, and the calibration of any penalty must match these limits. If this moderate form of retributivism is still commensurate with a democratic society, life imprisonment is not, since it is an unrestrained, unnecessary and disproportionate State reaction to crime. The conclusion is not different in the case of a reducible life sentence, in so far as the sentence service only terminates on his or her death, and he or she may be recalled to prison many decades after release.",

A categorical rule against life imprisonment is demanded by the universal acknowledgement of the principle of resocialisation of offenders sentenced to prison and the emerging consensus on the prohibition of life imprisonment. This rule would not only avoid the proven pernicious consequences of life imprisonment, but would also constrain states to take seriously their international obligation to enable prisoners to serve their prison sentence in a constructive, rehabilitative manner, and accordingly to guarantee the necessary financial and human resources for doing so. Such categorical rule, while reflecting the inherent human dignity of every human being and the \u201cevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\u201d, would affirm the moral superiority of a democratic society over those offenders who do not respect its basic tenets, precisely when such moral superiority is most needed, i.e. when faced with the most vicious acts that humans are capable of. As Justice Stevens put it in his concurring opinion in Graham, \u201cpunishments that did not seem cruel and unusual at one time may, in the light of reason and experience, be found cruel and unusual at a later time\u201d.

In other words, the Convention guarantees a right to parole, including for those convicted of the most serious crimes. This means that prisoners have a vested and enforceable right to be paroled if and when the legal requisites of parole are present, not that all prisoners should necessarily be granted parole. Moreover, parole is not a release from the sentence, but a modification of the form of state interference with the sentenced person\u2019s liberty, by way of supervision of his or her life at large. And this supervision may take a very stringent form, with strict conditions attached, according to the needs of each paroled person.",

While the Contracting Parties to the Convention do have some discretion in regulating the parole mechanism, their margin of appreciation must remain under the Court\u2019s supervision. Otherwise, unrestrained discretion could provide a practical way of nullifying their international obligation to guarantee the possibility of parole. There are thus three basic requirements for effective protection of the prisoner\u2019s right to parole under the Convention. First of all, the parole mechanism must be placed under the authority of a court or at least under full judicial review both of the factual and the legal elements of the decision. Any parole mechanism that gives a governmental or administrative authority the last word on the review of the sentence would put the liberty of the prisoner in the hands of the executive and devoid the judiciary of its ultimate responsibility, thus entrusting judicial powers to the executive and breaching the principle of separation of powers. That would fly in the face of a democratic system where deprivation of liberty is the most important task of judges, not the executive. Hence, a review by a minister or any subordinate official of the administration is not sufficiently independent to comply with both universal and European human rights standards. Moreover, decisions to keep prisoners in or recall them to prison must be taken with all procedural guarantees, including affording prisoners the right to an oral hearing and to adequate access to their files.",

The legal regime for sentence reducibility must be in place at the time of imposing the prison sentence. Where the law does not establish a \u201cminimum term\u201d (or tariff) of service of the penalty before parole is considered, the trial court is required to set it, but this period must not be so long as to be tantamount to a de facto bar on the review of the prisoner\u2019s sentence during his or her natural life. Neither the law nor the courts may establish a minimum term to be served such as to turn the reducible sentence into a disguised form of irreducible life sentence, such as, for example, a whole or natural life tariff.

Thirdly, the criteria for assessing the appropriateness of parole must be established by law in a clear and foreseeable manner and be based primarily on special preventive considerations, and secondarily on general preventive considerations. Considerations of general prevention alone should not be used to justify refusal of parole or recall to prison. The criteria should not be limited to the prisoner\u2019s mental or physical infirmity or closeness to death. Such \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d are clearly too restrictive. That was the case with section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and the indeterminate sentence manual (\u201clifer manual\u201d). Recently, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that the Court did not prevent imposition of whole life orders for \u201cheinous crimes\u201d, since the law of England and Wales did provide for reducibility as the conditions set out in the lifer manual, although \u201cexceptional\u201d, were not too restrictive and indeed had a \u201cwide meaning that can be elucidated, as is the way the common law develops, on a case by case basis\u201d. In other words, the Court of Appeal held that the Grand Chamber was wrong in its interpretation of section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and the lifer manual. This opinion raises rather serious linguistic, logical and legal questions: what does \u201ccompassion\u201d have to do with \u201crisk assessment\u201d, the \u201cprospect of the offender\u2019s resocialisation\u201d or the \u201clack of continuing penological grounds for continued imprisonment\u201d? Is the \u201cwide meaning\u201d of compassionate grounds so wide that is has no connection with the plain meaning of the word \u201ccompassion\u201d? What can be more unpredictable than a discretionary legal provision to release in exceptional circumstances which is converted into an obligation to release with a \u201cwide meaning\u201d? What can be more unclear than \u201cexceptional grounds\u201d with a \u201cwide meaning\u201d? It is evident that the review mechanism provided for by section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and the lifer manual in the interpretation of the Court of Appeal is not \u201ca review which allows the domestic authorities to consider whether any changes in the life prisoner are so significant, and such progress towards rehabilitation has been made in the course of the sentence, as to mean that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds\u201d. The existence of a clear and predictable legal framework which enshrines the right to parole of all prisoners, including those who have committed the most \u201cheinous crimes\u201d, is an international obligation of member States, and compliance with international human rights law does not hinge on how shocking the factual circumstances of each case are. Hence, the Court of Appeal\u2019s final statement, namely \u201cour decision on each case turns on its specific facts and cannot be seen as a guide to any similar case\u201d, does not absolve the State from the international obligation to respect the Court\u2019s judgments. To think otherwise would have seismic repercussions. The Convention is not an \u00e0 la carte commitment, and the European system of protection human rights would collapse if it started to be understood that way. ",

The right of access to a lawyer must include the right to talk to him in private, although this should not prevent the replacement of a lawyer who acts criminally, participates in a criminal act or impedes the proper conduct of the proceedings. Similarly, the right of access to a lawyer should apply no matter how \u201cserious\u201d the offence of which the person detained is suspected. Indeed, persons suspected of particularly serious offences can be among those most at risk of ill-treatment, and therefore most in need of access to a lawyer. Consequently, the question whether restrictions on the right of access to a lawyer are justified should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, not determined by the category of offence involved. If lawyers are essential during the investigation and the trial of a case, they are even more so during the execution of the sentence. Access to lawyers is crucial in the phase of the service of the prison sentence, because they can provide independent supervision of the prison regime applied, the disciplinary sanctions imposed and the special measures of restraint and security adopted and the whole panoply of prohibitions, restrictions and obligations attached to the condition of an inmate, and when necessary act in order to reinstate the human rights of the prisoner.
