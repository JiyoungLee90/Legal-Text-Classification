Even though the Prison Administration in principle could also take action and adopt decisions falling within the sphere of public law, the Government has not submitted relevant domestic case-law examples in which in comparable factual circumstances decisions or actions of the Prison Administration have been scrutinised by administrative courts. The Court is thus unable to conclude that the actions and decisions closely related to the special powers vested with the Prison Administration in investigation of violence in prison would fall within the scope of the administrative rather than the criminal law. In the latter case the examination of complaints concerning such decisions would fall outside the jurisdiction of the administrative courts.",

Be this as it may, the Court considers that, even though the applicant\u2019s letter of 23 February 2006 was devoid of detailed description of the incident, the applicant\u2019s allegations were corroborated by the information on his collaboration with the police and his status in other criminal proceedings.
