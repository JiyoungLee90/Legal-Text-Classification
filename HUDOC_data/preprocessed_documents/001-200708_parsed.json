She then used her procedural status to regularly enquire about progress in the investigation, starting from an early stage of the proceedings. Thus, it cannot be said that she did not show an interest in having the relevant facts elucidated through a criminal investigation at the domestic level (contrast Akhvlediani and Others, cited above, \u00a7 25; Manukyan v. Georgia (dec.), no.\u00a053073/07, \u00a7 30, 9 October 2012; and Deari and Others v. \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d (dec.), no. 54415/09, \u00a7\u00a7 47-49, 6 March 2012). The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s claim that the sixmonth time-limit ought to be calculated from the prosecutorial decision of 1\u00a0February 2007. That decision was of a rather anodyne procedural nature, merely rejecting one of the applicant\u2019s procedural requests; it was not a decision on the final discontinuation of the proceedings; nor was it a decision denying the applicant the right to be meaningfully involved in the investigation or undermining the eventual effectiveness of the investigation by prejudging its outcome (contrast, for instance, Shavlokhova v.

Thus, they contested the applicant\u2019s claim that the AMV driver had breached the traffic regulations by speeding on the wrong side of the road, as no such factual findings had ever been finally reached by the domestic authorities. The negligent actions of a State official, even if he or she had been acting in the exercise of his or her official duties, could not suffice, as such, for bringing the respondent State\u2019s substantive liability into play. As regards the procedural limb of Article 2, the criminal investigation into the road accident had commenced promptly and the investigative authorities had undertaken an array of relevant investigative measures. The applicant had been sufficiently involved in the investigation, as the nextofkin of the victims of the accident, and the criteria for public scrutiny and transparency had thus been satisfied.

It reiterates in this connection that the exact circumstances surrounding the road traffic accident of 22 November 2003, in particular, the speed at which the AMV had been travelling, the side of the road on which it had crashed into the car driven by the applicant\u2019s son, and the question of whether or not A.M., the driver of the AMV, had fled the scene of the accident, were all in dispute between the parties (see paragraphs 8, 47 and 48 above). Without knowledge of such crucial facts, it is impossible to assess properly the applicant\u2019s claim that the respondent State should be held responsible for the alleged breach of the traffic regulations on account of either negligent or deliberate conduct on the part of the AMV driver, who was either a military or police officer at the material time (see paragraph 14 above; contrast Mikhno v. Ukraine, no.\u00a032514/12, \u00a7\u00a7 125 and 129, 1 September 2016, and Kotelnikov v. Russia, no. 45104/05, \u00a7\u00a7 93 and 94, 12 July 2016). Having regard to its subsidiary role, the Court must remain cautious when it is called upon to reconstruct the exact facts surrounding an accident which occurred sixteen years previously. It must bear in mind that the competent domestic authorities are better placed and equipped for such a fact-finding mission (compare, among many other  authorities, McShane, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0103, and Shanaghan v. the United Kingdom, no. 37715/97, \u00a7 95, 4 May 2001). Indeed, the situation at hand cannot be equated to a death in custody, where the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the State to provide a satisfactory and plausible explanation (see McShane, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0101 and 104), or to a death that occurred as a result of the State\u2019s failure to put in place an adequate regulatory framework for dangerous activities\u00a0(see Mikhno, cited above, \u00a7 126; Finogenov and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a018299/03 and 27311/03, \u00a7 209, ECHR 2011 (extracts); and \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2004\u2011XII). Neither has the applicant ever complained, nor is there any similar suggestion on the facts of the case, that the death of the applicant\u2019s next-of-kin was caused either by a framework deficiency or the State\u2019s failure to discharge \u201ca preventive operational measure\u201d (compare with Nicolae Virgiliu T\u0103nase v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 41720/13, \u00a7\u00a7 135 and 136, 25 June 2019). While it was a military vehicle that caused the fatal road traffic accident, it cannot be inferred from the facts that there might have been use of force by the AMV\u2019s driver for which State responsibility under Article 2 arises (contrast with McShane, cited above, \u00a7 101).",

In the case of a life-threatening injury or death, the above obligation calls for an effective independent judicial system to ensure enforcement of the aforementioned legislative framework by providing appropriate redress (see, for example, Anna Todorova v. Bulgaria, no. 23302/03, \u00a7 72, 24 May 2011). This obligation also applies in the context of designing a framework for the protection of life from road traffic accidents (see, for example, Al Fayed v.\u00a0France (dec.), no. 38501/02, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78, 27 September 2007; Rajkowska v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 37393/02, 27 November 2007; and Railean v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 23401/04, \u00a7 30, 5 January 2010). An effective judicial system, as required by Article 2, may \u2013 and under certain circumstances must \u2013 include recourse to the criminal law (see Cioban v. Romania (dec.), no. 18295/08, \u00a7\u00a025, 11 March 2014). Whilst States have the discretion to decide how a system for the implementation of a regulatory framework protecting the right to life must be designed and implemented, what is important is that whatever form the investigation takes, the available legal remedies, taken together, must amount to legal means capable of establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress (see Antonov v. Ukraine, no. 28096/04, \u00a7\u00a046, 3\u00a0November 2011).",

Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see \u0160ilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7\u00a0195, 9 April 2009). Thus, in a number of cases before the Court concerning the implementation of a domestic regulatory framework for the protection of life from road traffic accidents, the finding of a violation was largely based on the existence of unreasonable delays and a lack of diligence on the part of the authorities in conducting the proceedings, regardless of their final outcome (see Anna Todorova, cited above, \u00a7 76; Antonov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050-52; Igor Shevchenko v.

However, all of those positive steps taken in the early stages of the investigation were subsequently overshadowed by the overall length of the investigation and the prohibitive delays on the part of the investigative authorities. The road traffic accident and the death of the applicant\u2019s son and sister occurred on 22 November 2003, whereas the investigation ended on 1 March 2017, more than thirteen years later, without any final determination of the case on the merits. The exceptionally protracted investigation, which in itself raises serious concerns as to the domestic authorities\u2019 compliance with the requirements of promptness and reasonable expedition (see, for instance, Star\u010devi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 80909/12, \u00a7 58, 13 November 2014), was further exacerbated by several lengthy periods of total inactivity on the part of the investigative authorities (see paragraphs 21-23 and 28-34 above and compare, for instance, Prynda, cited above, \u00a7 56; Zubkova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041; and Dvo\u0159\u00e1\u010dek and Dvo\u0159\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 v. Slovakia, no. 30754/04, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 69, 28 July 2009). On various occasions the domestic authorities themselves acknowledged that the investigators had acted without due diligence when collecting evidence (see paragraphs 27-29 above, and compare, for instance, Antonov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 51, and Oleynikova v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a038765/05, \u00a7 81, 15 December 2011).",

In particular, while the person who had been driving the AMV had been identified, the witnesses were heard and the relevant forensic examinations conducted repeatedly in the very early stages, the authorities failed to reach any conclusion in the criminal proceedings. The Government did not even argue that a lengthy investigation had been justified by the necessity to perform numerous vital procedural measures, by the applicant\u2019s behaviour, or for other relevant reasons (compare, for instance, Igor Shevchenko, \u00a7 60, and Sergiyenko, \u00a7\u00a052, both cited above, and contrast with Nicolae Virgiliu T\u0103nase, also cited above, \u00a7\u00a0184). In this connection, the Court reiterates that justice delayed is often justice denied, as the existence of unreasonable periods of inactivity and a lack of diligence on the authorities\u2019 part in conducting the proceedings renders the investigation ineffective irrespective of its final outcome (see, as a recent authority, Vazagashvili and Shanava v. Georgia, no. 50375/07, \u00a7\u00a089, 18 July 2019, with further references). The Court further observes that, as a result of the accumulated delays, the investigative authorities\u2019 allowed the criminal proceedings to stagnate for more than ten years, which resulted in the expiry of the relevant statute of limitations and the consequent discontinuation of the proceedings without establishing the criminal responsibility of the AMV driver (compare Ma\u017eukna v. Lithuania, no.\u00a072092/12, \u00a7 83, 11 April 2017, and Angelova and Iliev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a055523/00, \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 116, 26 July 2007). Such a lack of due diligence, which in the eyes of the Court looks like a deliberate delay, was the sole cause of the proceedings becoming time-barred. This is yet another indication of the fact that the criminal-law system has proved to be far from rigorous and deprived the applicant of any possibility of obtaining redress (compare, mutatis mutandis, V.K. v. Russia, no. 68059/13, \u00a7 185, 7\u00a0March 2017; Kraulaidis v. Lithuania, no. 76805/11, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 63, 8\u00a0November 2016; and \u0130zci v. Turkey, no. 42606/05, \u00a7 72, 23 July 2013). It is exactly because of the ineffectiveness of the domestic investigation that the Court has been prevented to rule on the responsibility of the respondent State under the substantive limb of Article 2 of the Convention (see paragraphs\u00a049 and 50 above).",
