The Special Rapporteur has addressed the issue of solitary confinement and stated that its imposition, of any duration, on persons with mental disabilities is cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment (A/66/268, paras. 67-68, 78). Moreover, any restraint on people with mental disabilities for even a short period of time may constitute torture and ill-treatment. It is essential that an absolute ban on all coercive and non-consensual measures, including restraint and solitary confinement of people with psychological or intellectual disabilities, should apply in all places of deprivation of liberty, including in psychiatric and social care institutions. The environment of patient powerlessness and abusive treatment of persons with disabilities in which restraint and seclusion is used can lead to other non-consensual treatment, such as forced medication and electroshock procedures.",

Both this mandate and United Nations treaty bodies have established that involuntary treatment and other psychiatric interventions in health-care facilities are forms of torture and ill-treatment. Forced interventions, often wrongfully justified by theories of incapacity and therapeutic necessity inconsistent with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, are legitimized under national laws, and may enjoy wide public support as being in the alleged \u2018best interest\u2019 of the person concerned. Nevertheless, to the extent that they inflict severe pain and suffering, they violate the absolute prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment (A/63/175, paras. 38, 40, 41). Concern for the autonomy and dignity of persons with disabilities leads the Special Rapporteur to urge revision of domestic legislation allowing for forced interventions.",

Each of those bodies was competent, and indeed obliged, to investigate allegations contained in the individual complaints. The way in which complaints were followed up thereafter depended on the specific competencies of the bodies at issue. Accordingly, the Local Boards and the State Board for the Protection of Patients\u2019 Rights were obliged to inform the health inspectorate of the Ministry of Health of any irregularity they had found and the health inspectorate was obliged to respond within a period of thirty days. If the State Board for the Protection of Individuals with Mental Disorders was the body reporting an irregularity to the health inspectorate, the latter was also obliged to reply stating the appropriate measures it had taken. In any event, all of those bodies were obliged to inform the competent criminal justice authorities in the event of a suspicion that a criminal offence had been committed, and all were obliged to inform the complainant of their actions.",

After she had been restrained, she had asked the hospital staff several times to unleash the belts because she had serious back pain from which she had been suffering for a number of years and with which she had already been diagnosed. When they refused to do so, she had asked that at least her legs be untied, but the hospital staff had also refused to do that. That meant that she had had to endure the restraint in a painful position because of her back-pain problems, and it had lasted throughout the night. Later, she had learned that it had been the usual practice of the hospital to use measures of physical restraint against all those who had not consented to admission.

She had therefore been examined by a psychiatrist, who had found that she had been suffering from severe mental disorders. During the examination the applicant had made fanciful allegations, had been psychotic, agitated, upset, unpredictable and aggressive. She had refused medical treatment, and had also threatened and resisted. Thus the psychiatrist, out of fear that the applicant might harm herself or others, had ordered her immediate hospitalisation. Later on, as her behaviour had deteriorated and she had been screaming and kicking, in order to prevent her from causing any possible accidental injury to herself or any of the medical staff as a result of her unpredictable behaviour, the doctors had found that there were medical indications for the use of a measure of physical restraint. In particular, the applicant had been given antipsychotic treatment and placed in an isolation room, where she had been fastened to a bed with four belts especially designed to prevent any injury. In the isolation room, the applicant had been given food and water and the possibility to use a toilet.",

It had only indicated what safeguards needed to be respected (see paragraph 54 above) and those had been duly complied with in the applicant\u2019s case.

It notes, however, that the developments in contemporary legal standards on seclusion and other forms of coercive and non-consensual measures against patients with psychological or intellectual disabilities in hospitals and all other places of deprivation of liberty require that such measures be employed as a matter of last resort and when their application is the only means available to prevent immediate or imminent harm to the patient or others (see paragraph 36 above, section 54 of the Protection of Individuals with Mental Disorders Act; paragraph 49 above, the report of the Special Rapporteur on Torture of 1 February 2013; paragraph 52 above, Article 27 Rec(2004)10; paragraph 54 above; and Bure\u0161, cited above, \u00a7 95).",

In addition, according to the \u201cgenerally recognised principles of international law\u201d, there may be special circumstances which absolve the applicant from the obligation to exhaust the domestic remedies at his disposal (see Van Oosterwijck v.

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see M.S. v. Croatia, no. 36337/10, \u00a7\u00a063, 25 April 2013). This means, among other things, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see Selmouni v.

This would also be essential if the evidence presented to justify the confinement were to be adequately examined in accordance with the adversarial nature of the proceedings. The case favouring such an extreme measure as a deprivation of liberty should be tested for its adversarial quality as effectively as possible for people with, and without, mental disabilities. However, persons with disabilities required reasonable accommodation and support when instructing their representatives in connection with proceedings in respect of deprivation of their liberty, in accordance with Article 13 of the CRPD. This almost always required that the representative meet in person those whom they were representing in order to facilitate effective communication, to support the person\u2019s understanding of their rights and to ensure that the representative understood the person\u2019s will and preferences when representing him or her.
