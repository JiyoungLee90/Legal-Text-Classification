No evidence was found to support the applicant\u2019s allegation that two of the other inmates, Mr D. and an unidentified individual, had joined Mr Y. in beating him up. The applicant also submitted that the ITT governor, Mr F., had ordered the blood and other traces of the assault to be cleaned up immediately after the incident and that he had instructed everybody to say that the applicant had accidentally fallen from the upper bunk. Furthermore, the applicant stated that he had been taken back to cell no. 10 in the evening of 27 April 2004, while awaiting transfer to hospital, and that Mr Y. had intimidated him in order to make him say that he had injured himself by accident. The applicant also claimed that Mr D. had later been put in the same hospital ward, where he had continued to threaten the applicant, and had been present during all his interviews. Most of the inmates claimed that the applicant had provoked Mr Y. into a fight by being noisy and aggressive. One of the ITT staff confirmed the applicant\u2019s story that the ITT governor had ordered the blood stains in cell no. 10 to be cleaned up and that the applicant had been taken back to the same cell before his transfer to hospital. This staff member had been reprimanded for having placed the applicant in the same cell as convicted criminals. However, according to his statement, it had been impossible to ensure compliance with the legal requirement concerning the isolation of detainees, because the ITT had been housing double its capacity of inmates. A woman who had been detained in the ITT at the same time as the applicant confirmed that she had cleaned up the blood in the cell, the corridor and in the investigation room following an order from the authorities. In his statement, Mr D. denied having beaten the applicant, but confirmed having been hospitalised with him in the same ward. Two detainees submitted that after the applicant had been removed from the cell following the incident the cell door had remained open for a couple of minutes and they had seen the ITT governor and some other officers hitting the applicant several times.

The Court is not convinced by this explanation. As suggested by the facts of the case (namely, the applicant\u2019s admission to the hospital late in the evening on 27 April 2004 and the fact that he was handcuffed on that very date), the applicant was restrained from the very outset of his stay there and not following any attempt to escape.

The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s sick-leave certificate stating his inability to work and thus his inability to participate in the investigation was not considered. As to threats he had supposedly made to the victim, their existence appeared to be based solely on the latter\u2019s statement, the court decision not having been supported by any evidence in that regard.
