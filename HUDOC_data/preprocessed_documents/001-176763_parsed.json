As a result, prior to his questioning by the police, the applicant made incriminating statements in circumstances where he had not been allowed access to a lawyer and informed of his basic rights. The fact that the reconstruction of events became an accepted practice by the domestic courts does not remedy the absence of the minimum safeguards required for a waiver to be valid for the purposes of a fair trial under Article\u00a06. The Government did not comment on these points. The Court considers that those facts considerably weaken the value of the pre-printed phrase \u201cNo lawyer sought\u201d in demonstrating the unequivocal character of the waiver by the applicant of a right guaranteed by the Article 6 of the Convention (see Sava\u015f v.
