However, the report issued the very next day by the K\u0131rklareli Forensic Medicine Institute upon the applicant\u2019s request noted a number of injuries on his body, particularly on his arms, torso and left foot (see paragraph 20 above). The Court observes that the findings in this report appear to corroborate the applicant\u2019s allegations, both as regards the sequence of events that occurred on the relevant day and the particular treatment he had been subjected to by members of the  gendarmerie. The Court notes on the other hand that the Government failed to provide an explanation for these injuries, which were undoubtedly sustained by the applicant while under the absolute control of the State authorities. Considering the circumstances of the case as a whole, and the absence of a plausible explanation from the Government, the Court finds that the Government bear responsibility for the injuries sustained by the applicant.",

Turkey, no. 30951/96, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, 22\u00a0March 2005). The minimum standards as to effectiveness defined by the Court\u2019s case-law include the requirements that the investigation be independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny, and that the competent authorities act with exemplary diligence and promptness (see, for example, \u00c7elik and \u0130mret v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a044093/98, \u00a7 55, 26 October 2004). Moreover, when the official investigation has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirements of the prohibition of ill-treatment. While there is no absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction or in a particular sentence, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow grave attacks on physical and moral integrity to go unpunished (see Okkal\u0131 v. Turkey, no. 52067/99, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2006XII (extracts)). The Court further reiterates that where a State agent has been charged with crimes involving torture or illtreatment, it is of the utmost importance that he or she be suspended from duty during the investigation and trial, and should be dismissed if convicted (see Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 32446/96, \u00a7 55, 2\u00a0November 2004).",

However, on 14 June 2007, he issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction and referred the matter to the Ey\u00fcp Public Prosecutor. It was not until seven months later that the Ey\u00fcp Public Prosecutor questioned N.T., who was the gendarme sergeant in charge of the applicant\u2019s transfer. According to the information in the case file, none of the other gendarmes who were allegedly involved in the incidents was identified by the public prosecutor, let alone questioned as a suspect or even as a witness. Moreover, following N.T.\u2019s questioning, it took one year and one month to file a bill of indictment with the Ey\u00fcp Magistrates\u2019 Court against N.T. In the absence of any information provided by the Government as to any investigative steps taken by the public prosecutor in the meantime or, in the alternative, to any obstacles that held the investigation back, the Court cannot but assume that the public prosecutor remained passive throughout this period. The Court further notes that although the firstinstance court reviewed and admitted the bill of indictment on 2 March 2009, it ordered the first hearing to be held eight months later, that is, on 10 November 2009, a delay which similarly remains unjustified. According to the information in the case file, the proceedings are still pending before the first-instance court. There is, moreover, no indication in the case file to demonstrate that the accused gendarme sergeant was suspended from duty during the investigation and trial or that any disciplinary proceedings were taken against him or other gendarme soldiers allegedly involved in the incident.",
