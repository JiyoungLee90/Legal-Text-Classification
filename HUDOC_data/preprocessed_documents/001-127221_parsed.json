The panel further noted that he had initially been willing to serve in the army and had had no prior psychiatric problems. However, during military service his health had gradually deteriorated. The applicant had been characterised by his fellow servicemen as unsociable, slow, untidy, short-tempered and suicidal. During his conversation with the doctors he appeared sad and emotionally fragile, sometimes tearful. The panel diagnosed him with moderate neuroticism expressed over a protracted period of time following situational triggers. It stated that his illness was related to his military service. The panel reached the conclusion that the applicant was not fit for further military service in peacetime and partially fit for service in wartime. He was also found to require a carer.",

The State has a primary duty to put in place rules geared to the level of risk to life or limb that may result not only from the nature of military activities and operations, but also from the human element that comes into play when a State decides to call up ordinary citizens to perform military service. Such rules must require the adoption of practical measures aimed at the effective protection of conscripts against the dangers inherent in military life and appropriate procedures for identifying shortcomings and errors liable to be committed in that regard by those in charge at different levels (see K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7 and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 40145/98, \u00a7 41, 7 June 2005, and Kayankin v.
