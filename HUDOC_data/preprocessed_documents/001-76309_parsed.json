The Court examined the implementation of the compensation law in a \u201ctest case\u201d (see \u0130\u00e7yer v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no. 18888/02, 12 January 2006), and ruled that the Government could be deemed to have fulfilled their duty to review the systemic situation at issue and to introduce an effective remedy (ibid., \u00a7 86). Accordingly, it found that the applicants should be required by Article 35 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention to apply to the relevant compensation commissions under the Law of 27 July 2004 and to claim compensation for the damage they had sustained as a result of their inability to gain access to their possessions.
