The majority cite this case-law (see paragraphs 61 et seq. of the judgment), but, in our view, they omit to establish the relevant principles for determining the scope of application of Article 8.",

With regard to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, for example, the Grand Chamber stressed in the case of Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom that \u201cArticle 5 should not, in principle, be interpreted in such a way as to incorporate the requirements of Protocol No. 4 in respect of States which have not ratified it, including the United Kingdom\u201d (see Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a039692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09, \u00a7 55, ECHR\u00a02012). Prior to that, the Court had already applied the same reasoning in relation to Protocol No. 12, and also in reiterating that Article 14 did not independently impose a blanket prohibition on all discrimination (see Sahin v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a030943/96, \u00a7 85, ECHR\u00a02003VIII), and again in the context of the guarantees of Article 1 of Protocol No. 7, finding that Article 6 did not apply to expulsion proceedings (see Maaouia, cited above, \u00a7 36).",

To put it another way, full account must be taken of the fact that Switzerland has not ratified Protocol No. 1.",

This close link resulted in particular from the aim of the allowance in question, in so far as it was designed in those cases to facilitate family life or contribute to it. Applying this more stringent criterion in the present case leads us to the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s complaint is not covered by the \u201cfamily life\u201d aspect of Article 8. As is clear from the Government\u2019s observations (see paragraph 54 of the judgment) and from the case-law of the Federal Court (... ATF 137 V\u00a0334, point 6.1.2 of the reasoning), the disability insurance scheme in issue is not aimed at organising family life. Rather, it is aimed at compensating for the permanent financial impact of disability. We are therefore not convinced by the Court\u2019s reasoning in paragraph 62.",

Although they refer to the relevant case-law (see paragraph 63 of the judgment), the majority do not explain how the combined method would affect the applicant\u2019s personal development or personal autonomy. The Government rightly point out that the method for calculating the benefit should not be a factor in the hypothetical choice of the number of hours worked. In the instant case there was nothing to prevent the applicant from stating that she would have liked to work 100%, 80% or even not at all after the birth of her daughters. In all those cases the applicant would have received a disability benefit under the combined method. That, too, is what distinguishes this case from the case of Schuler-Zgraggen.",
