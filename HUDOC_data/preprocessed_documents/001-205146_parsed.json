The court further held that under domestic law a hospital ought to have had a court order in order to disclose patients\u2019 medical data. However, the fact that the applicants\u2019 names had been redacted had rendered that requirement moot in the instant case. Relying on section 5 of the Police Act (see paragraph 17 below), the court held that the police had also acted lawfully when they had processed private and medical data. This judgment was confirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeal with a judgment of 19 April 2013 served on the applicants\u2019 representative on 17 June 2013.

Lastly, the DPA, the administrative and civil courts accepted that the lists contained medical data and, accordingly, personal data within the meaning of the Personal Data Protection Act (see paragraphs\u00a013, 14 and 16 above).

These lists were seized by the police and later returned to the hospital (see paragraph 10 above). That the police were also given access to patient files finds support in the findings of the DPA and the civil courts (see paragraphs 7, 13 and 16 above).
