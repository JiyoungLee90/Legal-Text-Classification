The Court observes that the first-instance court\u2019s judgment does not contain any information as to the reasons for which the applicant was found guilty of disseminating propaganda in support of the PKK. Besides, there is nothing in the case file showing that the applicant had been involved in violent acts or incited or had the intention of inciting others to violence during the public gathering in question. She was not involved in the clashes between the demonstrators and the police. Nor did she chant any slogans or carry banners containing expressions which might be construed as encouraging violence, armed resistance or an uprising or capable of inciting to violence.
