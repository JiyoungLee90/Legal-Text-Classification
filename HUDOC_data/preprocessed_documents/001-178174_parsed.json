On the contrary, the President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature asked very few questions, and they were solely for the purpose of clarification; special reference will be made to some of those questions at the appropriate stage. Not a single question was put to Mr Kamenos. The Supreme Council of Judicature was not seeking to pursue a procedure of prosecution against Mr Kamenos in the form of a confrontation between prosecution and defence. For that reason, and despite having such powers under Rule 16, the relevant provision of the Constitution on the judicial process and the procedure to be followed in investigating disciplinary cases, it did not assign the duties of prosecutor to the judge-investigator or to any other judicial official. In that way, which was the declared intention of the Supreme Council of Judicature, more rights were secured for Mr Kamenos than those which he had under the aforementioned Articles of the Constitution and the Rule.

It is unfounded for the reasons which we explained above, and unjustifiable because it conflicts with what the lawyer said to us at the beginning of the proceedings, when he ... spoke in praise of the powers invested by the Constitution in the Supreme Council of Judicature, describing its work as difficult and important [in those instances] when it is called upon to decide whether a judge displayed misconduct and is obliged, again in accordance with the Constitution, to terminate the latter\u2019s services in the event of conviction.

He did not himself take the initiative of collecting evidence in view of the accusation, as he explains in his report. The persons who signed the accusation did not have any personal knowledge of the circumstances and statements were taken from all those they ... named, and from others subsequently named by those who had been initially summoned. The investigation into the manner in which Mr Kamenos exercised his duties in general was therefore not systematic and that is also the reason for not taking statements from a number of other persons whom Mr Kamenos himself indicated. Besides, as we have seen, of the 28 statements which the Investigating Office took, only 15 were attached to the charge sheet, with a further reduction to 10 in the course of the hearing. They did not include statements which, as the Investigating Officer reported, not only expressed no complaints but stated that Mr Kamenos\u2019s conduct had been irreproachable in all respects. Consequently, as is in any case self-evident, the object of the hearing is [to determine] whether, on the basis of the evidence of those ten witnesses, the charge has been substantiated as formulated. That is to say, whether, from each individual\u2019s evidence and the correlation between them, to the extent possible, there arises conduct as cumulatively stated on the charge sheet, [and] in the case of the second charge \u201cwith the result that, owing to the agitation and disruption they were caused, the entire proceedings were diverted from their proper course\u201d. This (was the wording), without any specification on the charge sheet of a definite, specific incident at a specific time, ... in relation to a specific person in the context of a specific case. The witnesses who remained on the charge sheet (whose statements I shall of course return to), as lay members of the court, or as lawyers or witnesses, did not submit a complaint there and then about what they considered to be objectionable conduct. ... Nor did the litigants in any specific case which could be related to the charge sheet make a complaint at the time, or appeal or employ any other legal means so that any objectionable conduct would be examined also from the aspect of its effect on the final outcome. That was what occurred in the cases of Athanasiou\u00a0v.\u00a0Reana Manuf. & Trade Co.Ltd and others (2001) 1 C.L.R. 1635, and Fanos N. Epiphaniou Ltd v. Melarta and others (2002) 1 C.L.R.654, in which the Supreme Court annulled decisions issued by the Industrial Disputes Tribunal under the presidency of Mr\u00a0Kamenos, using strong language about the degree of his intervention in the proceedings and the appearance of partiality to which it could give rise. Of course, the charge sheet does not extend to those cases and does not concern the issue of interventions as such ... The core of the charge is the conduct attributed to Mr\u00a0Kamenos at the expense of lay members of the court, lawyers, litigants and witnesses, and it is in the light of such considerations that I shall go on to examine the evidence adduced.\u201d",

The Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) (\u201cLaw no. 33/1964\u201d) was enacted in order to address an emergency situation and to set up the necessary judicial machinery for the continued administration of justice.

The Supreme Court sat as a full bench (that is, all thirteen judges; see paragraph 35 above). The complainant requested that the Supreme Court re-examine and/or revise its judgment in Kourris (see paragraph 43 above) and that his case be heard by a different bench, arguing that the thirteen judges in question had themselves written the impugned decision, which they had taken in their capacity as members of the SCJ. On 15 March 2001 the Supreme Court dismissed the recourse for want of jurisdiction without addressing the issue of impartiality. It ruled that the Constitution entrusted the appointment of judicial officers exclusively to the SCJ (Article 157 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution). Judicial appointments were closely, even inextricably, interwoven with the exercise of the judicial function; more precisely, they constituted a precondition for the exercise of that function. Entrusting the appointment of judicial officers to the judicial function itself was an aspect of the independence of the judiciary and an expression of the autonomy of that function. Law no. 33/64 had been based on that premise and reflected the constitutional order. The complainant then filed a communication with the United Nations Human Rights Committee (OP-ICCPR), which was declared inadmissible on 25 July 2005 (communication no. 1182/2003; decision on admissibility UN. Doc.\u00a0CCPR/C/84D/1182/2003)).",

The offence of misconduct is a disciplinary offence and is limited and linked to the exercise of judicial functions. It does not belong to the criminal sphere. Furthermore, the penalty for misconduct under the Rules is dismissal (Article 153 \u00a7 7 (4) of the Constitution and Rule 27; see paragraphs 39 and 41 above). Following the SCJ\u2019s finding on 19 September 2006 that misconduct had been proved, the applicant was removed as President of his court and, simultaneously, dismissed from his post as a judge.

They submitted that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had not constituted a determination of his civil rights and obligations within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. First, no \u201cright\u201d had existed in the present case: there had been no right to remain as a judge or as President of the IDC and there had been no right not to be dismissed from his post. The applicant did not have arguable grounds on which to claim such a right. Secondly, even if such a right was deemed to exist, it was not \u201ccivil\u201d in nature as the two conditions established in the case of Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, \u00a7 62, ECHR\u00a02007II) had been fulfilled. As to the first condition, the Government observed that the applicant had not had a right of access to a court in order to challenge his removal. Although neither the Constitution nor the applicable procedural rules concerning the exercise of the SCJ\u2019s disciplinary authority expressly excluded access to a court in order to challenge the removal of a judge from his post, the Supreme Court had expressly ruled in the cases of Kourris and Karatsis (cited above) that the acts, decisions or omissions of the SCJ could not be challenged by way of a recourse under Article 146 of the Constitution (see paragraphs 43 and 44 above). The applicant had therefore not had access to a court in order to challenge his dismissal.",

A judge participated directly in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and performed duties designed to safeguard the general interest of the State (relying on Serdal Apay v. Turkey (dec.), no. 3964/05, 11 December 2007; Muammer Yilmazo\u01e7lu v. Turkey (dec.), no. 36593/97, 12 June 2003 and Pitkevich v. Russia (dec.), no. 47936, 8 February 2001). The exclusion from access to court by domestic law was justified on objective grounds and in the State\u2019s interests. In the Karatsis case the Supreme Court had highlighted that judicial appointments were inextricably interwoven with the exercise of the judicial function and, more precisely, constituted a precondition for the exercise of that function. Entrusting the appointment of judicial officers to the judicial function itself constituted an aspect of the independence of the judiciary and was an expression of the autonomy of its function (see paragraph 44 above). In the present case, the applicant, as a judge at the IDC, and even more so as its president, had occupied a post of the highest rank in the field of the administration of justice. He had had powers conferred by public law and had assumed duties to safeguard the general interests of the State. The applicant\u2019s misconduct had eroded public confidence in the integrity and independence of the judicial function as a whole. As stated by the SCJ in its decision in the present case, the purpose of the procedure had not been to punish the applicant, but rather to protect the public by adopting a strict standard of judicial conduct so as to preserve the public\u2019s trust in the integrity, reputation and independence of the judicial system (see paragraph 31 above). Preventing the applicant from having access to a court had therefore been justified on objective grounds and the subject matter of the dispute had been related to the exercise of State power.",

Any publiclaw features of a disciplinary nature in the case did not exclude the proceedings from the scope of Article 6 since their outcome had been severe and far-reaching: the applicant had been dismissed from his post, affecting his career and professional activities. The fact that Articles 12 \u00a7 5 and 30 of the Constitution, which contained equivalent guarantees to Article 6 of the Convention, had been applicable to the disciplinary proceedings were indicative of the civil nature of the right at stake.",

In order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant\u2019s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. First, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, a \u201cspecial bond of trust and loyalty\u201d between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 102-103). Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article\u00a06 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question (ibid., \u00a7 103). There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (ibid., \u00a7 103).",

So in Saghatelyan v. Armenia (no. 7984/06, \u00a7\u00a7 32-35, 20 October 2015), in which the applicant had been dismissed as a judge on the basis of a presidential decree following a recommendation by the Council of Justice, the Court considered that the first condition of the test had not been satisfied. It observed in that regard, first, that the Government had not mentioned a particular provision of the law which expressly excluded judicial protection in connection with disciplinary proceedings against judges and, second, that although at the material time it had not been possible to challenge a presidential decree, as this applied to all individuals, national law did not rule out access to court for the applicant based on her status as a holder of public power. In Harabin\u00a0v.\u00a0Slovakia (no. 58688/11, 20 November 2012), disciplinary proceedings were brought against the applicant, who was the President of the Supreme Court, before the Constitutional Court. It found him guilty of a serious disciplinary offence and imposed a disciplinary sanction (\u00a7\u00a7 36-37). The decision was final, there being no remedy against the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions (\u00a7 54). In applying the Eskelinen test, the Court observed that the Constitutional Court was a tribunal with powers to determine the relevant issues. National law therefore did not exclude a judicial examination of the relevant points and the applicant had actually had access to a court (\u00a7 123). The Court thus took the approach that even though the disciplinary proceedings brought against the applicant were only examined at one level of jurisdiction, that qualified as \u201caccess to court\u201d for the purposes of the first condition of the Eskelinen test.",

The Court highlighted that in the context of the first condition, it was not prevented from categorising a particular domestic body, outside the domestic judiciary, as a \u201ccourt\u201d for the purposes of the Eskelinen test. In that connection, it reiterated that for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention a tribunal need not be a court of law integrated with the standard judicial machinery since a tribunal, within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1, was characterised in the substantive sense of the term by its judicial function, that is to say, the determining of matters within its competence on the basis of rules of law and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner. Consequently, a non-judicial body, for example an administrative or parliamentary body, may qualify as a \u201ccourt\u201d in the substantive sense of the term if it performed judicial functions (see also Savino and Others v.

It noted that the proceedings before the National Judicial Council followed the rules of criminal procedure, which included, inter alia, all the guarantees provided by Article 6 of the Convention and enabled the accused to submit a defence. When ruling in disciplinary proceedings against judges, the National Judicial Council was empowered to establish the facts of a given case, hold hearings, hear witnesses and assess other evidence and decide on all the questions of fact and law. It therefore concluded that in that case the National Judicial Council had exercised judicial powers in determining the applicant\u2019s disciplinary responsibility and thus that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had been conducted before a tribunal for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

In that regard, it observed that the High Council of Justice had determined all the questions of fact and law after holding a hearing and assessing the evidence, the Parliamentary Committee had been empowered to hold its own deliberations and conduct additional inquiries, if deemed necessary, which could end with a recommendation to dismiss or retain the judge and that the plenary of Parliament had subsequently approved dismissing the applicant based on the HCJ\u2019s submissions and the Parliamentary Committee\u2019s recommendation.",

Georgia (no. 45729/05, \u00a7 27, 28 March 2017), a disciplinary charge against the applicant had been examined by the Disciplinary Council of Judges at first instance as a four-member panel and on appeal sitting as a plenary. The decisions were then reviewed by the Supreme Court of Georgia. The Court observed that the disciplinary bodies that had conducted the proceedings had clearly performed a judicial function and that the Disciplinary Council of Judges clearly represented \u201ca tribunal\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In Di\u00a0Giovanni v. Italy (no. 51160/06, \u00a7 37, 9 July 2013) the Court observed that the first-instance body \u2013 the disciplinary section of the Supreme Judicial Council \u2013 had full jurisdiction to examine all the questions raised in the case. The fact that the decision could be appealed against before the Court of Cassation (Sezioni Unite) was an additional factor. Similarly, in several recent judgments against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Court observed in the context of the first condition that the first-instance disciplinary body, the State Judicial Council, determined all questions of facts and law after holding hearings and assessing evidence (Poposki and Duma v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos.\u00a069916/10 and 36531/11, \u00a7 37, 7 January 2016; Gerovska Pop\u010devska v.\u00a0the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 48783/07, \u00a7 58, 7\u00a0January 2016; Jak\u0161ovski and Trifunovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 56381/09 and 58738/09, \u00a7 32, 7 January 2016; and Mitrinovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 6899/12, \u00a7\u00a029, 30 April 2015).",

The applicant did not have a right of access to a court to challenge that decision. Neither the national law nor the Constitution provide for a right of access to a court in cases concerning the dismissal of judges. On the contrary, constitutional provisions exclude judicial review in a general, abstract and foreseeable manner, by stating that the decision of the SCJ is final and binding. The case-law expressly states that the decisions of the SCJ cannot be challenged by means of a recourse under Article 146 of the Constitution.",

Judges are entrusted with specific responsibilities in the administration of justice. The applicant held the office of President of the Industrial Disputes Court and exercised judicial powers. He participated directly in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interest of the State and other authorities. Public confidence in the judiciary is of paramount importance and should be preserved. The applicant\u2019s misconduct has diminished this trust and confidence.
