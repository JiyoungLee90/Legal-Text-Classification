The applicant company also alleged that, in any event, the protected appellation of origin \u201cCeskebudejovicky Budvar\u201d did not correspond to the German expression \u201cBudweiser\u201d, so that the 1986 Agreement could not be used to challenge its application for registration. Even supposing, however, that the German expression \u201cBudweiser\u201d were an accurate translation of the Czech appellation of origin, the applicant argued that the 1986 Agreement applied only to translations between Portuguese and Czech, not into any other languages. It submitted, lastly, that a formal defect in the 1986 Agreement made it unconstitutional, as it had been adopted by the Government, not Parliament, in breach of Articles 161 and 165 of the Constitution governing parliamentary sovereignty.",

The applicant company acknowledged this, even referring to the negotiations on the subject between the two companies. Indeed, it was only after the negotiations had broken down that the applicant company decided to apply to the Lisbon Court of First Instance for an order cancelling the registrations in the name of Budejovicky Budvar, eight years after it filed its own application with the NIIP (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). As a company engaged in a commercial enterprise, which by its very nature carried an element of risk, the applicant company was or should have been aware that there was a possibility that its request would be turned down by the competent authorities, especially as by the time it lodged its application challenging Budejovicky Budvar\u2019s own registration on 10 November 1989, the 1986 Agreement had already been in force for two and a half years.",

In these circumstances, and even though planning and trade-mark law are of course quite different, Anheuser-Busch Inc. was in a very similar position to that of the applicant company in the Pine Valley case, in which the Court found that the fact that outline planning permission had been granted amounted to a favourable decision as to the principle of the proposed development (Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v.

However, registration was ultimately refused, not because there was any risk of confusion over the source of the product concerned, but solely as a result of legislation that was introduced after 19 May 1981, when the application for registration was filed. That legislation was the exclusive cause of the refusal to register the mark. In their decisions, the domestic courts did not rely on Article 189 \u00a7 1 (j), which laid down that registration of a mark was to be refused if it contained \u201cexpressions\u201d that contravened the national legislation.

That provision is therefore applicable in the present case. In that connection, we agree with the majority\u2019s comments in the section of the judgment which unambiguously states that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was applicable, an issue which had never been clearly settled by a decision of the Court (in the British American Tobacco Company Ltd v. the Netherlands, judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 331, after the Commission had expressed the opinion that Article 1 of Protocol No 1 had not been violated, the Court held (\u00a7 91) that it was unnecessary to decide whether the patent application filed by the applicant company in that case constituted a \u201cpossession\u201d that came within the scope of the protection afforded by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1).",
