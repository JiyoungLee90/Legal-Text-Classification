Russia, no. 68443/01, \u00a7 46, 9 June 2005; Sun v.\u00a0Russia, no. 31004/02, \u00a7\u00a7 29-33, 5 February 2009; and Adzhigovich v.\u00a0Russia, no. 23202/05, \u00a7\u00a7 30-34, 8 October 2009), the sanction for noncompliance with the obligation to declare any amount of foreign currency exceeding USD 10,000 was established in Article 16.4 of the Code of Administrative Offences, which provided for either a fine or a confiscation order (see paragraph 15 above). The Court is therefore satisfied that the interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights was provided for by law, as required by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

The general declaration requirement applicable to any individual crossing the State border prevents cash from entering or leaving the country undetected and the confiscation measure which the failure to declare cash to the customs authorities results in is part of the general regulatory scheme designed to combat those offences. The Court therefore considers that the confiscation measure conformed to the general interest of the community (see Ismayilov, \u00a7 34, and Grifhorst, \u00a7 93, both cited above).",

Moreover, although the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 contains no explicit procedural requirements, the Court must consider whether the proceedings as a whole afforded the applicant a reasonable opportunity to put his case to the competent authorities with a view to enabling them to establish a fair balance between the conflicting interests at stake (see Grifhorst, \u00a7 94; Paulet, \u00a7 65; and Boljevi\u0107, \u00a7 41, all cited above; Denisova and Moiseyeva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 16903/03, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59, 1 April 2010; and Rummi v.

Not only was it permissible to export foreign currency, but the sum which could be legally transferred or, as in the present case, physically carried across the customs border, was not in principle restricted (see paragraph 16 above). Those elements distinguish this case from certain others, in which the confiscation measure applied either to goods whose import was prohibited or to vehicles used for transporting prohibited substances or trafficking human beings (for examples of such cases, see Ismayilov, \u00a7\u00a035, and Grifhorst, \u00a7 99, both cited above).",

The applicant presented to the domestic authorities and the Court documentary evidence, including a contract for the sale of a house and land and receipts from Russian banks where he had exchanged his money, showing that the money had originated from the sale of his property in the Moscow Region. On that basis the Court distinguishes the present case from cases in which the confiscation measure covered assets which were the proceeds of a criminal offence, were deemed to have been unlawfully acquired or were intended for use in illegal activities (for examples of such cases, see Ismayilov, cited above, \u00a7 36).",

When asked at the security check whether he had any cash, he replied in the affirmative (see paragraph 7 above and compare with Moon v.\u00a0France, no. 39973/03, \u00a7 8, 9 July 2009, and Grifhorst, cited above, \u00a7 8, in which the applicants denied that they had any money on them). The lack of intent to deceive was conceded by the Russian authorities, which decided not to pursue criminal proceedings on that basis (see paragraph 9 above). There is nothing in the case file to suggest that the applicant was suspected of or charged with any criminal offences in connection with the incident at issue or that by imposing the confiscation measure on him the authorities were seeking to prevent any other illegal activities, such as money laundering, drug trafficking, financing terrorism or tax evasion. The money he was carrying had been lawfully acquired and he was allowed to take it out of Russia and the Customs Union so long as he declared it to the customs authorities. It follows that the only prosecutable conduct which could be attributed to him was failure to make a written declaration to that effect to the customs authorities (compare Ismayilov, \u00a7 37, and Boljevi\u0107, \u00a7\u00a043, both cited above).",

Had the amount gone undetected, the Russian authorities would have only been deprived of the information that the money had left Russia. Thus, the confiscation measure was not intended as pecuniary compensation for damage \u2013 as the State had not suffered any loss as a result of the applicant\u2019s failure to declare the money \u2013 but was deterrent and punitive in its purpose (see Ismayilov, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

The sentencing court merely referred to the \u201cnature and dangerousness of the offence\u201d and \u201cinformation on the [applicant\u2019s] character\u201d but did not ask whether or not the confiscation order was in the public interest or whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.

In either case, it was the entire undeclared amount that was forfeited to the State. In the Court\u2019s view, such a rigid system is incapable of ensuring the requisite fair balance between the requirements of the general interest and the protection of an individual\u2019s right to property (see Grifhorst, cited above, \u00a7 103 in fine, and also Vasilevski v.\u00a0the\u00a0former Republic of Macedonia, no. 22653/08, \u00a7 57, 28 April 2016, and Andonoski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a016225/08, \u00a7\u00a038, 17\u00a0September 2015, in which the domestic legislation prevented the courts from considering the relationship between the applicant\u2019s conduct and the offence). The confiscation measure imposed an individual and excessive burden on the applicant and was disproportionate to the offence committed (see Ismayilov, \u00a7 38, and Boljevi\u0107, \u00a7 45, both cited above; and Tanasov v.\u00a0Romania, no. 65910/09, \u00a7 28, 31 October 2017).",
