That guard could not have foreseen that the two inmates would get into a fight so quickly, and had not been in a position to prevent the incident, which had unfolded in seconds and had consisted of a single punch.

It was unclear who had decided that only one guard was to accompany the applicant, or whether that guard had been properly briefed. The prison authorities had not taken any other steps to prevent the fight. They had known that both prisoners were volatile and involved in an escalating feud, but had confined their reaction to the earlier incident to talking with them. There were apparently no clear rules or procedures on how to manage the risk of inter-prisoner violence or report incidents to the prosecuting authorities. Varna Prison\u2019s head of security had himself admitted that such problems were dealt with on an ad hoc basis. In recent years, no prison staff had been disciplined for failing to prevent such violence, even though 103 incidents had been reported in 2012, 92 in 2013, and 42 in 2014. Overcrowding, the absence of productive activities for prisoners, the low ratio of staff to inmates, and the lack of suitable training for prison staff also contributed to such incidents.",

But that situation came to an end when around three months later the applicant was examined by a maxillofacial surgeon and given an X-ray, and then, about two months after that, received treatment for his jaw injury in Sofia Prison Hospital (see paragraphs\u00a028 and\u00a030 above). According to the available medical evidence, at that point his jaw fracture could no longer be operated on (ibid.).

In 2014 he brought a claim for damages against the prison authorities in relation to their alleged failure to provide him with adequate medical care for, among other conditions, his fractured jaw (see paragraph 37 above). His claim was based on section 1(1) of the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act 1988 (see paragraph 48 above). According to the available information, the Bulgarian administrative courts have regularly examined such claims on the merits (see paragraph 49 above), and the Varna Administrative Court started examining the one made by the applicant (see paragraph\u00a038 above). It is true that very few of the recent cases have resulted in awards of compensation (see paragraph 49 above). But that does not in itself mean that the applicant\u2019s claim lacked a reasonable prospect of succeeding. Each case turns on its own merits, and it would be speculative to say how the Varna Administrative Court and, on appeal, the Supreme Administrative Court would have disposed of the applicant\u2019s claim had it been pursued to conclusion. The very fact that the applicant brought it shows that he himself thought it would be an effective remedy (see Ignats, cited above, \u00a7 114). By later withdrawing it, he deprived the Bulgarian courts of the opportunity to deal with it (see paragraph 38 above). He did not explain what prompted his decision to do so, and there is no evidence that it was due to pressure or fear of reprisals (see, mutatis mutandis, Ignats, cited above, \u00a7 109).

Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], nos. 17153/11 and 29\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a7 74 and 84 in fine, 25 March 2014; Avoti\u0146\u0161 v.

Applicants who in such circumstances withdraw their claims or appeals deprive the national courts of the High Contracting States of the opportunity which Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention offers them of addressing and so preventing or putting right the breaches alleged against them (see Azinas v. Cyprus [GC], no. 56679/00, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, ECHR\u00a02004-III; Milo\u0161evi\u0107 v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 77631/01, 19\u00a0March 2002; Borghi, cited above; and Ignats, cited above, \u00a7 114). The Court does not discern in the present case any particular circumstances capable of absolving the applicant from the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies.",
