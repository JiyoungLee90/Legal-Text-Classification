Certain schools always refuse to enroll Roma children, which can sometimes be explained by the pressure exerted by the parents of non-Roma students. The ECRI is especially concerned about the fact that in certain cases, Roma children are separated from other children within the same establishment or nearby. In one case, the European Court of Human Rights found that Greece had violated Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (prohibition of discrimination in the enjoyment of rights set forth in the Convention), taken together with Article 2 of Protocol no. 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (right to education). The ECRI has learned that in Spata, where Roma children had initially been denied enrolment at the school, a separate class was created to accommodate them to allow them to gradually adapt to the school environment. While recognizing the necessity of progressive integration in the school system, the ECRI would like to draw attention to the Greek authorities to their opinion on this issue, as set out in General Policy Recommendation no. 10, on racism and racial discrimination in and throughout schooling and education. In this general policy recommendation, the ECRI recommends the creation of preparatory classes for pupils from minority groups in special and time-limited cases, if such a need is justified by objective and reasonable criteria, and if the best interests of the child command as such\u201d.",

The Committee noted that a large amount of Roma children is enrolled in \u2018special schools\u2019. Despite the fact that, as the Czech Republic argued, this situation resulted from the need to adopt measures adapted to their needs, it was also a consequence of discriminatory practices and a lack of sensitivity on the part of the authorities to cultural identity and the difficulties faced by the Roma. The Committee recommended that the Czech Republic increase their efforts in order to evaluate the situation of Roma in the area of education, to develop programs to end their segregation in this area, and to establish a method for determining when Roma children should be enrolled in special schools in order to avoid indirect discrimination on the basis of their cultural identity.",

It is clear from the facts of the case that the Ministry of Education recognised, as early as 2008, the need for an anti-segregationist policy in Sofades and that it designed measures to that end.

It follows in particular that the respondent State, found to be responsible for a violation of the Convention or its Protocols, is called upon to not only to pay the applicants the sums awarded as just satisfaction, but also to choose, under the control of the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or individual measures, where appropriate, to be adopted in its internal legal order (Ila\u015fcu and others v.

Moreover, it follows from the Convention, and in particular from Article 1 thereof, that in ratifying the Convention, the contracting states undertake to ensure that their domestic law is compatible with it.
