In the case at hand, as in many similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigation has been pending for many years without bringing about any significant developments as to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of Mr Murdalov. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that the criminal proceedings have been plagued by a combination of defects similar to those enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 12325). The investigation was suspended on several occasions; those suspensions were followed by periods of inactivity, which further diminished the prospects of solving the crime (see paragraphs 20 and 23 above). Moreover, from the case file, as it stands, it can be seen that the investigators took steps with regard to only the investigation into the infliction of bodily injuries and abuse of power (criminal cases nos. 90003 and 61883), whereas the proceedings remained passive in respect of the disappearance and murder (criminal cases nos. 15004 and 252/404523-15). No timely and thorough measures have been taken by the investigators to identify and question the witnesses at the VOVD \u2013 including its police officers, who could have seen Mr\u00a0Murdalov there and could have been involved in his subsequent disappearance and death. Finally, officer L.\u2019s involvement in the disappearance of Mr Murdalov should have been an obvious line of inquiry which the domestic authorities should have pursued in the context of the disappearance investigation (see Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey [GC], no. 24014/05, \u00a7 175, 14 April 2015, and Vazagashvili and Shanava v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 50375/07, \u00a7 82, 18 July 2019).",

In many other cases, the Court\u2019s awards have covered non-pecuniary damage caused by the violation of various Articles of the Convention, in addition to violations of Article 3.

Subsequently, at the request of the first applicant, the investigators severed the part of the case concerning the ill-treatment of Mr Murdalov in respect of officers P. and M.

From the documents submitted it can be seen that the investigators took a number of steps, including putting the names of officers P. and M. on the wanted list and subsequently arresting them (see paragraphs 17, 18, 21 and 26 above). Furthermore, a number of witnesses \u2013 including police officers and detainees from the IVS, where Mr\u00a0Murdalov had been detained \u2013 were questioned and several forensic examinations were ordered. The documents submitted show that the only evidence implicating officers P. and M. in Mr Murdalov\u2019s ill-treatment was the statement made by officer L.

During the investigation, officer L. changed his statements on several occasions in order to understate his role in the illtreatment of Mr Murdalov and to implicate the other police officers (see paragraph 30 above). Nevertheless, given the investigation\u2019s findings in respect of officers P. and M., and the lack of evidence demonstrating their involvement in the ill-treatment, the investigators terminated the proceedings in respect of them for lack of corpus delicti.
