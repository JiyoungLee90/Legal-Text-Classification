In support of their complaint they referred to the following facts. The  in the Urus-Martan district of Chechnya had been under the total control of federal troops since December 1999. There had been Russian military checkpoints on the roads leading to and from the settlement. The armed men who had abducted Beslan, Rizvan, Rizavdi and Shuddi Dolsayev had arrived in military vehicles late at night, which indicated that they had been able to circulate freely during the curfew and to pass through the military checkpoints.

The applicants pointed out that the district prosecutor's office had failed to take a number of crucial investigative steps, such as a crime scene examination (see paragraphs 29, 65, 67 and 79 above), or that it had taken them only after the communication of the application to the respondent Government. The investigation into Beslan, Rizvan, Rizavdi and Shuddi Dolsayev's kidnapping had been opened nine days after the events and had then been suspended and resumed a number of times, thus delaying the taking of the most basic steps, and the applicants had not been properly informed of the most important investigative measures. The fact that the investigation had been pending for almost six years without producing any known results was further proof of its ineffectiveness.

The investigation in case no.\u00a061144 was instituted on 30 October 2002, nine days after Beslan, Rizvan, Rizavdi and Shuddi Dolsayev had been taken away. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that although the first and second applicants were questioned within the first few days of the investigation, after that a number of essential steps were delayed and were eventually taken only several years later, or not at all. The Court notes that the district prosecutor's office conducted the crime scene examination several years after the abduction and that it failed to collect any evidence, including the tyre marks, from the scene of the abduction (see paragraphs 65, 67 and 79 above); that the prosecutors did not identify or question the servicemen of the local law-enforcement agencies and the military commander's office about their possible participation in a security operation on 21 October 2002; that the investigation failed to establish whether any APCs and other military vehicles had been used by federal authorities that night; and that the investigators failed to identify and question the officers who had manned the checkpoints in Martan-Chu on the night of the abduction and to collect the registration log of the passing vehicles. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",

Relevant elements will include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, the involvement of the family member in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person and the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries.

It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities' conduct (see Orhan v.

Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",
