As to the oral hearing, the court found that the facts and their background were undisputed, the written correspondence between the Ministry and the applicants had already been included in the District Court\u2019s judgment and the role of the Ministry of the Interior as the supervisory and expert organ in lottery legislation matters had become apparent from the Lotteries Act. It was thus clearly not necessary to hold an oral hearing. Nor did the forfeiture require an oral hearing to be held. It was not necessary to provide the public prosecutor or the applicants with an opportunity to submit further comments. As to the merits, the court found that catching a marked fish was more due to luck than to the participants\u2019 skills. Even a beginner could have caught a winning fish. The ice fishing competition thus fulfilled the criteria of a lottery within the meaning of the Lotteries Act. The provisions of the Lotteries Act were not especially difficult to understand and the first applicant had been well aware of the manner in which they were interpreted by the Ministry. As it could not be deemed that the first applicant had misinterpreted the law in an excusable manner, he was found guilty of a lottery offence. According to the court, the proper sanction, bearing in mind the first applicant\u2019s guilt and the damaging effect of the offence, was thus 50 day-fines. The court estimated that the profit gained from the offence was 60,000 euros and ordered its forfeiture.",
