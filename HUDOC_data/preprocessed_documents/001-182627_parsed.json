In the United Kingdom, for instance, the under-representation of women and persons from visible minority groups among judges, especially in the higher courts, prompted the authorities to implement a proactive policy to promote diversity, with the creation in 2013 of a Judicial Diversity Committee under the authority of the Lord Chief Justice. In April 2017 the Committee published its first official statistics on the composition of the judiciary, together with an action plan to encourage greater diversity (Judicial Diversity Committee of the Judges\u2019 Council \u2013 Report on Progress and Action Plan 2016-17, 13 April 2017). In the Netherlands the Council for the Judiciary, as far back as 2007, commissioned a study into the representation of ethnic minorities in the judiciaries of several traditional and more recent immigration countries (the Netherlands, Germany, France, Canada and the United States). A handbook published by the Council for the Judiciary in 2015 on reforming the process for the selection, recruitment and training of judges set out the clear objective of ensuring that the diversity within society was reflected in the judiciary (\u201cJudicial reform in the Netherlands: A new process for the recruitment, selection and training of judges\u201d, Scientific Magazine for the Judiciary Organisation of the Netherlands, 2015).",

For example, in the United States the Supreme Court held in its decision in Batson v. Kentucky (476 US 79 (1986)) that the right of defence and prosecution lawyers to challenge jurors could not be exercised on the basis of \u201cracial\u201d criteria (see also, for a recent example, Timothy Throne Foster v. Bruce Chatman (578 U.S. \u2013 (2016)). In the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Peters v. Kiff (407 US 493 (1972)) regarding the systematic exclusion of African Americans from juries, Justice Thurgood Marshall issued a dissenting opinion in which he argued that removing a large part of the community from the jury reduced the diversity of human experiences and qualities that could be expressed during the deliberations. In Canada, in several recent cases, individuals accused of murdering \u201cAboriginal\u201d people have been acquitted by juries with no Aboriginal members. These judgments triggered a debate on the representativeness of Canadian juries and the need to reform jury selection in order to promote the participation of members of Aboriginal communities; in particular, a former Supreme Court judge delivered a report in 2013 concerning the province of Ontario. In 2015 the Supreme Court ruled (R v. Kokopenace, 2015 SCC 28) that provinces had an obligation to make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to provide \u201ca fair opportunity for a broad cross-section of society to participate in the jury process\u201d. However, they are not required to ensure that the final composition of the jury accurately and proportionately reflects the different groups making up the Canadian population.",

After the challenges had been exercised, jurors were no longer just private individuals but constituted an organ of the judiciary which had to be seen to be impartial. As soon as the verdict had been delivered he had questioned the prosecution\u2019s representative about his intentions, since, unlike the prosecution, the civil party had no means of challenging an acquittal verdict. The prosecutor had replied that the possibility of an appeal should be discussed within the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the Montpellier Court of Appeal. Given the conduct of the trial, and in particular the refusal of the President of the Assize Court to question the two gendarmes accused of lying to the investigating judge, and the hesitant attitude of the prosecution\u2019s representative, he had realised that an appeal was unlikely and had tried to influence the prosecutor\u2019s choice. Although the proceedings had ended he had decided, from his position on the civil party\u2019s bench in the courtroom, still in his robes and alongside the defence lawyer who was being questioned in the same circumstances by other journalists, that he could not in all conscience shirk his duty as a lawyer in view of the reluctant attitude of the prosecution.",

In the present case, although the acquittal verdict had been delivered, the judgment was not yet final. The Principal Public Prosecutor had a period of ten days in which to appeal against the decision, unlike the civil party \u2013 whom the applicant was representing \u2013 who did not have that right. The Court agrees with the disciplinary board of the Bar associations attached to the Montpellier Court of Appeal (see paragraph 22 above) that the statement made at the exit from the courtroom had been part of an analytical approach that was apt to help persuade the Principal Public Prosecutor to appeal against the decision to acquit. It also notes the Government\u2019s assertion that there was nothing in the file to demonstrate that this means of expression was the only means available to the applicant in order to defend his client\u2019s interests (see paragraph 46 above). It observes that, in choosing this form of words, the Government were criticising the use of the impugned remarks rather than the applicant\u2019s assertion that they were aimed at defending the interests of the civil party. The Court therefore considers that, in making his statement, the applicant sought an opportunity to continue his client\u2019s defence by pursuing the proceedings before an enlarged assize court of appeal (see, mutatis mutandis, Mor v.

The Court reiterates, secondly, that the public has a legitimate interest in the provision and availability of information about criminal proceedings, and that remarks concerning the functioning of the judiciary relate to a matter of public interest (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7 152, and B\u00e9dat v.

However, it does not appear to the Court that the applicant was seeking to accuse members of the jury of racial bias. Rather, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s statement reflected a widely held view that the impartiality of judges, whether professional or lay judges, is a virtue that does not exist in a vacuum but is the result of considerable efforts to shake off unconscious bias rooted, in particular, in geographical and social background and liable to arouse fears in persons being tried of being illunderstood by persons of different appearance to them (see, as regards the impartiality of the courts in cases of allegations of racism on the part of a juror, the Court\u2019s judgments in Remli v. France, 23 April 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II; Gregory v. the United Kingdom, 25\u00a0February 1997, Reports 1997I; and Sander v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a034129/96, ECHR 2000V).

The Court reiterates in that regard the importance, in a State governed by the rule of law and in a democratic society, of maintaining the authority of the judiciary. The proper functioning of the courts would not be possible without relations based on consideration and mutual respect between the various protagonists in the justice system, at the forefront of which are judges and lawyers (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7 170). Nevertheless, for the reasons set out above (see paragraphs 64 to 67), the Court considers that the facts of the case do not support the conclusion that there was an attack on the authority and impartiality of the judiciary such as to justify the judgment against the applicant.",
