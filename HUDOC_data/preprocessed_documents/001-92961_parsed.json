The basic structure of the Fuel Fee Act and the Motor Vehicle Tax Act was identical to, for example, the Penal Code, which does not specifically forbid certain unwanted acts but only provides for the consequences of such acts. The only difference was that the sanction applicable to the use of fuels was an administrative sanction collected as a tax. The basic aim of the provisions on additional tax and fuel fee is well established in .

He could have used a more leniently taxed fuel by notifying the authorities of such use and by paying a daily fee amounting to some EUR 252. However, it had not been possible to drive the pickup van during a single day such a distance as to make the use of such fuel financially viable. The result of the failure to give prior notice had been that the applicant had been considered to have used more leniently taxed fuel for a period of twenty days although his statement that the use involved one fill-up of the fuel tank had not been proved wrong. The consequences were out of all proportion and unreasonable taking into consideration even the absolute benefit sought through the offence, that is, the difference in price between fuel taxed as diesel oil and more leniently taxed fuel, the reprehensibility and unique nature of the act, the financial position and actions of the offender and other circumstances. The applicant\u2019s application for exemption from payment of the fuel fee or a decrease thereof had been unsuccessful. Although the increased fuel fee was characterised as an administrative sanction, it should be equated with a criminal sanction.",

The legislation provided for a high fuel fee so as to render the actual use of such fuel impossible. In practice, few notifications were made of the use of more leniently taxed fuel oil in cars and vans. A prohibition on the use of light fuel oil had not even been proposed in the Government Bill for the enactment of the new Fuel Fee Act. It was only added to the Bill during consideration in the Finance Committee (report no. 37/2003 vp). This demonstrated that the State had long held that the notification procedure including sanctions was sufficient to prevent the use of more leniently taxed fuel in diesel vehicles. The applicant took the view that the essential elements of the punishable offence were identical in the provision on petty tax fraud and in the Fuel Fee Act. Likewise, the administrative fuel fee and the penal sanction resulting from petty tax fraud were imposed for one and the same act. Under the wording of sections 3-4 and 6 of the Fuel Fee Act, the fuel fee was imposed for failure to observe the notification obligation. According to the essential elements of tax evasion in the Penal Code, a person who for the purpose of avoiding tax fails to observe a duty pertaining to taxation or influencing the assessment of tax shall be sentenced for tax fraud. The use of the more leniently taxed fuel would have been permissible subject to payment of a daily fee. The increased fuel fee was imposed for failure to submit a prior notification. It was for precisely the same reason, that is failure to observe the notification obligation, that the fine had been imposed. The fuel fee had thus not been imposed because the use of more leniently taxed fuel was prohibited as such. The fact of the fuel fee being imposed irrespective of intent or negligence only served to underscore the citizens\u2019 need for judicial relief and it did not change the essentially criminal nature of the fuel fee. The Fuel Fee Act and the Penal Code had the same structure, a stand which was also taken in the Government Bill for the enactment of the new Fuel Fee Act.",

In the former case the tax consequence was based on accounts, that is, the amount of tax actually evaded. In the present case, the amount of tax actually evaded had not been established but it seemed indisputable that the fuel fee significantly exceeded the amount of tax actually evaded. In the case of Ponsetti and Chesnel, interest on arrears and tax surcharge amounted to 40-80%. In the present case, the tax was increased by 300%. The former case involved chronic and repeated failure whereas the present case involved a single instance of failure of short duration. In the former case, the essential elements of tax fraud differed from those of failure to file tax returns in a timely fashion, whereas in the present case the essential elements of tax fraud and failure to notify were the same.

The primary purpose of the legislation was to ensure the use of diesel oil in diesel vehicles. At that time, the legislation did not contain any formal prohibition on the use of more leniently taxed fuel and therefore it was necessary to make the use of such fuel financially less advantageous than the use of diesel oil. This was ensured by providing for a high flat-rate tax (the fuel fee). Although the use of a more leniently taxed fuel was not prohibited, anyone who used such fuel was obliged to give prior notification. The fee was imposed irrespective of whether the person in question defaulted on the notification obligation intentionally or through carelessness since this guaranteed the State\u2019s tax income irrespective of how the conduct of the tax payer was assessed. The amount of the fuel fee depended solely on the vehicle type. Failure to comply with the notification obligation resulted in the fuel fee being collected threefold. Furthermore, a fuel fee could only be reduced in individual cases for particular reasons. Although the increased fuel fee had the nature of an administrative sanction, its main objective was to collect tax revenue and to safeguard the operation of the fuel taxation system. According to the new Fuel Fee Act, the fuel fee was, unlike before, a sanction for a violation of a prohibition laid down in the Act. However, the purpose of the fee remained unchanged, that is, to ensure the proper accrual of tax revenue.",

Failure to pay a fine resulted in its being converted to a prison sentence. The increased fuel fee was not a penal sanction but an administrative one, imposed in an administrative procedure and could not, therefore, be equated to a determination of a criminal charge against the applicant. This was also reflected in the new Fuel Fee Act, which contained an express prohibition on the of use light fuel oil. This change to the legislation resulted from the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 27\u00a0November 2003 concerning Finland (Case C-185/00: Commission of the European Communities v. Republic of Finland) in which the European Court of Justice deemed that Community legislation obliged Finland to amend its legislation so as to ensure, more efficiently than before, that fuels were used in compliance with fuel directives (see Council Directive 92/81/EEC on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on mineral oils and Council Directive 92/82/EEC on the approximation of the rates of excise duties on mineral oils, both replaced by Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity). As to the applicant\u2019s view that the prohibition on the use of more leniently taxed fuel had technically been in existence also before the amendment, the Government submitted that it was indeed true that the rate of the fuel fee was so high that its payment was disadvantageous even if the person concerned only had to pay the basic amount. However, in the above-mentioned judgment it had been found that  had failed to fulfil its obligations under Community law. Thus, the prohibition on the use of more leniently taxed fuel and the fact that the sanction for using the wrong fuel was severe, have been found to constitute different legal issues. As to the applicant\u2019s submission that the State had long held that the notification procedure inclusive of sanctions was sufficient to prevent the use of more leniently taxed fuel in diesel vehicles, the Government submitted that this was true, and that this fact had also been relied on before the European Court of Justice. However, it did not render the fuel fee a criminal law sanction nor a sanction of a comparable nature, as its aim was specifically to ensure the accrual of tax revenue, primarily by ensuring the use of taxable diesel oil in vehicles and secondarily by corresponding at least to the tax difference between the different fuels.",

Firstly, the administrative fuel fee was imposed for using a fuel that was taxed more leniently than diesel oil whereas the criminal sanction for petty tax fraud was imposed for illegal evasion of the fuel fee, the punishable act being failure to comply with the notification obligation laid down in the Fuel Fee Act. Thus, the administrative fuel fee and the criminal sanction for petty tax fraud were imposed for different acts. Secondly, the sanction provided for in the Penal Code always necessitated intent or at least negligence, and petty tax fraud was always intentional and thus essentially involved a subjective element. By contrast, the fuel fee was imposed, irrespective of the degree of intent, on the basis of the mere objective fact that the fuel system of a vehicle contained the wrong fuel. Thirdly, the purpose of the criminal sanction for tax fraud was to constitute a punishment and to express moral reproach for a certain act. The fuel fee did not have a similar purpose of punishment or reproach. It was only intended to ensure the accrual of tax revenue, primarily by ensuring the use of taxable diesel oil in vehicles and secondarily by corresponding at least to the tax difference between the different fuels. Moreover, the higher fuel fee was not intended to be a punishment, but only to ensure that vehicle users gave prior notification if they wanted to use a more leniently taxed fuel. Fourthly, the fuel fee system in force at the relevant time also differed from a punishment in that it made it legally possible for vehicle owners to choose to use a tax-free fuel, to notify the authorities of this and to pay the fuel fee, an option which was not open in respect of acts regulated by criminal law. Fifthly, only a perpetrator or an accomplice comparable with the perpetrator could be sentenced to a sanction under criminal law. Emphasis should be put on the fact that owners or holders of a vehicle had to pay the fuel fee irrespective of whether they used the fuel concerned. Sixthly, an unpaid fine could be converted to imprisonment whereas an unpaid fuel fee could not. Seventhly, criminal cases were examined by general courts whereas cases concerning fuel fees were examined in an administrative procedure, like tax cases, and finally through an appeal to an administrative court.",

This common feature was also referred to in the Government Bill (112/2003) for the enactment of the new Fuel Fee Act. However, the purpose of the reference was only to indicate that the fuel fee must be considered an effective means of ensuring the collection of fuel tax or of a corresponding amount of taxes, irrespective of whether the fuel fee was based on a prohibition of use.

Otherwise, the application of this provision would be left to the discretion of the Contracting States to a degree that might lead to results incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention (see, most recently, Storbr\u00e5ten v.\u00a0 (dec.), no.\u00a012277/04, ECHR 2007...

The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. It is enough that the offence in question is by its nature to be regarded as criminal or that the offence renders the person liable to a penalty which by its nature and degree of severity belongs in the general criminal sphere (see Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2003X). The relative lack of seriousness of the penalty cannot divest an offence of its inherently criminal character (see \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Germany, judgment of 21\u00a0February 1984, Series A no. 73, \u00a7 54, and Lutz v. Germany, judgment of 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123, \u00a7 55). This does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, as recent authorities, Jussila v.  [GC], no.\u00a073053/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030-31, ECHR 2006..., and Ezeh and Connors, cited above, \u00a7\u00a082-86).",

Those proceedings were \u201ccriminal\u201d also for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 and consequently the applicant was \u201cfinally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of [the] State\u201d.

This is however not decisive. In this connection, the Court has previously found that the sphere defined in the Finnish legal system as \u201cadministrative\u201d embraces certain offences that have a criminal connotation but are too trivial to be governed by criminal law and procedure (see Jussila v.

The applicant was liable in his capacity as owner or user of a diesel engine vehicle. As to the Government\u2019s argument that the fuel fee debit was intended as pecuniary compensation for damage, the Court is however not so convinced in the circumstances of the present case. It may well be that the fuel fee imposed corresponded to the damage caused, namely loss of revenue. It is however to be noted that the fuel fee collected was trebled. This must in the Court\u2019s view be seen as a punishment to deter re-offending, recognised as a characteristic feature of criminal penalties (see Ezeh, \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 105). It may therefore be concluded that the fuel fee debit was imposed by a rule whose purpose was not only compensatory but also deterrent and punitive.
