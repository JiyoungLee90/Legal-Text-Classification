These two approaches can also be characterised as the \u201cparens patriae\u201d approach or the \u201cpolice powers\u201d approach, respectively. The medical model emphasises the need for treatment as a sufficient prerequisite for the involuntary confinement of a mentally ill patient. Supporters of the medical model consider compulsory admission to be essential and inevitable to secure treatment for patients whose mental illness interferes with their capacity to accept treatment on a voluntary basis. Similarly, the \u201cparens patriae\u201d approach is the public-policy power of the State to act as the parent of an individual who is in need of protection but cannot protect himself. On the basis of this power, State authorities may make decisions regarding mental health treatment on behalf of one who is mentally incompetent to make the decision himself. A strict human-rights approach accepts forced hospital admission only when a mentally ill person threatens to do harm to others or himself. This is the only criterion (\u201cdangerousness criterion\u201d) justifying or permitting someone to be admitted involuntarily. This is similar to the police-power approach which authorises and requires the State only to interfere in order to protect the public order and the rights and safety of others.",

Many States, including Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, the United Kingdom and  apply both the dangerousness criterion and the need-for-treatment criterion, as alternatives, to admit mentally ill patients involuntarily. The dangerousness criterion is not applied in a uniform manner in the Member States of the European Union. Some States qualify the level of danger required for admitting a person involuntarily, others do not. The defined thresholds, however, are rather vague, requiring that the danger to health or safety of the person concerned or to the public be \u201cserious\u201d, \u201cimmediate\u201d, \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201csubstantial\u201d.

For the Court, deference to such an extent to medical opinions in these circumstances is difficult to reconcile with the paramount importance of independent and impartial judicial decision-making in cases pertaining to personal liberty. In the instant case, it is all the more so, since the key opinion was drawn up by an expert in a forty-minute court session break (see paragraph 22 above), which, for the Court, casts doubt on the \u201cfair and proper\u201d character of the examination.

Those courts, while attributing importance to the applicant\u2019s unconventional lifestyle \u2013 a consideration which, for the Court, clearly falls outside the ambit of permissible grounds for deprivation of liberty \u2013, essentially relied on the applicant\u2019s refusal to undergo hospitalisation. In this refusal, they perceived proof of his lack of insight into his condition \u2013 rather than the exercise of his right to self-determination \u2013 which, in those courts\u2019 view, entailed the risk of his health declining. For the Court, to accept this line of reasoning would be tantamount to acquiescing in a circular argument, according to which a person reluctant to undergo psychiatric hospitalisation would thereby demonstrate his inability to appreciate his own condition and the risk of its potential worsening \u2013 which would yield yet another reason for his involuntary treatment. The Court finds that this kind of handling of such cases is incompatible with the principle of effective protection of Convention rights. It would add that the present case is to be distinguished from Hutchison Reid (op. cit.), quoted by the Government in paragraph 50 above, since, unlike the applicant in that case, Mr Ples\u00f3 had had no history of presenting a danger to others, let alone of criminal conviction or reoffending with sexual connotation (see, a contrario, Hutchison Reid, \u00a7\u00a053).",
