In his submissions to the Court, the applicant further claimed that, because of a delay in scheduling a hearing for the examination of his appeal, on 18\u00a0October 1999 he had filed a complaint to that effect with the Supreme Judicial Council and the Ministry of Justice. This purportedly led to a hearing being scheduled for the very next day, 19 October 1999, to which the applicant was summoned at very short notice, while his counsel had found out about it only by chance and had not had time to prepare for the hearing or to call witnesses.",

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 of the Convention varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law (see Aksoy v.

The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article\u00a05 of the Convention, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996III, pp. 752-53, \u00a7 40). It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. However, since under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (see Benham, cited above, \u00a7 41).",

In the present case, in the context of the Pazardzhik criminal proceedings, the applicant claimed to have lodged an appeal against his detention on 8 October 1999. He did not however present a copy dated as having been deposited on that day with any relevant State institution, as the Government did by presenting a copy dated 18 October 1999. The Court therefore finds that the applicant has not convincingly substantiated his assertion that he filed his appeal on 8 October 1999 but rather accepts that it was deposited with the Pazardzhik District Investigation Service only on 18 October 1999. As the appeal was then examined by the District Court one day later on 19\u00a0October 1999, the Court considers this period to be in conformity with the requirement for a speedy decision under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",
