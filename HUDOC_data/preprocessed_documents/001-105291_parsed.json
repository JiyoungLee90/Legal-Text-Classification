Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, ECHR 2000-XI). In this connection, the Court notes that under section 428a of the Civil Procedure Act an applicant may file a petition for reopening of the civil proceedings in respect of which the Court has found a violation of the Convention. Given the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention and the reasons for which it has found a violation of that Article, the Court considers that in the present case the most appropriate way of repairing the consequences of that violation is to reopen the proceedings complained of. As it follows that domestic law allows such reparation to be made, the Court considers that there is no call to award the applicant any sum in respect of pecuniary damage (see Trgo v. Croatia, no. 35298/04, \u00a7 75, 11 June 2009).",
