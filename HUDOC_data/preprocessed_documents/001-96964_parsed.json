A liquidator was then appointed on 19 July 1995 by the commercial courts to oversee the liquidation.\u00a0Thus, following the insolvency order, the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions took the form of a control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Luordo v.

Those provisions lay down the conditions to be fulfilled by candidates to the office of liquidator and the qualities required of them, without indicating whether the candidate must be a private person or a civil servant. Even if the liquidator is a private person, in view of the nature of his duties and the fact that he is authorised by the domestic courts to discharge them, the Court is not persuaded that the State could avoid responsibility by delegating its obligations to this person (see, mutatis mutandis, Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1993, \u00a7 27 in fine, Series A no. 247C). According to the above-mentioned provisions, he is not a professional liquidator but an economist or lawyer authorised by the domestic courts to oversee the insolvency procedure. Those same courts in fact supervise his activities (contrast Katsyuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a039). In the context of his powers, which are thus defined by law, the liquidator discharges duties pertaining to public authority and is expected to achieve a \u201cfair balance\u201d between the demands of the general interest and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights (see, among other authorities, Luordo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 67-69). Consequently, in the Court\u2019s opinion, his acts and omissions engage, in the circumstances of the case, the responsibility of the State (see, mutatis mutandis, Sychev v. Ukraine, no. 4773/02, \u00a7\u00a7 53 and 54, 11 October 2005).",

The final impossibility for the applicant to recover any more than 140 roubles (see paragraph 17 above) stemmed directly from a misuse of power by the liquidator. That misuse made it impossible for the decisions of 20 February 1995 and 5 April 1996 to be enforced, even partly, and at the same time deprived the commercial court decisions of 26\u00a0August and 12\u00a0November 1998 of any useful effect (see paragraphs 20-22 above). Those decisions of 1998, in which the liquidator\u2019s action was found to have been unlawful and redress for the applicant\u2019s situation was ordered, could not be enforced as the liquidator, in 1996, had already distributed almost the entire proceeds of the liquidation.",

Those provisions do not indicate that the 700\u00a0creditors concerned belonged to the same class as the applicant. The Government did not provide any explanation in this connection. The first paragraph of the above-mentioned section 30 provides only that any expenses of the liquidation, the liquidator\u2019s fees and the expenses of the debtor company\u2019s ongoing operations must take priority over the claims of first-level creditors. Even supposing that \u201cpersons having actively participated in the liquidation process\u201d, who were also repaid in full by the liquidator, belonged to that class, the legal basis for repaying the other above-mentioned creditors in full and for depriving the applicant of the sum due to him according to the principle of proportional distribution has not been ascertained (see, mutatis mutandis, Vasilescu v. Romania, 22\u00a0May 1998, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050-53, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998III). The Court reiterates in this connection that the first and most important requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should have a legal basis (see Gravina v. Italy, no.\u00a060124/00, \u00a7\u00a079, 15\u00a0November 2005) and that the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Iatridis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058).",
