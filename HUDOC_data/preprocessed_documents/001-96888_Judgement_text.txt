The case originated in an application (no. 33262/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by the company “Pakom Slobodan Dooel” (“the applicant”) on 15 October 2003.
The applicant was represented by Mr D. Georgiev, a lawyer practising in . The Macedonian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs R. Lazareska Gerovska.
On 13 September 2006 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
In December 1993, the applicant concluded a lease contract (“the contract”) with the company “M.” (“the debtor”) under which it rented a warehouse (“the property”) for a period of five years.
On an unspecified date in 1996, the applicant claimed repossession (враќање во владение) of the property since on 12 November 1996 the debtor had broken in, removed its belongings and rented the property to a third person. The applicant’s claim was upheld in two court levels, the last being the Skopje Court of Appeal’s decision of 21 October 1998 ordering the debtor to restore the property in the applicant’s actual possession.
On 3 February 1999 the  Court of First Instance   (“the first-instance court”) granted the applicant’s enforcement request of 16 December 1998 by ordering the debtor to vacate the property and to restore it in its actual possession (“the enforcement order”). It also made a charging order over the debtor’s bank account concerning the payment of trial costs.
On 16 February 1999 the debtor objected, inter alia, that the validity of the contract had expired and that the enforcement was accordingly, inadmissible. This objection was finally rejected by the Skopje Court of Appeal’s decision of 17 November 1999.
On 11 February 2000 the first-instance court dismissed the debtor’s request for postponement of the enforcement. On 7 February and 16 March 2000 respectively, it also dismissed same objections submitted by third parties, which had meanwhile joined the proceedings.
On 16 May 2000 the public prosecutor lodged a legality review request (барање за заштита на законитоста) with the Supreme Court against the decision of 16 March 2000 arguing that inter alia the enforcement order could not be executed since the validity of the contract had meanwhile expired. On 29 September 2000 the first-instance court postponed, on the public prosecutor’s request, the enforcement proceedings pending the outcome of the legality review proceedings. On 9 October 2002 the Supreme Court dismissed the public prosecutor’s legality review request.
Between 19 January 2000 and 29 May 2003, the first-instance court fixed five hearings to be held on-site. On two occasion, the debtor unsuccessfully requested exclusion of the sitting judge. On 20 July 2000 and 10 July 2003 the President of the first-instance court ordered removal of the sitting judge. On 4 March and 13 June 2003 respectively, it issued an eviction order against the debtor. On 29 May 2003 it refused the debtor’s request that the enforcement proceedings be suspended pending the outcome of other civil proceedings, instituted in the meantime, in which the latter had claimed revocation of the enforcement order (see paragraph 12 below).
On 22 November 2005 the first-instance court adjourned the enforcement advising the debtor to challenge the admissibility of the enforcement (недопуштеност на извршувањето) in separate civil proceedings.
On 9 February 2006 the Skopje Court of Appeal rejected the debtor’s claim for revocation of the enforcement order, under section 53 of the 1997 Act, as having not been advised by the first-instance court to do so (see paragraph 15 below).
On 15 December 2005, in separate civil proceedings, the debtor challenged the admissibility of the enforcement. On 30 December 2008 the Skopje Court of Appeal finally upheld its claim declaring the execution of the enforcement order inadmissible since the validity of the contract had expired on 31 March 1999.
There was no formal decision terminating the enforcement proceedings.
Section 53 of the then valid 1997 Enforcement Proceedings Act (“the 1997 Act”) (Закон за извршна постапка) provided, inter alia, that the court would advise a debtor to challenge the admissibility of the enforcement in separate proceedings if that issue was relevant for the enforcement.
Section 3 of the 2005 Enforcement Act (“the 2005 Act”) (Закон за извршување) provides that bailiffs (извршители) carry out the enforcement.
Section 238 of the 2005 Act provides that enforcement proceedings instituted before it entered into force are to continue in accordance with the 1997 Act until 31 December 2007. Thereafter, the 2005 Act applies.
