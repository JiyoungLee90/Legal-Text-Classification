The court admitted a considerable amount of evidence including oral evidence from the accused, Z.S. and his wife; evidence from nine eyewitnesses and two doctors concerning Z.S.\u2019s injuries; and a medical certificate of 2 August 1998 on Z.S. The court established that S.U., one of the accused, had left the restaurant at around 11.30 p.m. While under the influence of alcohol he had gone out into the street and stopped the car in which Z.S. and his wife were travelling. S.U. had immediately started to bang on the car. When Z.S. got out, S.U. had attacked him with his fists and kicked him. Shortly afterwards, the first and fourth applicants had joined in, battering Z.S. with their fists and a glass bottle and kicking him all over his body. Z.S. had sustained injuries to his head, cuts to his finger and elbow, bruising to his face and damage to eight teeth. The court rejected the first applicant\u2019s defence that he had not been involved in the quarrel as contrary to the evidence. It found the fourth applicant\u2019s argument that he had been involved in the fight with Z.S. because the latter had hit him in the eye unsubstantiated, as no evidence or medical certificate had been produced in support of that allegation.",

They stated that the officers concerned had used force of the type and degree that had been absolutely necessary to suppress the Roma\u2019s active, unlawful and direct resistance, in particular as the Roma had disobeyed police commands and had used dangerous objects (stones, bottles and wooden sticks) against the officers. They further maintained that the officers had initially attempted to restore order without resorting to physical force (by issuing a warning and an order) and had only gone on to apply the mildest form of coercive measure (involving the use of physical force and a rubber baton) in the performance of their duty. The Government concluded that the applicable principles concerning the force used had been respected: the aim had been to subdue resistance; the officers had used a lawful coercive measure; force had been used only because the resistance could not have otherwise been subdued and it had been necessary to act immediately; and the measure had been used in accordance with law and had continued for as long as the reasons that had prompted the intervention persisted.",

They further argued that an accused could always deny what he or she had stated earlier; that the courts were required to rely on other evidence in addition to any confession; that the statements made in the pre-trial proceedings before other bodies could not be used at the trial; and that unlawfully obtained evidence could not be used as a ground for a court decision.",

They noted that the second and fifth applicants had been apprehended by the police for involvement in the disturbance and not in the fight with Z.S.

Concerning the injuries that the second and fifth applicants had allegedly sustained, they stressed that they could have been inflicted only as a result of the use of reasonable force to subdue the disturbance in which they had been actively involved.
