Thus, the investigation must be thorough. This means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened, and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of the standard (see, for example, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 102 et seq., Reports 1998-VIII, and Mikheyev v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a7 107 et seq., 26 January 2006). Nevertheless, the nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfy the minimum threshold of the investigation\u2019s effectiveness depend on the circumstances of the particular case. They must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see Velcea and Maz\u0103re v. Romania, no. 64301/01, \u00a7 105, 1 December 2009).",
