However, the Court notes that his detention was reflected in the other procedural documents drawn up by the police (see paragraphs 12, 31 and 39 above). Therefore, it was acknowledged by the authorities and there existed official record of Timur Khambulatov\u2019s detention by the police (see, by contrast, among many authorities, Kurt v. , 25 May 1998, \u00a7 125, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998III and Imakayeva v.
