On 6 July 2002 an employee of the ROVD had confirmed that he had seen Lecha Basayev and Lema Dikayev in the corridor of the ROVD. Four other residents of Martan-Chu, who had been apprehended on the same night, had been released from the ROVD in the afternoon of 6 July 2002.

The investigation in criminal case no.\u00a061117 was instituted on 23 August 2002, that is one month and twenty-one days after the abduction of Lech Basayev and Lema Dikayev. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were delayed (see paragraphs 59, 86, 90 above) and were taken either several years later or not at all. For instance, the investigators had failed to establish and question the employees of the military commander's office who might have participated in the apprehension of the applicants' relatives and the employees of the ROVD who could have seen Lecha Basayev and Lema Dikayev in the corridor on 6 July 2002; they had failed to establish and question four other residents of Martan-Chu who, according to the applicants, had been abducted on the night of 6 July 2002 and released on the following day; the investigators had failed to establish the identity of the owners of the APCs used on the night of the abduction or to question their drivers; they had failed to identify or question the servicemen who were manning the checkpoints in Martan-Chu on the night in question or to check the registration logs of the passage through the roadblocks during the curfew. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays and omissions, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, \u00a7 64, Reports 1997III,).",
