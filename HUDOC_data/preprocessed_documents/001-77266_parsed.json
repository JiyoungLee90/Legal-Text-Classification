The applicant wrote to the deputy regional governor, complaining that the conduct of a town council head had not been even-handed and at times unlawful. The letter was sent privately, the applicant did not publish or otherwise make his allegations available to the outside world, instead he acted within the framework established by law for making complaints. He brought his grievance solely to the attention of the direct hierarchical superior of the official against whom the complaint was directed. It is not clear how the head of the town council, who was the plaintiff in the defamation action, obtained a copy of the applicant's letter.",

The extent to which such protection might be deemed necessary depends on the particular circumstances of the case. In the present case the applicant's grievances were set out in private correspondence and were not made public. Accordingly, the requirements of such protection have to be weighed not in relation to the interests of the freedom of the press or of open discussion of matters of public concern but rather against the applicant's right to report irregularities in the conduct of State officials to a body competent to deal with such complaints.",

In the present case the criticism was directed against a town council head whose standing is closer to that of professional politicians, and who should be prepared to tolerate a more demanding public scrutiny. As the Court has had an opportunity to remark, it would go too far if the protection afforded to law-enforcement officials were extended to all persons who are employed by the State (see Busuioc v.\u00a0, no.\u00a061513/00, \u00a7\u00a064, 21\u00a0December 2004). Secondly, whereas Mr Le\u0161n\u00edk's aspersions on the prosecutor P. were leaked to a newspaper \u2013 whether intentionally or otherwise, the applicant's grievances remained a matter strictly between him and the deputy regional governor, the hierarchical superior of the town council head.",

That the citizens should be able to notify competent State officials about the conduct of civil servants which to them appears irregular or unlawful, is one of the precepts of the rule of law. In this connection the Court notes the express provision of the Russian Supreme Court's resolution that \u201ccommunication of information to the person whom it concerned\u201d was not considered its dissemination and therefore not actionable as defamation (see paragraph 17 above). It appears that the applicant raised this argument in substance, but it was not addressed by the domestic courts. The domestic courts did not identify any \u201cpressing social need\u201d for putting the protection of the civil servant's personality rights above the applicant's right to impart information and the general interest in having irregular conduct of civil servants examined by competent authorities.",

Assessing the text of the letter as a whole, the Court finds that its contents did not go beyond the limits of acceptable criticism, especially since these limits are wider in respect of civil servants than in relation to private individuals (see, e.g., Le\u0161n\u00edk, cited above, \u00a7 53). Furthermore, as the fact of usurpation of land by V. had not been denied or refuted in the domestic proceedings, it appears that the applicant's factual allegations rested on what he believed to have been sufficient grounds.",

The first-instance court had premised its finding of liability on inaccuracy of factual statements and the insulting character of value-judgments, but the final judgment by the Moscow Regional Court maintained the finding of liability by reference to solely three expressions in the last paragraph of the letter (see paragraph 13 above).
