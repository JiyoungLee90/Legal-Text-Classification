The mere possibility of two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination.

However, as observed above, these facts were obviously a matter for examination before the Hrvatska Kostajnica Municipal Court and the Sisak County Court, and thus the request for the protection of legality was in fact more of a disguised appeal by the State Attorney\u2019s Office to secure an additional re-examination of those same facts than an attempt to secure the principle of legal certainty by preventing inconsistency in civil courts\u2019 judgments (see Pravednaya v. Russia, no. 69529/01, \u00a7 32, 18 November 2004).

In the Government\u2019s view, irrespective of the final judgment in his favour, the applicant\u2019s legitimate expectations as regards his salary had been a constant matter of dispute. Therefore, the mere fact that the applicant had enforced the pecuniary claim granted by the impugned civil courts\u2019 judgment did not alter the fact that he should have been aware that he might have to return part of the enforced amount. In any case, should the Court find that there had been interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights, the Government considered that such interference had amounted to a control of the use of property in the public interest of attaining legal certainty regarding the securing of rights under the Special State Support Act. Accordingly, given the number of disputes related to securing rights under the Special State Support Act and its social importance, the Government considered that the quashing of the final judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour through the legality review procedure had not placed an excessive individual burden on him.",

The principle of lawfulness also presupposes that the applicable provisions of domestic law are sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application (see Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a031443/96, \u00a7 147, ECHR 2004V). Furthermore, a deprivation of property can only be justified if it is shown to be \u201cin the public interest\u201d and if it satisfies the requirement of proportionality by striking a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights (see Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v.

It cannot be maintained, therefore, that the deprivation of property at issue was lawful, in the sense of the Convention. The present case thus concerns a failure to recognise the res judicata effect of a final judgment delivered in contentious proceedings. It cannot be considered that a public interest overriding the fundamental principle of legal certainty and the applicant\u2019s rights justified a re-examination of the dispute and the resulting deprivation of his possessions (see Tregubenko v.
