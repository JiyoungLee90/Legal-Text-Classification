An overcrowded prison entails cramped and unhygienic accommodation; a constant lack of privacy (even when performing such basic tasks as using a sanitary facility); reduced out-of-cell activities, due to demand outstripping the staff and facilities available; overburdened health-care services; increased tension and hence more violence between prisoners and between prisoners and staff.

Large\u00adcapacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives ...

The State is under an obligation to secure the attendance of an accused who is in custody (see, mutatis mutandis, Goddi v. , 9 April 1984, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 76). It is of capital importance that a defendant appear, both because of his right to a hearing and because of the need to verify the accuracy of his statements and compare them with those of witnesses (see Van Geyseghem v.  [GC], no. 26103/95, \u00a7 33, ECHR 1999I). The Court reiterates further that the trial court may exceptionally continue hearings where the accused is absent on account of illness, provided that his or her interests are sufficiently protected (see Ninn-Hansen v. Denmark (dec.), no. 28972/95, p.\u00a0351, ECHR 1999-V). However, where proceedings involve an assessment of the personality and character of the accused and his state of mind at the time of the offence and where their outcome could be of major detriment to him, it is essential to the fairness of the proceedings that he be present at the hearing and afforded the opportunity to participate in it together with his counsel (see Kremzow v. Austria, 21 September 1993, \u00a7 67, Series A no.\u00a0268-B; Zana v. Turkey, 25 November 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 71-73, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VII; and Pobornikoff v.

It is the very weakness of a mentally ill defendant which should enhance the need for supporting his rights. In this context, authorities must show requisite diligence in ensuring the accused\u2019s right to be present in an effective manner and must act particularly carefully when infringing upon that right, so as not to place the mentally ill at a disadvantage when compared with other defendants who do enjoy such a right (see, mutatis mutandis, F.C.B. v. Italy, 28 August 1991, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 208B). The Court is not convinced that the Russian courts complied with that responsibility in the present case.",

Furthermore, the applicant never appeared before the Circuit Court judges. In turn, the Court does not see any evidence convincingly demonstrating that the applicant\u2019s behaviour or his mental condition precluded his stating his case in open court. The Court would add that the applicant\u2019s inability to participate in the proceedings in person seemed to have resulted not from the seriousness of his mental condition, but rather from the lack of a legal provision in the domestic law which would recognise his right to attend the court hearings even in a limited number of situations. The domestic law replaced the applicant with his legal representative for all purposes relating to procedural participation in those proceedings and simply did not provide a possibility for the applicant to be present in person.",
