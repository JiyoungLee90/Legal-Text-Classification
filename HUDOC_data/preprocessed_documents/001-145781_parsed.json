However, the Court also observes that the conclusion of the forensic expert was challenged by the applicant\u2019s lawyer. In any event, the Court notes that the forensic examination is only one of the means for the investigation to secure the evidence during the examination of an illtreatment allegation. The Court notes that in the present case as there was no criminal inquiry in respect of the applicant\u2019s allegation of ill-treatment, the applicant, alleged perpetrators of the ill-treatment, other police officers, the applicant\u2019s lawyers, the applicant\u2019s cellmates or any other possible witness were not heard by the investigator. No explanation was given by the Government as to the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to conduct an investigation in this respect. The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that there was no effective investigation of the applicant\u2019s claim of ill-treatment.",

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

In particular, where an individual, when taken into police custody, is in good health, but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Tomasi v.

It appears from the documents submitted to the Court that during the criminal investigation the applicant was questioned only twice, at the beginning of the criminal investigation, respectively on 25\u00a0June\u00a02004, as a suspect, and on 26 June 2004, as an accused and in his statements the applicant admitted that his role had consisted in conducting surveillance over the victims\u2019 arrival to their house by car and notifying his accomplices by mobile phone. The applicant\u2019s brother and P.M., in their statements made during the investigation which were not submitted to the Court, also confirmed the applicant\u2019s involvement in the crime. The applicant was however never again questioned during the investigation after 26 June 2004, despite his express request for a new questioning (see\u00a0paragraph \u00a7 15 above). Moreover, it does not transpire from the case file that other further investigative actions, such as the determination of the applicant\u2019s whereabouts at the moment of the commission of the crime or organisation of a face-to-face confrontation between the applicant and his co-accused, which could have given more information about the applicant\u2019s participation in the crime was carried out during the investigation. In particular, taking into account the fact that the applicant was convicted of his role consisting in conducting surveillance over the victims\u2019 arrival and notifying his accomplices by mobile phone, it is regrettable that the investigation did not establish whether at the time of the commission of the crime the applicant\u2019s mobile phone had been within the coverage of the area where he should have conducted surveillance and whether he had called his accomplices after such a surveillance.",

The applicant\u2019s brother and P.M. also denied in court their statements concerning the applicant made during the investigation, alleging ill-treatment and stating that the applicant had not been involved in the commission of the crime. The domestic courts also referred to the statements that four police officers (R.H., K.H., K.G. and R.M.) had made at the trial hearing while they convicted the applicant (see paragraph 24 above).",

In particular, in their submissions R.M. stated that he had known only P.M. among the accused and K.G. described the circumstances of arrest and questioning of three accused (A.K., P.M. and A.S.) without mentioning the applicant. As to the statements made by R.H. and K.H., they stated in a general way that the accused had not been subjected to ill-treatment in police custody without further explanation. The Court thus considers that the statements that the applicant, his brother and P.M. had made during the investigation were the decisive evidence against the applicant, without which securing a conviction of the applicant would not have been possible. The Court points out in this regard that the Government also accepted that the applicant\u2019s conviction was mainly based on the statements that his brother and P.M. had made to the police (see\u00a0paragraph 65 above).",

However, in the present case although the Court could not establish a substantive violation of Article\u00a03 of the Convention in respect of the applicant\u2019s alleged ill-treatment while in police custody, it found that its inability to reach any conclusions in substance derived from the failure of the domestic authorities to conduct an effective investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegation of ill-treatment (see\u00a0paragraphs 47-62 above). Nevertheless the Court reiterates that particular considerations apply in respect of the use in criminal proceedings of evidence obtained in breach of Article 3. The use of such evidence, secured as a result of a violation of one of the core and absolute rights guaranteed by the Convention, always raises serious issues as to the fairness of the proceedings, even if the admission of such evidence was not decisive in securing a conviction (see \u0130\u00e7\u00f6z v. Turkey (dec.), no. 54919/00, 9\u00a0January\u00a02003; Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a054810/00, \u00a7\u00a7 99-104, ECHR 2006IX; and G\u00f6\u00e7men v.

In this connection, the Court reiterates that a higher degree of scrutiny should be applied to the assessment of statements by co-accused, because the position in which the accomplices find themselves while testifying is different from that of ordinary witnesses. They do not testify under oath, that is, without any affirmation of the truth of their statements which could have rendered them punishable for perjury for wilfully making untrue statements (see\u00a0Vladimir Romanov v. Russia, no. 41461/02, \u00a7 102, 24 July 2008). The Court notes in this regard that where doubts arise as to the reliability of a certain source of evidence, the need to corroborate it by evidence from other sources is correspondingly greater (see Lutsenko v. Ukraine, no. 30663/04, \u00a7 49, 18 December 2008).",

Although it is not the Court\u2019s task to verify whether the domestic courts made any substantive errors in that assessment, it is nevertheless required to review whether the courts gave reasons for their decisions in respect of any objections concerning the evidence produced (see Huseyn and Others\u00a0v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, nos. 35485/05, 45553/05, 35680/05 and 36085/05, \u00a7\u00a0211, 26\u00a0July 2011, and Erkapi\u0107 v.

Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85). As has been found above, the criminal proceedings in the present case did not comply with the requirements of fairness. In these circumstances, the most appropriate form of redress would, in principle, be the reopening of the proceedings in order to guarantee the conduct of the trial in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Somogyi v. Italy, no.\u00a067972/01, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2004IV; Shulepov v. Russia, no. 15435/03, \u00a7\u00a046, 26\u00a0June 2008; Maksimov\u00a0v. Azerbaijan, no. 38228/05, \u00a7 46, 8 October 2009; and Abbasov\u00a0v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 24271/05, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, 17 January 2008). The Court notes in this connection that the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Azerbaijan provides for a review of domestic criminal proceedings by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and remittal of the case for re-examination, if the Court finds a violation of the Convention (see\u00a0paragraph 37 above).",
