As is clear from section 3(5) of the Association Act [VereinsG], it is nevertheless legally possible for an association to be criminally liable [Strafgesetzwidrigkeit einer Vereinigung] because the association can form, through its members and through its representing organs, a collective will which is detached from the individual members and which develops its own purpose [Zweckrichtung] and can act independently. If the criminal law is breached as a result of this own purpose or of the independent actions of an association, all the conditions for applying the prohibition [Verbotstatbestand] are fulfilled. A decisive factor in this context is that the members\u2019 conduct can be attributed to the association. The character of the association must be shaped [pr\u00e4gen] by the criminal offences [Strafgesetzwidrigkeit] committed by its members. An association can strive concurrently for different aims; besides the legal aim laid down in its rules, it can also pursue criminal aims which it achieves through the conduct of its members. ...",

It is within the competency of the authority issuing the prohibition order and the administrative court to examine whether there has been a breach of criminal law [Gesetzeswidrigkeit]. However, it is not the purpose of the prohibition [Verbotstatbestand] to impose an additional sanction on individuals who have already violated criminal provisions.

The organisation\u2019s inherent momentum and its organised human and material resources facilitate and promote punishable acts.

It was sufficient, for the finding of an unconstitutional aim that justified the ban, for the programme, imagery and style to indicate an essential relationship with Nazism. The fact that an association aligned itself with the Nazi party (prohibited in Germany) or propagated a racial theory which was not in conformity with the constitutional prohibition of discrimination was sufficient to meet the conditions for banning the association.

The First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States permitted a State to ban \u201ctrue threats\u201d, which encompassed those statements where the speaker meant to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals. The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a prohibition on true threats protected individuals from the fear of violence and the disruption that fear engendered, as well as from the possibility that the threatened violence would occur. Intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word was a type of true threat, where a speaker directed a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. The First Amendment permitted Virginia to outlaw cross burnings done with the intent to intimidate, because burning a cross was a particularly virulent form of intimidation.",

They pointed out that, where the right to freedom of expression had been relied on by applicants to justify the publication of texts that infringed the very spirit of the Convention and the essential values of democracy, the European Commission of Human Rights had had recourse to Article 17 of the Convention, either directly or indirectly, in rejecting their arguments and declaring their applications inadmissible (examples included Glimmerveen and Hagenbeek v. the\u00a0Netherlands, nos. 8348/78 and 8406/78, Commission decision of 11 October 1979, Decisions and Reports (DR) 18, p. 187, and Marais v.

Poland (dec.), no.\u00a042264/98, ECHR 2004-VII), the Court had observed that \u201cthe general purpose of Article 17 is to prevent totalitarian groups from exploiting in their own interests the principles enunciated by the Convention\u201d. Similar conclusions had been reached in the cases of Norwood v.\u00a0the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 23131/03, ECHR 2004-XI), and Witzsch v.\u00a0Germany ((dec.), no. 7485/03, 13 December 2005); the Government referred by contrast to Vajnai v.

One such value is the coexistence of members of society free from racial segregation, without which a democratic society is inconceivable. The State cannot be required to wait, before intervening, until a political movement takes action to undermine democracy or has recourse to violence. Even if that movement has not made an attempt to seize power and the risk of its policy to democracy is not imminent, the State is entitled to act preventively if it is established that such a movement has started to take concrete steps in public life to implement a policy incompatible with the standards of the Convention and democracy (see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, \u00a7 102).",

The responsibilities originating in the particular constitutional role and legal privileges that apply to political parties in many member States of the Council of Europe may apply in the case of social organisations only to the extent that the latter do actually have a comparable degree of political influence. On the other hand, the Court is aware that the termination of the legal existence of the Association and the Movement was a sanction of considerable gravity, because it equated to stripping these groups of the legal, financial and practical advantages normally secured to registered associations in most jurisdictions (see paragraph 18 above). Therefore, any such measure must be supported by relevant and sufficient reasons, just as in the case of dissolution of a political party, although in the case of an association, given its more limited opportunities to exercise national influence, the justification for preventive restrictive measures may legitimately be less compelling than in the case of a political party. In view of the difference in the importance for a democracy between a political party and a non-political association, only the former deserves the most rigorous scrutiny of the necessity of a restriction on the right to associate (compare, per analogiam, the level of protection granted to political speech and to speech which does not concern matters of public interest, in Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 103, and Tammer v.\u00a0Estonia, no. 41205/98, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2001I). This distinction has to be applied with sufficient flexibility. As regards associations with political aims and influence, the level of scrutiny will depend on the actual nature and functions of the association in view of the circumstances of the case.",

In the latter connection the courts observed that the central theme of the Tat\u00e1rszentgy\u00f6rgy rally was \u201cGypsy criminality\u201d, a racist concept. The courts paid particular attention to the fact that the impugned rallies involved military-style uniforms, commands, salutes and formations as well as armbands reminiscent of Arrow Cross symbols. On appeal, this reasoning was extended to include considerations to the effect that the populations of the villages targeted by the Movement were a \u201ccaptive audience\u201d, because those citizens had not been in a position to avoid the extreme and exclusionary views conveyed by the Movement\u2019s actions.

Having regard to the fact that there were established organisational links between the Movement whose activists were present and the Association, the Court also finds that the intimidating effect of the rallies in Tat\u00e1rszentgy\u00f6rgy and elsewhere must have gained momentum \u2013 and indeed, have been multiplied \u2013 by virtue of the fact that the rallies were backed by a registered association benefiting from legal recognition.",

In the light of historical experience \u2013 such as that of Hungary in the wake of the era of Arrow Cross power \u2013 the reliance of an association on paramilitary demonstrations which express racial division and implicitly call for racebased action must have an intimidating effect on members of a racial minority, especially when they are in their homes and as such constitute a captive audience. In the Court\u2019s view, this exceeds the limits of the scope of protection secured by the Convention in relation to expression (see Vajnai, cited above) or assemblies and amounts to intimidation, which is \u2013 in the words of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in Virginia v. Black (see paragraph 31 above) \u2013 a \u201ctrue threat\u201d. The State is therefore entitled to protect the right of the members of the target groups to live without intimidation. This is particularly true because they were singled out on a racial basis and were intimidated on account of their belonging to an ethnic group. In the Court\u2019s view, a paramilitary march goes beyond the mere expression of a disturbing or offensive idea, since the message is accompanied by the physical presence of a threatening group of organised activists. Where the expression of ideas is accompanied by a form of conduct, the Court considers that the level of protection generally granted to freedom of expression may be reduced in the light of important public-order interests related to that conduct. If the conduct associated with the expression of ideas is intimidating or threatening or interferes with the free exercise or enjoyment by another of any Convention right or privilege on account of that person\u2019s race, these considerations cannot be disregarded even in the context of Articles 10 and 11.",

With regard to the dissolution of the Association, it is immaterial that the demonstrations, taken in isolation, were not illegal, and the Court is not called upon in the present case to determine to what extent the demonstrations amounted to exercise of the Convention right of assembly. It may be only in the light of the actual conduct of such demonstrations that the real nature and goals of an association become apparent. In the Court\u2019s view, organising a series of rallies allegedly in order to keep \u201cGypsy criminality\u201d at bay by means of paramilitary parading can be regarded as implementing a policy of racial segregation. In fact, the intimidating marches can be seen as constituting the first steps in the realisation of a certain vision of \u201claw and order\u201d which is racist in essence.",

Large-scale, coordinated intimidation \u2013 related to the advocacy of racially motivated policies which are incompatible with the fundamental values of democracy \u2013 may justify State interference with freedom of association, even within the narrow margin of appreciation applicable in the present case. The reason for this relates to the negative consequences which such intimidation has on the political will of the people. While the incidental advocacy of anti-democratic ideas is not sufficient in itself to justify banning a political party on the ground of compelling necessity (see paragraph 53 above), and even less so in the case of an association which cannot make use of the special status granted to political parties, the circumstances taken overall, and in particular any coordinated and planned actions, may constitute sufficient and relevant reasons for such a measure, especially where other potential forms of expression of otherwise shocking ideas are not directly affected (see paragraph 71 in fine below).",

However, it is satisfied that the authorities nevertheless chose the least intrusive \u2013 indeed, the only reasonable \u2013 course of action to deal with the issue. Moreover, it is to be noted that the domestic authorities had previously drawn the attention of the Association to the unlawful nature of the Movement\u2019s activities, a move which resulted only in formal compliance (see paragraph 9 above), to the extent that further rallies took place during the ongoing proceedings (see paragraph 15 above \u2013 compare S.H. and Others v. Austria [GC], no.\u00a057813/00, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2011). In the Court\u2019s view, the threat to the rights of others represented by the Movement\u2019s rallies could be effectively eliminated only by removing the organisational back-up of the Movement provided by the Association. Had the authorities acquiesced in the continued activities of the Movement and the Association by upholding their legal existence in the privileged form of an entity under the law on associations, the general public might have perceived this as legitimisation by the State of this menace. This would have enabled the Association, benefiting from the prerogatives of a legally registered entity, to continue to support the Movement, and the State would thereby have indirectly facilitated the orchestration of its campaign of rallies. Furthermore, the Court notes that no additional sanction was imposed on the Association or the Movement, or on their members, who were in no way prevented from continuing political activities in other forms (see, a fortiori, Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 133-34).

Previously, Committee of Ministers Recommendation No.\u00a0R\u00a0(97)\u00a020 had already required governments to establish a sound legal framework consisting of civil, criminal and administrative law provisions on hate speech, which covers all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify racial hatred, xenophobia, anti-Semitism or other forms of hatred based on intolerance, including intolerance expressed by aggressive nationalism and ethnocentrism, discrimination and hostility against minorities, migrants and people of immigrant origin. In addition, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) of the Council of Europe has, since its inception, addressed the activities of certain groups which have an openly anti-Roma and anti-Semitic discourse. In its very first General Policy Recommendation, ECRI suggested the criminalisation of any oral, written, audio-visual and other forms of expression, including the electronic media, inciting to hatred, discrimination or violence against racial, ethnic, national or religious groups or against their members on the ground that they belong to such a group, as well as the production, distribution and storage for distribution of the material in question. Criminal prosecution of offences of a racist or xenophobic nature should be given a high priority and be actively and consistently undertaken. ECRI further advised banning racist organisations where it is considered that this would contribute to the struggle against racism. Noting that Roma suffer throughout Europe from persisting prejudices, ECRI has specifically recommended that States take the appropriate measures to ensure that justice is fully and promptly done in cases concerning violations of the fundamental rights of Roma. More recently, on 1 February 2012, the Committee of Ministers adopted the \u201cDeclaration on the Rise of Anti-Gypsyism and Racist Violence against Roma in Europe\u201d, expressing its deep concern about the rise of anti-Gypsyism, anti-Roma rhetoric and violent attacks against Roma, and calling on public authorities at all levels to conduct in a speedy and effective manner the necessary investigations of all crimes committed against Roma and identify any racist motives for such acts.

In its Third Opinion on Hungary, the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities found that \u201cHungary is currently facing a worrying rise in intolerance and racism, chiefly aimed at Roma\u201d. Subsequently, the Committee of Ministers approved a Resolution which determined that, \u201cIn recent years, the Roma have increasingly been victims of displays of intolerance, hostility and racially motivated violence. Hate speech and racism in public statements, and in certain media, is also increasing, which is of deep concern\u201d. Both the United Nations Human Rights Committee and the United Nations Committee against Torture expressed their concern at the virulent and widespread anti-Roma statements by public figures and the media as well as indications of rising anti-Semitism in Hungary, and at reports of a disproportionately high number of Roma in prisons and ill-treatment of and discrimination against Roma by those responsible for law enforcement. In his report on Hungary, Githu Muigai, United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, expressed deep concern at the growth of paramilitary organisations with racist platforms which target Roma.",

The use of the expression \u201cGypsy crime\u201d, which suggests that there is a link between crime and a certain ethnicity, constitutes a racist form of speech intended to fuel feelings of hatred against the targeted ethnic group. This expression reflects a clearly divided view of society into \u201cthem\u201d, the Roma, perpetrators of crimes, and \u201cus\u201d, the \u201cethnic\u201d Hungarians, the victims of their crimes. Such sweeping generalisations attributing negative behaviour and characteristics are made solely on the basis of the target group\u2019s origin and ethnicity.

A holistic approach to these freedoms is called for under international human rights law, especially with regard to the applicable restrictions. The exercise of freedom of expression carries special duties, specified in Article 29 \u00a7 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), among which the obligation not to disseminate racist ideas is of particular importance, and Article 20 \u00a7 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), according to which any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law. This prohibition is valid not only for racist expression, but also for assemblies or associations which promote racism. In some cases, the dissemination of racism through speech, assembly or association may even be instrumental in the \u2018destruction of rights\u2019, warranting the application of the provisions contained in Article 30 of the UDHR, Article 5 of the ICCPR and Article 17 of the Convention.",

Thus, dissolution was a proportionate measure in the face of the Association\u2019s rhetoric and activities, which denied the affected persons the right to respect as human beings and jeopardised their safety and public order.",

Yet the Association did not take this opportunity; rather, it repeated its unlawful activities, paving the way for a more severe reaction of the domestic authorities. There is therefore no contradiction between the dissolution of the Association and the official tolerance of its parades during a certain period of time. Once that trial period had passed, the dissolution of the Association was the only adequate means to react to the danger it represented to the rights of third persons and public order.",
