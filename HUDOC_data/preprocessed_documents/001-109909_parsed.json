The order of 18 September 2006, however, was final, and no judicial review proceedings could have been initiated. In these circumstances, although it does not appear unlikely that a court could reconsider its own order even when it is not amenable to judicial review, in the lack of any procedural rules in this respect the Court is not convinced that a request from the applicant to this effect should be regarded as an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Furthermore, the Court cannot but note the applicant\u2019s statement that she refrained from any action because she intended to comply with the order to appear. The Government have not argued that there was an established practice on the basis of which it should have been clear to the applicant that the police escort ordered by the court would amount to a two-day deprivation of liberty and that she would have to spend the night in prison. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies should be dismissed.",

At the hearing on 27 May 2005 the District Court noted that the applicant\u2019s presence was not mandatory. In these circumstances the trial court was competent to decide whether to deem the applicant\u2019s presence necessary or to proceed with the determination of the dispute in her absence so as to avoid any further delay. The Court notes in this respect that the domestic court did not specify the legal grounds for its order and did not state expressly that the applicant\u2019s attendance was necessary for establishing the truth pursuant to Article 269 (2) of the 2006 CCP (see paragraph 16 above) but rather justified it with the need to secure her own procedural rights (see paragraph 13 above). Furthermore, the application of Article 71 (2) of the 2006 CCP also appears problematic since the applicant neither absconded nor was without a permanent address (see paragraph 17 above). However, the Court does not find it necessary to determine this point, as, for the reasons which follow, it considers that the applicant\u2019s detention in any event was disproportionate to the aim pursued.",

The distance between her home town and the town where the hearing was held, 160 km, was not such as to justify such a long period of detention. In fact, she spent most of that time in prison (see paragraph 14 above) The Court is not persuaded that the authorities could not have taken less radical measures in order to secure the applicant\u2019s attendance in court. Moreover, by arresting her one day earlier they did not even give her a chance to show good faith and comply with the court order of her free will. In view of these circumstances, the Court considers that the authorities failed to strike a fair balance between the need to ensure the fulfilment of the applicant\u2019s obligation to attend a court hearing and her right to liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Epple v. , no. 77909/01, 24 March 2005, and Vasileva, cited above).",
