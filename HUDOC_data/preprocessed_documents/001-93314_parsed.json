In particular, it was found that T.B. had fired the three shots without any absolute necessity, in breach of the relevant provisions of the Police Activities Act and various ministerial instructions. The court observed that T.B. had used the gun in the absence of a real threat to the life of a police officer or third persons, and without having made any attempts to verify the identity and the age of the driver of the vehicle. In addition, it was observed that T.B. had not given the applicant\u2019s son any time to react after the two warning shots and had immediately fired the third shot from a rather long distance. T.B. was thus found to be responsible for recklessly depriving the applicant\u2019s son of his life. He was sentenced to one year and nine months\u2019 imprisonment, fined 1,250 Lithuanian litai (LTL, approximately 361.48 euros (EUR)) and barred from employment with law enforcement authorities for a period of five years. The court also awarded the applicant pecuniary damages against the Ministry of Interior in the amount of LTL 5,216.30 (approximately EUR 1,508.47) for funeral expenses. The court did not examine the applicant\u2019s claim for non-pecuniary damage, having ruled that she was entitled to satisfaction of that claim in separate civil proceedings.",

However, Article 65 of the Code on Criminal Procedure, in force until 1\u00a0May 2003, precluded the courts from deciding in the criminal proceedings on an award in respect of the non-pecuniary damage suffered by the victim of the crime. Consequently, in their judgments and decisions the domestic courts had repeatedly indicated that as regards non-pecuniary damage caused by the death of her son the applicant should institute separate civil proceedings and, furthermore, expressis verbis acknowledged her right to have that claim satisfied. Nonetheless, the applicant had never lodged any such civil claim.",

To prove that they referred to domestic case-law, namely to a decision adopted by the Court of Appeal on 24\u00a0November 2006 in a civil case, by which a civil claimant was awarded non-pecuniary damages amounting to LTL 75,000 (approximately EUR 21,739) from the Chief Police Commissariat, in respect of damage suffered due to a crime \u2013 violation of the traffic safety rules causing serious injury to the applicant \u2013 committed by a police officer, and of which that officer had previously been convicted in a criminal case. As another example of the relevant domestic case-law the Government submitted a decision of the Court of Appeal of 10\u00a0April 2006 granting a civil claim for LTL 100,000 (approximately EUR 28,985) as compensation for non-pecuniary damage suffered by a pupil at a secondary school because of a crime committed by the teacher, who also had previously been convicted in a criminal case of injuring that pupil. Lastly, the Government drew the Court\u2019s attention to the decision of the Supreme Court of 12\u00a0June 2006, adopted in a civil case, instituted for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage suffered due to a crime. The persons responsible for that damage had previously been convicted in a criminal case of causing serious physical injury; the Supreme Court amended the decisions of the lower-instance courts and increased the award of non-pecuniary damage suffered to LTL 47,000 (approximately EUR 13,623). From the above the Government concluded that a separate civil action for non-pecuniary damage which the applicant had suffered due to the death of her son offered reasonable prospects of success and therefore was a domestic remedy which the applicant should have exhausted under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

She insisted that her claim should have been examined in the criminal proceedings, especially taking into account that, in her view, under the rules of the new Code of Criminal Procedure the civil claim in respect of the non-pecuniary damage was to be examined in the criminal case, other than in exceptional circumstances. Moreover, she based her civil claims not only on provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but also on Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention as well as on Article 30 of the Lithuanian Constitution. The applicant argued that she had raised the issue of examination of the civil action in the criminal case at all court instances and therefore had exhausted the available domestic remedies.",

Moreover, as is apparent from the domestic case-law examples the Government provided, a claim for compensation in the civil courts would have had a fair prospect of success (see paragraph 35 above). Yet, the applicant did not avail herself of that opportunity.

The very same day and the following days various procedural steps were undertaken in this respect, such as an initial on-site inspection, official inquiry, examination of the scene of the crime, questioning of witnesses, and ballistic and medical examinations. The \npre-trial investigation was thorough and objective and the case was never returned to the prosecutors for further investigative measures; the courts were therefore able to duly establish all the relevant facts of the incident and secure the police officer\u2019s full accountability for his role in the tragedy. Lastly, the Government argued that there was no manifest disproportion between the gravity of the crime and the punishment imposed on T.B.

What is more, on the same and the following days many other investigative actions were carried out (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). Accordingly, it can be considered that the investigation proceeded at a good pace. The Court also notes that on 27\u00a0September 2001 the prosecutor recognised the applicant as the victim of the crime, thus conferring upon her the status of a participant in the criminal proceedings and granting her access to the investigation and the trial. Moreover, it can be deemed that the official investigation was proper and effective, since it allowed the establishment both of the cause of death of the applicant\u2019s son and the identity of the person responsible for it. As regards the trial aspect, the first-instance court convicted T.B. on 14 March 2003 and the trial came to an end with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 1 June 2004, which, in the circumstances of the case, the Court considers to be reasonably expeditious.",

While doing that, the Court should grant substantial deference to the national courts in the choice of appropriate sanctions for the death caused by the State agent. However, it must still exercise a certain power of review and intervene in cases of manifest disproportion between the gravity of the act and the punishment imposed (see Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran v. Turkey, no. 42942/02, \u00a7 66, 8 April 2008).",

In particular, the criminal proceedings did concern the protection of the right to life, given that the State agent was prosecuted and subsequently convicted not only of abuse of office but also of manslaughter (see, a contrario, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116, ECHR 2004XII), and sentenced to two\u00a0years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. The Court cannot overlook the fact that the execution of that sentence was suspended; however it was suspended for three years, which is the maximum time for suspension allowed by Article 75 of the new Criminal Code. What is more, in the past the Court has found a suspended sentence in cases which concerned the authorities\u2019 attempt to arrest a suspect not to be in contradiction per se with the State\u2019s obligation to punish those who unlawfully take the life of another (see D\u00f6lek v. Turkey, \nno. 39541/98, \u00a7\u00a7 79-83, 2 October 2007, and, a contrario, Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 66-72). The Court also notes that it has previously found a violation of Article 2 in cases where police officers whose actions resulted in death continued serving in the police (see Nikolova and Velichkova v. Bulgaria, no. 7888/03, \u00a7 63, 20 December 2007). However, in the instant case the authorities dismissed T.B. from the police and no indication was given to the Court that he has ever been \nre-employed by the police or other law enforcement authorities. In the light of the foregoing, the Court cannot hold that the punishment which the State imposed on T.B. was disproportionate in view of the gravity of the act he had committed.",
