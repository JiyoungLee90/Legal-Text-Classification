The applicant's petition under Article 130 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution was not an effective remedy which the applicant was required to use (see \u0160upa v.  (dec.), no. 72991/01, 6 February 2007, with further references). No award should therefore be made in that respect.\u00a0As to the Convention proceedings, the Court awards EUR 1,250 corresponding approximately to the sum claimed.",
