Treatment has been held by the Court to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also \u201cdegrading\u201d because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them. In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24888/94, \u00a7 71, ECHR 1999-IX).",

Bearing in mind the authorities\u2019 obligation to account for injuries caused to persons within their control, in custody, and in the absence of a convincing and plausible explanation by the Government in the instant case, the Court finds it established to the standard of proof required in Convention proceedings that the first applicant\u2019s injuries were the result of the treatment of which he complained and for which the Government bore responsibility (see Mehmet Emin Y\u00fcksel v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 40154/98, \u00a7 30, 20 July 2004).",

It also resulted in long-term damage to his health. Indeed, his medical records reveal that many months after the illtreatment he continued to suffer from its consequences, in particular he had a spinal disc deformed and developed post-traumatic arthritis of shoulder and wrist joints (see paragraphs 22 to 25 above). Moreover, it appears that the use of force was aimed at debasing the first applicant, driving him into submission and making him confess to a criminal offence that he had not committed (see paragraphs 16 and 18 above).

However, it considers that the second applicant cannot be blamed for undermining the effectiveness of the investigation by a belated application to the competent domestic authorities. The Court has emphasised on several occasions that persons held in custody are often in a stressful situation and may be vulnerable to pressure (see Mammadov v. Azerbaijan, no. 34445/04, \u00a7 74, 11 January 2007). It takes note of the second applicant\u2019s allegation, which was not disputed by the Government, that until February 1999 he had had no access to legal assistance and had not been allowed to correspond with the outside world (see paragraph 45 above). The second applicant was therefore prevented from bringing his claim of ill-treatment immediately to the attention of the authorities.",

The Court notes in this connection that allegations of illtreatment in police custody are extremely difficult for the victim to substantiate if he or she has been isolated from the outside world, without access to doctors, lawyers, family or friends who could provide support and assemble the necessary evidence (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a097, Reports 1996-VI). The authorities must take whatever reasonable steps they can to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including inter alia forensic evidence (see Bat\u0131 and Others v. Turkey, nos. 33097/96 and 57834/00, \u00a7 134, ECHR 2004-IV (extracts)). The Court therefore considers that the failure to secure the forensic evidence in a timely manner was one of the important factors contributing to the ineffectiveness of the investigation in the present case. A timely medical examination could have enabled the medical expert to determine whether the second applicant had sustained any injuries in the circumstances described by him.",

Given that no documents relating to the inquiry were submitted by the Government, it is impossible to establish what investigative measures were taken (see paragraph 100 above for similar reasoning in respect of the first applicant). An additional inquiry was apparently conducted in June 2003. It, however, follows from the materials in the Court\u2019s possession that it was limited to the questioning of the police officers in charge of the criminal case against the second applicant. There is no evidence in the documents submitted by the Government that any other investigative measures were taken.

The prosecutor had the legal power to interview the police officers, summon witnesses, visit the scene of the incident, collect forensic evidence and take all other crucial steps for the purpose of establishing the truth of the second applicant\u2019s account. His role was critical not only to the pursuit of criminal proceedings against the possible perpetrators of the offences but also to the pursuit by the second applicant of other remedies to redress the harm he had allegedly suffered (see Maksimov, cited above, \u00a7 86).",

This fact restricted his participation in the investigation and prevented him from exercising the rights attached to the procedural status of victim, including the right to lodge applications or the right to put questions to the medical expert. The Court is particularly struck by the prosecutor\u2019s statement that, having the procedural status of witness, the second applicant had no right to be informed about the outcome of the inquiry (see paragraph 53 above). It cannot therefore be said that the second applicant\u2019s right to participate effectively in the investigation was secured (compare Denis\u00a0Vasilyev v.
