In reaching this conclusion, the Court takes into account that the case was not complex (see paragraphs 4 and 5 above) and that the applicants were not responsible for any significant delay, the adjournments requested by them having been necessary for the collection of evidence (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above). Moreover, numerous adjournments and other delays were imputable to the authorities: the failure to secure the presence of experts appointed by the court and of witnesses (see paragraphs 10, 11, 12 and 14 above), the failure to undertake efficient measures to avoid delays caused by false security alerts (see paragraph 9 above), defective summons (see paragraphs 7 and 17 above), inactivity periods (see paragraphs 19 and 21-24 above) and a formalistic approach to procedural requirements (see paragraph\u00a016 above). Finally, in the particular circumstances of rampant inflation the courts failed to display diligence in conducting the proceedings despite the fact that the value of the applicants' claim was bound to diminish significantly with the passage of time (see paragraphs 5, 16, 18, 20 and 26 above).",
