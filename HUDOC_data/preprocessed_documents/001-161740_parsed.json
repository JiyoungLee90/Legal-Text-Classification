That was both a breach of the rules of procedure and an indication that there did not exist a reasonable suspicion that Mr Dzhabarov had committed an offence. The lack of such suspicion was also demonstrated by the absence of any evidence in the police file. Two police reports, drawn up later and suggesting that Mr Dzhabarov had been detained with a view to elucidating whether he was implicated in the robbery of a petrol station and a number of burglaries, could not ex post facto justify his detention; they moreover contained discrepancies and were based on investigative steps carried out after Mr Dzhabarov\u2019s arrest. The court went on to say that the order had been issued more than nine hours after Mr\u00a0Dzhabarov\u2019s de facto arrest, which was out of line with the object and purpose of the law. The court partly allowed Mr Dzhabarov\u2019s claim for costs, awarding him 200 Bulgarian levs (BGN) (102 euros (EUR)) in lawyers\u2019 fees and BGN 10 (EUR 5) in court fees.",

The police were given the power to detain persons suspected of offences with a view to being able to investigate those offences. That is why the law did not require conclusive evidence of an offence but simply information enabling the police to form a reasonable suspicion in that regard. The police detention log showed that Mr Petkov had been brought to the police station at 3.10\u00a0a.m. on 20 December 2007, whereas the three witness statements submitted by the police in the judicial review proceedings in support of their contention that Mr Petkov was suspected of an offence spoke of a robbery of a petrol station committed at 4.50 a.m. This showed that, at the time of Mr\u00a0Petkov\u2019s arrest, the police did not have a reasonable suspicion of him committing an offence. It was also striking that although Mr Petkov had in fact been arrested at 3.10 a.m. on 20 December 2007, the order for his detention said that his detention had started at 1.30 p.m. that day. The court partly allowed Mr Petkov\u2019s claim for costs, awarding him BGN\u00a0200 (EUR\u00a0102) in lawyers\u2019 fees and BGN 10 (EUR 5) in court fees.",

It noted that it was not disputed that between about 11 a.m. and about 3.30 p.m. on 9 September 2006 Ms Nikolova had been detained by officers of the Sandanski police. That was further proved by the register of detainees kept by the Sandanski police station and the statements of the officers concerned. However, a claimant in proceedings under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act (see paragraph 47 below) had to make out all elements of the tort under that provision: a wrongful act or omission by officials, damage, and a sufficient causal link between the two. The claimant bore the full burden of proof in relation to each of those, and the lack of any element meant that the claim should fail. However, Ms Nikolova had not categorically shown that she had suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result of her arrest and detention. There was no evidence that the officers concerned had done anything to hurt her dignity. Their testimony, which was internally consistent and matched the rest of the evidence, showed that Ms\u00a0Nikolova had not been subjected to any physical or psychological abuse. Ms Nikolova\u2019s evidence that one of the officers had acted rudely was contradicted by the evidence of all officers and was vague; it could not therefore be credited. It was not supported by the statement of Mr B.T. either. Ms Nikolova\u2019s assertions in respect of the damage that she had allegedly suffered were in addition very general and could not be upheld. The police had been apprised of a possible offence and had detained her for less than twenty-four hours to elucidate the case, as possible under section\u00a064 of the MIAA (see paragraph 42 below). Had the detention lasted more than twenty-four hours, the outcome of the case would probably have been different.",

This is because the requirements of this provision concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies and the six-month period, which are combined in a single sentence whose grammatical construction implies such correlation, are closely intertwined. The remedies to be taken into account are those capable of effectively and sufficiently redressing the wrong which is the subject of the application (see Nikolova and Velichkova v. Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a07888/03, 13 March 2007, and Nenkov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 24128/02, 7\u00a0October 2008).",

Bulgaria, no. 68294/01, \u00a7 45, 6 November 2008, and Petkov and Profirov v. Bulgaria, nos. 50027/08 and 50781/09, \u00a7\u00a035, 24 June 2014). Taken in isolation, proceedings for judicial review of the detention order are usually not capable of providing sufficient redress because all they can achieve is an ex post facto judicial declaration that the order was unlawful. They must thus be seen as a mere first step in a two-step system of remedies rather than as being entirely distinct from the claim for damages to which they open the way. In such situations, the \u201cfinal decision\u201d is therefore not that given at the end of the proceedings for judicial review of the detention order, but the one given at the end of the ensuing proceedings for damages. In the cases of the two applicants whose detention was based on a detention order \u2013 Mr Dzhabarov and Mr Petkov \u2013 those decisions were given less than six months before they lodged their applications (see paragraphs 1, 21 and 30 above).",

The criminal proceedings later opened against her had been discontinued for lack of evidence that she had committed an offence.

The fact that the prosecuting authorities decided to drop the charges against her on the basis of findings made in the course of their further inquiries does not alter that (see X v. the United Kingdom, no. 8083/77, Commission decision of 13 March 1980, Decisions and Reports 19, p. 223).",

The Supreme Administrative Court has held that the order must be issued immediately and that its absence could in itself affect the lawfulness of police detention (see paragraphs 45 and 46 above). The point was raised in the proceedings for damages brought by Ms Nikolova but not expressly addressed by the Bulgarian courts because they dismissed her claim on different grounds. However, failure to observe domestic law gives rise to a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which refers directly back to that law, and even relatively minor procedural irregularities may result in such a breach (see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a072-73, 9 July 2009; Creang\u0103, cited above, \u00a7 101; and Voskuil v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, no. 64752/01, \u00a7 83, 22 November 2007). The absence of a written order in Ms Nikolova\u2019s case cannot either be described as a minor procedural omission, and her attempt to have that issue reviewed at national level did not succeed. In view of the importance of the right to liberty and the need to prevent arbitrary deprivations of it, the Court has consistently emphasised that detention needs to be attended by sufficient formalities (see Kurt v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, \u00a7 125, Reports 1998-III; Anguelova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, \u00a7 154, ECHR 2002-IV; and Menesheva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 59261/00, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2006-III). Indeed, in Anguelova (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0155), the Court found that police detention not based on a written order was in breach of the previous version of section 65(1) of the MIAA, section\u00a035(1) of the 1993 Act (see paragraph 43 above), and thus contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Detention carried out in breach of that provision can normally be presumed \u2013 although this presumption can be rebutted \u2013 to cause some mental suffering to the detainee not only while it lasts but also thereafter. Such suffering, which will not necessarily rise to the level of a psychological trauma or disorder, or produce outward manifestations or symptoms, does not invariably lend itself to extrinsic proof, such as expert psychiatric or medical evidence. An automatic refusal to award any compensation to a person who has been unlawfully detained simply because he or she has not provided such evidence is therefore excessively formalistic and in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 5 of the Convention (see Danev v. Bulgaria, no. 9411/05, \u00a7\u00a7 34-35, 2\u00a0September 2010). Indeed, in Iovchev v. Bulgaria (no. 41211/98, \u00a7 146, 2\u00a0February 2006), the Court held the same with respect to the refusal of the Bulgarian courts to award any compensation for mental suffering allegedly sustained as a result of inhuman and degrading conditions of detention (see also Ananyev and Others v.
