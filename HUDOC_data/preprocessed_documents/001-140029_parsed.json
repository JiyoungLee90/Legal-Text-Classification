The prosecutor noted that, by declaring the applicant company\u2019s aircraft ownerless and selling them, as well as by unlawfully seizing its L-410s (see also paragraphs 104 and 106 below), the authorities had caused the applicant company \u201cdirect pecuniary damage of over one million Ukrainian hryvnias\u201d. On 15 December 2004 the supervision department of the GPO quashed the ruling of 9 December 2004 as premature.

It considered that the courts had made a premature finding that the applicant company was the owner of the aircraft. The fresh examination of the case was supposed to clarify, including with the help of a forensic graphological examination, whether the contracts of sale of 30 July and 28\u00a0\u00a0December\u00a01999 (see paragraph 9 above) were authentic and in compliance with the Russian legislation as indicated therein.",

Pursuant to the instructions of the Supreme Court, it had undertaken a forensic graphological examination of the contract of sale of 30\u00a0July\u00a01999 and the additional agreement of 28\u00a0December 1999, and had found the signatures on them to be authentic. The court further established that the transaction had taken place in compliance with Russian legislation as indicated in the contracts. It underlined that the aircraft had been declared ownerless despite the fact that the case file had contained copies of the certificates of their registration with the Ministry of Transport of Ukraine of 28 March 2000 (see paragraph 11 above). Furthermore, the Russian company S. had confirmed to the court in writing that it had sold the planes at issue to the applicant company. Accordingly, the court concluded that there were no reasons not to consider the contract of sale of 30 July 1999 as appropriate proof of the applicant company\u2019s title to the planes. The court also found that the Bila Tserkva Administration had breached the procedure for identifying and declaring the property ownerless.",

Turkey [GC], 16 September 1996, \u00a7 69, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV, and Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54, Reports 1996-VI).

The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, among other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among many authorities, Immobiliare Saffi v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a022774/93, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 1999V, and Visti\u0146\u0161 and Perepjolkins v.

The requirement of lawfulness, within the meaning of the Convention, demands compliance with the relevant provisions of domestic law and compatibility with the rule of law, which includes freedom from arbitrariness (see Hentrich v.

The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole. The requisite balance will not be found if the person concerned has had to bear an individual and excessive burden (see, among other authorities, Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, \u00a7\u00a7 69 and 73, Series A no.\u00a052).

I do not feel reassured that, within the total amount of EUR\u00a05,000,000, there is a part that reasonably relates to the actual market value of used aircraft. There are elements in the file which suggest that the amount of EUR 5,000,000 may be much higher than the total price paid by the applicant company for the aircraft in 1999 and 2000 (see paragraph 259, referring to paragraphs 9 and 101).
