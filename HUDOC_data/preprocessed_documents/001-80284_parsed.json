The court based its judgment on the statements of Ms Y., the applicant's confession made at the beginning of the investigation \u2013 although he later changed his statements and pleaded not guilty before the court \u2013 and on a certain amount of indirect evidence, such as statements by indirect witnesses and expert reports. At the hearing the court also examined the applicant's doctor, Mr R., who had monitored the applicant since April\u00a02000 in connection with a hip fracture he had sustained in August\u00a01999, with a view to determining whether the applicant would have been able to commit the offence, taking into account his injury. Mr R. stated that because of the improvement of his state of health the applicant had not been operated on but had been recommended not to lift weights of over 12 kilograms. The court also found the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment unsubstantiated. The court reached that conclusion relying on oral evidence given at the hearing by another policeman, a medical certificate according to which the applicant had no injuries that could have been caused on the date of the alleged ill-treatment, and the results of the investigation conducted by the public prosecutor's office. Advocate\u00a0K. assisted the applicant in the proceedings before the trial court. The court convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to 11 years and six\u00a0months' imprisonment.",

The court held that the trial court had been correct to rely on Ms Y.'s statements made during the preliminary investigation because it had been impossible for her to appear at the hearing. The court also held that there had been no substantial breaches of procedural requirements, including any alleged breach of the applicant's right to defence, such as to render the conviction unlawful.",

It is primarily for the national court to decide whether the requested measure is relevant and essential for deciding a case (see mutatis mutandis H. v. France, judgment of 24\u00a0October\u00a01989, Series A no. 162A, p. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 60-61). At the hearing in the present case the trial court examined Mr R., the doctor who had monitored the applicant in connection with a fracture of his hip, precisely to determine whether the applicant would have been physically able to commit the offence. The Court finds that the trial court therefore had sufficient information on this aspect of the case.
