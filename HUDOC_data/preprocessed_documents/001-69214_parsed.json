In this respect, it has previously held that the disappearance and unacknowledged detention of a person suspected by the authorities of PKK involvement could be considered as lifethreatening in the general context of the situation in south-east Turkey in 1993 (see Timurta\u015f, cited above, \u00a7 85). Having regard to the cases involving disappearances which it has been called upon to examine and which occurred in 1994, the Court concludes that that general context still pertained in that year (see, for instance, \u00c7i\u00e7ek v. Turkey, no. 25704/94, 27\u00a0February 2001; \u0130rfan Bilgin v. Turkey, no. 25659/94, ECHR 2001-VIII; Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, 18 June 2002; \u0130pek v.
