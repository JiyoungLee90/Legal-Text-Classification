Her intellectual capabilities are, owing to the above-mentioned [conditions], additionally compromised on the psychoorganic type. During the interview we noticed confabulations in the content of her thoughts, that is to say fabricated content, a paranoid position, in particular as regards her close family and the employees of the social welfare centre, and infantile explanation. The respondent lacks insight into her condition. All this led us [to conclude] that the respondent does not possess sufficient intellectual capacity to adequately protect her own rights and interests, and because of her lack of insight she might also jeopardise the rights and interests of others.

She argued that she had purchased the flat where she lived herself and there was no danger that she would give it up. The assertion that she was paranoid as regards her close family members was not correct. She had had troubled relations with her son at times because he had moved into her flat with his girlfriend and her daughter and had had an interest in having her removed from the flat and placed in a home. Therefore, she had successfully sought their eviction from her flat. She had also changed her bank and her son no longer had authority to use her credit card. She lived a peaceful life, and was a member of the Association of Disabled Persons with Cerebral Palsy and Poliomyelitis. The court conducting the proceedings had had the chance to establish that normal communication with her was possible and that she lived in a tidy flat.

The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, for example, Mifsud v.\u00a0France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, \u00a7\u00a015, ECHR 2002-VIII). The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances. To be effective, a remedy must be capable of directly remedying the impugned state of affairs (see Balogh v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a047940/99, \u00a7\u00a030, 20\u00a0July\u00a02004).",

Furthermore, the psychiatrists had had no knowledge of how she had been spending her money and disposing of her assets. She had had troubled relations with her son at times because he had spent her money on his own needs when she had been hospitalised, instead of paying the bills for her. In addition, he had moved into her flat with his girlfriend and her daughter, and had thus had an interest in the applicant being removed from the flat and placed in a home. Therefore, she had successfully sought their eviction from her flat. She had also changed her bank and her son no longer had authority to use her credit card. The court conducting the proceedings had had the opportunity to establish that normal communication with her was possible and that she lived in a tidy flat. The Centre had not proven the need to partly deprive her of her legal capacity. Only a bookkeeping expert could have established the facts concerning her debts.

However, given that it was the Centre itself that had instituted the proceedings for deprivation of the applicant\u2019s legal capacity, her appointment as the applicant\u2019s legal guardian put her into a conflict of loyalty between her employer and the applicant as her ward. In the present case the guardian gave her full consent to the application for partial deprivation of the applicant\u2019s legal capacity, and made no submissions as regards the evidence to be presented. Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant engaged the services of a lawyer at her own expense (see paragraph 10 above), it cannot but be noted that national law does not provide for obligatory representation of the person concerned by an independent lawyer, despite the very serious nature of the issues concerned and the possible consequences of such proceedings (see M.S. v. Croatia, no. 36337/10, \u00a7 104, 25 April 2013). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that in cases of mentally disabled persons the States have an obligation to ensure that they are afforded independent representation, enabling them to have their Convention complaints examined before a court or other independent body (see Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu v. Romania [GC], no. 47848/08, \u00a7 161, 17 July 2014).",
