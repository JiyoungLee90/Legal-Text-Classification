He added that there was still a clear and present danger associated with the attempted coup.

The magistrate explained that the independence and impartiality of the judiciary sought to protect the fundamental values of a democratic society, that these were universal and modern values, and that the general principles of law included a prohibition on abuses of rights and abuses of power. He added that when the judiciary was used in such a way as to be diverted from its true function and purpose, the justice system risked losing its legitimacy. There had been an attempted uprising against the democratic regime, as attested by reports from various authorities and the decision by the HSK, and specific facts giving rise to strong suspicion had been established. Furthermore, the offences of which the suspects were accused were among the \u201ccatalogue offences\u201d listed in Article\u00a0100 \u00a7\u00a03 of the CCP. In addition, the evidence and suspicion needed for a detention order to be made at the investigation stage was not of the same nature or scale as was required to reach a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt at the trial stage, and it was therefore unnecessary, when ordering pre-trial detention, to have the proof that would be needed to establish guilt. There was a risk of absconding given the nature of the alleged offence and the potential sentence, and at the start of the investigation stage there was also a risk of tampering with evidence. The magistrate therefore concluded that judicial supervision would be insufficient and that detention was not a disproportionate measure.",

Bearing in mind the features of that application, it was acceptable that its use or installation with a view to use should have been treated by the investigating authorities as evidence of a link to FET\u00d6/PDY. It referred in that connection to its Ayd\u0131n Yavuz and Others judgment, delivered on 20 June 2017. For that reason, in view of the features of the messaging software in question, the Constitutional Court found that the investigating authorities or courts that had ordered the applicant\u2019s detention could not be said to have pursued a groundless and arbitrary approach in accepting that his use of the application could, in the circumstances of the case, be regarded as \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of the commission of the offence of membership of FET\u00d6/PDY. In addition, having regard to the reasons mentioned in the decisions ordering the detention and dismissing the applicant\u2019s subsequent objection, the Constitutional Court held it could not be maintained that no reasons had been given for the detention or that it was a disproportionate measure.",

Arguing that the case concerned an offence committed in connection with or in the course of his official duties, he submitted that the subject matter fell within the jurisdiction of the Court of Cassation.

The criminal courts of first instance had previously been responsible for a considerable variety of tasks in addition to their judicial function. The tasks in question were not taken into account for the purpose of judges\u2019 career progression but were regarded as ancillary and little attention was paid to them as a result. The magistrates\u2019 courts were therefore established to take decisions requiring judicial intervention at the investigation stage. In this way, the purpose of the new legislation was to promote specialisation regarding preventive measures and to ensure more effective protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.",

Thus, according to the specific explanations for the provision in question, the establishment of the magistrates\u2019 courts would, above all, ensure that there was a degree of specialisation and harmonisation in the implementation of preventive measures. The aim pursued by the new provision was therefore, in due course, to achieve a countrywide standard for decisions on preventive measures by fostering interaction between magistrates\u2019 courts.",

It specified that unless the case was limited to a single event, person or group, the examination by a newly established court or a recently appointed judge of a case arising prior to the establishment or appointment in question did not constitute an infringement of the right to a lawfully established court.

Moreover, if any lack of impartiality on a magistrate\u2019s part was established on the basis of concrete, objective and decisive evidence, procedural rules were in place that would disqualify the magistrate from dealing with the case in question.",

It added that there were no constitutional provisions requiring objections against magistrates\u2019 decisions to be reviewed at a higher level of jurisdiction; provided that an effective review was secured, there was no obligation for the objection to be examined by a higher court. The Constitutional Court further noted that the different \u201cdivisions\u201d of a particular court could not be regarded as forming a single court, and that arranging the courts in the same judicial district into \u201cdivisions\u201d was an administrative decision relating to the organisation of the courts. Thus, the magistrate\u2019s court examining an objection was to be seen as an independent and separate court from the magistrate\u2019s court that had delivered the decision being challenged. Lastly, the Constitutional Court stated that having objections reviewed by judges with such a high degree of specialisation in preventive measures pursued a public-interest objective.",

In support of their allegations of a lack of independence and impartiality on the part of the magistrates\u2019 courts, the applicants had relied mainly on statements made by the executive, and in particular the Prime Minister. They had also submitted that a magistrate had shared comments praising the Prime Minister on social media and that judges who had ordered the release of individuals arrested during police operations conducted on 17 and 25\u00a0December 2013 had been appointed as magistrates. In its judgment the Constitutional Court noted that magistrates discharged their duties on the basis of general legislative provisions and following their appointment by the HSK. Accordingly, it held that in the absence of any proof of acts or conduct indicating prejudice against the applicants, it could not be accepted that facts whose existence and nature had not been convincingly established or comments made in the context of political debates constituted proof that the judges concerned had displayed a lack of independence and impartiality, for political or personal reasons.",

It held that, in view of the features of the ByLock application, its use by a person or its installation with a view to use could be treated by the investigating authorities as an indication of the existence of links between the person concerned and FET\u00d6/PDY. The Constitutional Court found that the strength of that indication could vary from case to case, depending on factors such as the person\u2019s actual use of the application, the manner and frequency of such use, the position and importance of the contacts within FET\u00d6/PDY, and the content of messages exchanged via the application. Thus, in its view, bearing in mind the features of the messaging system in question, it could not be concluded that the investigating authorities or courts that had ordered the detention had pursued an unjustified or arbitrary approach in accepting, in the context of investigations relating to the attempted coup or to FET\u00d6/PDY, that the use of the application could, depending on the circumstances of the case, be regarded as \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that the offence in question had been committed.",

After noting that in the light of its case-law, the lack of a hearing for a period of eight months and eighteen days was contrary to the requirements of Article 19 \u00a7 8 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court considered it necessary to examine whether that situation was justified from the standpoint of Article 15 of the Constitution.

The investigating authorities had therefore suddenly been required to initiate and conduct investigations in respect of tens of thousands of suspects because of this unexpected situation. The Constitutional Court further noted that, given the characteristics of the FET\u00d6/PDY organisation (confidentiality, cell-type structure, infiltration of all public institutions, self-professed holiness, and action based on obedience and devotion), investigations relating to it were more complex and difficult. In that context, the judicial and investigating authorities had had to handle an unforeseeable workload, and at the same time, more than 4,000\u00a0judges and prosecutors had been dismissed from office. Furthermore, various measures had been taken in the wake of the coup attempt, in particular to alleviate the serious situation facing the investigating and judicial authorities and to preserve the proper functioning of the justice system (arrangements had been made to increase the number of judges and prosecutors: shortening of the internship periods for trainee judges and prosecutors, administrative measures to recruit trainee judges and prosecutors, and reinstatement of judges and prosecutors who had previously retired or resigned).",

The Constitutional Court added that on 16 June 2016, following a trial concerning FET\u00d6/PDY, the assize court dealing with the case had concluded that the organisation in question had built up structures within the armed forces, the police and the judicial institutions, that it had developed outside the State structure, and that it was an armed terrorist organisation. It further noted that the HSK had instituted disciplinary proceedings against several judges and prosecutors on account of irregularities committed in connection with the organisation and had ordered their dismissal.",

After examining the evidence forming the basis for the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, it concluded that \u201cstrong evidence that an offence had been committed\u201d had not been sufficiently established in the case before it. Next, the Constitutional Court examined whether there had been a violation of the right to liberty and security in the light of Article 15 of the Constitution. On this point, it noted firstly that in a state of emergency, the Constitution provided for the possibility of taking measures derogating from the guarantees set forth in Article\u00a019, to the extent required by the situation. It observed, however, that if it were accepted that people could be placed in pre-trial detention without any strong evidence that they had committed an offence, the guarantees of the right to liberty and security would be meaningless. Accordingly, it held that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was disproportionate to the strict exigencies of the situation and concluded by a majority (eleven votes to six) that his right to liberty and security, as safeguarded by Article\u00a019 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Constitution, had been breached.",

It noted that by the date of the applicants\u2019 initial detention, the preliminary investigation procedure had been completed and permission to initiate a criminal investigation had been given. The Constitutional Court further noted that the Mersin Assize Court, which had examined an objection by the applicants against the order for their detention, had found that the prohibition in section 88(1) of Law no. 2802 related only to actions that could be taken by the security forces and did not preclude the judicial authorities from taking preventive measures.

In ordering the applicant\u2019s initial pre-trial detention, the Kocaeli magistrate\u2019s court had acted in accordance with the Court of Cassation\u2019s case-law on the concept of \u201cin flagrante delicto\u201d, as expounded in its judgment of 26 September 2017 (see paragraph\u00a088 above). The Government added that the Court of Cassation had reached a similar conclusion in cases predating the applicant\u2019s case, concerning the offence of membership of terrorist organisations other than FET\u00d6/PDY. It was for the national courts to interpret the concept of \u201cin flagrante delicto\u201d and, having regard to the characteristics of the present case and the well-established case-law of the Court of Cassation, the conclusion reached by the Kocaeli magistrate\u2019s court could not be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unfounded.

They relied in that connection on a judgment delivered on 28\u00a0September 2010 by the plenary criminal divisions of the Court of Cassation (E.2010/162K.210/179), which had found that the offence of which the defendant (a former public prosecutor) was accused, namely forging official documents, constituted an offence connected to official duties in that the defendant had been acting in his capacity as a prosecutor when forging the documents in question.

The Court has considered the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time to be incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Sta\u0161aitis v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a047679/99, \u00a7 67, 21 March 2002; Nakhmanovich v.

Conversely, it has found that an applicant\u2019s detention could not be said to have been arbitrary if the domestic court gave certain grounds justifying the continued detention on remand (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 131), unless the reasons given are extremely laconic and without reference to any legal provision which would have permitted the applicant\u2019s detention (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0157).\u201d",

This consideration, set out in particular in cases concerning the right of judges to freedom of expression, is equally relevant in relation to the adoption of a measure affecting the right to liberty of a member of the judiciary. In particular, where domestic law has granted judicial protection to members of the judiciary in order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions, it is essential that such arrangements should be properly complied with. Given the prominent place that the judiciary occupies among State organs in a democratic society and the growing importance attached to the separation of powers and to the necessity of safeguarding the independence of the judiciary (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e S\u00e1 v.\u00a0Portugal [GC], nos.\u00a055391/13 and 2 others, \u00a7 196, 6 November 2018), the Court must be particularly attentive to the protection of members of the judiciary when reviewing the manner in which a detention order was implemented from the standpoint of the provisions of the Convention (see Alparslan Altan, cited above, \u00a7 102).",

It further notes that the Government contended that Law no. 2802 differed from Law no.\u00a06216 on the establishment and rules of procedure of the Constitutional Court in that it made a distinction between offences linked to judges\u2019 official duties and personal offences, affording procedural safeguards only in respect of the former, whereas Law no. 6216 provided for judicial immunity in respect of both types of offence.",

It observes that the applicant\u2019s core argument is that the HSK\u2019s permission for the opening of an investigation proved that he had been detained in connection with an offence linked to his official duties. He also alleged that the acts of which he had been accused related to his judicial functions (see paragraph\u00a0133 above). According to the applicant, by subjecting him to the procedural rules governing offences discovered in flagrante delicto, the national authorities had clearly breached section 88 of Law no. 2802 (see paragraph\u00a0133 above). The Court notes that in the detention order of 20\u00a0July 2016 (see paragraph 27 above), no position was taken explicitly on whether the applicant\u2019s alleged membership of a terrorist organisation constituted an offence committed \u201cin connection with or in the course of [his] official duties\u201d, regulated by sections 82-92 of Law no. 2802, or a \u201cpersonal offence\u201d within the meaning of section 93 of the same Law (see paragraph\u00a067 above). The magistrate merely referred to section\u00a094 of the Law, which applies to both types of offences, in support of his finding that the applicant\u2019s alleged offence constituted a \u201csituation of discovery in flagrante delicto\u201d governed by that provision. However, the Court points out that under Law no. 2802, the distinction as to whether a criminal offence allegedly perpetrated by a judge constitutes an offence committed in connection with or in the course of his or her official duties or a personal offence is fundamental for the procedural safeguards afforded to judges such as the applicant. In this connection, the Court does not consider it appropriate, or even necessary, to undertake an analysis of the scope of the safeguards afforded by Turkish law to judges suspected of having committed an offence. Nevertheless, it considers that a crucial factor for the purposes of its assessment as to the lawfulness of the measure in question is that the magistrate\u2019s application of the concept of in flagrante delicto, within the meaning of section 94 of Law no. 2802, was decisive for depriving the applicant of the safeguards afforded to all judges by Law no.\u00a02802. Therefore, taking account of the reasoning adduced by the magistrate in detaining the applicant, the Court does not accept the Government\u2019s argument that the only consequence of applying section\u00a094 was that the decision to detain him was taken by a magistrate\u2019s court lacking territorial jurisdiction. It must be emphasised that it is not for the Court to determine into which category of offences the applicant\u2019s alleged conduct falls. However, the Court observes that the requirements of legal certainty become even more paramount when it reviews \u201cthe manner in which a detention order was implemented from the standpoint of the provisions of the Convention\u201d (see paragraph 144 above), where a judge has been deprived of his liberty. Therefore, the Court considers that in view of its previous finding that the extensive interpretation of the concept of in flagrante delicto, as applied by the domestic courts, was not in conformity with the requirements of the Convention, the mere application of that concept and the reference to section 94 of Law no. 2802 in the magistrate\u2019s detention order of 20 July 2016 did not, in the circumstances of the present case, fulfil the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Indeed, this consideration played a significant role in the Court\u2019s analysis above (see paragraphs 204-06 above). This does not mean, however, that the authorities have carte blanche under Article\u00a05 of the Convention to order the detention of an individual during the state of emergency without any verifiable evidence or information or without a sufficient factual basis satisfying the minimum requirements of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c) regarding the reasonableness of a suspicion.

In order to determine whether proceedings falling under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention provide the necessary guarantees, regard must be had to the particular nature of the circumstances in which they take place (see Megyeri v.

When the Court comes to consider a derogation under Article\u00a015 of the Convention, it allows the national authorities a wide margin of appreciation to decide on the nature and scope of the derogating measures necessary to avert the emergency. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the pressing needs of the moment, the national authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to decide both on the presence of such an emergency and on the nature and scope of derogations necessary to avert it. Accordingly, in this matter a wide margin of appreciation should be left to the national authorities (see Ireland v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 207, Series A no. 25).",

It is for the Court to rule whether, inter alia, States have gone beyond the \u201cextent strictly required by the exigencies\u201d of the crisis. The domestic margin of appreciation is thus accompanied by European supervision. In particular, where a derogating measure encroaches upon a fundamental Convention right, such as the right to liberty, the Court must be satisfied that it was a genuine response to the emergency situation, that it was fully justified by the special circumstances of the emergency and that adequate safeguards were provided against abuse (see, for example, Brannigan and McBride v. the United Kingdom, 26\u00a0May 1993, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a048-66, Series A no. 258-B, and Aksoy\u00a0 v.\u00a0Turkey, 18\u00a0December 1996, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a071-84, Reports 1996-VI). In exercising this supervision, the Court must give appropriate weight to such relevant factors as the nature of the rights affected by the derogation and the circumstances leading to, and the duration of, the emergency situation (see Brannigan and McBride, cited above, \u00a7\u00a043, and A. and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0173).",

In so holding, the Constitutional Court had regard to the difficulties facing Turkey in the aftermath of the coup attempt, namely the opening of a considerable number of investigations in respect of individuals involved in the coup attempt or with links to FET\u00d6/PDY and the recourse to pre-trial detention for the majority of them, the complexity of these investigations, the emergence of an unforeseeably heavy workload for the courts and investigating authorities, the suspension and dismissal of large numbers of judges and prosecutors immediately after the coup attempt, and lastly the dismissal of judicial support staff, prison officers and gendarmerie personnel responsible for ensuring the safety and protection of prisoners. The Constitutional Court also took into account the possibility for detainees to apply for release and lodge objections with a view to regaining their liberty, and the automatic review of detention at intervals of thirty days (see paragraphs\u00a092-97 above).",

The Constitutional Court\u2019s reasoning on this point appears pertinent. The Court also accepts that the legislation applicable in the present case would not have been sufficient to deal efficiently with the situation prevailing in Turkey after the coup attempt: Article\u00a0108 of the CCP requires a review of detention at thirty-day intervals during the investigation stage, with the detainee or his or her lawyer being heard in person, and detainees may also apply for release at any stage of the investigation or trial and submit renewed applications without having to wait for a certain period to elapse. Accordingly, the Court accepts the relevant conclusion reached by the Constitutional Court in the case of Ayd\u0131n Yavuz and Others, to the effect that the measures implemented in the aftermath of the coup attempt and the fact for a period of eight months and eighteen days the applicants did not appear before the judges deciding on their detention could reasonably be said to have been strictly required for the protection of public safety.",

All the magistrates\u2019 courts and other judicial bodies in Turkey, including the Court of Cassation, which had cited the use of ByLock as the basis for their decisions and had relied on reports by the police, the intelligence services, the BTK or the prosecuting authorities, had lost their independence by failing to question the authenticity of the information concerned. Referring to press articles, the applicant asserted that judges who had expressed the view that the ByLock application could not be used as evidence in judicial proceedings had been dismissed from their posts. The executive had thus conveyed a message to the entire judiciary that such evidence \u2013 which in the applicant\u2019s view was unlawful \u2013 should be treated as lawful, and in that way had compelled the judiciary to accept the ByLock messaging system as lawful and decisive evidence.

Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a032, Reports 1996-III).",

It takes note of the concerns about the national judicial system as expressed by regional and international authorities in those reports and opinions. While emphasising that it is not called upon in the present case to make general findings about the Turkish judicial system, it observes that the complaints relating to the HSK\u2019s structure are focused on the constitutional amendments adopted by the National Assembly on 21\u00a0January 2017 and put to a national referendum on 16\u00a0April 2017. The Court would reaffirm in this connection that it is not its task to make a general assessment of the structure of the HSK, but to determine to what extent the independence and impartiality of the magistrates deciding on the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention might have been affected. However, as the Government observed, the establishment of the magistrates\u2019 courts dates back to 18 June 2014, well before the constitutional reform that altered the structure of the HSK. Furthermore, nearly all of the decisions by the magistrates\u2019 courts on the applicant\u2019s detention were taken before the entry into force of the constitutional amendment. As regards the dismissals following the coup attempt, the Court notes that the HSK explained its decision on the matter by indicating that the presence within the judicial system of judges and prosecutors who had sworn allegiance to an illegal organisation, and who were acting in accordance with the organisation\u2019s instructions, was incompatible with the principles of independence and impartiality and undermined the reputation and authority of the judicial system. When examining the dismissals in question in the case of \u00c7atal v.\u00a0Turkey, the Court observed that the judges against whom such measures had been taken had the opportunity to apply directly to the Supreme Administrative Court, which had jurisdiction to examine the merits of their applications as a first-instance court (see \u00c7atal v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a02873/17, 7 March 2017).",

The Court considers that, having regard to the constitutional and legal safeguards afforded to the magistrates\u2019 courts, and in the absence of any relevant arguments giving cause to doubt their independence and impartiality in the applicant\u2019s case, the complaint alleging a lack of independence and impartiality on the magistrates\u2019 part should be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

It further notes that the review performed following an objection provides an opportunity, as required by Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention, to examine the lawfulness of detention (compare R.T. v.\u00a0Greece, no. 5124/11, \u00a7 98, 11\u00a0February 2016) and to secure the detainee\u2019s release where appropriate (see, mutatis mutandis, M.M. v.\u00a0Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058, and contrast Suso Musa v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a042337/12, \u00a7 59, 23\u00a0July 2013). The Court can see no reason to doubt that the scope of the objection lodged with the magistrate\u2019s court was sufficient for it to constitute \u201cproceedings\u201d for the purposes of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention (compare Gavril Yosifov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a074012/01, \u00a7 60, 6\u00a0November 2008). The magistrate\u2019s court dealing with the objection is empowered by law to order release in the absence of reasons justifying the detention, having regard to whether the measure is \u201cwell founded\u201d or not. The Court would emphasise that there is no hierarchical or structural link between the magistrate examining the objection and the magistrate whose decision is being challenged. In that connection, as long as it has not been established that the magistrates in question have developed a personal friendship going beyond the strictly professional sphere, the existence of professional contact between them cannot in itself justify concerns as to the independence and impartiality of the magistrates examining the objection (see, mutatis mutandis, Hajdu\u010dekov\u00e1 v.\u00a0Slovakia (dec.), no.\u00a047806/99, 8\u00a0October 2002). Lastly, in so far as the applicant alleged that the \u201cclosed circuit\u201d operation of the magistrates\u2019 courts rendered any objection ineffective, the Court would refer to the data provided by the Government (see paragraphs\u00a0106-107 above) concerning the number of objections that have been upheld.",

The arrest and pre-trial detention of judges will always trigger serious concerns as to the independence of the judiciary, the separation of powers and the rule of law.

Moreover, the majority cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that the offence of which the applicant was accused was a \u201cpersonal\u201d offence governed by section 93 of Law no. 2802 and not an \u201cofficial\u201d offence under section 82-92, and that the application of section 94 in his case therefore did not have the effect of depriving him of procedural safeguards, but simply meant that the decision to detain him was taken by a magistrate\u2019s court lacking territorial jurisdiction. In the majority\u2019s view, which I share, the magistrate\u2019s application of the concept of discovery in flagrante delicto was decisive for depriving the applicant of the safeguards afforded to all judges by Law no. 2802, and the mere application of that concept and the reference to section 94 of Law no.\u00a02802 in the magistrate\u2019s detention order did not, in the circumstances of the present case, fulfil the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 158 of the judgment).",

However, the criteria for drawing the line between the two are not prescribed in Law no. 2802 itself, apart from what can be inferred from section 89, which uses the expression \u201coffences in connection with or in the course of their official duties\u201d, as opposed to \u201cpersonal offences\u201d as mentioned in section 93. To the extent that these two concepts have been elaborated upon in the case-law of the Court of Cassation, the scope of what is considered to be an \u201cofficial\u201d offence appears to be surprisingly narrow, possibly not encompassing a judge\u2019s alleged membership of an illegal organisation accused of having infiltrated the judiciary (see paragraph 90 of the judgment). However, on the other hand, in the present case it was the Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSK) which instigated the investigation in respect of the applicant (see paragraph 15-22 of the judgment), seemingly on the assumption that the offence was actually linked to the applicant\u2019s profession as a judge.",

There are indications that the Law, including section 88, is understood to provide only a certain safeguard against arrest in a narrow and technical sense, but not against pre-trial detention.

Firstly, a principled approach must be taken based on the concept of legal certainty. In this regard, I respect the Court\u2019s approach adopted in the Alparslan Altan v.\u00a0Turkey case (no. 12778/17, \u00a7\u00a7 104-15, 16 April 2019), in so far as the extensive interpretation of the concept of in flagrante delicto was found not only to be problematic with regard to the principle of legal certainty, but also to negate the procedural safeguards which members of the judiciary \u2013 in particular members of the Constitutional Court \u2013 were afforded in order to protect them from any interference by the executive. Furthermore, it is important to note that this interpretation has legal consequences that go far beyond the legal framework of a state of emergency. Secondly, I still believe that our case-law requires an analysis of the national courts\u2019 interpretation and of any potential errors in order to determine whether the detention suffered from a gross and obvious irregularity, for the following reasons (see, mutatis mutandis, Mooren v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a011364/03, \u00a7\u00a084, 9 July 2009; Hammerton v. the United Kingdom, no. 6287/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0107-17, 17 March 2016; \u010calovskis v.

However, in the present case the applicant\u2019s situation was different and he was covered by the provisions of Law no.\u00a02802 on judges and prosecutors. The provisions of Law no.\u00a02802 are different from those of Law no. 6216. Indeed, while Law no.\u00a02802 makes a distinction between personal offences (section 93) and offences that are committed in connection with or in the course of official duties (sections 82-92), and affords procedural safeguards in respect of offences related to official duties, Law no. 6216 provides for judicial immunity in respect of both types of offences, namely personal offences and offences related to official duties. Moreover, section 94 of Law no. 2802 governs, in principle, both types of offences and provides that the rules of ordinary law apply in the case of discovery in flagrante delicto.",

It is to be noted that in cases arising out of different facts and in relation to different types of offences, the Court of Cassation and the Constitutional Court have already reached different conclusions and in those cases the offences were classified as function-related when they were linked to the judicial activity of the person concerned.

Furthermore, despite the lack of territorial jurisdiction in the present case, the decisions on detention taken by the magistrate in question remained entirely valid under domestic law (see, to similar effect, Fernandes Pedroso v. Portugal, no. 59133/11, \u00a7 93, 12\u00a0June 2018).",

Secondly, after accepting that the interpretation of in flagrante delicto was extensive in relation to the personal offence at issue in the present case, as can be understood from the parties\u2019 submissions, I consider that section 93 of Law no. 2802 should have been applied rather than section 94, and that the applicant\u2019s case should have been dealt with by a court with different territorial jurisdiction. In view of the particular circumstances of the present case and the procedural safeguards that I have tried to outline above, I believe that the shortcomings in the instant case cannot be said to amount to such a \u201cgross or obvious irregularity\u201d as to render the detention unlawful (see Mooren, cited above, \u00a7\u00a084).
