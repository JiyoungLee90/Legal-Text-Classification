On the basis of the first applicant\u2019s criminal complaint and the Ministry\u2019s reply of 13 January 2010 (see paragraph 31 above), the public prosecutor established that after the first applicant had gone past the roadblock (by mounting the pavement on the left side of the street) and continued driving towards Z.G., both M.D. and Z.G. had fired four shots \u201cin order to stop [the car] ...

For this concrete action, an indictment was filed against (the first applicant) whom this prosecution\u2019s office considers guilty\u201d.",

It also sentenced him to a suspended prison term of a year and a half. The court found that he had bypassed the roadblock by mounting the pavement on the left side of the street driving towards Z.G., who, at the time, had been standing on the pavement. In order to avoid being hit by the car, Z.G. had jumped aside, as a result of which he had sustained a head injury and bruising to the torso. Z.G. did not join the prosecution and waived the right to claim compensation against the first applicant. As indicated in the judgment, Z.G. gave two statements regarding the incident. In the statement of 13 December 2011, he said that, at the relevant time, he was standing on the left side of the street, while in the statement dated 8 February 2013, he specified that the first applicant\u2019s car had bypassed the roadblock at the right side of the street mounting the pavement where he (Z.G.) was standing. The court heard oral evidence from the first applicant, D.M., I.A., M.B., B.J. and admitted as evidence the reports and medical certificates indicated above (see paragraphs 13, 14, 26 and 27).",

They further complained under this Article that there had been no effective investigation into his allegations. Relying on Article 13, they complained that there had been no effective remedy in respect of their complaints under Article 3 of the Convention. Lastly, they complained under Article 6 that they had been denied the right of access to court due to the failure of the public prosecutor to reject the criminal complaint by means of a formal decision. The Court considers that this last complaint falls to be examined under Article 13 of the Convention, as it concerns a particular aspect of the right to an effective remedy under this provision. It further considers that the applicants\u2019 complaint concerning the risk to the first applicant\u2019s life should be examined under Article 2 of the Convention.

Nonetheless, the degree and type of force used and the intention or aim behind the use of force may, among other factors, be relevant in assessing whether in a particular case State agents\u2019 actions in inflicting injury but not death are such as to bring the facts within the scope of the safeguard afforded by Article 2 of the Convention, having regard to the object and purpose of that Article. In almost all cases where a person is allegedly assaulted or ill-treated by the police or soldiers their complaints will rather fall to be examined under Article 3 of the Convention (see Sa\u0161o Gorgiev v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 49382/06, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2012 (extracts), and the references cited therein).",

Neither was any such suggestion made by the first applicant. It notes, however, that the fact that the latter was not killed was fortuitous. On the available material, it is clear that four bullets were fired at the first applicant\u2019s car, two of which were fired from an automatic rifle and the remaining two from a pistol. All of them were aimed at the car\u2019s tyres. It cannot be established whether the automatic rifle was set, at that time, to burst mode, as claimed by the first applicant (see paragraphs 11 and 23 above). As regards the use of the automatic fire mode, the Court has already stated that it is absolutely impossible to aim with a reasonable degree of accuracy using automatic fire (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 108, ECHR\u00a02005VII). In any event, the Court notes that the bullets fired from the automatic rifle have never been found, nor was their trajectory established. That demonstrates poor targeting and an increased risk of fatal consequences. Both bullets fired from the pistol hit the rear part of the car, one of them hitting the car between the rear door and the roof. As a result, the rear window shattered. The second bullet penetrated the rear door of the car, passed through the rear seat and ended up hitting the front passenger seat. In this connection it is not without relevance that Z.G., when firing at the car, was not in a steady shooting position (see paragraphs 8, 16, 17 and\u00a018 above). That undoubtedly influenced the accuracy of his aim, given the fact that the impact sites of the shots he fired followed a horizontal or upward trajectory to the car driver\u2019s level and not a downward one, as one would expect if the tyres, and only the tyres, of the vehicle were being shot at by the pursuing police.",

Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims. In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances, including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see Timus and Tarus v.\u00a0the\u00a0Republic of Moldova, no. 70077/11, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 47, 15 October 2013, and Esmukhambetov and Others v.

The Court considers it important that Z.G. shot at the first applicant\u2019s car after it had already gone past the roadblock and, thus, could no longer pose a threat to his physical integrity. That is confirmed by the direction of the shots and the ballistic test (see paragraphs 8 and 27 above).

However, apart from the still disputed incidents when he went past the roadblocks, no evidence was submitted that during the chase he had put the lives of police officers, or others, at risk. Furthermore, no information that would link the first applicant or the car with any criminal activity had been communicated to the pursuing officers, although there was sufficient time during the chase (see paragraphs 6 and 22 above) for any such information to come to light. The control centre, through which the operation was organised, issued no warning that the first applicant might be armed or dangerous (see, conversely, Makaratzis, cited above, \u00a7 64). In such circumstances, the fact that the events took place at night, although relevant, cannot be regarded as sufficient, in the absence of any objective evidence, to justify the police\u2019s belief that the first applicant was a dangerous criminal (see paragraph 61 above). Lastly, the police could have established, on the basis of the registration plates of the car, which had not been reported stolen, the identity of the owner of the car and his address, as well as those of the first applicant. The foregoing, coupled with the absence of any threat to life and limb after he had driven past the second roadblock (see paragraph 69 above), is sufficient to lead the Court to conclude that the use of potentially lethal force against the first applicant, whose behaviour was certainly irresponsible and open to criticism, was not absolutely necessary to effect his arrest.",

According to the Government, it was so since he had refused to get out of the car as ordered by the police officers concerned. That version was based on the witness statements made by the arresting officers I.A. and M.B., who had been direct protagonists in the events complained of. Obviously, the internal inquiry carried out by the Ministry of the Interior was also based, at least to a decisive extent, on evidence produced by these witnesses (see paragraphs 20 and 26 above). The Court notes however, that it has not been presented with any other evidence in support of the Government\u2019s version of events. In this connection it observes that none of the twenty police officers who, as maintained by the Government (see paragraph 74 above), witnessed the applicant\u2019s arrest, produced any evidence in this respect. The written statements of police officers submitted in the case file (see paragraphs\u00a01519 and 22 above) also did not contain any information as to whether the applicant had resisted his arrest. In such circumstances, and in view of the fact that the facts of the dispute have not been the subject of any determination by a national court, the Court does not consider that the Government demonstrated with convincing arguments that the use of force, which resulted in the applicant\u2019s injuries, was strictly necessary and proportionate.

Moreover, the applicant was heavily drunk and was driving his car at excessive speed; he had mounted the pavement and endangered the life of a police officer, creating a situation in which the police officers had to fire in order to stop the car after he had already gone through the second roadblock (the authorities used two roadblocks as less extreme methods).
