In the Government\u2019s submission, the Court had erred in its decision in Scordino v. Italy ((dec.), no. 36813/97, ECHR 2003IV) in finding that, as the Court of Cassation had always held that complaints about the amount of compensation related to questions of fact, which fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the lower courts, an appeal on points of law was not a remedy that had to be exercised. Admittedly, the Court of Cassation, which examined points of law, could not superimpose its own assessment of questions relating to the merits or the assessment of the facts and evidence on those of the lower courts. It did, however, have the power to find that a decision of the lower courts was inconsistent with the correct interpretation of the law or contained grounds that were illogical or contradictory. In such a case it could set out the applicable legal principle or mark out the broad lines of the correct interpretation and remit the case to the lower court for a fresh assessment of the evidence on the basis of those directions. That submission had, moreover, been confirmed by the four judgments (nos.\u00a01338, 1339, 1340 and 1341) delivered by the plenary Court of Cassation on 26 January 2004 (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above).",

Moreover, having regard to the nature of the Pinto Act and the context in which it was passed, the Court went on to find that there were grounds for departing from the general principle that the exhaustion requirement should be assessed with reference to the time at which the application was lodged. That was the case not only in respect of applications lodged after the date on which the Act came into force, but also of those which were already on the Court\u2019s list of cases by that date. It took into consideration, among other things, the transitional provision provided for in section 6 of the Pinto Act (see paragraph 23 above), which afforded Italian litigants a genuine opportunity to obtain redress for their grievances at national level for all applications currently pending before the Court that had not yet been declared admissible (ibid.).",

Once a decision had been obtained from the court of appeal, the State did not spontaneously make payment but obliged the applicants to serve the decision on the authorities, wait the statutory 120 days after service and then take out a writ, and sometimes apply for a garnishee order, which was not always successful because funds might not be available.

Instead, the Government asked the Court to lay down guidelines regarding damage or authorise the courts to continue using guidelines that were totally different from those used by the Court so that they could carry on running the Italian system without introducing any changes to expedite proceedings. The applicant argued that the Government erred in their assessment of the position as it was not for the European Court of Human Rights to avoid giving judgments that conflicted with national law but, on the contrary, the national law (including the Pinto Act) that should not conflict with the Convention. In the applicant\u2019s submission, the Government could not properly argue that in some cases delays in legal proceedings gave applicants an advantage if they held out with unfounded arguments during proceedings, or if the stakes involved in the dispute were less than the just satisfaction awarded. The value of the application in question was of no relevance to the right to a hearing within a reasonable time and Article 6 did not require an applicant claiming the right to just satisfaction to have been successful. Furthermore, the Government\u2019s reasoning was one that was expressed with hindsight at the end of proceedings, and it was never possible to say beforehand what the outcome would be. If a case was lost after twenty years of proceedings the non-pecuniary damage incurred was all the greater, since if the person had known earlier that they would lose they would probably have arranged certain aspects of their life differently.",

Furthermore, there is nothing in the case file or the domestic decisions to suggest that the proceedings were interrupted, but only that the applicant declared his intention to continue the proceedings. As early as 1998 he indicated that he had been unable to declare his intention to continue the proceedings on account of the poor organisation of the registry of the appeal court (see paragraph 17 above). His conduct cannot therefore be regarded as a significant factor justifying a reduction in the compensation. The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, reasoned in part, moreover supports this conclusion. It would appear that in awarding EUR 1,000 for four years\u2019 delay, the rate per year is EUR 250. The Court observes that the amount awarded is approximately 14% of what it generally awards in similar Italian cases. This factor alone leads to a result which is manifestly unreasonable having regard to the Court\u2019s case-law in respect of proceedings before employment tribunals. The Court reiterates in this connection that this type of proceedings, like those concerning the civil status and capacity of persons, must be especially speedy. It will return to this matter in the context of Article 41 (see paragraph 146 below).",
