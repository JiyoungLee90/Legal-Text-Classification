Indeed, he had dental problems and these were addressed by the prison\u2019s medical staff whenever he complained about them. The applicant did not show any interest in addressing these problems himself as he did not follow through the recommendations to consult a dentist on several occasions. Furthermore, when he saw the dentist for the first time in 2000, the applicant expressly refused any treatment (see paragraph 17 above). Nor did he have any further complaints in that regard for over one year. The Court is thus unable to conclude that the national authorities did not ensure proper medical supervision of the applicant\u2019s condition. Secondly, the Court points out that the applicant himself admitted that in October 2001 extraction had been the only option. It was only after those extractions that he applied to the domestic authorities with a request for free-of-charge dental prosthetics.",

The Court notes in this regard that, according to the applicable instructions at the time, detainees could only receive short-term visits (see paragraphs 25 to 30 above) while convicted prisoners could receive long-term visits. The Court, like the Commission previously (see X.\u00a0v. the Federal Republic of Germany, no. 3603/68, Commission decision of 4 February 1970; G.S. and R.S. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a017142/90, Commission decision of 10 July 1991; and E.L.H. and P.B.H. v. the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a032094/96 and 32568/96, Commission decision of 22 October 1997), has noted with approval the reform movements in several European countries to improve prison conditions by facilitating long-term (also called \u201cconjugal\u201d) visits. However, the Court has stressed that the refusal of such visits may be regarded as justified for the prevention of disorder and crime within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Aliev v. , no.\u00a041220/98, \u00a7 188, 29 April 2003, and Nazarenko, cited above, \u00a7 26). The Court has recently confirmed that the Convention does not require the Contracting States to make provision for such visits. Accordingly, this is an area in which the Contracting States could enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention with due regard to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals (see Dickson v. the  [GC], no. 44362/04, \u00a7 81, ECHR 2007V).",

Another case concerned an applicant who could not prove that any family visits had been refused in the period under consideration and his complaint in that regard was therefore rejected on the ground that there had been no interference with his family life (see \u010cistiakov, cited above, \u00a7 33). Only two cases decided so far have concerned the restrictions on receiving long-term family visits in a remand prison (see Estrikh, cited above, and Nazarenko, cited above). The Court observes that in these cases the applicants had started off by actively requesting permission to receive short-term visits; in Estrikh they were constantly refused (see Estrikh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 23-24) and in Nazarenko they were granted (see Nazarenko, cited above, \u00a7 14). The refusals in the Estrikh case, coupled with the fact that the applicant was not entitled to receive long-term visits, were sufficient to consider that there had been an interference with the applicant\u2019s family life. In Nazarenko an express request by the applicant to receive a long-term family visit was first refused, but four months later it was allowed on account of the change in his status. Therefore, in view of the relatively brief waiting period and the fact that no short-term visits had been refused in the meantime, the Court concluded that no issues under Article 8 of the Convention had arisen.",

He did not complain to the domestic authorities but brought up this issue for the first time before the Court. In view of such circumstances and leaving aside the question of domestic remedies, especially in view of the Constitutional Court\u2019s subsequent intervention on this issue (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above), the Court has to establish whether the facts, as presented to it, constitute an interference with the applicant\u2019s family life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention.",

No other visits were ever refused and for that reason the domestic authorities cannot be held responsible for the long periods of time between those visits. Nor can it be said that the domestic authorities imposed unreasonable restrictions on the number of family visits the applicant could receive as he did not seek to exercise his right to receive one family visit per month. Secondly, the Court observes that the applicant did not bring his family situation, in particular, the birth of his child, to the attention of the domestic authorities. The Court therefore comes to the conclusion that there has been no \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his family life guaranteed by Article 8 \u00a7 1.",
