The said newspaper had accordingly rectified its error in a subsequent article published on 15 December 1995, explaining that Mr G\u00fcl had not pronounced upon the \u201crepublic\u201d or \u201csecularity\u201d in his interview, but had only referred to the public discontent in a socio-economic context. He claimed that Cumhuriyet itself had acknowledged the inaccuracy of the statement it had published in its issue of 30\u00a0April 2007. He further contended that the statement attributed to him did not serve a \u201cpublic interest\u201d in any event, for it lacked \u201ccurrency\u201d, and that the publication of such dated news was a further sign of bad faith on the part of Cumhuriyet. Mr G\u00fcl requested compensation for nonpecuniary damage in the amount of 50,000\u00a0Turkish liras (TRY) from the Ankara Civil Court of First Instance, as well as an interim injunction against the statement in question. He submitted the relevant copies of Cumhuriyet, as well as a number of Court of Cassation decisions in support of his claim, but not the copies of the Guardian articles in question.",

The applicants argued, inter alia, that the statement under consideration in the present case was a direct quote from an interview that Mr G\u00fcl had given to a journalist from The Guardian on 27\u00a0November 1995; that this interview had also been reported in the Turkish daily Posta; that the subsequent article published by The Guardian on 15\u00a0December 1995 did not constitute a \u201ccorrection\u201d as alleged, as it did not entail a denial or retraction of the previous statement; that in a statement he had made to the newspaper H\u00fcrriyet, the Guardian journalist Jonathan\u00a0Rugman had verified that Mr G\u00fcl had indeed made the impugned declaration; that the London correspondent of Cumhuriyet had been informed by the foreign affairs editor of The Guardian that there were no correction requests from Mr G\u00fcl in their archives in relation to the article of 27\u00a0November 1995; and that the article published in Cumhuriyet on 30\u00a0April 2007 was an objective account of the background to Mr G\u00fcl\u2019s quote, and not an acknowledgment of the inaccuracy of this statement as alleged. The applicants added that contrary to the claimant\u2019s allegations, the statement in question was of great public interest pending the Presidential elections, as the public had the right to be informed about the background and political opinions of Presidential candidates. On the procedural side, the applicants claimed that the interim injunction based on Article 25 of the Civil Code amounted to a \u201cban\u201d on the publication of the relevant material, whereas Article 26 of the Turkish Constitution only allowed for the \u201climitation\u201d of the freedom of the press in certain conditions, including for the purposes of the protection of the reputation of others. Moreover, the second part of the injunction, which ordered the suspension/prevention of the publication of \u201cnews that might be subject to the court proceedings\u201d in a sweeping manner, was set out in extremely vague terms. It thus had the effect of preventing the publication of any news, articles or commentaries about Mr G\u00fcl, thereby granting him quasi-immunity from criticism as a Presidential candidate. For the foregoing reasons, the applicants requested the lifting of the interim injunction.",

It also concedes, however, that certain procedural safeguards may apply only to the extent allowed by the special nature and purpose of interim proceedings, which most often deal with matters of urgency requiring rapid action (see Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7\u00a086, ECHR 2009). Article 105 \u00a7 2 of the Turkish Code of Civil Procedure accordingly allows domestic courts to dispense with hearing submissions from the defendant party prior to granting an injunction where the need for immediate protection of the claimant\u2019s rights so necessitates. It appears that this is also the practice in many other Member States (see paragraph\u00a035 above).",
