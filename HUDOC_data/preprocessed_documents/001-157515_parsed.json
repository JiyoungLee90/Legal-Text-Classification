Noting the absence of any assessment made by medical experts in that respect, the Court considers the Government\u2019s submissions to be without basis. For the same reasons, the Court also remains unconvinced by the Government\u2019s argument that given that To\u011fay G\u00fcltekin was re-examined on 20\u00a0March 2004, the failure to transfer him to hospital did not amount to a violation of the Convention (see paragraph 29 above).",

It observes that when To\u011fay G\u00fcltekin visited the regimental infirmary once again on 20 March 2004 (see paragraph 19 above) the other military doctor who examined him does not seem to have sought information as to the decision taken by his colleague on 17 March 2004 and does not seem to have consulted the medical records from which he would have seen that To\u011fay G\u00fcltekin had complained of the possibility of having contracted hepatitis a short while ago. Had the doctor (who had diagnosed To\u011fay\u00a0G\u00fcltekin with infection of the upper respiratory tract (see paragraph\u00a018 above)) done so, he could have realised that the symptoms were in fact those of hepatitis and not those of an upper respiratory tract infection \u2013which, according to the three university professors, are similar\u00a0\u2013 and could have made attempts to ensure To\u011fay G\u00fcltekin\u2019s referral to hospital.",
