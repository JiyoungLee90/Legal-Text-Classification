It held that only the value of the expropriated land \u2013 not taking into account that there existed a limestone deposit underneath it \u2013 had to be compensated. Pursuant to section 124(3) of the Federal Mining Act (Bundesberggesetz, see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d, paragraph 22), mining rights under the terms of that Act were granted only on the statutory condition that they would have to yield to a public infrastructure project without compensation. Consequently, the actual right to quarry and the linked costs and losses for relocation and the impeded landfill did not generate a compensation claim. While the acquired mining rights constituted \u201cproperty\u201d under Article 14 of the Basic Law, the holder of a mining licence could not rely on making unhindered use of his or her mining rights; he or she could only operate under the limitations stipulated, inter alia, under section 124(3) of the Federal Mining Act. The planning decision was therefore merely actualising the determination of content and limits already inherent in the acquired mining right.",

The enterprise could not enjoy more extensive protection under the law than the economic basis it rested on: the mining right.
