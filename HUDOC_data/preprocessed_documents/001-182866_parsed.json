However, a significant change in the detention regime \u2013 such as a move from a communal cell to solitary confinement \u2013 has been held by the Court to put an end to the \u201ccontinuous situation\u201d (see Ananyev and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a042525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7\u00a7 77-78, 10 January 2012, and Fetisov and Others v.

His detention in that cell must therefore be taken to constitute a distinct period that calls for a separate application of the sixmonth rule (see Zakharkin v. Russia, no. 1555/04, \u00a7 115, 10 June 2010). Since that period ended in September 2015, that is to say more than six months before the introduction of the application on 25\u00a0January 2017, the part of the complaint concerning the applicant\u2019s detention prior to the former date has been introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and\u00a04 of the Convention.",

Italy [GC], no. 16483/12, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0163-67, ECHR 2016 (extracts), and Fetisov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 134). Nor can it be found that the cumulative effect of the other aspects of the detention which the applicant complained about reached the threshold of severity required to characterise the treatment as inhuman or degrading within the meaning of Article 3 (compare with the Court\u2019s findings in respect of the same detention facility at the relevant period of time, Mskhiladze v. Russia, no. 47741/16, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, 13 February 2018, and contrast with the Court\u2019s findings in respect of a previous period, Kim v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a044260/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01722, 31-35, 17 July 2014, and M.S.A. and Others v.

The only measure the Russian authorities deployed during that period was the sending of several letters of request to the Embassy of Tajikistan, seeking to obtain a laissez-passer document for the applicant. However, in doing so, they merely followed the established procedure in blatant disregard for the fact that the applicant was not a national of that State and that Tajikistan had no legal obligation to admit him. The Court reiterates that detention cannot be said to have been effected with a view to the applicant\u2019s removal if it was not a realistic prospect because he was not a national of the State to which the authorities sought to remove him (compare Kim, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a052-53, and the case-law cited therein). The Government did not provide evidence of any efforts having been made to secure the applicant\u2019s admission to a third country. The authorities had not asked him to specify such a country or taken any steps to explore that option on their own initiative (contrast with Chkhikvishvili v. Russia, no. 43348/13, \u00a7\u00a030, 25\u00a0October 2016). Moreover, the Russian authorities did not seek to elucidate the reasons for a mismatch between the applicant\u2019s name and the record in their database. They did not interview the applicant in that connection, they did not establish whether the entry in the database had been erroneous or whether the applicant had used a different name in the past.",

The maximum punishment for an administrative offence being thirty days, it was abnormal that the applicant spent more than two years in custody in the framework of a \u201cpreventive\u201d measure (see Kim, cited above, \u00a7 55). The Court also notes that, following the District Court\u2019s decision of 29 July 2016 ordering the discontinuation of the enforcement proceedings, the applicant was released more than two weeks later, on 13 August 2016. The Government did not explain what the legal basis for his detention in that period had been.",
