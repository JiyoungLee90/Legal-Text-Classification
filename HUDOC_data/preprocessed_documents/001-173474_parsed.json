The report indicated that the applicant had been working on a project for the implementation of an electronic administration system for foreign trade since 2001. The Disciplinary Prosecutor accused the applicant of not having conducted an award procedure (Vergabeverfahren). Furthermore, the applicant had allegedly placed orders without consulting the Ministry and asking for permission beforehand. He had thereby caused damage amounting to around 200,000 euros (EUR). Furthermore, he had disobeyed orders from the Ministry and subsequently tampered with the files. He had therefore breached his official duties (Verletzung der Dienstpflicht).",

He pointed out that, despite the precise orders given by the Appeals Commission in its decisions of 14 December 2006 and 2 December 2008, the Disciplinary Council had committed the same procedural errors again and its decisions constantly failed to assess the evidence correctly. Furthermore, the right to prosecute him had already become time-barred in 2009, but the Disciplinary Prosecutor nonetheless insisted on continuing the disciplinary proceedings against him. Finally, given that his monthly pension was EUR 1,526.52, any reduction of this amount would have seriously affected his economic existence.",

The Court has noted that in all three sets of proceedings, several procedural steps were taken without any significant delay in between.
