They pointed out that the investigation into the events complained of in Yunusovy (no. 14202/08) had been initiated in January 2002, whereas the application had been lodged in February 2008. Over a period of six years, the investigation had been suspended and resumed on multiple occasions and the applicants had been informed of those decisions. However, they had remained inactive and had demonstrated a passive attitude towards the pending proceedings by failing to maintain \u201ceffective communication\u201d, such as by lodging requests for information with the investigators. Referring to the Court\u2019s decision in Doshuyeva and Yusupov v.\u00a0Russia (no. 58055/10, 31\u00a0May 2016), the Government submitted that in the case at hand \u2013 as in the case of Doshuyeva and Yusupov \u2013 the applicants had failed to explain their procedural inactivity and had done \u201cnothing to restore their rights by applying to the domestic court or the Court\u201d. The Government furthermore stressed that the applicants should have applied to the Court before 2006, by which time it had become clear to them that no meaningful steps had been taken by the investigators since the initiation of the criminal proceedings.",

They stated that the violation was of a lasting nature and that the six-month time limit should be calculated from the time at which they had become aware that there were no prospects of success in the domestic investigation. They submitted that they had maintained contact with the domestic authorities and sought information on the progress of the investigation and that up to a certain point they had trusted the authorities, hoping that the latter would investigate the killings. The applicants submitted, in particular, that they had hoped that the authorities would take all the same possible steps to have the crime resolved as they would have taken in a case involving any other Russian nationals. In addition, at the material time the law-enforcement bodies had been dealing with a considerable amount of work due to the numerous instances of killing and disappearance that had been occurring in the region at the material time. The applicants\u2019 continuous efforts to request information from various State bodies regarding the progress of the proceedings (and the replies thereto) had provided them with hopes that the investigation would lead to the establishment and prosecution of the perpetrators. Lastly, the applicants stressed that they had maintained regular contact with the authorities and that there had been no excessive or inexplicable delays on their part in the lodging of their application with the Court, unlike in the case of in Doshuyeva and Yusupov referred to by the Government.",

However, despite that lack of information from the authorities, they took regular steps to inform themselves about the proceedings by submitting evidence, enquiring about progress in the investigations and requesting that steps be taken to prosecute the perpetrators. The applicants expected the investigations to yield results and took all steps possible to induce the authorities to identify and prosecute the perpetrators. It was only after the lapse of several years of waiting that they realised that the proceedings did not have any realistic prospects of success (see, for example, paragraphs 54-56, 60, 62, 69, 72, 91, 96, 124, 128, 132, 143,147 and 150 above).",

Applying the above-mentioned principles, it has concluded that it would be sufficient for the applicants to make a prima\u00a0facie case for the killings having been committed by State agents, and that it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof, either by disclosing documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, for example, Gandaloyeva v. Russia, no. 14800/04, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, 4 December 2008; Dangayeva and Taramova v. Russia, no. 1896/04, \u00a7 83, 8 January 2009; Khachukayev v.

If the Government failed to rebut this presumption, this would constitute a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive part. Conversely, if the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Shakhgiriyeva and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a027251/03, \u00a7\u00a7 158-59, 8 January 2009; Abdurashidova v.

In each of the cases, the applicants\u2019 relatives were killed in an area that was under the full control of the State (see paragraphs 10, 51 and 75 above), and the manner in which the killings were carried out showed that the perpetrators were not afraid of drawing the attention of the local law-enforcement agencies and, even more so, that they could have belonged to the State authorities (see paragraphs 10-11, 57 and 78 above). The applicants consistently maintained that their relatives had been killed by State agents, and the domestic investigation did not duly examine any other theories regarding the perpetrators\u2019 possible identities.",

Russia, nos.\u00a02944/06 and 4 others, \u00a7 217, 18 December 2012). In the cases at hand, even though the incidents concerned the killing of the applicants\u2019 relatives and not their abduction and subsequent disappearance, the Court observes a number of similar defects rendering the criminal proceedings in question ineffective. The investigations have been ongoing for several years without attaining any tangible results, despite the applicants\u2019 consistent allegations concerning the involvement of State agents in the killings (see paragraphs 13, 54, 60, 84, 85, 92, 96 and 143 above), and numerous pieces of evidence, including eyewitness statements, substantiating those allegations (see, for example, paragraphs 16, 17, 18, 31, 51, 52, 53, 57, 65, 91, 93, 100 and 116 above). However, the investigators failed to verify the allegations or to question those police officers and/or military servicemen who \u2013 according to the eyewitnesses \u2013 could have been directly responsible for the killing of the applicants\u2019 relatives (see, for example, paragraphs 16, 30, 55, 57, 85, 94\u00a0and 101 above). The contents of the investigation files, as submitted to the Court, show that the investigators intended to question the possible perpetrators of the killings, but that in each case, in spite of having information regarding their identities and possible whereabouts, they failed to carry out those steps. Taking such steps would have played a crucial role in elucidating the circumstances of the crimes. The investigators\u2019 reluctance to take those steps led to the loss of precious time and negatively affected the overall conduct of the criminal proceedings (see, for example, Askhabova v. Russia, no. 54765/09, \u00a7 153, 18 April 2013). Considering the circumstances of the cases at hand, the Court does not find it necessary to examine separately whether the investigations into the killings were sufficiently independent.",

Therefore, it is highly doubtful that any further court appeals by the applicant in Shamsudinova (no. 4635/08) against the investigators\u2019 decisions would have had any prospects of spurring the progress of the investigation or effectively influencing its conduct. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Government\u2019s objection in respect of that application as regards the applicant\u2019s failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
