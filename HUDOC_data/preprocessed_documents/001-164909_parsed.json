The Court has rejected this approach as being excessively formalistic, because the absence of legislation on prisoners\u2019 attendance at hearings cannot be interpreted as sufficient grounds for depriving them of the right to appear (see Gryaznov v.

Contrary to the Government\u2019s claim that the applicants could have effectively presented their cases to the courts because they had all been duly informed of the hearings, merely informing the applicants of the appeal hearing dates was clearly insufficient in a situation where the current state of the domestic law in reality prevented them from attending.",
