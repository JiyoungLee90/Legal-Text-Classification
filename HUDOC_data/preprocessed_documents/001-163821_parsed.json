The courts had a duty to examine every two months if reasons for detention persisted and, depending on the circumstances, extend it or revoke it. There was no obligation on the courts to specify how long the detention would last, given their obligation to control the duration of the detention every two months. However, these statutory time-limits were not mandatory and the fact that the decision had been issued after two months and four days could not therefore be decisive for concluding that the applicant\u2019s right to liberty was violated. The court also held that the High Court and the Court of Appeals had not stated that the applicant was guilty but that it transpired from the case-file and the disputed decisions that the applicant had been charged with the relevant criminal offence. The court did not address the complaint about the lack of a stamp and signature on the copy of the decision extending the detention on 22 September 2011.",

Montenegro, nos. 1451/10, 7260/10 and 7382/10, \u00a7 123, 24 November 2015). The applicant in the present case, however, had availed himself of this remedy even before that date and the Constitutional Court had indeed accepted his first constitutional appeal and had quashed the impugned decision of the Court of Appeals (see paragraph 15 above). In view of that, the Court considers that the applicant could reasonably believe that his second constitutional appeal also had prospects of success and that for that reason the six-month time-limit should start running as of the day when the applicant was served with the decision of the Constitutional Court of 20 April 2012 (see, mutatis mutandis, Sini\u0161taj\u00a0and Others, cited above, \u00a7 130).",

The Government submitted no delivery slip or any other proof to the contrary, but rather argued that since the applicant had been detained at IECS and had had no representative at the time, the date when the decision was served on IECS should also be considered as the date when the applicant received it. In order words, the six month time-limit should be calculated from the day when the decision was served on the IECS.",

As the Government offered no evidence whatsoever to the contrary, the Court is disposed to accept as plausible the applicant\u2019s submission that he received the decision on 25 May 2012.

That is why the question whether a court has failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons, deriving from Article 6, can only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case.

It suffices, in the absence of a formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official in question regards the accused as guilty, while a premature expression of such an opinion by the tribunal itself will inevitably fall foul of the said presumption (see, among other authorities, Garycki v. Poland, no. 14348/02, \u00a7 66, 6 February 2007; Perica Oreb v. Croatia, no. 20824/09, \u00a7 140, 31 October 2013; and Karaman v. Germany, no. 17103/10, \u00a7 63, 27 February 2014).",

However, even assuming that he was found guilty thereby, on 22 September 2011, that is long before the first-instance judgment was rendered, the High Court had extended the applicant\u2019s detention.
