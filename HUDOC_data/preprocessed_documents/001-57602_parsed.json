Any person who is detained may make an ex parte, that is to say, a unilateral, application for a writ of habeas corpus to a Divisional Court of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division or, if no such Court is sitting at that time, to a single judge (of the High Court) in court or, if there is none, to such a judge wherever he may be found. Habeas corpus is a common law remedy, developed both by statute and by the courts themselves, by which a person may challenge the legality of his detention. Applications are given priority over other business. The case is considered on the basis of affidavit evidence, as to which cross-examination does not take place in practice. The normal procedure is for applications to be made by counsel; only in exceptional circumstances would a court hear an applicant in person. The judge or the  may, where the illegality is clear, order that the writ issue forthwith but more commonly will arrange for the person holding the detainee to be notified of the application and be given an opportunity of appearing before the full court to justify the detention. If at the hearing the  is not satisfied that the detention is lawful, it will issue the writ which will have the effect of procuring the release of the person detained.",

However, section 66 par. 3, it should not be forgotten, is concerned with the recall, perhaps in circumstances when some danger is apprehended, of patients whose discharge from hospital has been restricted for the protection of the public (section 65 par. 1 of the 1959 Act - see paragraph 11 above). The Winterwerp judgment expressly identified \"emergency cases\" as constituting an exception to the principle that the individual concerned should not be deprived of his liberty \"unless he has been reliably shown to be of \u2018unsound mind\u2019\" (ibid., p. 18, par. 39); neither can it be inferred from the Winterwerp judgment that the \"objective medical expertise\" must in all conceivable cases be obtained before rather than after confinement of a person on the ground of unsoundness of mind. Clearly, where a provision of domestic law is designed, amongst other things, to authorise emergency confinement of persons capable of presenting a danger to others, it would be impracticable to require thorough medical examination prior to any arrest or detention. A wide discretion must in the nature of things be enjoyed by the national authority empowered to order such emergency confinements. In the Court\u2019s view, the terms of section 66 par. 3, read in their context, do not grant an arbitrary power to the Home Secretary; nor are they such that they exclude observance in individual cases of the principles stated in the Winterwerp judgment (see, mutatis mutandis, the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 91, par. 240).",

Three minimum conditions required for \"the lawful detention of a person of unsound mind\" are set out above (at paragraph 40). Whilst the Court undoubtedly has the jurisdiction to verify the fulfilment of these conditions in a given case, the logic of the system of safeguard established by the Convention places limits on the scope of this control; since the national authorities are better placed to evaluate the evidence adduced before them, they are to be recognised as having a certain discretion in the matter and the Court\u2019s task is limited to reviewing under the Convention the decisions they have taken (see the above-mentioned Winterwerp judgment, pp. 18 and 20, par. 40 and 46).",

The responsible medical officer therefore referred the matter to the Home Office and, acting on the doctor\u2019s advice, the Home Secretary issued a warrant in pursuance of which the applicant was recalled to hospital the same day, without prior medical examination or verification of the wife\u2019s allegations (see paragraph 23 above).",

When the Home Secretary, pursuant to section 66 par. 2, discharges a patient from hospital while a restriction order is in force (see paragraph 12 above), he is thus suspending a measure taken to protect the public. As was stated by one of the Divisional Court judges at the hearing on 21 June 1974 in the habeas corpus proceedings brought by X, very often the only way patients of this kind can be allowed back into the community is by releasing them on licence, with very careful supervision and an immediate reaction in the event of a sign of new danger (see paragraph 29 in fine above).",

In paragraph 1 (e) of Article 5 (art. 5-1-e) as interpreted by the Court (see the above-mentioned Winterwerp judgment, pp. 17-18, par. 39, and paragraph 43 above), the Convention itself makes the \"lawfulness\" of the kind of deprivation of liberty undergone by X subject to certain requirements over and above conformity with domestic law.

Such measures, provided they are of short duration (see the above-mentioned Winterwerp judgment, p. 19, par. 42), are capable of being \"lawful\" under Article 5 par. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e) even though not attended by the usual guarantees such as thorough medical examination (see paragraph 41 above).

The Court would point out in the first place that the need for the applicant to be apprised of the reasons for his recall necessarily followed in any event from paragraph 4 of Article 5 (art. 5-4): anyone entitled - as X was (see paragraph 54 above) - to take proceedings to have the lawfulness of his detention speedily decided cannot make effective use of that right unless he is promptly and adequately informed of the facts and legal authority relied on to deprive him of his liberty. The Court further notes that at the close of the first hearing before the , the application for a writ of habeas corpus was adjourned because the  itself felt that more information was required before any decision could be arrived at (see paragraph 26 in fine above). At the adjourned hearing on 21 June 1974, since the detention was apparently legal, the onus was effectively on X to show that the Home Secretary had acted unlawfully in exercising his statutory discretion. However, it is clear from the evidence that lack of information as to the specific reasons for the recall, a matter almost exclusively within the knowledge of the Home Secretary, prevented X\u2019s counsel, and thus the , from going deeper into the question (see paragraph 56 above). Consequently, the complaint under paragraph 2 (art. 5-2) amounts, in the particular circumstances, to no more than one aspect of the complaint that the Court has already considered in relation to paragraph 4 (art. 5-4); there is no call to rule on the merits of a particular issue which is part of and absorbed by a wider issue (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Deweer judgment, pp. 30-31, par. 56 in fine, and the Dudgeon judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, par. 69).",
