The Court observes that it has already been established that the Code of Obligations did not provide for effective remedies with respect to complaints of undue length of proceedings (see Lukenda, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054-60 and 66-71). However, the 2006 Act, on which the applicant also relied in his claim, provided for a special compensatory remedy which was found in Korenjak v. Slovenia ((dec.), no.\u00a0463/03, 15\u00a0May\u00a02007) and Carevi\u0107 v. Slovenia ((dec.), no. 17314/03, 3\u00a0June 2008) to constitute an appropriate means of redressing a violation of the right to have one\u2019s case examined within a reasonable time. The Court further notes that the  took the position that section 25 of the 2006 Act, which concerned transitional rules, applied to the proceedings in question and that the compensation claim would have been admissible in the applicant\u2019s case if it had been lodged within the statutory time-limit. In this connection, the Court observes that applicants must comply with the applicable rules and procedures of domestic law when making use of domestic remedies (see Begu\u0161 v. , no. 25634/05, \u00a7\u00a029, 15 December 2011, and Ben Salah, Araqui and Dhaime v.  (dec.), no. 45023/98, ECHR 2000-IV), and finds that the present applicant failed to do so. The Government\u2019s objection concerning the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies as regards the complaint of undue delays under Article 6 \u00a7 1 must therefore be upheld (Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 of the Convention).",
