Mr Nemtsov had actually accused the Moscow mayor of criminal offences under Articles\u00a0290 (bribery) or 201 (abuse of position in a commercial or other organisation) of the Criminal Code. The Government drew parallels between the present case and the Court\u2019s inadmissibility decision in the case of Vitrenko and Others v. Ukraine (dec.) (no. 23510/02, 16\u00a0December 2008), in which one of the applicants had called her political rival a thief without justification. As to the proportionality of the award, the Government cited five domestic judgments in defamation cases in which the awards had ranged from RUB 270,000 to 4,000,000. In their view, those judgments indicated that the award in the present case had not been exceptional or excessive. They also referred to the Court\u2019s judgments in cases in which comparable amounts had been awarded but the Court had not found a violation of Article 10.",

The facts in the report had justified the conclusions which Mr\u00a0Nemtsov had drawn from them.

Just a few months after the end of the defamation proceedings the President of Russia dismissed Mr\u00a0Luzhkov from his position for a loss of confidence.

The courts did not take into account Mr Luzhkov\u2019s position of a professional politician who should have been more tolerant of criticism. As to Mr Nemtsov\u2019s spontaneous reaction to a provocative comment by the mayor\u2019s spokesperson, the applicants considered that he was entitled to a degree of exaggeration. The courts acknowledged that the response was his \u201cjudgment\u201d rather than a factual allegation but nevertheless held him responsible for the failure to establish its truth.

Mr Nemtsov concluded that systemic corruption at all levels of the Moscow government had been spearheaded by the Moscow mayor and his wife. The second statement which the courts held to be defamatory was Mr Nemtsov\u2019s reaction to the comment by the mayor\u2019s spokesman who had described him as a \u201cnon-entity\u201d unable to \u201cmeasure up to the mayor\u201d. Mr Nemstov quipped that he should not indeed be compared to Mr Luzhkov who, unlike him, was a \u201ccorruptionist\u201d and a \u201cthief\u201d.",

The issues in the report were matters of intense public interest for Moscow residents and could have swayed their voting intentions. The Court reiterates that free elections and freedom of expression together form the bedrock of any democratic system. The two rights are inter-related and operate to reinforce each other, as freedom of expression is one of the \u201cconditions\u201d necessary to \u201censure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\u201d. For this reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely. This principle applies equally to national and local elections (see Kwiecie\u0144 v. Poland, no. 51744/99, \u00a7 48, ECHR 2007-I). As a general rule, any opinions and information pertinent to elections which are disseminated during the electoral campaign should be considered as forming part of a debate on questions of public interest. Statements made as part of an election campaign are accorded the high level of protection under Article\u00a010, leaving the State authorities a particularly narrow margin of appreciation for suppressing such speech (see Morice v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a029369/10, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2015).",

They did not note that, as a professional politician and the elected head of the city government, the mayor inevitably and knowingly laid himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed. The requirements of the protection of his reputation had to be weighed against the interests of open discussion of political issues. The courts\u2019 decisions were confined to the assessment of damage which the mayor\u2019s reputation may have suffered in connection with Mr Nemtsov\u2019s remarks and the lack of substantiation of what they considered to be factual allegations of criminal conduct. They failed to recognise that the instant case was one where the margin of appreciation available to the authorities in establishing the necessity for the impugned measure was particularly narrow. Nor did they attempt to perform a balancing exercise between the need to protect the plaintiff\u2019s reputation and the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression. Those failings call for the conclusion that the domestic courts failed to \u201capply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010\u201d (see Terentyev v. Russia, no. 25147/09, \u00a7 24, 26\u00a0January 2017).",

The statement accusing Mr Luzhkov and his wife of setting a \u201charmful example\u201d of corrupt practices was followed with concrete examples of such practices, including the mayor\u2019s orders allocating a large swathe of land for development by his wife\u2019s company or transferring a State-owned manufacturer of prefabricated housing into her company\u2019s ownership (see paragraph 4 above). These factual elements were not disputed in the proceedings; the plaintiffs did not challenge them. In the Court\u2019s view, those undisputed elements lent support to the conclusion which Mr Nemtsov drew from them. In so far as he also quoted as saying that he considered Mr Luzhkov to be a \u201ccorruptionist\u201d and a \u201cthief\u201d, the Court acknowledges that these are strong words which suggest involvement in criminal activities (see Vitrenko and Others, cited above). However, the absence of a criminal conviction does not necessarily exclude the reality of the alleged facts, in particular, where such allegations have not yet been officially investigated (see Nadtoka v. Russia, no. 38010/05, \u00a7 45, 31 May 2016; see also Fedchenko v.\u00a0Russia (no. 4), no. 17221/13, \u00a7 47, 2\u00a0October 2018, and Marian Maciejewski v. Poland, no. 34447/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07276, 13\u00a0January 2015, in which the applicants\u2019 use of the words like \u201cthieves\u201d was found, in the circumstances, not to have overstepped the margins of exaggeration or even provocation covered by freedom of expression). Mr\u00a0Nemstov was reacting to a rather offensive comment by the mayor\u2019s spokesman, and his reaction was reported as is, without editing. Spontaneous forms of expression allow for a greater degree of exaggeration and cannot be held to the same standard of accuracy as written assertions (compare Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, \u00a7 46, 29 February 2000, and Ottan v.\u00a0France, no. 41841/12, \u00a7 69, 19 April 2018).",

The Court reiterates its constant approach that an individual\u2019s liability in defamation must not extend beyond his or her own words. Punishing a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so (see Reznik v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4977/05, \u00a7\u00a045, 4 April 2013, and Stojanovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a023160/09, \u00a7\u00a7 39 and 70, 19 September 2013).

Mr Luzhkov was awarded a total of RUB\u00a01,000,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, that is to say, almost EUR 23,000 at the material time. That award was unusually high in absolute terms but also many times higher in relation to awards in comparable defamation cases that have come before the Court (see, for example, Grinberg v. Russia, no.\u00a023472/03, \u00a7 12, 21 July 2005 \u2013 RUB\u00a02,500 to the Governor of the Ulyanovsk Region out of the RUB\u00a0500,000 he had claimed; Fedchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 33333/04, \u00a7 15, 11\u00a0February 2010 \u2013 RUB 5,000 to a member of Parliament out of the RUB\u00a0500,000 he had claimed; Novaya Gazeta and Borodyanskiy v.

An award of damages must be \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d in the sense that it must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered (see Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the , 13 July 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 48-51, Series A no.\u00a0316B). However, when making the pecuniary award against the applicants, the District Court merely stated a few generalities, such as \u201cfactual elements of the case\u201d or \u201ccontents of publications\u201d (see paragraph 9 above). It did not give a specific justification for granting such a large amount in damages or carry out a serious assessment of its proportionality (compare Kwiecie\u0144, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056). In these circumstances, the Court finds that a high award of damages to Mr\u00a0Luzhkov did not pursue a \u201cpressing social need\u201d and was not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d (compare I\u00a0Avgi Publishing and Press Agency S.A. and Karis v.\u00a0Greece, no. 15909/06, \u00a7 35, 5 June 2008).",
