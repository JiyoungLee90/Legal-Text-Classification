The Delegate stated that an oral hearing was not only an additional guarantee that an endeavour would be made to establish the truth, but also helped to ensure that the accused, or the person conducting, like Mr Helmers, a private prosecution to defend his reputation, was satisfied that his case was being determined by a tribunal, the independence and impartiality of which he could verify.",

This was especially so where the offence at issue was only a minor one. In such cases the effective control of the impartial administration of justice was ensured, inter alia, by compliance with the principle of equality of arms and through the public character of the proceedings, in this instance by virtue of public access to the case-file.",

However, even where a court of appeal has jurisdiction to review the case both as to facts and as to law, the Court cannot find that Article 6 (art. 6) always requires a right to a public hearing irrespective of the nature of the issues to be decided. The publicity requirement is certainly one of the means whereby confidence in the courts is maintained. However, there are other considerations, including the right to trial within a reasonable time and the related need for expeditious handling of the courts\u2019 case-load, which must be taken into account in determining the necessity of a public hearing at stages in the proceedings subsequent to the trial at first instance.",

Mr Ekbatani denied the facts upon which the charge against him was founded. However, he was convicted by the District Court on the basis of the evidence given by the complainant. For the Court of Appeal the crucial question therefore concerned the credibility of the two persons involved. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal decided, without a public hearing, to confirm the District Court\u2019s conviction. After an examination of the particular circumstances of that case, the Court found that the question of Mr Ekbatani\u2019s guilt or innocence \"could not, as a matter of fair trial, have been properly determined without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the applicant ... and by the complainant\". Accordingly, the Court considered that \"the Court of Appeal\u2019s re-examination of Mr Ekbatani\u2019s conviction at first instance ought to have comprised a full rehearing of the applicant and the complainant\" (Series A no. 134, p. 14, para. 32).",

Furthermore, relying on a number of facts not explicitly mentioned in his appeal submissions in the appointment case, but which were said to be generally known, at least in the circles concerned, Mr Helmers disputed the District Court\u2019s view that the committee\u2019s summary of his appeal was factually correct.

That is because, generally speaking, in \"civil\" cases there is no need to assess a party\u2019s credibility and only seldom any other reason why the court should hear a party in person, while in \"criminal\" cases this may be of great importance. Thus, I find that the specific objectives underlying the institution of criminal proceedings for the purpose of establishing a person\u2019s guilt or innocence justify that such a person should enjoy greater possibilities of appearing in person than a party to \"civil\" proceedings. However, for present purposes the proceedings instituted by Mr Helmers before the Swedish courts have to be examined in the light of the requirements of \"fairness\" applicable to \"civil\" proceedings.",

To my mind, the relevant facts, i.e. the contents of Mr Helmers\u2019 appeal submissions to the \"UH\u00c4\", the special university committee\u2019s summary thereof and the \"notorious\" facts regarding the animosities at the University (see paragraphs 16 and 17 of the judgment), were all unchallenged. Furthermore, Mr Helmers had been given the opportunity to argue his case in written submissions to the Court of Appeal as elaborately as he wished and his request for an oral hearing could have had no other relevant purpose than to be allowed to plead his case in person. Moreover, it must be taken into account that although the proceedings brought before the Court of Appeal were undoubtedly of importance for Mr Helmers, they were equally important for the defendants, who apparently did not desire an oral hearing. In these circumstances and taking into account that for the present purposes the proceedings brought by Mr Helmers have to be put on a par with \"civil\" proceedings and the fact that there had been a full hearing at first instance, as well as the proper margin of appreciation for the Court of Appeal, I find that this court did not violate the requirements implied in the notion of a \"fair and public hearing\" when it refused Mr Helmers\u2019 request for an oral hearing.",

The applicant\u2019s decision to bring a private prosecution coupled with a claim for symbolic compensation, instead of bringing a civil action against the committee for issuing what he considered to be a defamatory summary of his allegations, could neither change the criminal nature of the proceedings he instituted nor extinguish or limit the rights of the defendants under Article 6 (art. 6) as a whole.

The direct assessment of the evidence by the deciding judge is, however, a guarantee which is related to the \"immediacy principle\" rather than to the public character of the hearing and, as such, is a matter that goes to the fairness of the procedure, inherent in the concept of \"proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable\".",

Accordingly, in my opinion, an oral hearing is not required when the case may be properly decided on evidence which is available in the case-file and is not contradicted by the parties, when the presence of the appellant and the respondent is not relevant for the outcome of the case, and when a substitute for oral argument by the parties is provided by written observations submitted in a procedure that complies fully with the rights of the defence and the principle of equality of arms.

Although they went to the merits of the case, all these points had to be determined by the appellate judges solely by reference to the written evidence available in the case-file (the committee\u2019s certificate, the text of Mr Helmers\u2019 appeal, the composition of the committee) and the law applicable, and in the light of the written observations of the parties.

Thus, it would be somewhat paradoxical if a State that affords such a right were held to be in violation of that Article (art. 6) if it empowered its courts of appeal to dispense with a hearing when they considered that it was not necessary for a fair disposal of the case, whilst another State, which does not allow appeals or allows only limited appeals (such as cassation proceedings), were to be seen as acting in accordance with the Convention.",
