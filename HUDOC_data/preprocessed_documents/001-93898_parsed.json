Therefore, there had been a risk that he might abscond if released. Further, the domestic courts had referred to the danger of his reoffending, that danger being gauged by reference to his membership of the National Bolshevik Party. That party had been recognised as an extremist organisation by a Russian court and had been banned. Its members had resorted to radical and violent action to express their political views. The applicant had been previously fined in administrative proceedings for commission of disorderly acts, which also proved that he was likely to reoffend. The domestic courts had also taken into account the fact that the imputed offence had been committed by an organised group.

The Court accepts that that factor was relevant in assessing the danger of his reoffending. Such a danger, if convincingly established, may lead the judicial authorities to place and leave a suspect in detention in order to prevent any attempts to commit further offences. It is however necessary, among other conditions, that the danger be a plausible one and the measure appropriate, in the light of the circumstances of the case and in particular the past history and the personality of the person concerned (see Clooth v. Belgium, 12\u00a0December 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0225, \u00a7\u00a040). In the cases of Clooth v. Belgium and Kolev v. Bulgaria (see below) the Court found that the applicant\u2019s previous criminal record did not justify his detention because the offences which had given rise to his previous convictions were non-violent and were not comparable, either in nature or degree of seriousness, to the charges preferred against him in the contested proceedings (see Clooth, cited above, \u00a7 40, and Kolev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a050326/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-61, 28 April 2005). In the present case the applicant\u2019s record included only minor non-violent administrative offences and he had no criminal record. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s record of administrative offences did not justify his continued detention (see, for similar reasoning, Aleksey Makarov v. Russia, no. 3223/07, \u00a7 51, 12 June 2008).",

Russia, no.\u00a032327/06, \u00a7 62, 15 May 2008). There is no indication in the present case that before his arrest the applicant had made any attempts to intimidate witnesses or to obstruct the course of the proceedings in any other way. In such circumstances the Court has difficulty accepting that there was a risk of interference with the administration of justice at the later stages of the proceedings. Such risk was bound to gradually decrease as the trial proceeded and the witnesses were interviewed (compare Miszkurka v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a039437/03, \u00a7\u00a051, 4 May 2006) The Court is not therefore persuaded that compelling reasons existed for a fear that the applicant would interfere with witnesses or otherwise hamper the investigation of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh his right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

In the present case, the domestic courts did not point to any aspects of the applicant\u2019s character or behaviour that would justify their conclusion that he presented such risks.
