In such circumstances, the applicant\u2019s argument did not require a separate reply, in the light of the principles established in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Moreira Ferreira, cited above, \u00a7\u00a084).

He did not submit any legal or financial documents in support of this claim at the time of making the submissions. Following the expiry of the time-limit fixed for that purpose, the applicant re-submitted, of his own initiative, claims under Article\u00a041 of the Convention, and provided the Court with a copy of a contract dated 16\u00a0March 2009. The contract related to the services to be provided by the applicant\u2019s three representatives before the Court (see paragraph\u00a02 above) but it was only signed by one of them. As per the terms of the contract, the applicant was to pay 2,000 Georgian laris (GEL - approximately EUR 910) at the moment of signature and the same amount, within two years of signing the contract. No proof of such payment was submitted to the Court. The applicant did not clarify the reasons behind failing to comply with the relevant time-limit.",
