The Court does not accept that proposition. It is true that the Convention does not guarantee a right to have a penalty imposed by a court in criminal proceedings suspended for a probationary period (see X\u00a0v.\u00a0Switzerland, no. 7648/76, Commission decision of 6 December 1977, Decisions and Reports 11, p. 190).

It further observes that the Court of Appeal dispatched a certified copy of its decision on 12 April 2000. That copy was received by the  on 13 April 2000. On the same day the  transmitted the decision to the prison and directed the applicant's release. Those documents were received by the prison administration on 14\u00a0April 2000. The Court observes that the Government have not explained what means were used for the dispatch of the relevant decision and whether the dispatch was effected without delay. Moreover, the Government did not present a detailed account of the relevant events, from the time of the delivery of the decision by the Court of Appeal until the precise moment of the applicant's release. In this connection, the Court reiterates that it must scrutinise complaints of delays in the release of detainees with particular vigilance (Nikolov, cited above, \u00a7 80). According to the applicant, the Court of Appeal's decision was given on 12 April 2000 at 9\u00a0a.m. and he was released only on 14 April 2000 at 4 p.m. Consequently, the delay between the delivery of the Court of Appeal's decision and the applicant's release exceeded 48 hours. In the Court's view the administrative formalities related to the applicant's release could and should have been carried out more swiftly.
