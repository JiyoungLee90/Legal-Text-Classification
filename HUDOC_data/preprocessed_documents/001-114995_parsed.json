For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, as a recent example, Tyagunova v. Russia, no.\u00a019433/07, \u00a7\u00a065, 31\u00a0July 2012). In cases under Articles 2 and\u00a03 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). Consideration has been given to the opening of investigations, delays in taking statements (see Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no.\u00a023531/94, \u00a7\u00a089, ECHR\u00a02000VI, and Tekin v.

The operational team examined the scene of the incident on the same day and questioned the applicants and Z. on the circumstances of the alleged beatings.
