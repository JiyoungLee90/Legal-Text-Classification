The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7 83). Whereas in the Bouyid case it was not disputed that the applicant did not display any marks of injuries on entering the police station, the present case is different. According to the forensic expert, the applicant\u2019s main injury, namely his broken tibia, predated his arrest of 20 July 2015 (see paragraph 49 above). There are also indications that further minor injuries on the applicant\u2019s leg and arm likewise occurred prior to the incident (see paragraph 50 above). Therefore, it cannot be established that the events entailing the applicant\u2019s injuries lied wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, and it is not evident that the applicant was in good health when taken into police custody. Against this background, and in contrast to Bouyid, no strong presumptions of fact arise in respect of injuries occurring while the applicant was within the control of the police, which would be necessary for the burden to shift onto the Government to explain how the injuries were caused and produce evidence casting doubt on the veracity of the applicant\u2019s allegations.",

The Court also notes in that regard that despite the expert\u2019s conclusion that the applicant\u2019s leg injury predated the events, that contradicted the applicant\u2019s version, the domestic authorities did not find the applicant\u2019s account to be inconsistent or contradictory, but nonetheless proceeded on the assumption that the applicant was unable to recall the events (see paragraph 19 above).",

Similarly, no further measures were taken with a view to resolving the discrepancy between the police officers\u2019 version of events, according to which the applicant had inflicted the injuries on himself, and the allegation that the injuries had been caused as a consequence of the legitimate use of force to overcome the applicant\u2019s resistance.
