As time went by, D. matured and was able to take his own decisions in respect of his contacts with his father. The Court notes that the domestic authorities were also aware of the fact that the nature of the applicant's contact with D. became dependent not only on the attitude of the child's mother, but also on the boy's own wishes (see paragraphs 12, 17 and 23 above). In addition, the Court observes that between 2001 and 2005 the applicant had not sought any contact with D. which was noted by the domestic court (see paragraph 27 above). The Court reiterates here that it is not seeking to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities as regards parental authority, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their margin of appreciation (see\u00a0Kaleta v.\u00a0Poland, no. 11375/02, \u00a7 58, 16 December 2008).",
