The applicant claimed several times that the accusations were false. He stated, inter alia, that it was not a priority for him for the girl\u2019s name to be exposed and that he was not seeking revenge against her. He accepted that having placed himself in the spotlight of the media he had to tolerate publicity which was not always \u201csunshine and lollipops\u201d but criticised the way the media had covered his case. When asked about the girl\u2019s age, he responded that the girl had been in a club where the minimum age had been 20 years and that it had been a shock to find out later that she had been only 18 years old. When asked about his complaints against the girl for allegedly wrongful accusations, he stated again that he was not seeking revenge against those who had reported him to the police, but that it was clear that they had had ulterior motives. He hoped that the police would see that it was important to have a formal conclusion in the case and that the documents in the case were \u201cscreaming\u201d conspiracy.",

In the same way, the applicant had to take responsibility for material he issued, irrespective of the name he chose to use when doing so. The court further considered that the altered picture, along with the text, should be considered as a whole and that it contained X\u2019s opinion of the applicant\u2019s person, which indicated a strong dislike. As to the subject matter, the District Court found that the picture and the statement had been a part of general public debate because the applicant was a well-known person in Iceland and had to accept being the subject of public discussions. The court then described in detail his professional activities of writing online, publishing books and appearing on television, especially under pseudonyms, the subject matter of his work, the subsequent criticism of his work and his participation in public debates about it. The court noted that this had led to greater outcry and public debate about the accusations against him of sexual offences, a debate in which he had participated. The court concluded that the manner in which the words had been presented by X had been more invective than a factual statement, and should therefore be considered as a value judgment rather than a statement of fact.

The views of the [applicant] published there garnered some attention, as well as controversy; views which included his attitudes towards women and their sexual freedom. The documents of the case reveal that there were instances when his criticism had been directed towards named individuals, often women, and in some cases his words could be construed to mean that he was in fact recommending that they should be subjected to sexual violence. The [applicant] has often justified such conduct by stating that the material had been meant in jest and that those who criticised it lacked a sense of humour. The Supreme Court agrees with the District Court that the [applicant] enjoys the personal protection provided for by law, under Article 71 of the Constitution and Article 8(1) of the European Convention of Human Rights, cf. Act No 62/1994, irrespective of whether he was appearing under his own name or a pseudonym.

[X] enjoys freedom of expression according to Article 73(2) of the Icelandic Constitution and Article 10(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the District Court reached the correct conclusion that under these circumstances he had enjoyed greater freedom to express himself about the [applicant] and his opinions.",

Although it can be agreed that by using the term \u2018rapist\u2019 about a named person, that person is being accused of committing rape, account must be taken of the context in which the term is set, cf. the ruling of the Supreme Court on 29 January 2009 in Case No 321/2008. If the altered picture and the comment \u2018Fuck you rapist bastard\u2019 are taken as a whole \u2013 as the parties agree should be the case \u2013 the Supreme Court agrees with the District Court that this was a case of invective on the part of [X] against the [applicant] in a ruthless public debate, which the latter, as stated previously, had instigated. It was therefore a value judgment about the [applicant] and not a factual statement that he was guilty of committing rape. In this context, it makes a difference, even though this alone is not decisive for the conclusion, that [X] did not maintain that the [applicant] had thus committed a criminal offence against someone else, named or unnamed. Accordingly, and with reference to the conclusion of the appealed judgment, the conclusion that [X] expressed himself within the limits of the freedom to which he is entitled under Article 73(2) of the Constitution, must be upheld. As a result he is acquitted of all the [applicant\u2019s] claims.",

At the same time, the risk of harm posed by content and communications on the Internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms, particularly the right to respect for private life, is certainly higher than that posed by the press (see, inter alia, Delfi AS v.

If the altered picture and the comment \u2018Fuck you rapist bastard\u2019 are taken as a whole \u2013 as the parties agree should be the case \u2013 the Supreme Court agrees with the District Court that this was a case of invective on the part of [X] against the [applicant] in a ruthless public debate, which the latter, as stated previously, had instigated. It was therefore a value judgment about the [applicant] and not a factual statement that he was guilty of committing rape. In this context, it makes a difference, even though this alone is not decisive for the conclusion, that [X] did not maintain that the [applicant] had thus committed a criminal offence against someone else, named or unnamed\u201d (see paragraph 16 above).",

It directly refers to a person who has committed the act of rape, which is criminalised under the Icelandic Penal Code (see paragraph\u00a018 above). The veracity of an allegation of rape can therefore be proven.

Although the Court does not exclude the possibility that an objective statement of fact, such as the one impugned in the present case, can, contextually, be classified as a value judgment the contextual elements justifying such a conclusion must be convincing in the light of the objective and factual nature of the term \u201crapist\u201d taken at face value.

In other words, although the Court has no reason to call into question the Supreme Court\u2019s findings that the statement was a part of a \u201cruthless public debate\u201d prompted by the applicant\u2019s behaviour and public persona, the factual context in which the statement was made, and its allegation that the applicant was a \u201crapist\u201d, was the criminal proceedings in which the applicant had been accused of the very same criminal act to which the statement referred, proceedings which had been discontinued by the public prosecutor for lack of evidence (see paragraph 6 above).",

In light of the above, and in particular the objective and factual nature of the term \u201crapist\u201c, when viewed on its face, the Court finds that the contextual assessment made by the Supreme Court did not adequately take account of relevant and sufficient elements so as to justify the conclusion that the statement constituted a value judgment. However, even assuming that the Court were to accept the Supreme Court\u2019s classification of the statement \u201crapist\u201d as a value judgment, the Court recalls that under its settled case-law (see paragraph 40 above), even where a statement amounts to a value judgment there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive. In the light of the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against the applicant just prior to the publication of the applicant\u2019s newspaper interview, the Supreme Court failed to explain sufficiently the factual basis that could have justified assessing the use of the term \u201crapist\u201d as a value judgment, the Supreme Court merely referring, as previously mentioned, to the applicant\u2019s participation in a \u201cruthless public debate\u201d which he had \u201cinstigated\u201d when he gave the interview in question. In short, Article 8 of the Convention must be interpreted to mean that persons, even disputed public persons that have instigated a heated debate due to their behaviour and public comments, do not have to tolerate being publicly accused of violent criminal acts without such statements being supported by facts. The Court therefore finds that the statement was of a serious nature and capable of damaging the applicant\u2019s reputation. It reached such a level of seriousness as to cause prejudice to the applicant\u2019s enjoyment of the right to respect for private life for Article 8 to come into play (see, inter alia, A v.

But the domestic defamation proceedings did not \u2013 or at least did not explicitly \u2013 turn on the question whether X had proven what he wanted to express. Having regard to Article 235 of the Penal Code (quoted in paragraph 19 of the judgment), the question was whether X had alleged anything that might be harmful to the applicant\u2019s honour. In my opinion, the question whether the expression was a statement of fact or a value judgment is a relevant issue, but not a decisive one. Even the question whether or not there was a sufficient factual basis to support the expression is not decisive.
