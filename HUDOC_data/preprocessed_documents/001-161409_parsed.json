As regards the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d required under that provision, the Court has held that the fact that an applicant has not been charged or brought before a court does not necessarily mean that the purpose of his detention is not in accordance with that provision (see Brogan and Others, cited above, \u00a7 53). Sub-paragraph (c) of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 does not presuppose that the police should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges. However, the requirement that the suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention. For there to be reasonable suspicion that the detained person may have committed an offence, there must be facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 182; Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 155, ECHR\u00a02000IV; Gusinskiy v.

Firstly, it noted that the orders for the applicants\u2019 arrests did not refer to facts or information substantiating any reasonable suspicion that the applicants had committed offences. Although additional information had been presented during the subsequent domestic proceedings, the Court found that it was also insufficient to justify any such suspicion (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04651). Secondly, the Court pointed out that the applicants had not been arrested with the purpose of bringing them before a competent legal authority, as further required by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), because the police had apparently not intended to carry out any investigation into the offences allegedly committed by them, and had merely kept the applicants in detention until the expiry of the statutory twenty-four-hour time-limit. In particular, the applicants had not been formally interviewed or involved in any other investigative measures. In addition, the Court criticised the MIAA for not clearly requiring that an arrest justified by a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that the person affected had committed an offence should be carried out with the purpose of bringing them before a competent judicial body (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a052-53 and 45).",
