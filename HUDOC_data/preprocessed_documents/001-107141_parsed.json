Moreover, while the applicants Mr \u0160trucl and Mr\u00a0Klan\u0161ek were for the remaining part of their detention allocated more personal space, during three and two months of that period, respectively, they still stayed in cells where they had no more than 3.25 square metres of personal space, which was further reduced by the furniture in the cells (see Modarca v.

However in such overcrowded conditions as faced by Ljubljana prison, it is hard to see how sentenced prisoners could reasonably spend their time out of their cells apart from time spent in the outside yard during dry weather conditions and when taking their meals in the prison canteen. In particular, the Court notes that the sentenced prisoners held in the closed section of the prison were locked up in their cells and were only able to leave them if they applied for certain activities, most of which were to take place in the recreation room (see paragraphs 28 to 30 above). Given the fact that there was only one 50square-metre recreation room per floor, which was to be used by ten inmates at most (see paragraphs 6 and 30 above), the Court finds it difficult to accept the Government\u2019s argument that the applicants were actually able to spend most of their out-of-cell time in that room.",

It moreover notes that the information supplied by the Government indicates that the temperatures in the cells in the late afternoon during the summer of 2009 were on average around 28 oC and could occasionally even exceed 30 oC (see paragraphs 23, 24 and 76 above). The applicants\u2019 complaint concerning high temperatures in the cells was further supported by the Human Rights Ombudsman\u2019s findings which, although they concerned the year 2007, are of relevance as the methods of ventilation of prison cells, namely, opening the windows and using personal fans, appear to have been the same then as in 2009 (see paragraph 56 above). The Court therefore finds that during the summer the conditions of the applicants\u2019 detention were further exacerbated by the high temperatures in the cells.",

In seven cases a transfer was ordered at the request of the prisoner \u2013 six of them were from  prison and one from Dob prison. The reasons for transfer in most cases was the need to maintain contact with family members who lived closer to the prison to which the transfer was ordered, and in one case a reference was made to the special needs of the prisoner due to his inability to communicate in Slovenian. In all of the decisions overcrowding was also mentioned as a factor. In sixty-three cases the transfer was ordered at the request of the prison governor either from  or Dob prison. Some of the cases concerned legislation which was in force under amendment no.\u00a062/2008 (see paragraph 42 above). However, the majority of the requests were upheld on the basis of the interpretation that the overcrowded conditions negatively affected the implementation of personal plans, security and order and discipline within the prison, which were grounds provided in paragraph 1 of section 79.",

On 20 May 2011 the Government informed the Court that a first judgment on this matter was delivered by the  on 9 May 2011. The court found in favour of the claimant, a detainee who spent about six months (in the period between July 2006 and March 2007) in  prison as a remand prisoner. For most of that time he was held together with five other detainees in a cell of about 18 square metres. The court found that all four elements of civil tort were established, namely: unlawful act, occurrence of damage, causal link and the defendant\u2019s responsibility. The court noted that there had been no jurisprudence on this matter so far and that this was the first judgment to establish the principles for the future. Referring also to Kalashnikov (cited above), the court noted that the rights guaranteed by the Convention represented minimum standards and that the protection afforded by the national legislation should go beyond this minimum. It found that the personal space afforded to the claimant was far below the standard of 7 square metres for a multi-occupancy cell recommended by the CPT and provided in the section 27 of the Regulation and was therefore in breach of the claimant\u2019s personal rights. The court further observed that the overcrowding had had a negative effect also on other aspects of dentition and found in this connection that the claimant\u2019s personal rights had been breached on account of poor ventilation, disturbances during the night, verbal and physical conflicts in the cell, and the impossibility for him to eat his meal at the table or use the telephone for at least ten minutes as provided in the regulations. Moreover, the court found that these conditions also amounted to a violation of Article 18 of the Slovenian Constitution, which prohibited torture or inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment. The claimant was awarded compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the amount of 2,290 euros (EUR).",

The authorities, being aware of the structural problem of overcrowding (see paragraphs 52 and\u00a053), which included the applicants\u2019 and a number of other cells in Ljubljana prison, could have therefore ordered the applicants\u2019 transfer had this been possible. In fact, Mr Klan\u0161ek\u2019s transfer of 18 February 2010 and Mr\u00a0Duki\u0107\u2019s transfer of 19 November 2009 were ordered on the basis of sections 79 and 81 of the ECS Act. The Court notes in this connection that the Government\u2019s suggestion that Mr Klan\u0161ek\u2019s transfer had been made on the basis of a request by him to that effect is not supported by the documents in the file. It moreover notes that the decision to transfer Mr\u00a0Klan\u0161ek and Mr Duki\u0107 was issued after they had been detained for almost nine and five months, respectively, in Ljubljana prison in cells where most of the time they had less than 3\u00a0square metres of personal space.",

To be considered effective in their situation, the remedy should have been able to lead to the improvement of the conditions they were detained in and not only to compensation for the damage sustained (Orchowski, cited above, \u00a7 108). Noting that the civil remedy under section\u00a0179 of the Civil Code is merely of a compensatory nature and no domestic court has so far imposed an injunction in order to change the situation which had given rise to the infringement of a prisoner\u2019s personal rights, the Court finds that the institution of civil proceedings could not have remedied the situation of the aforementioned applicants. As regards the applicant Mr Duki\u0107, who lodged his application after his release from Ljubljana prison, the Court acknowledges that the judgment of 9 May 2011, if it becomes final, represents an important development in the domestic jurisprudence in particular as regards circumstances where an alleged violation no longer continues because the person is already at liberty or has been transferred to a place of detention where conditions comply with the Convention standards. Welcoming this change, the Court nevertheless observes that for the time being the judgment of 9 May 2011 appears to be an isolated example which moreover has not been subject to review by the higher courts. Therefore, as things stand, the civil claim for compensation cannot be considered to be sufficiently certain in practice as regards compensation claimed in respect of allegedly inadequate prison conditions.",

The same is true for complaints under section 85 of the ECS Act (see paragraph 43 above).

However, it must be observed that a lack of resources cannot\u00a0in principle justify prison conditions which are so poor as to reach the threshold of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see, among others, Nazarenko v. Ukraine, no. 39483/98, \u00a7 144, 29 April 2003) and that it is incumbent on the respondent Government to organise its penitentiary system in such a way that ensures respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of financial or logistical difficulties (see Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7 63, 1 June 2006).",

The Court would observe in this connection that it would appear that the requirements concerning the minimum personal space in a shared cell to which the Government referred were not binding in respect of existing prison facilities (see paragraph 35 above). It would draw the Government\u2019s attention to the CPT\u2019s recommendation for  prison that no more than four prisoners should be held in cells measuring 18 square metres (including the sanitary annex, see paragraphs 50 and 51 above).",

A ruling of a civil court cannot, however, have any impact on general prison conditions because it cannot address the root cause of the problem. For that reason, the Court would, in addition to the measures aimed at reducing the occupancy level in cells in Ljubljana prison, encourage the State to develop an effective instrument which would provide a speedy reaction to complaints concerning inadequate conditions of detention and ensure that, when necessary, a transfer of a detainee is ordered to Convention compatible conditions (see Orchowski, cited above, \u00a7 154).",
