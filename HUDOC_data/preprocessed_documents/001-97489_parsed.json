It has been the Court's constant approach that an applicant cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the resources afforded by the national law in the defence of his interests (see, mutatis mutandis, Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v. Turkey, 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319A, \u00a7 66). On the other hand, it was not disputed that at least five hearings did not take place because the applicants did not attend them (see paragraphs 8, 23 and 26 above) and five more hearings were adjourned because the applicants and the defendants did not appear (see paragraphs 12, 15 and 26 above). In this respect the Court reiterates that the applicants are required to show diligence in carrying out the procedural steps relating to them in the domestic proceedings, to refrain from using delaying tactics and to avail themselves of the scope afforded by domestic law for shortening the proceedings (see, for instance Uni\u00f3n Alimentaria Sanders S.A. v. Spain, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 157, and Humen v.  [GC], no. 26614/95, \u00a7 66, 15 October 1999).

In any event the fact that the domestic courts heard the case several times did not absolve them from complying with the reasonable time requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Litoselitis v.

The Court observes that on 12 March 1999 the District Court allowed the applicants' objection to Judge K. and reassigned the case to Judge B. The latter contested that decision before the . It was not until November 1999 that the  dismissed his request and referred the case to the District Court for examination on the merits. As a result the proceedings were delayed by seven months. The proceedings were delayed by another four months when on 3 April 2000 they were adjourned until 4 August 2000. According to the Government, it had not been possible to schedule the hearing for an earlier date because the judge was busy in unrelated proceedings. Furthermore, another delay of four months occurred during the transfer of the case from the District Court to the  for examination on appeal in the first round of proceedings. The Court reiterates that it is for Contracting States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can guarantee the right of everyone to obtain a final decision within a reasonable time (see, for instance, L\u00f6ffler v. Austria, no.\u00a030546/96, \u00a7 21, 3 October 2000). The manner in which a State provides for mechanisms to comply with this requirement \u2013 whether by increasing the numbers of judges, or by automatic time-limits and directions, or by some other method \u2013 is for the State to decide. If a State lets proceedings continue beyond the \u201creasonable time\u201d prescribed by Article 6 of the Convention without doing anything to advance them, it will be responsible for the resultant delay (see Price and Lowe v. the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a043185/98 and 43186/98, \u00a7 23, 29 July 2003). The Court finds that in the present case the authorities did not take due measures to speed up the proceedings.
