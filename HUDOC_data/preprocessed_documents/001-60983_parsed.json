The trial court established that the applicant\u2019s surgery in 1988 had been carried out according to medical standards at the material time and dismissed allegations of medical malpractice on the part of the doctor who had performed it. In the court\u2019s opinion the deterioration of the applicant\u2019s health was caused by a rare post-surgery complication aggravated by his illness from which he had been suffering prior to the surgery. Despite finding the defendant not liable, the court established that the applicant sustained damage in connection with the surgery and found it justifiable to award him PLN\u00a050,000 in compensation. The applicant was also awarded a monthly allowance of PLN 100, which in the court\u2019s opinion would compensate his increased needs.",

The proceedings were therefore of considerable importance for the applicant since they were intended not only to result in compensation for his sufferings but also to enable him to receive the best medical treatment. However, he reached the age of majority without any final decision on his claim. Therefore, the Court cannot agree with the Government\u2019s statement that the domestic authorities satisfied the applicant\u2019s claim.",
