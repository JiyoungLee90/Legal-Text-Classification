Further aspects of the applicant\u2019s detention which, taken cumulatively with the problem of overcrowding, the Court considers incompatible with the protection against inhuman and degrading treatment are the lack of in-cell running water supply, the extremely cramped courtyards and the complete absence of any meaningful activities, whether inside or outside the cell (see Dimitrov and Ribov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 34846/08, \u00a7 37, 17 November 2015, and Kim v.

However, the Court has already established that the applicant did not have any effective remedy by which to contest the lawfulness and length of his detention, and the Government have not pointed to any other normative or practical safeguard. It follows that the Russian legal system did not provide for a procedure capable of preventing the risk of arbitrary detention pending expulsion (see Kim, \u00a7 53, and Azimov, \u00a7\u00a7 153-54, both cited above, and Louled Massoud v.
