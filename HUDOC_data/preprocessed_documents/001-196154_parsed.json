It held that the senior prosecutor had correctly decided to reopen the investigation, but the decision to discontinue the investigation in respect of T.D. had been unfounded. The court noted that T.D. had initially given consistent statements about his guilt as regards M.K.\u2019s murder (see paragraphs 16-18 above) but had later withdrawn them, claiming that police officers had pressured him to incriminate himself. However, his allegation of undue police pressure had not been sufficiently investigated, and only one of the two officers who had questioned him had been questioned (see paragraph\u00a028 above). Furthermore, it had not been established whether T.D. had an alibi for the night of the assault. The court therefore held that although there was not enough evidence to draw up an indictment against T.D. and transfer the case to a court for examination, T.D. had to remain a suspect and his role in M.K.\u2019s murder had to be further investigated.",

Furthermore, the prosecutor had not taken sufficient measures to clarify what M.K. had been doing during the last few hours before the assault and under what circumstances he had consumed alcohol; the prosecutor had also failed to determine in good time that T.D. had gone abroad, and had failed to promptly announce the search in respect of him (see paragraph 35 above).

However, due to the fact that no material evidence had been found at the scene of the crime, witness testimonies had been the main source of information for the authorities. In this regard, the Government submitted that M.K., before his death, had refused to cooperate and provide details about the assault (see paragraph 5 above), and that his relatives had failed to provide important information right away. In particular, the applicant\u2019s sister had mentioned M.K.\u2019s conflict with T.D. only in April\u00a02006 (see paragraph 13 above), and only in 2009 had the applicant\u2019s mother revealed the fact that V.S. had come to her house to apologise (see paragraph 29 above).

The authorities questioned him very early in the investigation (see paragraph\u00a09 above) and the Court considers that to be indicative of the fact that they had reasons to believe that V.S. might have been involved in the killing of M.K. Furthermore, in July 2005 several witnesses testified that M.K. had previously been assaulted by V.S. (see paragraph 11 above). The Court points out that at that time the authorities were aware of V.S.\u2019s intention to commit suicide \u2013 V.S. told them about it himself, and a psychiatric hospital informed them about his previous suicide attempt (see paragraphs 9 and 12 about). However, despite having reliable information that V.S. might take his own life, the authorities did not take any prompt action to locate and question him about his previous assault on M.K., or carry out any other measures to examine his possible role in M.K.\u2019s death. The Court agrees with the Government that the death of V.S. made it more difficult to establish the circumstances of the crime against M.K. (see paragraph 75 above). However, the authorities failed to act with the promptness required in the circumstances to secure evidence from V.S. before he committed suicide.",

Although the applicant claimed that T.D. must have been a suspect from the very beginning of the investigation (see paragraph 71 above), the Court does not have any documents supporting that claim. In any event, from the material in the Court\u2019s possession, it appears that there were no attempts to locate T.D. before November 2006, that is to say, not until seven months after the authorities had become aware that there had been a conflict between him and M.K. (see paragraph\u00a015 above). No explanation for this delay has been provided to the Court.",

However, it does not appear that any measures were taken to address this discrepancy. In this connection, the Court further notes that the domestic courts which subsequently examined the charges against T.D. found that his confession had been \u201cunpersuasive and illogical\u201d and had contained multiple contradictions, but that no investigative measures had been carried out to eliminate them (see paragraphs 45, 47 and 54 above).",

The Court notes that in that same statement the applicant claimed that she had already told the authorities about V.S.\u2019s apology, but that this had not been recorded (see paragraph 29 above).

Turkey, no. 62077/08, \u00a7\u00a039, 6\u00a0November 2018). Indeed, the indictment was drawn up essentially on the basis of T.D.\u2019s initial confession, in which he claimed to have killed M.K. alone (see paragraph 43 above). The Court observes that the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court, which acquitted T.D., also criticised the pre-trial investigation for not addressing the hypothesis that there were multiple perpetrators, and that during the proceedings before that court a pre-trial investigation officer testified that there had been suspicions that M.K. had been assaulted by several individuals, but \u201csince T.D. had confessed and no other suspects had been identified, that line of investigation had not been pursued\u201d (see paragraph\u00a046 above).",

It notes, in particular, the conclusions adopted by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office after disciplinary proceedings instituted following the applicant\u2019s complaint. The Prosecutor General found that the prosecutors in charge of the investigation had not taken all available measures to investigate the criminal offence within the shortest possible time; that because of the inappropriate and insufficient investigation during the initial stages, a great deal of important data of potential evidentiary value had been lost; that some of the reports in the case file were \u201cuninformative and formalistic\u201d; and that the length of the pre-trial investigation had been excessive. In the view of the Prosecutor General, all the shortcomings made it doubtful whether an appropriate and objective investigation of M.K.\u2019s murder was possible at all (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above; see also Antonov v. Ukraine, no. 28096/04, \u00a7 50, 3 November 2011). In the light of that conclusion, the Court is unable to give much weight to the Government\u2019s argument that the pre-trial investigation is officially still ongoing (see paragraphs 59 and 60 above; see also Angelova and Iliev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 55523/00, \u00a7 103, 26 July 2007).",
