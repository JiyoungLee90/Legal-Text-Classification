They had not been prevented from expressing their political views in public or sanctioned for having done so. Rather, they had been prosecuted for deliberately disregarding the rules governing the exercise of the freedom of assembly. The restriction imposed on the applicants\u2019 freedom of peaceful assembly had been based on section 6 of the Assembly Act and section 152 of the Act on Administrative Offences. Undisputedly, they had expressed a political opinion on public ground (which fell under the jurisdiction of the Assembly Act) although characterising their action as a form of artistic expression which, as a cultural event, would fall outside the scope of the Assembly Act, but would have been subject to an authorisation from the municipality, never obtained. The fact that the applicants had labelled their action as a \u201cperformance\u201d, a term foreign to the Assembly Act, was irrelevant since in the domestic jurisprudence it was the aim (i.e. the joint expression of a political opinion), the venue (i.e. public ground) and the organised nature of an event which was decisive to qualify it as an \u201corganised event\u201d falling under section 6. Obviously, the different forms which an assembly might take or the labels attached to them by the organisers could not be enumerated with absolute precision in the law but it was not contrary to the requirement of foreseeability to define an assembly by its purpose and to clarify the scope of the law by judicial interpretation.

Furthermore, the police had showed the requisite tolerance towards the demonstration at issue, and the applicants\u2019 expression of political views had been unhindered.

As regards the Government\u2019s suggestion concerning the Guidelines on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly adopted by the Venice Commission, the Court would take the view that the Explanatory Notes to those Guidelines specify the minimum number of participants required for the constitution of an assembly; however, those Guidelines can by no means be interpreted as stipulating that any common expressive action of two individuals necessarily amounts to an assembly, especially in the absence of intentional presence of further participants, as in the present case.",

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a \u201crestriction\u201d is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see, among many other authorities, Perna v.

Although freedom of expression may be subject to exceptions, they must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established (see Observer and Guardian v. the , 26 November 1991, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 216). In particular, there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on questions of public interest (see Feldek v.

This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully or in good faith; the Court looks at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the statement held against the applicant and its context (see News Verlags GmbH & CoKG v.

However, it would point out that the mere fact that an expression occurs in the public space does not necessarily turn such an event into an assembly. The Court notes at this juncture that various definitions of assembly may exist in the national legal systems. It reiterates that its role is to supervise that the application of the domestic law be in conformity with the Convention, and would take the view that the term \u201cassembly\u201d possesses \u2013 just like the term \u201cassociation\u201d (see Chassagnou and Others v.

Such an autonomous meaning serves the interests of the protection of the right against improper classifications in national law. The Court considers that, in qualifying a gathering of several people as an assembly, regard must be had to the fact that an assembly constitutes a specific form of communication of ideas, where the gathering of an indeterminate number of persons with the identifiable intention of being part of the communicative process can be in itself an intensive expression of an idea. The support for the idea in question is being expressed through the very presence of a group of people, particularly \u2013 as in the present case \u2013 at a place accessible to the general public. Furthermore, an assembly may serve the exchange of ideas between the speakers and the participants, intentionally present, even if they disagree with the speakers.",

In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the \u201cpolitical performance\u201d in question was intended to send a message through the media rather than the direct gathering of people \u2013 the latter in any case being virtually unachievable in thirteen minutes which was the duration of the performance. The Court recalls in this connection that a press communiqu\u00e9 made in public, even where there was a gathering of twenty-five people, was examined under Article 10, rather than Article 11, of the Convention (see Karademirci and Others v. , nos. 37096/97 and 37101/97, \u00a7 26, ECHR 2005I).",

The Court acknowledges that such a notification might be justified in certain cases, since it enables the authorities effectively to coordinate and facilitate the assembly. However, in the Court\u2019s view, there was no need for such coordination in the present circumstances (cf. Bal\u00e7\u0131k and Others v. , no. 25/02, \u00a7 49, 29\u00a0November 2007), since nothing indicates that either the public order or the rights of others were affected. The national authorities\u2019 approach to the concept of assembly does not correspond to the rationale of the notification rule. Indeed, the application of that rule to expressions \u2013 rather than only to assemblies \u2013 would create a prior restraint which is incompatible with the free communication of ideas and might undermine freedom of expression.",
