The FAC noted that the applicants had failed to submit a certificate of marriage and that in any event their alleged religious marriage could not be validly recognised in Switzerland, pursuant to Article 45 of the Federal Act on Civil International Law, because it was illegal under the relevant provision of the Afghan Civil Code, which contained an absolute prohibition on marriage for women under 15 years of age, while the first applicant was 14 years old. In any case, independently of the applicable Afghan law, the applicant\u2019s marriage was manifestly incompatible with Swiss ordre public, since having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 16 was a crime under Article 187-1 of the Swiss Criminal Code. The first applicant could therefore not be qualified as a member of the second applicant\u2019s family under the Dublin Regulation and the applicants could not claim any right to family life under Article 8 of the Convention.",

A subsequent withdrawal of that right, for instance because the person concerned has been convicted of a criminal offence, will constitute an interference with his or her right to respect for private and/or family life within the meaning of Article 8. In such cases, the Court will examine whether the interference is justified under the second paragraph of Article 8. In this connection, it will have regard to the various criteria which it has identified in its case-law in order to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the grounds underlying the authorities\u2019 decision to withdraw the right of residence and the Article 8 rights of the individual concerned (ibid., \u00a7 45).",

Rather, the question to be examined in the present case is whether, having regard to the circumstances as a whole, the Swiss authorities were under a duty pursuant to Article 8 to grant the second applicant a residence permit in Switzerland, whether or not as an asylum seeker, thus enabling him to exercise any family life he might have established on Swiss territory with the first applicant, whom they had decided not to remove to Italy (see, mutatis mutandis, A.S. v. Switzerland, cited above, \u00a7 46). The instant case thus concerns not only family life but also immigration lato sensu.

B. 1, on more extreme facts as to age, the Court of Appeal took a broader, more tolerant view. But concepts which determine public policy may legitimately differ from State to State. What is important here is that the non-recognition of the purported marriage could not exhaust the question of whether the applicants did or did not have a family life together. It is quite obvious that the authorities approached the sexual aspect as determinative. To them, the fact that the first applicant, who was underage, was in a sexual relationship with the second applicant meant that that relationship was utterly incompatible with the existence of family life between them. My colleagues in the present case have taken that view on board. I cannot do the same. I would add that, to my mind, it is not irrelevant that the couple had been provided by the relevant authorities with joint accommodation consisting of just one room with only one bed in it, for that shows how their relationship was objectively and genuinely perceived. I would also add that it is not without significance that no charges were ever brought against the second applicant for unlawful sexual intercourse with the first applicant. In circumstances such as the these, where the man was under 20 years old, a prosecution could be avoided by virtue of Article\u00a01873 of the Swiss Penal Code, according to which",

On either view, the applicants have not shown that they had any right to remain in Switzerland. A joint removal would have posed no issue under Article 8. It was only because the applicants were separated by removing one of them, in the circumstances related above, that a question arose regarding the matter. That is actually their complaint. However, bearing in mind the very brief period of separation, seen in the light of what had preceded and what followed it, and taking into account that the applicants were quite free to move elsewhere together, it would be unrealistic, in my opinion, to say that there was a violation of Article 8. I am, in this regard, essentially in agreement with what is stated in paragraph 45 of the judgment.",
