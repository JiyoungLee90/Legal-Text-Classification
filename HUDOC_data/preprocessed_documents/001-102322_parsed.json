The allegedly insulting statements (\u201clittle bastards\u201d, \u201cyoung rascals\u201d and the like) were not actionable because they constituted value judgments not amenable to verification. The alleged breach of the duties of a journalist arising out of the Media Act, namely, disclosure of confidential or private information, was not actionable in civil proceedings because the Media Act provided for criminal or disciplinary, rather than civil, sanctions for such breaches. On the other hand, relying on Article 152 of the Civil Code, the court granted the claimants' request for a retraction of the allegation that they \u201chad attempted to interfere with the investigation\u201d because the journalists had not produced any proof of such interference. It ordered that the newspaper and the applicant publish a retraction containing an apology to Mr and Mrs B.

Further, as regards criticism directed against judges, the Court has found that the work of the courts, which are the guarantors of justice and which have a fundamental role in a State governed by the rule of law, needs to enjoy public confidence. It should therefore be protected against unfounded attacks. The courts are however not immune from criticism and scrutiny. It is important that a clear distinction is made between criticism and insult. If the sole intent of any form of expression is to insult a court, or members of that court, an appropriate punishment would not, in principle, constitute a violation of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Ska\u0142ka v.\u00a0Poland, no. 43425/98, \u00a7 34, 27 May 2003).",

The Court has accepted that that interpretation of the relevant legislation by the Russian courts was not such as to render the impugned interference unlawful in Convention terms (see Kazakov v.

In assessing whether such a \u201cneed\u201d exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation.

The Court's task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among many others, Krasulya v.

It was only in his second publication of 17 September 2002 that the applicant mentioned the names of the juvenile offenders, including the name of Mr V.'s stepgrandson, and the official positions of their relatives. However, before that date that information had already been disclosed by another newspaper and the incident in all its details had been widely discussed in the press and on the Internet (see paragraph 11 above). It has not been submitted in the domestic proceeding or before the Court that the applicant's publications introduced any new personal details previously unknown to the public. It follows that by the time of the second publication the offenders' personal information had ceased to be confidential and was already in the public domain. Thus, the interest in protecting the identity of the juvenile offenders and their relatives had been substantially diminished, so that the preservation of confidentiality in this matter could no longer constitute an overriding requirement (see Editions Plon v.

The Court reiterates in this connection that in cases of publications relating the details of an individual's private life with the sole purpose of satisfying the curiosity of a particular readership, the individual's right to the effective protection of his or her private life prevails over the journalist's freedom of expression (see Von Hannover v. , no. 59320/00, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2004VI; Campmany y Diez de Revenga and L\u00f3pez Galiacho Perona v.\u00a0Spain (dec.), no. 54224/00, ECHR 2000-XII; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Prisma Presse v.\u00a0France (dec.), nos. 66910/01 and 71612/01, 1 July 2003; and Bou Gibert and El Hogar y La Moda J.A. v.

The public did not have a legitimate interest in knowing about Mr V.'s family affairs, which were not in any way related to his official functions. The Court reiterates that it is unacceptable that an official should be exposed to opprobrium because of matters concerning a member of his family (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24 February 1997, \u00a7 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I). It is also of significance that Mr V.'s stepgrandson was a minor, and for that reason his deeds were not prosecutable under Russian law. He was never charged with a criminal offence and no criminal proceedings were opened against him. The instant case is therefore distinguishable from those cases in which journalists have reported on ongoing criminal proceedings, thereby exercising their right and duty to impart information on a matter of public concern (see, for example, News Verlags GmbH & Co.KG v. , no. 31457/96, \u00a7\u00a7 55 and 56, ECHR 2000I). In the Court's view, in cases such as the present one where an offence has been committed by a minor who has not reached the statutory age of criminal responsibility and who is not considered responsible for his actions, a journalist's right to impart information on a serious criminal offence must yield to the minor's right to the effective protection of his private life. There can be little doubt that his repeated naming in the press in connection with the reprehensible summer camp incident was particularly harmful to Mr V.'s stepgrandson's moral and psychological development and to his private life.",

The Court notes that that wording was not actually contained in the articles authored by the applicant. The article of 17\u00a0September 2002, however, mentioned that \u201cattempts are being made to exert pressure on the course of the resumed investigation\u201d. It is true that that statement is impersonal and the individuals who allegedly exercised such pressure are not referred to by name. However, when read in context, in particular in conjunction with such statements as \u201chigh-ranking parents of minor rapists seek to hush up the scandal\u201d, that statement might convey to an ordinary reader the impression that it had been the claimants, Mr and Mrs B and Mr V., who had made the attempts to influence the investigation referred to in the article.

The Court agrees that the applicant published a serious factual allegation against the claimants and that that allegation was susceptible of proof. The applicant, however, never endeavoured to prove that allegation or establish a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis for it. It follows that the applicant disseminated a defamatory accusation against the judges Mr and Mrs B. and the traffic police officer Mr V., which was likely to lower them in public esteem and was put forward without any supporting evidence (see Barfod v. , 22 February 1989, \u00a7 35, Series A no.\u00a0149).",

Secondly, the judicial order to extend an apology had no clear legal basis in domestic law: at the material time (2003-2004) the domestic courts interpreted the notion of retraction as possibly including an apology. And only Resolution no. 3 of 24 February 2005 of the Plenary Supreme Court of the  prohibited the courts from ordering defendants to extend an apology to a claimant, because that form of redress had no basis under Russian law, including Article 152 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 32 of the judgment).",
