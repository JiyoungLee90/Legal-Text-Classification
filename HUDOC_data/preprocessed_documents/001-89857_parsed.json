Thereafter, the prosecutors and the courts did not advance any grounds whatsoever for maintaining the applicants\u2019 detention, simply stating that the previously chosen preventive measure was correct. However, Article 5 \u00a7 3 requires that after a certain lapse of time the persistence of a reasonable suspicion does not in itself justify deprivation of liberty and the judicial authorities should give other grounds for continued detention (see Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v. Poland, no.\u00a033492/96, \u00a7 80, 21 December 2000, and I.A. v. , no. 28213/95, \u00a7\u00a0102, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII). Those grounds, moreover, should be expressly mentioned by the domestic courts (see I\u0142owiecki v. Poland, no. 27504/95, \u00a7 61, 4\u00a0October 2001). No such reasons were given by the courts in the present case. Furthermore, at no stage did the domestic courts consider any alternative preventive measures instead of detention on remand, and by relying essentially on the gravity of the charges, the authorities prolonged the applicants\u2019 detention on grounds which cannot be regarded as \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d.",
