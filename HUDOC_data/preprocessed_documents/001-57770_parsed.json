Unlike in the United Kingdom, whether she could change her forename did not depend on her wishes only; Article 57 of the Civil Code made this subject to judicial permission and the demonstration of a \"legitimate interest\" capable of justifying it (see paragraph 22 above). Miss B. knew of no decision which had regarded transsexualism as giving rise to such an interest. In any event, the Libourne tribunal de grande instance and the Bordeaux Court of Appeal had refused to allow her the forenames Lyne Antoinette (see paragraphs 13-15 above).

In my opinion, what Miss B. requested from the French courts was a \"correction\" of the alleged error as to sex and consequently the rectification of the civil status register and the replacement of her male forename by a female forename, following a priordeclaration by the court that she was of female sex. Miss B., intending to marry a man, did not ask the Court to hold that there was a case of transsexualism, but that there had been a mistake in registering her sex, since, although a woman, she had been registered as a man. She did not submit any requests relating to possible rectification of the indication of her sex in her official identity documents consequent on rectification granted in accordance with the relevant legislation (see paragraph 22 of the judgment).",

In these systems civil status is a concept of public order and documents relating to such status are presumed to be correct. It follows that a change to a birth certificate can take place only in cases and according to procedures defined by law.

What the applicant was arguing was not that the State should abstain from acting but rather that it should take steps to modify its existing system, and the question whether an effective respect for the transsexual\u2019s private life imposed a positive obligation on the State in this regard was to be answered by considering the \"fair balance that has to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interests of the individual\".
