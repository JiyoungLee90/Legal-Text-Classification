The courts held that in the case at issue there were no factual or legal differences justifying deviating from the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice. In so far that the doctor in the present case was slightly more well-known than the doctor in the original case, the Court of Appeal held that this was of minor relevance. The fact that Dr St. had appeared as an expert before the German Parliament many years previously did not have any substantial effects on Dr St\u2019s public profile at that time. Moreover, the involvement of Dr St. in different legal disputes was irrelevant, as trying to enforce his rights in the appropriate legal procedure could not redound to Dr\u00a0St.\u2019s disadvantage. In sum, the applicant had vilified the noncriminal professional activities of Dr St. by implying that he committed criminal acts and interfered with the relationship of trust between doctor and patient, which deserved special protection against the interventions of others. The applicant had therefore severely interfered with Dr St.\u2019s personality rights. This interference was not justified by the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression in view of the massive \u201cpillory effect\u201d the applicant had created by singling out the plaintiff and criticising him in a harsh way in the immediate vicinity of his practice.",

It pointed out that the doctor\u2019s activities were legal and enjoyed protection under his constitutional right to freedom to exercise his profession. The court emphasised the important role which the legislature had attributed to gynaecologists both in the protection of unborn life and in the protection of the health of the women concerned. It was essential that the relationship of trust between the doctor and his patients was not disturbed by the intrusion of external parties. The applicant\u2019s actions had adversely affected the plaintiff\u2019s activities in an unacceptable way and had singled him out without any reason. Therefore, the court concluded that, under the circumstances of this particular case, the physician\u2019s personality rights prevailed over the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression.

His actions had not personally attacked Dr\u00a0St., but had criticised the legal situation in Germany concerning abortions, which had been performed by a doctor within twelve weeks of conception and following obligatory counseling. Those abortions had been considered to be unlawful, but had been exempt from criminal liability. Moreover, it had been consistent with the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court to call abortions, as performed by Dr St., unlawful. The applicant further submitted that the domestic courts had not sufficiently taken into account that Dr St. had not been unknown to the public \u2013 as the doctor had been in the earlier case decided by the Federal Court of Justice \u2013 but had appeared as an expert before the German Parliament and had been involved in several legal disputes in the context of the debate about abortion.",

By calling abortions unlawful the applicant had created the false impression that Dr St. had been operating outside of the legal framework in performing such procedures. Unlike the leaflet in the case of Annen (cited above) the leaflets in the present case did not point out that abortions are permitted in Germany under the terms of Article 218a of the Criminal Code and therefore not subject to criminal liability. Moreover, given the applicant\u2019s goal of forced \u201cpavement counselling\u201d, the applicant had severely disturbed the relationship of trust between doctor and patient. The Court had already rejected an earlier application by the same applicant against a desist order against similar conduct (see Annen v. Germany (dec.), nos.\u00a02373/07 2396/07, 30 March 2010). In the present case, the domestic courts had relied on the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice, which had been the subject matter of the earlier inadmissibility decision of the Court, and concluded that the circumstances had been comparable and had not warranted deviating from the existing case-law. When coming to that conclusion the domestic courts had paid attention to the fact that Dr St. had taken a public position in the abortion debate.",

However, the Court also takes note of the fact that the domestic courts considered these points and concluded that they were only of minor relevance. The appearance before the German Parliament had been many years previous to that time and therefore did not have any substantial effects on Dr St.\u2019s public profile.

The Court observes that such \u201cpavement counselling\u201d by the applicant, which the Regional Court described as \u201crunning the gauntlet\u201d, did not only interfere with the Dr St.\u2019s legal professional activities but also rendered it more difficult for patients to seek medical assistance.

Consequently, the injunction was limited geographically and in scope.
