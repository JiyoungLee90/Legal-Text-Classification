The case originated in an application (no. 40663/98) against the  lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by the Moldovan incorporated insurance company Asito (“the applicant”), on 5 February 1998.
The applicant was represented by Mr Eugen Şlopac, the company’s executive director. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Vitalie Pârlog.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the Prosecutor General intervened in a dispute between two private parties and that two final judgments favourable to it were quashed following the Prosecutor General’s request for annulment.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
By a decision of 10 July 2001, the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other’s observations.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The applicant is a Moldovan incorporated insurance company, with its seat in Chişinău.
On 12 June 1991, a governmental order allowed the applicant company to enter “banking and investments operations”, apart from its main insurance activity.
On 28 November 1991, the applicant company obtained from the National Bank of  a licence to engage in banking operations. During a routine audit procedure, the company refused to disclose its books, claiming it did not perform any banking activities. On 13 October 1992, the applicant company’s licence was withdrawn. The applicant company did not challenge this decision.
On 25 November 1994, the applicant company concluded a one-year contract (“the contract”), with company F., entitled “Joint Commercial Transaction”. The applicant company made a capital contribution of 330,000 Moldovan lei (MDL) to company F., and in exchange it was to receive the sum of MDL 269,500, payable in monthly instalments. Company F. was also to reimburse the capital contribution in a lump sum by 25 November 1995. Non compliance with the terms of the contract gave rise to a penalty of 0,50% of the unpaid sum for each overdue day. By a collateral contract, company F. mortgaged its plant and equipment, as security.
By 23 April 1996, company F. had paid the applicant company MDL 420,750. Due to a slowdown in the national economy, company F. was, as of that date, unable to pay the balance in full and had no reasonable prospect of complying with the terms of the contract.
On 24 May 1996 the applicant company filed an application with the Arbitration Court of the Republic of Moldova for breach of contract and requested that company F. be ordered to pay MDL 468,472, constituting the capital contribution and contractual penalties.
Company F. argued that the contract contained an implied obligation, arising from the nature and purpose of the contract, that the applicant company was to contribute to the expenses and losses of the joint venture. As the company had experienced losses, in spite of its good faith in performance, it asked for an adjustment or cancellation of the MDL 468,472 debt, invoking the Civil Code provisions on risk-sharing in joint ventures. As a subsidiary argument, it submitted that, in the absence of this implied obligation, the contract became a regular loan, for which the applicant company did not possess a licence.
On 1 August 1996 the Arbitration Court partially allowed the applicant company’s application, but it reduced the contractual penalties by 50%, considering the claim to be disproportionate in relation to the actual damage experienced by the applicant company, and issued an order of payment for an amount of MDL 327,474.75 (the equivalent of 62,780.00 euros (EUR) at the time)).
On 20 August 1996, the Prosecutor General, who was not a party to the proceedings, lodged an ordinary appeal against the judgment of 1 August 1996.
On 28 November 1996 the “Law on Economic Courts” entered into force. It provided for the re-organisation of the part of the judiciary system dealing with economic disputes. The re-organisation process resulted in a suspension of the hearings for several months.

On 16 June 1997 the Prosecutor General lodged a request for annulment (recurs în anulare) under Article 38 § 3 of the Law on Economic Courts against the judgment of 1 August 1996, asking that the contract be declared null and void for non-compliance with the Law on Banks and Banking Activities.
On 23 September 1997 the Appeal on Points of Law Chamber of the  allowed the Prosecutor’s request, quashed the judgment of 1 August 1996, and dismissed the applicant company’s action.
On 24 December 1997, the Supreme Court of Justice rejected the applicant company’s appeal against the above judgment. It found that the contract was a disguised credit operation and since the applicant company no longer possessed a banking licence, such a contract was illegal.
On 21 January 1998 the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the applicant’s extraordinary appeal (contestaţie în anulare) on the ground that the conditions for the re-opening of the case had not been fulfilled.
On 17 July 1996, pursuant to Article 5 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Prosecutor General filed an application with the Arbitration Court of Moldova, seeking the annulment of the contract concluded between the applicant company and company F. on 25 November 1994. According to the Prosecutor General, the contract was a disguised credit operation subject to a very high interest rate and the applicant company was not entitled to perform credit operations without a licence.
On 26 July 1996 the  dismissed the Prosecutor General’s application. The court found, inter alia, that according to the Law on Insurance, insurance companies were allowed to provide commercial and financial services and that the provision of credit was also permitted under the Civil Code. The  did not examine the question of the need for a licence. Since no party appealed, the judgment became final.
On 16 June 1997 the Prosecutor General lodged under Article 38 § 3 of the Law on Economic Courts a request for annulment (recurs în anulare) of the judgment of 26 July 1996.
On 23 September 1997 the Appeal on Points of Law Chamber of the Economic Court of Moldova dismissed the request.
On 17 November 1997 the Prosecutor General lodged under Article 278/60 of the Code of Civil Procedure an appeal on points of law (recurs) against this decision.
On 24 December 1997, the Supreme Court of Justice quashed the judgments of 26 July 1996 and of 23 September 1997.

The amount represented the profit obtained by ASITO as a result of the contract with company F., which had been declared null and void by the Supreme Court’s judgment of 24 December 1997. In his application, the Prosecutor General referred, inter alia, to the judgment of 23 September 1997 of the Appeal on Points of Law Chamber of the  and to the judgment of 24 December 1997 of the Supreme Court of Justice.
On 20 May 1998 the Prosecutor General requested that the amount to be confiscated be reduced. In this respect, the Prosecutor General pointed out that, according to the Law on Enterprises and Business Professions, an enterprise having exercised an illegal activity was accountable for the profit obtained and for a penalty equal to the profit. Since ASITO’s profit amounted to MDL 90,750, the Prosecutor General requested that MDL 181,500 be confiscated.
On 2 February 1999, the Economic Court of the  found in favour of the Prosecutor General and the Ministry of Finance and ordered ASITO to pay the State MDL 186,945.00 (the equivalent of EUR 18,765.00 at the time).

Law No. 970 of 24 July 1996 on Economic Courts, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:
Article 38 § 3
“The Prosecutor General and his deputies may lodge, within one year, with the Appeal on Points of Law Chamber of the Economic Court of the Republic of Moldova, a request for annulment (recurs în anulare) of any final decision of the Arbitration Court ... on the ground that the substantive or procedural law was violated ... They may also request a stay of execution of the decision of the .”
The relevant provision of Law No. 1550 of 25 February 1998 reads as follows:
Article III
“In Article 38 § 3 of the Law No. 970 of 24 July 1996 on Economic Courts the words ‘within one year’ shall be deleted.”
The relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure in force until 12 June 2003, state:
Article 5 (2) e) and f)
“Courts may commence to examine a civil action ... at the prosecutor’s request, in cases relating to ... the State’s and the society’s interest regarding ...
...
e) ... the nullity of contracts infringing the State’s interest ...;
f) ... and for the annulment of acts and activities of corruption and protectionism.”
Article 278/60
“The parties, ... [and] the Prosecutor General ... may, either on their own motion or on an application by one of the parties, lodge with the Supreme Court an extraordinary appeal (recurs) against any final judicial decision of the Economic Court of the Republic, on the following grounds:
(1) where the judgment has no legal basis or is contrary to the law or the law was wrongly applied ...”.
Between 1989 and 1999, the Prosecutor General made little use of Article 5(2), and the courts interpreted it in a restrictive manner. An application for termination of a contract was rejected, as relating neither to the categories of persons protected under the provision, nor to the State’s interest (Court of Appeal of , judgment Nr. 2r-523 of 15 January 1998). In a demand for the annulment of an apartment sale for non-compliance with the residence permit, the Supreme Court acknowledged the State’s interest, but rejected the case on the merits (The Supreme Court of Justice, plenary judgment Nr. 4r/a-17/99 of 8 November 1999).
