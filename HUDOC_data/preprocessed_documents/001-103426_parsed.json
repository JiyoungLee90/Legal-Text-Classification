The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, requiring in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 40, Reports 1996III). The Court accepts that a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a serious offence may initially warrant his detention. Also, the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, in particular the process of obtaining evidence from witnesses, constitutes a valid ground for such initial detention (see, for example, Jamro\u017cy v. , no. 6093/04, \u00a7 37, 15 September 2009).",

Furthermore, the Court notes that before ordering the applicant's detention on 25 May 2004 the Kyivskyy Court examined the major argument of the investigator in that regard, namely the changes in the victims' statements coinciding with the applicant's being at liberty, at a hearing with participation of the applicant, the victims' representative and the investigator (see paragraph 9 above). The Court sees no reason to consider that its decision about replacing the applicant's undertaking not to abscond with pre-trial detention was arbitrary.",

Germany, 27 June 1968, \u00a7\u00a012, Series A no. 7, and Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v. Turkey, 8 June 1995, \u00a7 52, Series A no. 319A). It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to ensure that in a given case the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable length of time. To this end, they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the matters included by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7 152, ECHR 2000IV).",

It is true that serious charges were raised against the applicant and the case was of a certain complexity, which influenced the length of the proceedings (see paragraph 52 below). However, during the impugned period of the applicant's detention the court dealing with his case rejected his requests for release five times in similarly worded rulings (see paragraph 11 above). Its line of reasoning remained unchanged and was twofold: firstly, the court referred, without any factual references or comments, to the seriousness of the charges against the applicant as an indication of the risk he would abscond and, secondly, it repeated on all five occasions \u2013 also without explanation \u2013 that it was premature, before the verdict, to change the preventive measure.",
