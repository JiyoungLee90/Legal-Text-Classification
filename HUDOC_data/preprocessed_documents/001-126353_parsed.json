The Court must also be satisfied that any detention during the period under consideration was compatible with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which is to prevent people from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary fashion (see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, \u00a7\u00a0154, ECHR 2002-IV; Fedotov v. Russia, no. 5140/02, \u00a7 74, 25\u00a0October 2005; and Levin\u0163a v.  (no. 2), no. 50717/09, \u00a7 29, 17 January 2012).",

From that moment the applicant was no longer subject to \u201clawful detention after conviction by a competent court\u201d (Article 5 \u00a7 1\u00a0(a) of the Convention), given that her initial conviction did not call for a sentence of detention. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty after 12 March 2009 had to be based on other grounds for detention provided for in Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention than those under Article 5 \u00a7 1(a), so as to observe the principle that no one should be arbitrarily deprived of their liberty (see Levin\u0163a (no.2), cited above, \u00a7 31).",

It observes that in the decision of 12\u00a0March 2009 the Court of Appeal did not devote any effort to analysing the legal grounds and the justification for the applicant\u2019s detention (see, by contrast, Mooren v.  [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08289, 9 July 2009). In fact, the extension of the applicant\u2019s detention was mentioned only in the operative part of the judgment, without any reasons given.
