He stressed that the forensic evidence confirmed the presence of injuries qualified by the domestic criminal legislation as \u201cserious bodily harm\u201d. This treatment had been unprovoked by the applicant and constituted a deliberate attempt to cause him very serious and cruel suffering, to arouse in him feelings of fear and humiliation, break his physical and moral resistance, and debase him and drive him into submission (the applicant referred to the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 167 Series A no. 25; Dedovskiy and Others v.

As to the State\u2019s positive obligation to prevent ill-treatment, the applicant was of the opinion that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to him from the criminal acts of third parties and that they had failed to take reasonable and effective measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (he referred to the judgments of Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 116, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII; Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2001V; Mubilanzila Mayeka and Kaniki Mitunga v.

State owed a duty to take adequate measures to provide care and protection as part of its positive obligations\u201d (see Mubilanzila Mayeka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055). The applicant cited several witness statements from the criminal investigation file which indicated that the information about the forthcoming \u201csettling of scores\u201d on 18 May 2002 between Mr\u00a0A.I. and the local Chechen community had been known to the authorities in advance, and that the police, in particular, had failed to take the necessary steps to protect that community.",

Russia (dec.), no. 49790/99, 14\u00a0October 2003). The applicant did not argue that he had not had an effective remedy at his disposal in this regard (compare Vanfuli v.
