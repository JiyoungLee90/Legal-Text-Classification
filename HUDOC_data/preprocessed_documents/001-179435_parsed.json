Given the Government\u2019s acknowledgment of the poor material conditions in which the applicant had been detained (see paragraph 7 above), the present complaint is thus \u201carguable\u201d and not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(a) of the Convention. It is also not inadmissible on any other ground. Accordingly, it must be declared admissible. Having examined all the material before it, the Court concludes that it discloses a violation of Article 13 of the Convention in the light of findings in Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, 10\u00a0January 2012.",
