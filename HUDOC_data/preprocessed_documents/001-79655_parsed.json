It has not been claimed that the courts acted outside their competences or that there was a fundamental defect in the proceedings before them. The fact that the Presidium disagreed with the assessment made by the first-instance and appeal courts was not, in itself, an exceptional circumstance warranting the amendment of a binding and enforceable judgment and re-opening of the proceedings on the applicant's claim. Moreover, it appears that by amending the judgment of 19 December 2004, the Presidium took into consideration the respondent's argument concerning the impossibility to enforce it rather than its arguments on the points of facts and law.",

Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court finds that by failing to comply with the enforceable judgment in the applicant's favour the domestic authorities violated his right to a court and prevented him from receiving the flat of a size and standard which the applicant was entitled to receive (see Teteriny v. Russia, no.\u00a011931/03, 30 June 2005). Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of non-enforcement of the judgment of 19 December 2004, as upheld on 9\u00a0February 2005.",

The applicant was thereby prevented from receiving the flat he had legitimately expected to receive. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicant is still entitled to receive a flat of a size and standard provided by the judgment of 19 November 2004, as upheld on appeal on 9 February 2005. The Court recalls that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no.\u00a053431/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23\u00a0October 2003). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violation found. It therefore considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the judgment of 19 November 2004, as upheld on appeal on 9 February 2005.",
