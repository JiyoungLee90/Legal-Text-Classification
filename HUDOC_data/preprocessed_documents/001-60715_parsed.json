The Commission could not be blamed for having originally suspended the proceedings, as long as the plans concerning the noise protection zones had not entered into legal force. When the Commission eventually resumed the proceedings, the applicant, surprisingly, contested the decision before the Federal Court. In respect of the proceedings before that court, the Government considered that the applicant, upon filing his administrative law appeal, contributed to their length by immediately challenging all the Federal Court judges. Furthermore, he did not react when, on 19 August 1993, he was informed that the Federal Court would group similar cases concerning another airport. The Government submitted that, in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law (see the S\u00fcssmann v.

On the other hand, the applicant contributed to some extent himself to the length of the proceedings. For instance, when new noise protection zones were introduced and the Federal Assessment Commission resumed proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case in 1988, he unsuccessfully filed administrative law appeals with the Federal Court (see above, paragraph 14). When the applicant filed a further administrative appeal with the Federal Court, he immediately challenged all Federal Court judges (paragraph\u00a017). As a result of the applicant\u2019s bankruptcy, declared on 14 March 1995, the Federal Court suspended the proceedings for approximately two years (paragraph 21). ",
