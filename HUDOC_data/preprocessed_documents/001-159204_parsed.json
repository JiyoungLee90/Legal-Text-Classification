Accordingly, taking into account the numbers provided by the Government, on 30\u00a0May 2010, when the male detainee population was at its lowest (a total of 149), the personal space per male detainee was approximately 4.5 sq. m, which is marginally higher than the recommended minimum area of 4 sq. m. The Court notes that the floor area per detainee dropped to 4.21 sq. m on 29\u00a0July 2010 and 12 August 2010, when the total number of male detainees recorded by the Government increased to 160. In the light of those figures, which in reality should be significantly lower in view of the fixtures in the rooms, it is reasonable to consider that the applicant did not have sufficient personal space in his dormitory, even on the basis of the more favourable data provided by the Government.",
