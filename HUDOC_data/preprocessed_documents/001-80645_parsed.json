It reiterates that on that date the Supreme Court upheld the order of 23 November 2000 extending the applicant's detention until 24 May 2001. The applicant did not challenge any of the orders extending his detention after 24 May 2001. The Government argued that by failing to file appeals, the applicant had denied the domestic authorities an opportunity to consider whether these further extensions were compatible with his Convention right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial. They insisted that the Court should reject the applicant's complaints in respect of that period of his pre-trial detention for the failure to exhaust available domestic remedies.",

Indeed, the Court has already held that when detention on remand is found to have exceeded a reasonable time on the most recent date when an appeal court examined the detention matter, the detention after that date will also be found, except in extraordinary circumstances, to have necessarily kept such character throughout the time for which it was continued (see St\u00f6gm\u00fcller v.
