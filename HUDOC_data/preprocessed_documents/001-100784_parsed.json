Under that provision, police officers could legitimately fire upon any person who did not stop after being warned and a simple warning was apparently sufficient for the prosecuting authorities and the courts to find that the use of firearms had been \u201ca means of last resort\u201d within the provision's meaning. The Court further noted that until 2003 the wording of section 80(1)(4) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act had remained identical (see Tzekov v.

Much like section 42(1)(4), it treated as completely irrelevant the seriousness of the offence in respect of which the detainee was being kept in custody or the danger which he or she represented. Moreover, a reading of the decisions of the military investigating and prosecuting authorities and the military court shows that they apparently considered that a verbal warning and the firing of warning shots were sufficient to find that the use of firearms was \u201ca means of last resort\u201d within the provision's meaning (see paragraphs 25, 27, 33, 36, 40, 41, 42 and 43 above).

However, without explaining why and in apparent contradiction with the provision's plain textual meaning, they construed it as allowing the police to use firearms to arrest an escaping detainee. It is not the Court's role to question the correctness of that interpretation; it must base its examination on the provisions of the domestic law as they were applied by the national authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Minelli v.

As the Court explained in Nachova and Others, the legitimate aim of effecting a lawful arrest can only justify putting human life at risk in circumstances of absolute necessity; there is no such necessity where it is known that the person to be arrested poses no threat to life or limb and is not suspected of having committed a violent offence, even if a failure to use lethal force may result in the opportunity to arrest the fugitive being lost. The principle of strict proportionality inherent in Article 2 requires the national legal framework regulating arrest operations to make recourse to firearms dependent on a careful assessment of the surrounding circumstances, and, in particular, on an evaluation of the nature of the offence committed by the fugitive and of the threat he or she posed. Furthermore, the national law regulating policing operations must secure a system of adequate and effective safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse of force and even against avoidable accident. In particular, law enforcement agents must be trained to assess whether or not there is an absolute necessity to use firearms, not only on the basis of the letter of the relevant regulations, but also with due regard to the preeminence of respect for human life as a fundamental value (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 9497, with further references).",

The Court does not overlook the fact that Mr Karandja was killed during an unplanned operation that gave rise to developments to which the police had to react fast and without prior preparation, and understands that the authorities' obligations under Article 2 must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible burden on them (see Tzekov, cited above \u00a7\u00a061, with further references). Nevertheless, it cannot accept that in the circumstances of the present case the police could reasonably have believed that Mr Karandja \u2013 who had been detained in connection with two nonviolent offences, the first of which he committed while he was still a minor (see paragraph 6 above) \u2013 was dangerous and that they needed to use firearms to immobilise him. The Court considers that in those circumstances any resort to potentially deadly force was prohibited by Article 2, regardless of the risk that Mr Karandja might escape. Recourse to such force cannot be considered as \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d where it is known that the person to be prevented from escaping poses no threat to life or limb and is not suspected of having committed a violent offence (see Nachova and Others, \u00a7 107, and Tzekov, \u00a7\u00a7 63 and 64, both cited above).",

By basing themselves on the strict letter of that provision and on their interpretation of Article 12a of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 41, 42, 43 and 46 above), the military investigating and prosecuting authorities and the military court disregarded highly material circumstances, such as the facts that the Sergeant had no reason to believe that Mr Karandja represented a danger to anyone, that other ways of preventing Mr Karandja from fleeing might have existed, and that it was questionable whether the Sergeant was at all entitled to use a firearm to prevent him from escaping. That approach fell short of the requirements of Article 2 (see Nachova and Others, \u00a7 114, and Tzekov, \u00a7 71, both cited above, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Ivan Vasilev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, \u00a7\u00a7 7779, 12 April 2007).",

It does not seem that any serious effort was made to identify civilian eyewitnesses and take statements from them, or to find the spent cartridges from all the shots fired by Chief Sergeant G.P. Without the information that such steps could have yielded, it was not possible to check the Sergeant's account of the events, which was all the more important in view of the discrepancy between, on the one hand, his assertion that he had fired several shots, confirmed by the testing of his handgun, and, on the other hand, the fact that the gunshot residue test had turned out negative (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above). Nor did the authorities try to identify \u2013 through a ballistics test or other means \u2013 the Sergeant's and Mr Karandja's exact positions at the time of the shooting. This made it impossible to determine why, if the Sergeant had been aiming for Mr Karandja's knees (see paragraphs 17 in fine and 22 above), he ended up shooting him in the back of the head. That important question was only addressed, very briefly, in the military court's decision (see paragraph 43 above). Lastly, it does not seem that any measures were taken to prevent the opportunities for collusion between the officers involved (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a052391/99, \u00a7 330, ECHR 2007...). Against that background, the Court can only reiterate that a prompt and effective response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force is essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 118).",

However, the death of her son at the age of twenty, when he was about to start work and support her, had deprived her of such assistance. In the particular circumstances, she was unable to provide documents to corroborate her claim. However, it would be unfair to assume that a son would not provide help and assistance to his sick mother. The applicant therefore asked the Court to rule on her claim in equity. Alternatively, she invited the Court to base the award in respect of loss of income on 30% of the average salary which her son would have received for fifteen years \u2013 the period during which she could have reasonably expected to receive financial assistance from him. According to official statistics, the average monthly salary in  was 460 Bulgarian levs which, in the applicant's view, was equivalent to EUR 230.

This may, in appropriate cases, include compensation in respect of loss of earnings (see, among other authorities, Angelova and Iliev v. Bulgaria, no. 55523/00, \u00a7 125 in limine, ECHR\u00a02007IX, and Nikolova and Velichkova v. Bulgaria, no. 7888/03, \u00a7\u00a082 in limine, 20 December 2007). In the present case, the Court has found that the authorities were liable under Article 2 for the death of the applicant's son. It also notes that her assertion that her son would have been providing for her financially was not disputed by the Government. In those circumstances, the Court sees no reason to doubt the existence of a sufficient causal link between the breach of Article 2 and the applicant's loss of financial support (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 171, and Beker v. Turkey, no.\u00a027866/03, \u00a7 62, 24 March 2009). However, there is no evidence as to Mr Karandja's actual income, if any (see Nehyet G\u00fcnay and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 51210/99, \u00a7 122, 21 October 2008), and the method used by the applicant to calculate the loss of financial support is far from precise. The calculations submitted by her are based on the assumption that her son would have had a stable income for fifteen years. Various eventualities, such as unemployment or incapacity to work, have not been taken into account (see Sangariyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 1839/04, \u00a7 128, 29 May 2008), nor has the applicant presented an actuarial report. The Court is therefore obliged to deal with her claim on an equitable basis (see Velikova v. Bulgaria, no. 41488/98, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2000VI, and Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7 82). Indeed, in cases such as the present one a precise calculation of the sums necessary to make complete reparation (restitutio in integrum) in respect of the pecuniary losses suffered by the applicant may be prevented by the inherently uncertain character of the damage flowing from the violation. The question to be decided in such cases is the level of just satisfaction, which is a matter to be determined by the Court at its discretion, having regard to what is equitable (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 171, with further references).",
