They maintain that, on the contrary, the length of the preceding administrative appeal proceedings was mainly attributable to the applicant's conduct. It had been expedient on the part of the building authority to await the outcome of the parallel proceedings regarding the prohibition of use order before deciding on the applicant's objection against the refusal of the building permit. Furthermore, discussions on a friendly settlement in the administrative appeal proceedings regarding the building permit had taken place in October 2006. The building authority only realised that a settlement had failed when the applicant lodged his action for failure to act on 25 May 2007. The Government finally invoked that the applicant would have had the opportunity to lodge his action for failure to act on the part of the administrative authorities already as of June 2006 and could have thus accelerated the proceedings.",

However, seeing that in length-of-proceedings cases the protracted examination of a case beyond a \u201creasonable time\u201d involves an increase in the applicant's costs incurred before the domestic courts (see Maurer v.
