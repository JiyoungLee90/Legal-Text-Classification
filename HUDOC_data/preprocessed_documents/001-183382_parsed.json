While the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant facts which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial. Furthermore, an extension order requires a more solid basis to show not only that there was genuinely \u201ca reasonable suspicion\u201d, but also that there were other serious publicinterest considerations which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighed the right to liberty (see Miladinov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 54 and authorities cited). The Court observes that each time they extended the applicant\u2019s detention, the domestic courts repeated the same stereotype formula with identical wording. There is, therefore, no indication that they sufficiently assessed the applicant\u2019s personal situation beyond a mere reference to his possessions and family situation (see paragraph 16 above), which was not accompanied by any explanation as to why his personal circumstances made detention necessary, given that he had immovable property and a family, including children who were still minors, residing in the respondent State. The courts did not refer to any examples of behaviour which indicated a risk of his absconding. Nor did they identify any other serious public interest considerations justifying the repeated extension of his pre-trial detention.",

In particular, in their assessment of the applicant\u2019s application for bail, supported by a substantial amount of money as security, the domestic courts constantly referred to the severity of the charges, the potential penalty and the fact that the applicant had been convicted at first instance in the parallel set of criminal proceedings, which, as already explained above, cannot in themselves be used as a sufficient reason. It is true that on 6\u00a0December 2010 the Skopje Court of Appeal accepted the applicant\u2019s appeal, granted bail of EUR\u00a01,340,614 and placed him under house arrest. However, the Supreme Court annulled that decision, declaring the applicant\u2019s appeal inadmissible (see paragraph 25 above).",
