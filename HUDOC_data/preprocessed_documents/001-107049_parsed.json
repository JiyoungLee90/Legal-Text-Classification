The Court observes that the domestic courts\u2019 decisions to reject the applicant\u2019s request for visiting rights were taken according to domestic law and relied on reasonable grounds which could not infringe the applicant\u2019s private or family life, namely that communication rights are only guaranteed for parents recognized according to the procedures provided by domestic law.
