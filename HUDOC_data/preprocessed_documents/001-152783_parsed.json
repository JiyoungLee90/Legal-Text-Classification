It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. The Court reiterates that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the alleged criminal activities of the applicant may be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings (see G\u00f3rski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a058,\u00a04\u00a0October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention (see Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037).",

The Court further notes that the period to be taken into consideration ended on 17\u00a0March 2010, when the applicant started serving a\u00a0prison sentence imposed in another set of criminal proceedings against him (see paragraphs\u00a012 and\u00a025 above).

In this regard, the Court observes that the proceedings were of considerable complexity, regard being had to the number of defendants and the extensive evidentiary proceedings. Nevertheless, the investigation was completed within the period of one year and some two months (see paragraphs\u00a06, 10 and\u00a027 above). The trial court started the trial without substantial delay, taking into account the fact that it had to decide whether to sever the charges against some accused to separate proceedings (see paragraphs\u00a010 and\u00a013 above). In the relevant period, that is until 17\u00a0March 2010, when the applicant started serving a prison sentence imposed in another set of proceedings, the hearings in his case were held regularly and at short intervals (see paragraphs\u00a01417 above).
