He only went to a forensic doctor six days after his release, which allowed sufficient time for him to sustain injuries not related to his arrest and detention. The forensic doctor had only made a visual inspection of the applicant, and did not carry out any in-depth analysis necessary for reaching a conclusion that the applicant was suffering from head trauma.

Since these three elements were the only ones mentioned by the court in its decision of 22 July 2004 as amounting to a lack of a thorough investigation, it is unclear how the same court could reach another conclusion several months later in the absence of any clarification of the three points. Moreover, the new evidence which was mentioned by the prosecutor supported the applicant's version of events. In their observations submitted to the Court, the Government insisted that the lack of an in-depth analysis by the forensic doctor prevented any definitive conclusion as to the officers' guilt. However, an in-depth medical examination was clearly necessary after the court's decision of 22 July 2004 and was one of the crucial elements for a thorough investigation of the case. It was never carried out, just as no real attempt was made to verify the extent to which a forty-eight-year old person with a third-degree disability could offer any serious resistance to two younger officers specially trained to deal with any resistance.",
