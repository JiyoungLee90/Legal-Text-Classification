It follows that, after the Court has given notice of the applicant\u2019s complaint to the Government, the burden is on the latter to collect and produce relevant documents. A failure on their part to submit convincing evidence on material conditions of detention may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations (see Gubin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a08217/04, \u00a7\u00a056, 17\u00a0June 2010, and Khudoyorov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a06847/02, \u00a7\u00a0113, ECHR 2005-X (extracts)).",

During the third trial, which lasted approximately a year and three and a half months, twelve out of thirty-seven hearings were adjourned, again due to the witnesses\u2019 failure to appear. The Court discerns no indication in the case file that the trial court availed itself of the measures existing under national law to discipline the absent witnesses and obtain their attendance, in order to ensure that the case was heard within a reasonable time (see Zementova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a0942/02, \u00a7\u00a070, 27\u00a0September 2007; Sidorenko v. Russia, no.\u00a04459/03, \u00a7\u00a034, 8\u00a0March 2007; and Sokolov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a03734/02, \u00a7\u00a040, 22\u00a0September 2005). The Court therefore finds that the delay occasioned by the witnesses\u2019 failure to attend hearings and the trial court\u2019s failure to ensure their attendance is attributable to the State.",

As a result, the applicant had to stand trial three times. Although the Court is not in a position to analyse the legal quality of the domestic courts\u2019 decisions, it considers that, since the remittal of cases for re-examination is frequently ordered as a result of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings may disclose a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see, mutatis mutandis, among other authorities, Wierciszewska v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7 46, 25 November 2003). The fact that the domestic courts heard the case several times did not absolve them from having to comply with the reasonable-time requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Litoselitis v. Greece, no.\u00a062771/00, \u00a7 32, 5 February 2004).",
