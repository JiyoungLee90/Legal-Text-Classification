The domestic courts admitted that the bailiffs had been responsible for their failure to enforce the judgment. The aggregated length of the delays occasioned by the judge\u2019s absence and his participation in unrelated proceedings amounted to approximately seven months. The Court also finds it peculiar that in the case which was of no particular complexity so many hearings had to be adjourned to give time to the defendant to produce additional evidence (compare with Di Pede v. Italy, judgment of 26 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV).",

The defendant defaulted on at least eight occasions which resulted in a delay of approximately seven months. There is no indication that the court reacted in any way to that behaviour. Accordingly, the Court considers that, the domestic courts did not avail themselves of the measures available to it under national law to discipline the participants to the proceedings and to ensure that the case be heard within a reasonable time (see, mutatis mutandis, Ku\u015bmierek v. , no. 10675/02, \u00a7 65, 21\u00a0September 2004).",
