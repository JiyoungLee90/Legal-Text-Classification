However, the Court reiterates that it is not open to a State authority to cite the lack of funds or other resources, such as housing, as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt (see Malinovskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035; Plotnikovy v.

The applicant should not be prevented from benefiting from the success of the litigation on the ground of alleged financial difficulties experienced by the State (see Burdov, cited above, \u00a7 35). The same principle applies to difficulties experienced by the State enforcement services and the complexity of the budgetary arrangement (see Wasserman v. , no. 15021/02, \u00a7\u00a038, 18 November 2004 and Chernyshov and Others v. , no. 10415/02, \u00a7\u00a014, 28 September 2006).",

The domestic authorities admitted that the applicant had rightfully dismissed offers made by the Council (see paragraph 12 above).

The Court recalls that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no.\u00a053431/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23 October 2003). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violations found (cf. Poznakhirina v. Russia, no. 25964/02, \u00a7\u00a033, 24\u00a0February 2005). The State's outstanding obligation to enforce the judgment in the applicant's favour is not in dispute.
