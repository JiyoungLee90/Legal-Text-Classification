It is not disputed between the parties that F.S. called the police a little after 7\u00a0a.m. F.S. informed the police of what had happened in the bank and about A.N.\u2019s appearance. This court fully accepts the statements of F.S., M.S., D.F. and I.T. as credible when they testified about A.N.\u2019s state of mind [in the bank]. They stated that A.N. had appeared totally unstable. The conclusion of the police officers M.L. and I.B. that A.N. had been normal and calm and had not been a danger cannot be accepted as logical. They reached such a conclusion after being informed by A.N. that he had withdrawn the money for [his] funeral, and that he was going to kill himself and nobody could stop him. Taking this into account, [this court considers that] the average person could have reached the conclusion about A.N.\u2019s state of mind referred to by witnesses [F.]S., M.S., D.F. and I.T. The police officers who needed to act with particular diligence should have also reached [this] conclusion about A.N.\u2019s state of mind, which they failed to do. They thus failed to act in accordance with sections 22 (1), 23\u00a7(1) and 24 of the Protection of Individuals with Mental Disorders Act ... The defendant considers that there is no connection between the failures of the police and [M.B.B.\u2019s death] and that there is therefore no liability on the Republic of Croatia. This court considers differently. Had police officer M.T. complied with the order of the deputy chief for the criminal police M.B., and informed the hospital and Social Care Centre at 8.15 a.m., as noted in the report, it is highly probable that the outcome would have been avoided, particularly taking into account the statement of witness I.F ... As the liability of the State is objective; it was for it to prove that the damage occurred as a result of a cause which could not have been avoided (vis major), or that the damage resulted exclusively from the actions of the aggrieved party or a third party which could not have been predicted and where the outcome could not have been avoided (section 177(1) and (2) of the Civil Obligations Act). Nothing of [the sort] has been proven by the defendant. ...\u201d",

Unlawful conduct is conduct which is contrary to the law or an omission in the application of the law, which is committed deliberately or by accepting that it might cause damage to a third party. ... The purpose of section 13 of the State Administration Act is to provide for the liability of the State where there is a wilful act contrary to the law with the intent of causing damage ... Acceptance [of that outcome] is conduct or an omission of a State official in the performance of his or her official duties where he or she was able to, according to his or her individual capability, take into account the objective requirements with due diligence, and which he or she failed to do. In the particular circumstances, there is no causal link between the damage and the omissions of police officer M.Kr., in his capacity as on-duty commanding officer, to report the day before [the shootings] about M.N.\u2019s complaint that she had been followed by A.N. This court finds nothing to suggest that the police officers who intervened at the bank, and who had had no knowledge of this, would have acted differently even if they had had such information. The plaintiffs also refer to the omissions of police officers M.L. and I.B ... Under section 24 of the Protection of Individuals with Mental Disorders Act the police may, in particularly urgent cases, take a mentally disturbed individual to a psychiatric hospital without prior medical examination, provided there is a reasonable suspicion that the individual poses an immediate threat to his life or health, or the life or health of others ... The events [in the bank] suggest that the police had an obligation to act under section 23 of the Protection of Individuals with Mental Disorders Act and to secure A.N.\u2019s medical examination, after which the doctor could decide whether to take to a psychiatric hospital. But in the particular circumstances police officers M.L. and I.B. could not have been expected to recognise that there was any particular urgency or that A.N. should be taken to a psychiatric hospital without prior medical examination ... The omission of police officer [M.T.] to inform the hospital about A.N.\u2019s behaviour is an irregularity in the performance of his official duties. However, the dispute between the parties is whether there is a causal link between this irregularity and the event ... Even if M.T. had informed the hospital at 8.15 a.m., it is doubtful whether the doctor would have carried out an examination because at that time he had not known where A.N. was. It follows that at the time A.N. was no longer available to the police and according to the evidence [submitted by] F.S. was in the bank sometime between 8.30 and 9 a.m. There is therefore no causal link between the incidents and the omissions of police officer M.T ... \u201c",

In any event, the police could have informed the hospital immediately after 7.15 a.m. when they had received the call from the bank. Nevertheless, the court held that the police had done everything they could and that it could not be concluded that only intervention by the doctor in the first few hours after the information had been received from the bank would have prevented the incidents. The court also found that, irrespective of A.N.\u2019s violent background and the indications that he was mentally disturbed, he had not acted violently on the day of the incidents or the day before. It was true that police officers M.L. and I.B. had omitted to examine A.N. under section 49 of the Police Act, but he had not been behaving violently, so that omission could not be characterised as an irregularity in their work. Moreover, it was not certain whether A.N. had a gun at the time and therefore it was in doubt whether such a police search could have prevented the incidents.",

In the Sa\u0161o Gorgiev case (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 52) the Court found a violation of that Article because the State had failed to put in place a system of adequate and effective safeguards to prevent its agents from misusing their service weapons as well as because nothing had suggested that any assessment had been made of the perpetrator\u2019s fitness to serve in the police and to carry a weapon.",

In view of the context of widespread domestic violence and more generally of abuse and violence against women in Croatian society, which was known to the State authorities, and of A.N.\u2019s past behaviour and criminal record, of which they were also aware, the police officers had a duty to act for the protection of A.N.\u2019s wife and close relatives as early as 21 March 2002, when A.N.\u2019s wife, M.N., went to the police station.

An equitable system of administration of justice which guarantees the independence of lawyers in the discharge of their professional duties without any violence or threat thereof is imperative for the maintenance of the rule of law. It is inherent in the rights to a fair trial and access to justice that the protagonists of justice perform their respective roles free from any violence or threat of violence. While the threat of violence does not in the majority of cases alter the way lawyers conduct their legal business, nonetheless the sheer existence of such a possibility calls into question the fairness of any court or out-of-court procedure. The State is therefore called not only to punish, but also to prevent such acts, and ultimately to take the measures necessary to ensure the lawyer\u2019s safety, in order to guarantee the rule of law and the rights to a fair trial and access to justice, as provided by Article 6 of the Convention, in addition to the lawyer\u2019s right to life and physical integrity. To reiterate a well-enshrined principle, where the safety of lawyers is threatened as a result of discharging their duties, they must receive appropriate protection from the State authorities.

Since the failure of police officer M.T. to immediately report the situation concerning A.N. on the morning of 22 March 2002 to the hospital, as he had been instructed to do by his superior, and the objective falsification of his report about the times he had contacted the hospital and Social Care Centre were irrefutable, the only disputed question was the dolus of police officer M.T.. The justification given by police officer M.T. for his behaviour is evidently not convincing, but even if one were to accept it, it would correspond, at least, to a dolus eventualis form of commission of the imputed crime of falsification, since M.T. knew quite well that the relevant time for the report was the exact time at which he spoke with Dr IF, not the time when he tried to call him, and therefore that the recorded time of the communication with Dr. IF did not correspond to the actual time of that communication. Indeed, no plausible explanation was given for M.T.\u2019s crucial delay of one hour and twenty minutes. Hence, the dolus of M.T. is patently evident, and his acquittal cannot be considered founded, falling short of minimum procedural standards of fairness. The expiry of the time-limit for M.Ko.\u2019s prosecution as a result of State inertia aggravates the impression of connivance in the way the criminal case was dealt with.",

This huge amount of money was clearly punitive, and aimed at silencing the applicants, and avoiding further appeals allowed by domestic law. It is simply inadmissible to \u201cpunish\u201d the applicants for having used the procedural powers that domestic law accorded them, all the more so when the applicants\u2019 civil action was in substance righteous.",

If one adds to these doubts, the disregard for the disciplinary punishment of M.T. and M.Ko. and for the evidence of A.N.\u2019s mental disturbance by the civil courts, and the rather terse and unconvincing final finding of the Supreme Court after a tortuous set of contradictory judgments and appeals, some stating that the State\u2019s liability could be engaged on the basis of fault on the part of its agents, others stating the opposite and requiring only the existence of an objective link of causality between the State agent\u2019s conduct and the damage, and finally the fact that the Supreme Court wrongly rejected even the existence of such a link, one cannot but conclude that no effective remedies were available to the applicants. No justice was done to them. In their tireless efforts to shed light on the facts, bring to justice those responsible and seek fair compensation, they were always let down. The \u201cpunishment\u201d of the applicants by ordering them to pay approximately 10,500 euros for costs and expenses only serves to show the adverse environment that they had to face in order to see justice done.",

Seen from a wider perspective, this case heralds a major development in the theory of the State\u2019s positive obligations with regard to violent mentally disturbed persons, on the one hand, and to lawyers who are victims of violence in the performance of their professional activity, on the other. But the present case is not closed. After the Court\u2019s judgment the domestic proceedings should be reopened, in both the criminal and the civil courts. The husband, children and sisters of the late M.B.B. are still waiting to obtain full justice.",
