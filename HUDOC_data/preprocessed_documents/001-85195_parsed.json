Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see, among other authorities, W. v.\u00a0Switzerland, judgment of 26\u00a0January 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0254-A, p.\u00a015, \u00a7\u00a030; Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a0110, ECHR\u00a02000-XI).",

Until his conviction, the accused must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continuing detention ceases to be reasonable (see, among many authorities, Castravet\u00a0v. , no. 23393/05, \u00a7\u00a030, 13\u00a0March 2007; McKay\u00a0v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a0543/03, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2006...; Jablonski\u00a0v. , no.\u00a033492/96, \u00a7\u00a083, 21 December 2000; and Neumeister\u00a0v.

It observes that until 14\u00a0September 2004 the domestic authorities never considered whether the length of his detention had already exceeded a \u201creasonable time\u201d. The fact that the maximum time-limits permitted by the domestic law were not exceeded may not be a decisive element for the Court\u2019s assessment. The calculation of the domestic time-limits depended solely on the gravity of the charges which was decided upon by the prosecution and was not subject to a judicial review (see Shcheglyuk\u00a0v.\u00a0, no.\u00a07649/02, \u00a7\u00a043, 14\u00a0December 2006, and paragraphs 49 and 50 above).

However, with the passage of time those grounds inevitably became less and less relevant. Nevertheless, over the following years the courts\u2019 reasoning did not evolve to reflect the developing situation and to verify whether these grounds remained sufficient at the advanced stage of the proceedings. Even though the applicant had been dismissed from the police already in May 2002 and this fact had been promptly brought to the attention of the domestic courts, for more than one year and a half they continued to refer to his police employment as a factor warranting his holding in custody. Those findings had no basis in fact and could not obviously serve as a justification for the applicant\u2019s continued detention.",

The Court has repeatedly held that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Belevitskiy v. , no.\u00a072967/01, \u00a7\u00a0101, 1\u00a0March 2007; Ilijkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7 81, 26 July 2001; and Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, \u00a7 51). This is particularly relevant in the Russian legal system where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of the issue whether the evidence that has been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov v.

Until September 2004 the District and City Courts had regard solely to the gravity of the charges and/or nature of the offence but explicitly refused to consider the applicant\u2019s arguments that he had a permanent place of residence, positive work references, family connections and clear criminal record. In this connection the Court reiterates that any system of mandatory detention is incompatible per se with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it being incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish and demonstrate the existence of concrete facts outweighing the rule of respect for individual liberty.",
