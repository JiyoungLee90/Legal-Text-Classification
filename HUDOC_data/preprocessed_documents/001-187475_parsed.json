Relying on the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, the Supreme Court concluded that, in analysing the legality of the prisoner\u2019s transport conditions, the personal floor space available to the prisoner should be assessed, together with other criteria such as: lighting and ventilation; whether each prisoner had his or her own seat; the duration of the journey; and the number of times the prisoner was transported in cramped conditions. In order to assess whether, in that particular case, the applicant had had to endure conditions degrading to human dignity, the Supreme Court relied on the European Parliament and Council Directive 2001/85/EC (see paragraph 27 below). The Supreme Court found that the dimensions of the transported prisoner\u2019s seat and legroom had been approximately the same as those set out as minimum requirements in the Directive. It held that, in such conditions, a single journey lasting a little over two hours had not degraded the applicant\u2019s human dignity, either separately, based on the dimensions of the van compartment, or cumulatively, with the use of means of restraint. The Supreme Court considered it important that the personal space in the van had not been different from the minimum requirements for transporting passengers who were not prisoners.",

In the latter case, the court dismissed the claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage of a prisoner who had twice been transported for ten minutes in a single occupancy compartment with a floor space of 0.51 square metres. The court considered that holding otherwise would lead to a result whereby the rights of people travelling by bus who were not prisoners would be protected to a lesser extent than those of prisoners. Having taken note of the Court\u2019s case-law, the Tartu Court of Appeal considered that such a conclusion could not be the aim of the Court.",

They emphasised that all the conditions and aspects of transport had to be assessed cumulatively, without there being an exclusive focus on floor space. The applicant had been placed alone in a single occupancy compartment with a floor area of 0.51 square metres. The compartment was at least 60 cm wide, 85 cm long and 149 cm high, and had a strong plastic seat on a metal frame attached to the floor. As for leg space, although narrow, it met the requirements of Directive 2001/85/EC (see paragraph 27 above). During the day, the compartments received natural daylight through the two roof hatches and windscreen; if it was dark, ceiling lights were switched on. The van had three separate adjustable air heating systems and zones, including one for transported prisoners. No seat belts or handles had been designed for the compartments. The Government noted that in Voicu v. Romania (no.\u00a022015/10, 10 June 2014), the Court had found that the absence of seat belts alone could not lead to a violation of Article 3. Considering those conditions and the fact that the applicant was young and healthy and had not spent more than twenty minutes in the van, during which time it had not left the prison premises, the treatment had not reached the level of severity to come within the scope of Article 3.",

Ill-treatment must, however, attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3.

Only a comprehensive approach to the particular conditions can provide an accurate picture of the reality for the person being transported (see, for example, M.S., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 74-75, where the Court also considered the frequency and the duration of trips; Trepashkin v. Russia (no. 2), no.\u00a014248/05, \u00a7\u00a7 132-136, 16 December 2010, where account was taken of the duration and number of trips, whether the design capacity of the prison van was complied with, and the opportunity prisoners had to exercise and have a decent meal on transfer days; Yakovenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108-112, where the Court noted the frequency and number of trips and that the compartments were poorly lit and insufficiently ventilated; and Khudoyorov v.

Against that background, the Court accepts the approach taken by the domestic courts that the space available for the detainees in the prison transport van was comparable to that required, as a minimum standard, for people who were not prisoners.",

In that respect, the Court notes that the applicant acknowledged, even if briefly, before departing that he would have to wear hand and ankle cuffs during his leave (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above), and that he made contradictory statements to the prison and the domestic courts about his fear of being humiliated in front of his family (see paragraphs 11, 12 and 14 above).

In the absence of any argument by the applicant regarding his complaint as communicated to the respondent Government (see paragraphs 3 and 28 above), the Court considers that the complaint under this head is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(a) and\u00a04 of the Convention.",
