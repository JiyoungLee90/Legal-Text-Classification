He submitted that there was no law or regulation giving the National Bar Council regulatory powers in such matters as money-laundering. Furthermore, pointing out that the decision concerned required lawyers to adopt in-house procedures to ensure compliance with the instructions on the reporting of suspicions, subject to disciplinary sanctions, and that the term \u201csuspicions\u201d was not defined, he complained that this was in breach of the requirement of legal certainty inherent in Article 7 of the Convention.

It further notes that, like the obligation to show due diligence and report suspicions, it affects all French lawyers, so the applicant belongs to a class of people who risk being directly affected by it. In particular, for example, if he fails to report suspicious activities as required he will expose himself by virtue of this text to disciplinary sanctions up to and including being struck off. The Court also considers credible the applicant\u2019s suggestion that, as a lawyer specialising in financial and tax law, he is even more concerned by these obligations than many of his colleagues and exposed to the consequences of failure to comply. In fact he is faced with a dilemma comparable, mutatis mutandis, to that which the Court identified in Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom (22 October 1981, \u00a7 41, Series A no. 45) and Norris (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30-34): either he applies the rules and relinquishes his idea of the principle of lawyer-client privilege, or he decides not to apply them and exposes himself to disciplinary sanctions and even being struck off.",

He referred in this connection to the statistics published by the FIU, which revealed, for example, that in 2010 it had received 20,252 reports, including 19,208 reports of suspicions submitted by the legal profession, that only 5,132 of these \u2013 that is, 25% \u2013 had been examined in detail and that in the end only 404 (no more than a quarter of which concerned suspicions of money-laundering) had been forwarded to the judicial system for follow-up; the others had been dealt with in the form of notes for the intelligence services, the tax authorities and the police. The information thus gathered was transmitted, recorded and held by an administrative department answering to the Ministry of Finance and it was not known what use was made of it. These figures also showed how inefficient the system was, as only 404 out of 19,208 reports had found their way into the justice system; lawyer-client privilege was thus being sacrificed to very little effect in terms of the prevention of money-laundering.",

In addition, Article D. 561-32-1 of the Monetary and Financial Code laid down the reference criteria that should trigger reports of suspicions of tax fraud \u2013 the use of front companies, for example \u2013 because they were an indication of dubious practices.

In this connection it highlighted four points. Firstly, the client\u2019s right to remain silent was also at stake. The obligation to report suspicions required lawyers to make their clients incriminate themselves. Secondly, as the legal provisions in issue were based on the notion of \u201csuspicions\u201d, but did not define that term, the \u201claw\u201d had neither the quality nor the foreseeability required. Thirdly, confidentiality was particularly important in the Court\u2019s case-law \u2013 which protected the confidentiality of journalists\u2019 sources and of medical data \u2013, the protection of legal professional privilege in the face of this type of obligation had been affirmed in Canada and the United States of America, and the positive law of certain European Union member States (Belgium, Estonia, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands), as well as Switzerland, was more protective. Fourthly, as the Court had pointed out in the Casado Coca v. Spain judgment (24 February 1994, Series A no. 285-A), the lawyer played a key role in preserving public confidence in the action of the courts; it was essential, therefore, that people should be able to trust in their lawyers, which meant preserving their independence from the authorities \u2013 which was undermined by the link with the FIU established by the legal provisions in issue \u2013 and the confidentiality of the information they handled.",

In addition, French lawyers were all subject to the criminal law on money-laundering, which was particularly strict, as well as to major ethical obligations, with sanctions for failure to comply, and to financial supervision.

Thus far the cases in which the Court had allowed equivalent protection in favour of the European Union had not concerned the implementation of Directives, which, unlike Regulations, left the States a margin of appreciation. Furthermore, while the fact that certain of the Directives relating to money-laundering referred to the Convention might lead to the acknowledgment of an equivalence of the rules and the substantive protection, there was clearly no equivalence of procedural protection in the absence of a right of individual petition in the European Union system. EBHRI also noted that the Court had acknowledged the equivalence of the protection afforded in the case of disputes involving international organisation staff members, precisely because they had a right of direct individual application to a judicial body affording all the requisite guarantees (it referred to Boivin v. 34 member States of the Council of Europe (dec.), no. 73250/01, ECHR 2008; Gasparini v.

It fails to see what lesson can be learnt from these figures in the present case when the FIU\u2019s 2010 activity report reveals that none of the 19,208 reports of suspicions were submitted by a lawyer. It considers, on the contrary, that this report presents a positive picture of the results achieved; in fact FATF found that France\u2019s methods of combating money-laundering and the financing of terrorism were among the most effective in the world.

It can be considered that at this stage, when a lawyer shares information with a fellow professional who is not only subject to the same rules of conduct but also elected by his or her peers to uphold them, professional privilege has not been breached. The fellow professional concerned, who is better placed than anybody to determine which information is covered by lawyer-client privilege and which is not, transmits the report of suspicions to the FIU only after having ascertained that the conditions laid down by Article L. 561-3 of the Monetary and Financial Code have been met (Article L. 561-17 of the same Code, see paragraph 38 above). The Government pointed out in this regard that the information is not forwarded if the Chairman of the Bar considers that there is no suspicion of money-laundering or it appears that the information reported was received in the course of activities excluded from the scope of the obligation to report suspicions.",

In the Andr\u00e9 and Another judgment, it specified that the Convention did not prevent domestic law from allowing for the possibility of searching a lawyer\u2019s offices as long as proper safeguards were provided; more broadly, it emphasised that, subject to strict supervision, it was possible to impose certain obligations on lawyers concerning their relations with their clients, in the event, for example, that there was plausible evidence of the lawyer\u2019s involvement in a crime and in the context of the fight against money-laundering. It then took into account the fact that the search had been carried out in the presence of the Chairman of the Bar, which it saw as a \u201cspecial procedural guarantee\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 42 and 43). Similarly, in the Roemen and Schmit judgment cited above (\u00a7 69) it noted that the search of the lawyer\u2019s premises had been accompanied by \u201cspecial procedural safeguards\u201d, including the presence of the President of the Bar Council. Lastly, in Xavier Da Silveira, cited above (see in particular \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 43), it found a violation of Article 8, in part because there had been no such safeguard when a lawyer\u2019s premises were searched.",

Now, even assuming that the disciplinary action to which failure to comply with the professional regulations of 12 July 2007 could lead might be classified as \u201ccriminal\u201d proceedings within the meaning of the Convention, the Court notes that no such proceedings were brought against the applicant.
