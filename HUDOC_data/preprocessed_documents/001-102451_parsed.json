The investigation in case no. 24045 was instituted on 17 October 2000, that is, on the date of the events. On the same date the investigators examined the crime scene. The Court notes that even though the crime scene was examined, no evidence was collected by the investigators, in spite of the remaining fragments of the explosive device (see paragraph 17 above) and the fragments of the applicants' sons' bodies (see paragraphs 17 and 32 above). The investigators' failure to collect such crucial evidence demonstrates a lack of diligence on the part of the authorities in investigating the incident as these measures are obviously basic and important steps at the very beginning of the criminal proceedings. It is clear that the subsequent actions of the investigators did not redeem the initial failures, but, on the contrary, they seem to have remained inadequate throughout the proceedings: according to the Government, during the first weeks of the investigation the investigators questioned a number of local residents, who consistently stressed that the explosion had been caused by a flying projectile launched from the direction of the Michurina settlement (see paragraphs 33-34, 37, 40 and 41 above). Nevertheless, the investigators did not take steps to substantiate this information, such as questioning any members of military forces about the possible launch of a projectile from their military equipment. Nor did the investigators request any other detailed information from the military units concerning their whereabouts and operations in the Urus-Martan area on 17\u00a0October 2000. From the information submitted by the parties, it does not follow that the investigators took any steps to verify the theory advanced by the Government that the deaths of the applicants' sons could have been a result of an accident caused by \u201cincorrect use\u201d of artillery by the Russian military (see paragraph 60). In the Court's opinion, such omissions in the investigation of the incident and the absence of explanations as to the authorities' failure to establish the very basic circumstances of the events, demonstrate a failure to act of their own motion and constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in its early stages by the authorities' failure to take the essential investigative measures and establish the crucial circumstances of the incident. Moreover, the town court's instructions to the prosecutor's office to investigate the crime effectively did not produce any tangible results for the applicants. The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant investigative measures were taken to identify those responsible for the deaths of the applicants' sons. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
