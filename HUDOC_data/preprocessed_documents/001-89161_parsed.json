At times defendants were not allowed to confront or question witnesses against them, defendants and their attorneys were denied access to government evidence against them, and defendants frequently did not enjoy a presumption of innocence. In some cases, courts refused to accept exculpatory evidence provided by defense attorneys, even if that evidence would have changed the outcome of the trial.

The establishment of such responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of conditions in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention. Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the receiving country, whether under general international law, under the Convention or otherwise. In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may be incurred, it is liability incurred by the extraditing Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no.\u00a0161, pp.\u00a035-36, \u00a7\u00a7 89-91; Garabayev v.

In cases such as the present the Court must examine the foreseeable consequences of sending the applicant to the receiving country, bearing in mind the general situation there and his personal circumstances (see Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 October 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0215, \u00a7\u00a0108 in fine). To that end, as regards the general situation in a particular country, the Court has often attached importance to the information contained in recent reports from independent international human-rights-protection associations such as Amnesty International, or governmental sources, including the US State Department (see, for example, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V, \u00a7\u00a7 99-100; M\u00fcslim v.

At the same time, it has held that the mere possibility of ill-treatment on account of an unsettled situation in the receiving country does not in itself give rise to a breach of Article 3 (see Vilvarajah and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0111, and Fatgan Katani and Others\u00a0v. Germany (dec.), no. 67679/01, 31 May 2001) and that, where the sources available to it describe a general situation, an applicant\u2019s specific allegations in a particular case require corroboration by other evidence (see Mamatkulov and Askarov v.

The assessment of this minimum is, in the nature of things, relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the treatment or punishment, the manner and method of its execution, its duration and its physical or mental effects. Treatment will be considered to be \u201cinhuman\u201d within the meaning of Article 3 because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering. Furthermore, in considering whether a punishment or treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3. When assessing conditions of detention, account has to be taken of their cumulative effects as well as the applicant\u2019s specific allegations. The duration of detention is also a relevant factor (see, Garabayev v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7 75, with further references). Furthermore, even if diplomatic assurances have been given, the Court is not absolved from the obligation to examine whether such assurances provided, in their practical application, a sufficient guarantee that the applicant would be protected against the risk of treatment prohibited by the Convention (see Chahal, cited above, \u00a7 105; Saadi v.

There were reports of beatings of those who required medical help and denial of medical assistance. According to the Report of the United Nations Secretary-General (see paragraph 36 above), torture was also used as a punishment for persons who had already confessed. All above reports equally noted very poor prison conditions, including overcrowding, poor nutrition and untreated diseases. It is also reported that allegations of torture and ill-treatment are not investigated by the competent Turkmen authorities. Bearing in mind the authority and reputation of the authors of these reports, the seriousness of the investigations by means of which they were compiled, the fact that on the points in question their conclusions are consistent with each other and that those conclusions are corroborated in substance by other sources (see paragraph 37 above), the Court does not doubt their reliability. Moreover, the respondent Government have not adduced any evidence or reports capable of rebutting the assertions made in the sources cited by the applicant.",

From the materials considered above it appears that any criminal suspect held in custody counter a serious risk of being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment both to extract confessions and to punish for being a criminal. Despite the fact that the applicant is wanted for relatively minor and not politically motivated offence, the Court agrees with the applicant\u2019s argument that the mere fact of being detained as a criminal suspect in such a situation provides sufficient grounds for fear that he will be at serious risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.",

The Court observes, however, that it is not at all established that the First Deputy Prosecutor General or the institution which he represented was empowered to provide such assurances on behalf of the State. Furthermore, given the lack of an effective system of torture prevention, it would be difficult to see whether such assurances would have been respected. Finally, the Court notes that the international human rights reports also showed serious problems as regards the international cooperation of the Turkmen authorities in the field of human rights and categorical denials of human rights violations despite the consistent information from both intergovernmental and nongovernmental sources (see paragraph 36 above).",

He was also informed that the criminal procedure against him was pending in Turkmenistan and not in . The same day the Kherson Police Department received an official request from the Turkmen authorities for the applicant\u2019s provisional arrest under Article 61 of the Minsk Convention. On 10 January 2007 the  ordered the applicant\u2019s detention pending the extradition proceedings against him. On 30 January 2007 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Ukraine received an official request from the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Turkmenistan for the applicant\u2019s extradition with a view to criminal prosecution. The Court further notes that the Minsk Convention, which is part of the domestic law in , provides for a provisional arrest of the wanted person with a view to his possible extradition to the requested State even prior to the official request for extradition. From the facts described above the Court considers that the Ukrainian authorities arrested and detained the applicant in order to take action with a view to his extradition. There were no criminal proceedings against the applicant in . Moreover, no other reason, except the one of extradition (and the proceedings for hooliganism which were mentioned to his relatives but never referred to again), has ever been advanced by the authorities for the applicant\u2019s detention during the period in question and there is no evidence in the case-file to suggest that any such other reason has ever existed. Therefore, notwithstanding the applicant\u2019s submissions to the contrary, his detention has always been with a view to extradition and his above complaint falls to be considered under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (f) of the Convention (see Novik, cited above).

However, the applicant, as a person detained with a view to extradition rather than a suspect in a criminal case, did not fall into any of these categories.

This provision does not require that the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to extradition be reasonably considered necessary, for example, to prevent his committing an offence or absconding.

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Amuur\u00a0v.

In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the \u201cquality of the law\u201d, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. \u201cQuality of law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Khudoyorov\u00a0v.

(no.\u00a0656/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a072-77, 11\u00a0October 2007) the Court established that Chapter 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Russia (\u201cExtradition of a person for criminal prosecution or execution of sentence\u201d), which did not set up special procedure of arrest and detention with a view to extradition but referred to the procedure of arrest and detention on remand, created confusion among the national authorities as to its application. The Court concluded that the provisions of the Russian law governing detention of persons with a view to extradition were neither precise nor foreseeable in their application and fell short of the \u201cquality of law\u201d standard required under the Convention.",

The Constitution further guarantees to everyone the right to challenge his or her detention in a court at any time. In other contexts, those constitutional safeguards are set out in further detail in separate instruments, such as the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Psychiatric Medical Assistance Act in the case of compulsory psychiatric treatment (see Gorshkov v.

There are no legal provisions, however, whether in the Code of Criminal Procedure or in any other legislative instrument, that provide, even by reference, a procedure for detention with a view to extradition.

Belgium, judgment of 18\u00a0June\u00a01971, Series A no. 12, \u00a7 76). A remedy must be made available during a person\u2019s detention to allow that person to obtain speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of the detention, capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release. The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Stoichkov\u00a0v.

In particular, Article 165-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that it is open to the \u201cprosecutor, suspect, accused or his or her defence counsel or legal representative\u201d to challenge the decision of the first instance court. However, the applicant, as a person detained with a view to extradition rather than a suspect in a criminal case, did not belong to any of these categories. As to Articles 106 and 382 of the Code they equally refer to the situations of and parties to domestic criminal proceedings and not specifically to extradition proceedings. The Government have not indicated how Articles 106, 165-2 and 382 of the Code of Criminal Procedure could provide the review required by Article 5 \u00a7 4.

It could not therefore have constituted the \u201cproceedings\u201d foreseen by Article 5 \u00a7 4, either.",
