                                "content": "18.\u00a0\u00a0On 30 January 2009 the Appeal Court convicted the first applicant of defamation and sentenced him to 40 day-fines, totalling 240 euros (EUR). He was ordered to pay EUR 2,000 plus interest in damages to the complainant. The applicant company was ordered, together with the first applicant, to pay EUR 4,000 plus interest in damages to the complainant as well as his costs and expenses of EUR 25,500, plus interest, in total. The court found first of all that the Espoo District Court had been the competent court in the matter. As to the merits, the Appeal Court mentioned Article 10 of the Convention and the principles expressed therein as well as adverting to the Court\u2019s case-law and legal literature on Article 10. With reference to the Court\u2019s case-law, it recalled that even if everyone was guaranteed freedom of expression, it was not permitted to defame others or to disseminate false information on anybody. In this respect a journalist had the same responsibility as others. The Appeal Court then found that it had not been proved that the complainant had disseminated wrong information in the documentaries in the manner recounted by the first applicant, except for the misleading information given in the context of the reportage on mould-infested houses which the complainant had failed to rectify. It appeared also from the witness statements that different statistical information existed as far as the conserved forest area in Finland was concerned, such that it could not be said that the figures given by the complainant had been fabricated. The first applicant had thus imparted false information on the complainant and these accusations had been serious. The first applicant had not therefore had strong reasons or probable cause to hold his own accusations to be true. The fact that freedom of expression was guaranteed under Article 12 of the Constitution as well as under Article 10 of the Convention together with the fact that the complainant was also a journalist and that the first applicant had been able to give grounds for his own opinion in the media, did not entitle the first applicant to impart the above-mentioned false information. Nor did the first applicant have the right to call the complainant a liar. On these grounds the first applicant was found guilty of defamation.",

In particular, the Appeal Court did not balance the first applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression (under Article 10 of the Convention), on the basis of the relevant criteria (as summarised at paragraph 49 above), in any considered way against the complainant\u2019s conflicting right to reputation (under Article 8 of the Convention). It does not emerge from the reasoning of the Appeal Court what \u201cpressing social need\u201d in the present case was taken to justify protecting the complainant\u2019s right to reputation over the freedom of expression of the applicants, in particular as both the first applicant and the complainant were professional journalists discussing the limits of critical journalism. Nor is it clear whether, according to the Appeal Court, the resultant interference with the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see paragraph 18 above). In this connection, as has been remarked in the Court\u2019s case-law, journalists in the position of the first applicant who are disseminating information or commenting on a matter of public interest, as well as their publishers, are to be taken as enjoying a higher level of protection of their freedom of expression under Article 10 than, for example, persons expressing themselves in a private dispute (see Jersild v. Denmark, cited above, \u00a7 31; and Flinkkil\u00e4 and Others v. Finland, no. 25576/04, \u00a7 73, 6 April 2010). Also of relevance in the present case for the requisite judicial balancing exercise to be carried out is the fact that the complainant, while entitled to benefit from the protection afforded to every individual\u2019s reputation by Article 8 as part of the right to respect for private life, was himself an investigative journalist involved in making TV documentaries on controversial issues for a public broadcasting company; that is to say, he was engaged in an activity very much in the public domain in a manner and in circumstances where he could himself expect to be the subject of robust scrutiny, comment and criticism regarding his professional conduct. In these two respects the judicial examination by the Appeal Court of the factors justifying the imposition of a criminal sanction on the applicants for the exercise by them of their freedom of expression cannot be said to have paid sufficient attention to the \"journalistic\" hue of the case.",
