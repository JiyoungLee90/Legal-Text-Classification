Finland ([GC], no. 73053/01, ECHR 2006XIV), the Court found that Article 6 under its criminal head applied to proceedings on the imposition of surcharges for taxes. In doing so, it examined whether the surcharge proceedings were \u201ccriminal\u201d within the autonomous meaning of the Article, and to this end relied on three criteria, commonly known as the \u201cEngel criteria\u201d (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 82, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a022), to be considered in determining whether or not there was a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Sergey Zolotukhin v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a014939/03, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2009; and Steininger v. Austria, no. 21539/07, \u00a7\u00a034, 17\u00a0April 2012).",

Moreover, with regard to the third criterion, it observes that the fine at issue concerned a substantial amount and was both deterrent and punitive, as it did not merely aim at the compensation of the damage caused by the applicant (see H\u00fcseyin Turan v. Turkey, no.\u00a011529/02, \u00a7\u00a019, 4 March 2008). In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that Article\u00a06 applies under its criminal head.",

While the requirements of a fair hearing are strictest concerning the hard core of criminal law, the guarantees of the limb of Article 6 applying to criminal law do not necessarily apply with their full stringency to other categories of cases falling under that head and which do not carry any significant degree of stigma. The Court therefore accepted that an oral hearing may not be required in all cases in the criminal sphere (see Jussila, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

An oral hearing may not be required where there are no issues of credibility or contested facts which necessitate an oral presentation of evidence or cross-examination of witnesses and where the accused was given an adequate opportunity to put forward his case in writing and to challenge the evidence against him (see Jussila, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-42 and 47-48).
