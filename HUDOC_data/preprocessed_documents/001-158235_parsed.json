Can an international lie exist? Yes, once Hitler was the master of such lies; now it\u2019s the imperialists of the USA and EU! Documents from not only Turkish but also Russian archives refute these international liars. The documents show that imperialists from the West and from Tsarist Russia were responsible for the situation boiling over between Muslims and Armenians. The Great Powers, which wanted to divide the Ottoman Empire, provoked a section of the Armenians, with whom we had lived in peace for centuries, and incited them to violence. The Turks and Kurds defended their homeland from these attacks. It should not be forgotten that Hitler used the same methods \u2013 that is to say, exploiting ethnic groups and communities \u2013 to divide up countries for his own imperialistic designs, with peoples killing one another. The lie of the \u2018Armenian genocide\u2019 was first invented in 1915 by the imperialists of England, France and Tsarist Russia, who wanted to divide the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. As Chamberlain later admitted, this was war propaganda. ... The USA occupied and divided Iraq with the Gulf Wars between 1991 and 2003, creating a puppet State in the north. They then added the oilfields of Kirkuk to this State. Today, Turkey is required to act as the guardian of this puppet State. We are faced with imperialist encirclement. The lies about the \u2018Armenian genocide\u2019 and the pressure linked to the Aegean and Cyprus are interdependent and designed to divide us and take us hostage\u00a0... The fact that successive decisions have been taken that even refer to our liberation war as a \u2018crime of humanity\u2019 shows that the USA and EU have included the Armenian question among their strategies for Asia and the Middle East ... For their campaign of lies about the \u2018Armenian genocide\u2019, the USA and EU have manipulated people with Turkish identity cards. In particular, certain historians have been bought and journalists hired by the American and German secret services to be transported from one conference to another ... Don\u2019t believe the Hitler-style lies such as that of the \u2018Armenian genocide\u2019. Seek the truth like Galileo, and stand up for it.\u201d",

Do\u011fu Perin\u00e7ek acknowledges that massacres took place but justifies them in the name of the laws of war and maintains that the massacres were perpetrated by the Armenian as well as by the Turkish side. He also acknowledges that the Turkish Ottoman Empire moved thousands of Armenians from the borders of Russia towards what are now Syria and Iraq, but denies totally the genocidal nature of these deportations. He maintains that at most these deportations reflected security needs. He has even claimed that the Ottoman troops were acting to protect the Armenians in the conflict between the Ottoman Empire and Russia. Moreover, he has often stated in public that the Armenians, or at least some of them, were traitors, as they were allied to the Russians against the troops of the Empire. The defendant has received varying degrees of support for his opinions from the historians whom he called to give evidence to the court. The historians called by the civil party have disagreed totally with him.

As the law clearly states, it has to concern a genocide as defined by, for example, the International Convention of 9 December 1948 on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and Article 6 of the Rome Statute. In its submissions, the defence maintained that when it drew up Article 261 bis of the Criminal Code, Parliament only had in mind the genocide of the Jews in the Second World War. The defence also argued that to be entitled to the protection of Article\u00a0261\u00a0bis, a genocide must necessarily be recognised as such by an international court of justice. It stressed that the Armenian genocide had not been universally recognised, in particular not by Turkey, and that certain historians shared Do\u011fu Perin\u00e7ek\u2019s opinions. It concluded, firstly, that as the situation was unclear and, secondly and above all, that as the genocide of the Armenians had not been recognised by an international court of justice, Do\u011fu Perin\u00e7ek\u2019s denial of the Armenian genocide could not come within the scope of Article 261 bis of the Criminal Code. It told the Court that the latter could not act as historian and noted in that particular regard that it had made an interlocutory application during the hearing for the Court to establish a neutral committee of historians to investigate whether or not the 1915-17 massacres had constituted a genocide.",

The civil party and the prosecution consider that the Armenian genocide is a well-known fact, whether or not it has been recognised by an international court of justice.

It does not, for example, refer to \u2018a genocide recognised by an international court of justice\u2019. Nor does it specify \u2018the genocide of the Jews, to the exclusion of the genocide of the Armenians\u2019. Is this an omission of Parliament?",

From a historical standpoint, therefore, it can be inferred that Parliament took the Armenian genocide as an example when drafting Article 261 bis of the Criminal Code (Comby report). It must therefore be recognised that the legislators did not simply have the genocide of the Jews in mind when they drew up Article 261 bis.",

For example, according to Corboz (Bernard Corboz, Les infractions en droit Suisse, vol. II, p. 304), the genocide must be established. It can be inferred from this statement that it is necessary and sufficient for the genocide to be recognised, without necessarily having been granted recognition by an international court or any other supranational body likely to be binding on the courts (an example might be a commission of historians with internationally acknowledged expertise). According to Trechsel (Stefan Trechsel, Kurzkommentar, ad Article 261 bis no. 35), in the context of genocide denial, German legal theory openly acknowledges the \u2018Auschwitz lie\u2019, but the denial of another genocide is also covered by Article 261 bis of the Criminal Code.",

The motion was approved on 16 December 2003. As noted earlier, the Armenian genocide served as a basis for the drafting of Article 261 bis of the Criminal Code (Comby report). The parliamentary motion was approved against the advice of the Federal Council, which apparently considered that the matter should be the preserve of historians. Yet it was this same Federal Council that expressly cited the Armenian genocide in its dispatch of 31 March 1999 on the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which was to serve as the basis of the current Article 264 of the Criminal Code criminalising genocide (Feuille f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [FF \u2013 Federal Gazette], 1999, pp. 4911 et seq.). The University of Lausanne has used the Armenian genocide as an example in a published work on humanitarian law. School history textbooks deal with the genocide of the Armenians. It may also be pointed out that the governments of Vaud and Geneva have recognised the Armenian genocide: on 5 July 2005 for the Canton of Vaud and on 25 June 1998 for the Republic and Canton of Geneva, whose President was Micheline Calmy-Rey, our current Minister for Foreign Affairs. This rapid overview enables the Court to conclude that the Armenian genocide is an established historical fact according to Swiss public opinion. The current position of the Federal Council, characterised by extreme caution when it is not inconsistent, changes absolutely nothing. It is easy to understand why a government prefers not to become involved in particularly sensitive issues. The international repercussions which this case has had are noteworthy.",

The appellant, who is aware of the widespread acceptance of this proposition, was merely seeking to make a political rather than a historical point, as he claimed, and it was not by chance that these statements were made at meetings to commemorate the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.

The Committee\u2019s French-language rapporteur, National Councillor Comby, explained that there was a discrepancy between the German and French versions, pointing out that the wording was obviously referring to any genocide and not only the Holocaust (BO/CN 1992 II 2675 et seq.). The National Council nevertheless adopted the Committee\u2019s proposal as it stood (BO/CN\u00a01992\u00a0II\u00a02676). Before the Council of States, the proposal by the latter\u2019s Legal Affairs Committee to maintain the wording of Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code approved by the National Council was set against a proposal by Mr K\u00fcchler, which did not, however, call into question the phrase \u2018or who on the same grounds denies, grossly trivialises or seeks to justify genocide or other crimes against humanity\u2019 (BO/CE [Official Gazette/Council of States] 1993 96; as to the scope of this proposal, see ATF 123 IV 202, point 3c, p. 208, and Poncet, ibid.). That proposal was adopted without any more detailed reference being made to denial of the Armenian genocide during the debate. During the elimination of divergences, the National Council\u2019s Legal Affairs Committee proposed, through Mr\u00a0Comby, that the amendments inserted by the Council of States be adopted, with the exception of the fourth paragraph, where the Committee proposed the wording \u2018a genocide\u2019, by way of reference to any that might occur. The French-language rapporteur observed that some people had mentioned massacres of Kurds or other populations, for example Armenians, and that all these genocides should be covered (BO/CN 1993 I 1075 et seq.). Further brief comments were made in relation to the definition of genocide and how a Turkish citizen might refer to the Armenian tragedy, and it was also observed that the Committee did not intend the provision to apply to one particular genocide alone but to all genocides, for example in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BO/CN 1993 I 1077; statement by Ms Grendelmeier). The National Council ultimately adopted the following wording of paragraph 4: \u2018[...] or any other means, violates the human dignity of a person or group of persons on the grounds of their race, ethnic origin or religion, or who on the same grounds denies, grossly trivialises or seeks to justify a genocide\u2019 (BO/CN 1993 I 1080). In the subsequent parliamentary proceedings, the Council of States maintained its position, adopting the wording \u2018a genocide\u2019 as a simple editorial amendment in the French version, and the National Council eventually endorsed the Council of States\u2019 decision, without any further reference being made to denial of the Armenian genocide (BO/CN\u00a01993 I 1300, 1451; BO/CE 1993 452, 579).",

In its case-law, however, the Federal Court has held that Holocaust denial objectively constitutes the factual element of the offence provided for in Article\u00a0261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code since it concerns a historical fact that is generally acknowledged as established (... ATF 129 IV 95, point 3.4.4, pp. 104 et seq.), although the judgment in question makes no reference to the historical intention of the legislature. Similarly, many authors have viewed the Holocaust as a matter of common knowledge for the criminal courts (Vest, Delikte gegen den \u00f6ffentlichen Frieden, note 93, p. 157), as an indisputable historical fact (Rom, op. cit., p. 140), or as a classification (\u2018genocide\u2019) that is beyond doubt (Niggli, Discrimination raciale, note 972, p. 259, who simply notes that this genocide was what prompted the introduction of the provision in question; to similar effect, see Guyaz, op. cit., p. 305). Only a few voices have referred to the intention of the legislature to recognise it as a historical fact (see, for example, Weder, Schweizerisches Strafgesetzbuch, Kommentar (ed. Donatsch), Z\u00fcrich, 2006, Article 261 bis \u00a7 4, p. 327; Chaix and Bertossa, op. cit., p. 184).",

The fact that Holocaust denial constitutes a criminal offence under Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code therefore stems less from the legislature\u2019s specific intention to outlaw negationism and revisionism when it formulated this rule of criminal law than from the observation that there is a very general consensus on this matter, to which the legislature undoubtedly had regard. Nor is there, accordingly, any reason to determine whether the legislature was guided by any such intention regarding the Armenian genocide (contrast Niggli, Rassendiskriminierung, 2nd ed., Z\u00fcrich, 2007, notes 1445 et\u00a0seq., pp. 447 et seq.). Indeed, it should be noted in this connection that, while certain aspects of the wording prompted fierce discussion among the members of parliament, the categorisation of the events of 1915 did not give rise to any debate in this context, and was ultimately mentioned by only two speakers in justifying the adoption of a French version of Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code that did not allow an excessively restrictive interpretation of the text, which did not follow from the German version.",

Hence there is no need for the courts to have recourse to the work of historians on this matter (Chaix and Bertossa, ibid.; unreported judgment\u00a06S.698/2001, point 2.1). As a further consequence, the basis thus determined for the criminalisation of Holocaust denial dictates the method which the courts must adopt in considering the denial of other genocides. The first question arising is therefore whether there is a comparable consensus regarding the events denied by the appellant.",

Thus, as well as relying on the existence of political recognition, this line of argument notes the existence in practice of a broad consensus within the community, which is reflected in the political declarations and is itself based on a wide academic consensus as to the classification of the events of 1915 as genocide. It may also be noted, in the same vein, that during the debate leading to the official recognition of the Armenian genocide by the National Council, reference was made to the international research published under the title Der V\u00f6lkermord an den Armeniern und die Shoah (BO/CN 2003 2017; statement by Mr Lang).

It follows that denial of the Armenian genocide \u2013 or the representation of the Armenian people as the aggressor, as put forward by the appellant \u2013 in itself constitutes a threat to the identity of the members of this community (Schleiminger, op. cit., Article 261 bis of the Criminal Code, note 65 and reference to Niggli). The Criminal Court, which found that there had been motives linked to racism, likewise ruled out that the approach pursued by the appellant pertained to historical debate. These findings of fact, about which the appellant raised no complaint (section 106(2) of the Federal Court Act), are binding on the Federal Court (section 105(1) of the Federal Court Act). They provide sufficient evidence of the existence of motives which, above and beyond nationalism, can only be viewed as racial, or ethnic, discrimination. It is consequently unnecessary in the present case to settle the debate among legal writers mentioned in point 6 above. In any event, the appellant has not raised any complaints concerning the application of federal law in relation to this matter.",

Furthermore, he was aware that genocide denial was a criminal offence and stated that he would never change his position, even if a neutral panel should one day conclude that the Armenian genocide did indeed take place (Criminal Court judgment, point II, p. 17). It can be inferred from these aspects that the appellant was not unaware that by describing the Armenian genocide as an \u2018international lie\u2019 and by explicitly denying that the events of 1915 amounted to genocide, he was liable to face a criminal penalty in Switzerland. The appellant cannot therefore draw any favourable inferences from the lack of foreseeability of the law he cites. These considerations, moreover, support the conclusion that the appellant is in essence seeking, by means of provocation, to have his assertions confirmed by the Swiss judicial authorities, to the detriment of the members of the Armenian community, for whom this question plays a central role in their identity. The applicant\u2019s conviction is thus intended to protect the human dignity of members of the Armenian community, who identify themselves through the memory of the 1915 genocide. Criminalisation of genocide denial is, lastly, a means of preventing genocides for the purposes of Article I of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, opened for signature in New York on 9\u00a0December 1948 and approved by the Federal Assembly on 9 March 2000 (RS\u00a00.311.11).",

Justification of such crimes, even with reference to the law of war or alleged security considerations, will in itself fall foul of Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code, so that even from this perspective, regardless of whether these same acts are characterised as genocide, the appellant\u2019s conviction on the basis of Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code does not appear arbitrary in its outcome, any more than it breaches federal law.\u201d",

In that letter he had denounced the assassination as a provocation by the United States of America against Turkey, and had invited the Patriarch to state openly that it had been instigated by the United States of America and thus, as a leader of the Armenians in Turkey, set an example to those defending the unity of the Turkish nation.

It described anonymous threats sent to Armenian schools in Istanbul in connection with the Armenian position in relation to the events of 1915 and the following years.

It noted that the CERD sought to resolve this conflict through the clause \u201cwith due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\u201d in its Article 4. The Swiss doctrine was largely of the view that these rights were of equal value and merited equal protection. The solution therefore lay in balancing them. Racial discrimination, being an attack on human dignity, violated the constitutional rights to personal liberty and equality before the law, and was prohibited under public international law. On the other hand, the rights to freedom of opinion and association were important for political debate in a democratic society and were not to be underestimated. While the essence of these rights were not affected by the proposed criminalisation of racial discrimination, they precluded the criminalisation of all types of speech envisaged by Article 4 of the CERD. In some cases this could lead to, for instance, unjustified restrictions on sociological or ethnological studies. The emphasis was therefore to be put on incitement to racial hatred and discrimination, and contempt and denigration, which were the main and truly blameworthy element of racial superiority theories that led to racial hatred and xenophobia. This Article made it possible to take account of fundamental freedoms when putting in place criminal law rules designed to ensure compliance with the CERD. The special place occupied by the rights to freedom of opinion and association in Western democracies in general and in Swiss semi-direct democracy in particular made resort to this possibility largely justified. It was therefore necessary to enter a reservation to Article\u00a04 of the CERD (see paragraph 63 below).",

Following the expiry of Mr Vaudroz\u2019s term of office, on 8 December 2003 the proposal was taken up by Mr Dominique de Buman. In support of the proposal, it was said that the extermination of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War had served as a reference point in the coining of the word \u201cgenocide\u201d by Raphael Lemkin, and that the rules laid down in the ensuing convention clearly corresponded to the process of destruction suffered by the Armenian people. By recognising it as genocide, Switzerland would render justice to the victims and the survivors and their descendants, prevent the commission of other crimes against humanity, and show its commitment to human rights, respect for minorities and international criminal justice. Reference was made to other bodies that had recognised these events as genocide, and the hope was expressed that the motion\u2019s adoption would contribute for the establishment of a durable peace between Turks and Armenians, which could only be based on a common vision that corresponded to the historical truth.",

It went on to say that, since this matter touched upon a painful historical episode, the efforts to come to terms with it had to be made chiefly by the countries concerned. Swiss foreign policy sought to achieve reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia through political dialogue, which had been established in 2000 and concerned in particular human rights. The motion\u2019s adoption risked prejudicing the regular official dialogue that had been established. The motion\u2019s sponsors intended that it would contribute to a durable peace between Turkey and Armenia by addressing a message of justice to the Armenian victims, but its acceptance could well have the opposite result and add to the emotional baggage that weighed down relations between those two countries.",

The prosecution must prove a definite causation between the act characterized as incitement, or provocation in this case, and a specific offence.

The Chamber further recalls that incitement may be direct, and nonetheless implicit. Thus, at the time the Convention on Genocide was being drafted, the Polish delegate observed that it was sufficient to play skilfully on mob psychology by casting suspicion on certain groups, by insinuating that they were responsible for economic or other difficulties in order to create an atmosphere favourable to the perpetration of the crime.",

This owing to the fact that the most important and established conducts, which had given rise to genocide and crimes against humanity, occurred during the period 1940-1945. However, the drafters recognised that, since then, other cases of genocide and crimes against humanity occurred, which were strongly motivated by theories and ideas of a racist and xenophobic nature. Therefore, the drafters considered it necessary not to limit the scope of this provision only to the crimes committed by the Nazi regime during the 2nd World War and established as such by the Nuremberg Tribunal, but also to genocides and crimes against humanity established by other international courts set up since 1945 by relevant international legal instruments (such as UN\u00a0Security Council Resolutions, multilateral treaties, etc.). Such courts may be, for instance, the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, for Rwanda, the Permanent International Criminal Court.

This situation has contributed to a gradual decline in the numbers of parents deciding to send their children to Armenian schools; some parents also reportedly avoid sending their children to Armenian schools because they are afraid that either they or their children will be threatened in consequence. ECRI notes that in 2008, a propaganda documentary entitled \u2018The Blonde Bride: The Truth behind the Armenian Issue\u2019 was distributed by the Ministry of National Education to all primary schools, along with a notice that it should be screened; the documentary showed bloody images of massacres and children were to write a composition about how they felt after watching it. While the Ministry of National Education eventually ceased distribution of the DVD following wide-scale complaints from parents, the DVDs were not collected from schools, and decisions whether or not to screen it were left to individual education authorities. ECRI is of the view that the dissemination and screening of such materials in schools runs directly counter to the objective of building a more open and tolerant society, and considers it especially regrettable that such material has been targeted at children.",

Spanish legislation refers generically to the denial of acts with the proven purpose of fully or partially eliminating an ethnic, racial or religious group. The perpetrator faces a sentence of one to two years\u2019 imprisonment. In France and Luxembourg, the legislation refers to denial of crimes against humanity, as defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, annexed to the London Agreement of 8 August 1945 ... This limitation of the substantive scope of the offence of denial of crimes against humanity is offset in Luxembourg by the fact that there is a special provision concerning denial of crimes of genocide. Denial of such crimes is punishable by the same sentences [imprisonment from eight days to six months and/or a fine ranging from 251 to 25,000 euros] as denial of crimes against humanity but the definition of genocide used for these purposes is that of the Luxembourg Law of 8 August 1985, which is general and abstract, not being limited to acts committed during the Second World War. The limited scope of the relevant provisions in France has been criticised and it should be noted in this connection that a Bill aimed at criminalising denial of the existence of the Armenian genocide was approved at its first reading by the National Assembly on\u00a012 October 2006. Accordingly, it appears that only Luxembourg and Spain criminalise denial of crimes of genocide in their legislation, generically and without restricting themselves to particular episodes in history. In addition, denial of crimes against humanity in general is not currently a criminal offence in any country.",

The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has referred to the criminal offence of exposing others to hatred or contempt, as provided for in the Canadian Human Rights Act, as a basis for condemning the content of a negationist website. The position of the judges in the United States is less settled, since that country affords extremely strict protection of freedom of expression, for historical and cultural reasons.

Norwegian law punishes anyone who makes an official statement that is discriminatory or hateful. This definition could conceivably apply to negationism. The Supreme Court has not yet had occasion to rule on this issue. In other countries, for example Denmark and Sweden, the trial courts have taken a position, having agreed to review whether the provisions of criminal law concerning discriminatory or hateful statements may be applied to cases of negationism, although they have not found them to be applicable in the cases before them. In Finland, the political authorities have expressed the view that such provisions are not applicable to negationism. Lastly, neither United Kingdom law nor Irish law deals with negationism.\u201d",

The court went on to say that incitement to genocide or racial or ethnic hatred were criminalised under other provisions of the Criminal Code, in line with Spain\u2019s international law obligations. Some other States, which had been particularly affected by the genocide committed under national-socialism, had also criminalised denial of the Holocaust. In reviewing whether Article 607 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code was compatible with the constitutional right to freedom of expression, the court sought to determine the exact way in which this Article was to be construed. It noted that it criminalised both denial and justification of genocide. In the court\u2019s view, denial was to be understood as maintaining that certain acts had not taken place or had not been carried out in such a way as to be classified as genocide, whereas justification did not entail denying outright the existence of a genocide but relativising it or denying that it was illegal, by identifying to some extent with its perpetrators. The salient question was whether these two forms of expression were \u201chate speech\u201d as outlined in this Court\u2019s case-law. Mere denial was not, for it could not in itself give rise to a climate of hostility towards a group that had been the victim of a genocide whose reality was disputed. It could therefore only be prohibited if it was in fact conducive to an attitude of hostility towards such a group \u2013 all the more because mere conclusions about the existence or otherwise of specific acts, not accompanied by value judgments about those acts or their illegality, fell also within the scope of academic freedom, which was constitutionally entitled to an even higher degree of protection. However, Article 607 \u00a7 2 did not contain such a limiting requirement. It thus outlawed conduct that did not constitute even a potential danger and could not therefore be constitutionally criminalised. Justification, on the other hand, being a value judgment, could in some cases be regarded as a means to indirectly incite to genocide. If it presented a genocide as right and thus incited to hatred towards a specific group, it could lead to a climate of hostility and violence, and was thus properly criminalised. Conduct that was disrespectful or degrading for a group of people could properly be outlawed.",

The applicant had not called into question the reality of the massacres and mass deportations, simply their legal characterisation, on which there was no international consensus. They were still the subject of a heated debate. This was evidenced by a declaration made by the United Kingdom Government about six months before the applicant\u2019s statements, and by a report provided to members of the United Kingdom Parliament in 2012. No mention was made of these events in the chapters on genocide in textbooks on public international law and international criminal law, and none of the commentaries on the Genocide Convention referred to these events as \u201cgenocide\u201d or gave them as an example of one. Against this background, any attempt to draw a parallel with the Holocaust was unconvincing. The element that made the legal characterisation of the events of 1915 and the following years such a controversial issue was precisely the presence or absence of the special intent to destroy required for mass killings to fall within the legal definition of genocide. No such intent had been established by a national or an international court, which was not the case for the Holocaust, in respect of which the International Military Tribunal had, albeit without using the term \u201cgenocide\u201d, found such intent.",

It has never been applied by the former Commission or the Court, and unbridled reliance on it to restrain the possibility for aliens to exercise their right to freedom of expression would run against the Court\u2019s rulings in cases in which aliens have been found entitled to exercise this right without any suggestion that it could be curtailed by reference to Article 16 (see Women On Waves and Others v.

The salient point for these courts had thus been not whether these events had indeed amounted to a genocide but whether Swiss society believed it to be so. This could perhaps be explained by the practical impossibility, noted by the doctrine, for domestic courts to decide in such cases whether historical events qualified as genocide within the meaning of international and domestic law. However, the problem with determining that point by reference to societal consensus, which could be a fast-changing thing, was that there were no legal criteria providing guidance in this respect. Such vagueness was incompatible with legal certainty. The fact that the Swiss Government and many other governments did not refer to the events of 1915 and the following years as \u201cgenocide\u201d, and that a number of historians had taken the view that they had not amounted to one, could have led the applicant to think that this issue was not yet settled in Switzerland. Being a doctor of laws, he conceived of \u201cgenocide\u201d as a strictly defined legal concept, and could not have foreseen that it would be determined by reference to mere societal consensus. The difference between the strict legal notion and the looser use of the word \u201cgenocide\u201d outside legal circles had been noted in the doctrine with reference to the atrocities that had taken place in Cambodia, Bosnia and Darfur. Reliance on societal consensus in that respect could enable politically active interest groups to widen the ambit of Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code by lobbying for parliamentary recognition of certain events as \u201cgenocides\u201d without regard for the legal definition of the term. The Swiss courts\u2019 approach thus meant that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression had not been prescribed \u201cby law\u201d but \u201cby public opinion\u201d.",

In view of this, and of the wording of Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code \u2013 seen in particular in the light of its drafting history (see paragraphs\u00a033-38 above and, mutatis mutandis, Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, \u00a7 62, Series A no. 130) \u2013 the Court finds that the applicant, despite his protestations to the contrary, could reasonably have foreseen that his statements in relation to these events might result in criminal liability under that provision. The fact that an earlier prosecution in relation to similar statements had resulted in an acquittal does not alter that, especially bearing in mind that the BerneLaupen District Court decided to give a judgment of acquittal because it found that the accused had not acted with a racist motive \u2013 a point that could vary from case to case depending on the person concerned and the exact content of his or her statements \u2013 while at the same time leaving open the question whether the events of 1915 and the following years could be regarded as \u201ca genocide\u201d for the purposes of Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 (see paragraph 44 above). The applicant could have found out about this by obtaining appropriate legal advice. It is true that in the absence of more ample case-law on that point, it was not entirely clear how the Swiss courts would go about determining whether these events had amounted to \u201ca genocide\u201d within the meaning of Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 in a subsequent case. However, these courts cannot be blamed for that state of affairs, which was by all appearances due to the fact that they had not often had the occasion to be confronted with acts such as that committed by the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Soros v. France, no. 50425/06, \u00a7 58, 6\u00a0October 2011). Their approach in the applicant\u2019s case could reasonably be expected, especially in view of the intervening adoption by the Swiss National Council of the motion recognising the events of 1915 and the following years as genocide (see paragraphs 48-50 above). This approach did not amount to a sudden and unforeseeable change in case-law (see, mutatis mutandis, Jorgic v. Germany, no. 74613/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a010913, ECHR 2007-III; contrast Pessino v.

In view of that, the Court accepts that the interference with the applicant\u2019s statements, in which he denied that the Armenians had suffered genocide, was intended to protect that identity, and thus the dignity of present-day Armenians.

Nor does it appear that he directed his accusation that the idea of the Armenian genocide was an \u201cinternational lie\u201d towards those persons or their descendants; the overall tenor of his statements shows that this accusation was rather aimed at the \u201cimperialists\u201d of \u201cEngland, France and Tsarist Russia\u201d and \u201cthe [United States of America] and [European Union]\u201d (see paragraph 13 above).

The Chamber also had regard to recent comparative-law developments and the position of the UN Human Rights Committee. On this basis, it expressed doubts that the applicant\u2019s conviction had been required by a pressing social need. It also took into account the severity of the penalty imposed on the applicant, and came to the conclusion that his criminal conviction and sentence had not been \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d for the protection of the honour and feelings of the descendants of the victims of the events of 1915 and the following years.",

The imposition of a criminal penalty on account of these statements had sought to stifle that debate and prevent the public from being presented with different interpretations of historical events, and had in effect created an official historiography of the suffering of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. This was antithetical to open debate and freedom of inquiry, which were essential in a democratic society. He had not denied the events as such, simply their characterisation as genocide within the meaning of that term in international law, in particular in view of the lack of proof of a specific intent on the part of the Ottoman government to destroy Armenians as a group. His contention found further support in the lack of retroactive application of the Genocide Convention and the fact that the events in issue had not been recognised as genocide by a competent court. This marked a distinction between his statements and statements denying the Holocaust, which bore on concrete historical facts, not just their categorisation. Moreover, the existence of the Holocaust had been clearly established by an international court on the basis of clear legal rules, such that the primary facts and their legal characterisation were now indistinguishable. This Court had in effect only countenanced the criminalisation of Holocaust denial on account of the anti-Semitic and antidemocratic intent of those who engaged in it. In view of the social climate in modern-day Europe, that denial was a unique phenomenon capable of rationalising a similar crime and representing a sign of racial hatred. By contrast, there was no history of persecution of the Armenians in Europe. In this connection, the applicant highlighted a number of features that in his view distinguished the Holocaust from the events of 1915 and the following years, and stated that it was one thing to recognise an event as genocide and quite another to outlaw the expression of different opinions on that.",

His statements had not been driven by racist motives, but by legal and historical considerations.

This point also flowed from Article 16 of the Convention, under which the High Contracting Parties could impose restrictions on the political activity of aliens. By holding that the applicant\u2019s statements qualified as political speech, the Chamber had prevented Switzerland from reacting to a political dispute over which it had no influence, even though the Swiss authorities could have a legitimate interest in ensuring application of the principle that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression carried with it duties and responsibilities.",

In upholding the lower courts\u2019 rulings on this point as not arbitrary, the Swiss Federal Court had chosen not to adjudicate on questions of history. In as much as the Chamber had found that the Swiss courts had erred by accepting the existence of such a general consensus, it had to be noted, firstly, that according to the Chamber the applicant had taken issue with the legal characterisation of the events but not with their actual taking place, and, secondly, that the events would come under Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 even if they were to be characterised as crimes against humanity rather than genocide.

In finding that the applicant had not expressed contempt for the victims of the events of 1915 and the following years, the Chamber had departed from the findings of fact of the domestic courts, acting as a court of fourth instance, and had assessed the statements in isolation, without putting them in their proper context.

The applicant\u2019s statements could not be equated with statements inciting violence, hostility or racial hatred towards the Armenians. Rejecting the legal characterisation of the events of 1915 and the following years was not an implicit attack on the dignity of the group or a continuation of the discriminatory treatment inflicted upon it at that time. The Swiss Government had not duly shown that this rejection had promoted racial discrimination towards the Armenian community in Switzerland, and there was no basis to infer automatically from it racist and nationalistic motives or an intention to discriminate. The main difference in this respect with statements relating to the Holocaust, whose denial today was one of the main vehicles of anti-Semitism, was the lack of connection between past and present hatred.",

This suggested that democratic societies saw no need to do so. The example of France in particular showed that there was a difference between official recognition of certain events as genocide and criminalisation of the denial that this was the case. The German government had also taken the position that such criminalisation was not appropriate. The position of the competent UN bodies was to the same effect. It had also to be borne in mind that statements similar to those of the applicant could lawfully be made in other countries and were widely available on the Internet and in historical and legal treatises that could lawfully be imported into Switzerland. Unlike the position in relation to the Holocaust in cases against Germany and Austria, it could not be said that the events of 1915 and the following years were part of Swiss historical experience. The mere presence of a community of about 5,000 Armenians on Swiss soil was not in itself sufficient in this respect, especially bearing in mind that these events had taken place almost one hundred years ago. It was also significant that the Swiss authorities had not tried to prevent the applicant from uttering his statements; it was difficult to see how there could exist a pressing social need to penalise them but not prevent them from being made. It had been disproportionate, and not required under Switzerland\u2019s international-law obligations, to impose criminal penalties in relation to these statements.",

Under the Court\u2019s case-law, laws against hate speech had to take account of whether the impugned statements were of a real public interest, which was not the case for the applicant. He was an incorrigible genocide denier who had not given any reasoning or scholarly validation in support of his crude and gratuitously offensive statements. The Chamber\u2019s conclusion that these statements \u2013 which had been no more than a racially motivated insult to Armenians and an invitation to Turks to believe them to be liars \u2013 had been of a historical, legal and political nature had been jejune in the extreme. The Swiss courts had therefore had the usual margin of appreciation to decide whether the statements could harm social harmony by infringing the dignity of the Armenians. The statements had not been part of a proper historical debate, and the Chamber\u2019s apparent suggestion that there could be no objective truth in historical research was nonsense, for the atrocities against the Armenians had been all too real. Distinguishing the Armenian genocide from the Holocaust on the basis that allegations made by Holocaust deniers sometimes concerned very precise facts, that the qualification of the Nazi crimes had had a well-defined legal basis, and that the existence of the Holocaust had been established by an international court, was invidious and attempted to set up the Holocaust as the only modern genocide capable of clear proof. Contrary to what had been suggested by the Chamber, genocidal intent was not difficult to prove when it was an obvious inference from the evidence or had been admitted by the perpetrators. The massacres and mass deportations of Armenians in 1915 and the following years had clearly amounted to genocide. By describing them as a mere \u201ctragedy\u201d, the Chamber had insulted all Armenians. In the same way that Holocaust denial was the main driver of anti-Semitism, denial of the Armenian genocide was the main driver of anti-Armenianism; this was how genocide denial worked. The Chamber\u2019s reliance on the position in Spain and France and the views of the UN Human Rights Committee had been erroneous, because these presented serious differences with Article 261 bis of the Criminal Code.",

Its denial likewise infringed that dignity; it affected not only history but memory, which was an integral aspect of the right to dignity. Outlawing denial was the only way to protect that right. Moreover, denial affected public order, at least in countries which, like France, were home to sizeable Armenian communities. This was demonstrated by the number of acts of vandalism and desecration, as well as insults and threats that Armenians became victim to, especially in localities where they lived alongside persons of Turkish origin, and on the Internet.

They also disputed the Chamber\u2019s finding that the applicant had only denied the legal characterisation of the events of 1915 and the following years, pointing out that the Lausanne District Police Court had found that he had attempted to justify the massacres and described the Armenians as \u201caggressors\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d, and that the Chamber had itself noted that he claimed to be a follower of Talaat Pasha. They also stated that the applicant had deliberately chosen the places where he had made his statements. However, the factor that was most telling of the applicant\u2019s racist motives was his leadership of the Talaat Pasha Committee, condemned by the European Parliament as \u201cxenophobic and racist\u201d. All of this had to be seen chiefly in the context of Turkey, not Switzerland, and its effect on the Armenian minority there. The applicant had been convicted in Turkey, in the so-called Ergenekon proceedings, inter alia, in connection with his activities in the Talaat Pasha Committee, which the Istanbul Assize Court had found established for the purpose of \u201crefuting the Armenian genocide allegations\u201d and part of a \u201cnationalist\u201d and \u201cchauvinist\u201d organisation that stirred up hatred and enmity among peoples.

This approach did not in its view provide a proper yardstick because it was somewhat specious to detach the historical reality of events from their legal characterisation. Moreover, it entailed the risk of creating a \u201chierarchy of genocides\u201d as the judicial recognition of a genocide depended on many historical factors. On the other hand, judicial recognition could not preclude further discussion about a genocide. A much better way to deal with this issue \u2013 and one that would avoid treating the Holocaust as a special case and yield much more predictable outcomes \u2013 was to focus on whether the statements in issue had been intended to incite to hatred or discrimination and find that their penalisation could be justified not because they amounted to the simple denial of a historical fact but because they were driven by such an intent, which was often at the heart of the denialist cause. This was demonstrated by the case-law relating to Holocaust denial, where such intent was almost irrebuttably presumed, and was the real basis for refusing such statements protection under the Convention. It was highly likely that such intent likewise underlay denials of the Armenian genocide, which were often prompted by a desire to rehabilitate the Ottoman regime of that period or justify the acts that took place.

A statement could only be considered legal or historical if it really contributed to the underlying debate, and could not hide under the cloak of political expression if it in fact amounted to hate speech. A contextual assessment was likewise necessary to assess whether a statement had destructive aims and called for the application of Article 17 of the Convention. The use of the word \u201clie\u201d was of special importance in this connection, because it impugned the integrity of the victims and their descendants, and attempted to redefine the events that they had experienced as something much less serious and turn them from victims into perpetrators ultimately responsible for their fate.",

The factors to be taken into account in this respect included the nature of the statement, seen in its proper context, which was not confined to its literal meaning or the purported profession of its author. What ultimately mattered was the meaning that could be ascribed to the statement, taken as a whole, by a reasonable member of the public. This flowed from the case-law of the German courts in such cases and the criteria laid down by the UN\u00a0Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. A statement could only benefit from the protection bestowed upon historical research if its author had acted in line with the methods of that research. As for virulent political statements, under the Court\u2019s case-law they appeared to be afforded a heightened degree of protection only if they concerned domestic controversies. In any event, hate speech could never benefit from the protection granted to political speech. This was confirmed by the criminalisation of hate speech in international and European law, which saw it as necessary in the fight for peace and justice and against discrimination, racism and xenophobia. The applicable international instruments did not differentiate in this respect between genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and left the States free to determine how these should be established. In particular, those instruments did not necessarily tie the possibility of outlawing the denial of such crimes to their being officially recognised by an international court, which was consonant with the principle of complementarity underlying the work of the International Criminal Court, under which it was in principle for the national courts to punish international crimes.",

In those cases the Commission was faced with statements, almost invariably emanating from persons professing Nazi-like views or linked with Nazi-inspired movements, that cast doubt on the reality of the persecution and extermination of millions of Jews under the Nazi regime; that claimed that the Holocaust was an \u201cunacceptable lie\u201d and a \u201cZionistic swindle\u201d, contrived as a means of political extortion; that denied or justified the existence of the concentration camps; or that claimed either that the gas chambers in those camps had never existed or that the number of persons killed in them was being highly exaggerated and was technically impossible. The Commission, frequently referring to the historical experience of the States concerned, described such statements as attacks on the Jewish community and intrinsically linked to Nazi ideology, which was antidemocratic and inimical to human rights. It regarded them as inciting to racial hatred, anti-Semitism and xenophobia, and was on that basis satisfied that the criminal convictions in respect of them had been \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. In some of those cases the Commission had relied on Article 17 as an aid in the interpretation of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, and used it to reinforce its conclusion on the necessity of the interference.",

Turkey (nos. 2668/07 and 4 others, 14 September 2010) the applicant, a prominent Turkish-Armenian writer and journalist who was later assassinated, had been convicted of denigrating \u201cTurkishness\u201d (T\u00fcrkl\u00fck), a criminal offence under Article 159 of the Turkish Criminal Code as then in force (superseded by Article 301 of the Turkish Criminal Code of 2005). Examining that conviction under Article 10 of the Convention, the Court noted that an examination of the articles in which Mr Dink had made the impugned statements showed clearly that his use of the term \u201cpoison\u201d denoted the \u201cperception of Turks\u201d among Armenians and the \u201cobsessive\u201d nature of the Armenian diaspora\u2019s campaign to secure recognition of the events of 1915 and the following years as genocide. Mr Dink had in effect asserted that this obsession, which meant that Armenians still viewed themselves as \u201cvictims\u201d, had poisoned the lives of members of the Armenian diaspora and had prevented them from developing their identity on a healthy basis. These assertions could not be regarded as hate speech (ibid., \u00a7 128).",

When expressing his resentment at attitudes which in his view amounted to denial of the incidents of 1915 and the following years, Mr Dink had conveyed his opinions on an issue of indisputable public concern in a democratic society. It was essential in such societies that debates surrounding historical events of a particularly serious nature should be able to take place freely. It was an integral part of freedom of expression to seek historical truth and it was not the Court\u2019s role to arbitrate on an underlying historical matter forming part of an ongoing public debate. Furthermore, Mr Dink\u2019s articles had not been gratuitously offensive or insulting, and had not fostered disrespect or hatred (ibid., \u00a7 135). There had therefore been no pressing social need to find him guilty of denigrating \u201cTurkishness\u201d.",

She was deported on two further occasions. In 1996 she brought proceedings seeking to have the re-entry ban lifted, but was unsuccessful. The Court noted, in particular, that Ms Cox\u2019s statements had concerned the Kurdish and Armenian questions, which were still the subject of \u201cheated debate, not only within Turkey but also in the international arena, with all those involved voicing their views and counter-views\u201d.

On the basis of the criminal investigations against Mr Ak\u00e7am and the stance of the Turkish courts on the Armenian issue in their application of that Article, as well as a public campaign against Mr Ak\u00e7am in connection with the investigations, the Court found that there existed a real risk that he could be prosecuted for \u201cunfavourable\u201d opinions on this matter (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 65-82). It went on to state that the terms used in that Article, as interpreted by the Turkish authorities, were too broad and vague, despite the safeguards put in place by the legislature.

The salient question is what relative weight should be ascribed to these two rights, which are in principle entitled to equal respect, in the specific circumstances of this case. It requires the Court to examine the comparative importance of the concrete aspects of the two rights that were at stake, the need to restrict, or to protect, each of them, and the proportionality between the means used and the aim sought to be achieved. The Court will do so by looking at the nature of the applicant\u2019s statements; the context in which the interference occurred; the extent to which they affected the Armenians\u2019 rights; the existence or lack of consensus among the High Contracting Parties on the need to resort to criminal-law sanctions in respect of such statements; the existence of any international-law rules bearing on this issue; the method employed by the Swiss courts to justify the applicant\u2019s conviction; and the severity of the interference.",

The Grand Chamber cannot accept this argument. Even though the applicant\u2019s statements touched upon historical and legal issues, the context in which they were made \u2013 at public events where the applicant was speaking to like-minded supporters \u2013 shows that he spoke as a politician, not as a historical or legal scholar.

While it cannot be excluded that statements relating to those events could likewise promote a racist and antidemocratic agenda, and do so through innuendo rather than directly, the context does not require this to be automatically presumed, and there is not enough evidence that this was so in the present case. The only element that could denote such an agenda was the applicant\u2019s self-professed affiliation with Talaat Pasha. However, the Swiss courts did not elaborate on this point, and there is no evidence that the applicant\u2019s membership of the so-called Talaat Pasha Committee was driven by a wish to vilify the Armenians and spread hatred for them rather than his desire to contest the idea that the events of 1915 and the following years had constituted genocide (see, mutatis mutandis, Lehideux and Isorni, cited above, \u00a7 53).",

There, the Court found a breach of Article 11 of the Convention in relation to the dissolution of a political party of which the applicant was then chairman. The Court found that the applicant\u2019s statements which had prompted the dissolution had contained an invitation to people of Kurdish origin to rally together and assert certain political claims, but no calls to use violence, rebel or otherwise reject democratic principles. They could not therefore have justified the dissolution. The second judgment, given pursuant to an application lodged in 1999, was Perin\u00e7ek v. Turkey (no.\u00a046669/99, 21 June 2005). There, the Court found that the applicant\u2019s criminal conviction in Turkey in relation to similar statements that could not be characterised as hate speech had not been necessary in a democratic society and had therefore given rise to a breach of Article 10 of the Convention.",

The Court notes that, as borne out by the Court\u2019s judgment in Varela Geis (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45-53) \u2013 which, incidentally, concerns the case that gave rise to the Spanish Constitutional Court judgment cited in paragraph 96 above \u2013 the two charges can be quite different. However, as already noted, the salient issue here is not the legal qualification given to the applicant\u2019s statements by the Swiss courts, but whether those statements could, when read as a whole and in their context, be seen as a call for violence, hatred or intolerance. The Court has already found that they cannot. It would here just add that, as explained by the Spanish Constitutional Court, genocide justification does not consist in assertions that a particular event did not constitute a genocide, but in statements which express a value judgment about it, relativising its gravity or presenting it as right (see paragraph 97 above). The Court does not consider that the applicant\u2019s statements could be regarded as bearing this meaning; nor could they be regarded as justifying any other crimes against humanity.",

The only such link may come from the presence of an Armenian community on Swiss soil, but it is a tenuous one. This is borne out by the Swiss Government\u2019s submissions, which clearly convey the idea that the controversy sparked by the applicant was external to Swiss political life, and, to an extent, by the judgment of the Lausanne District Police Court, which, in deciding to suspend part of the applicant\u2019s sentence, noted that he was a foreigner and would return to his country (see paragraph 22 above). There is moreover no evidence that at the time when the applicant made his statements the atmosphere in Switzerland was tense and could result in serious friction between Turks and Armenians there (contrast Zana, \u00a7\u00a7 57-60, and S\u00fcrek (no. 1), \u00a7 62, both cited above, which concerned the tense situation in south-east Turkey in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as Falakao\u011flu and Sayg\u0131l\u0131, \u00a7 33, and Sayg\u0131l\u0131 and Falakao\u011flu, \u00a7 28 in fine, both cited above, which concerned the publication of strongly worded declarations made at a time when clashes had taken place in several prisons in Turkey between security forces and detainees, resulting in deaths and injuries on both sides). Indeed, the earlier case in which a criminal prosecution had been brought under Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code in relation to such statements shows that while the Armenian and Turkish communities in Switzerland have expressed their strong disagreement about the legal characterisation of the events of 1915 and the following years, this has not resulted in consequences other than legal proceedings (see paragraphs 41-46 above). Nor could a failure to prosecute the applicant realistically have been perceived as a form of legitimation of his views on the part of the Swiss authorities (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Vona, cited above, \u00a7 71).",

For the Court, the answer must be in the negative. When convicting the applicant, the Swiss courts did not refer to the Turkish context. Nor did the Swiss Government in their observations. On the contrary, their attempt to justify the interference by reference to Article 16 of the Convention shows that they were chiefly concerned with their domestic political context.",

However, the broader concept of proportionality inherent in the phrase \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d requires a rational connection between the measures taken by the authorities and the aim that they sought to realise through these measures, in the sense that the measures were reasonably capable of producing the desired result (see, mutatis mutandis, Weber v.

However, it cannot accept that the applicant\u2019s statements in issue in this case were so wounding to the dignity of the Armenians who suffered and perished in these events and to the dignity and identity of their descendants as to require criminal-law measures in Switzerland. As already noted, the sting of the applicant\u2019s statements was not directed towards those persons but towards the \u201cimperialists\u201d whom he regarded as responsible for the atrocities. The parts of his statements that could in some way be seen as offensive for the Armenians were those in which he referred to them as \u201cinstruments\u201d of the \u201cimperialist powers\u201d and accused them of \u201ccarr[ying] out massacres of the Turks and Muslims\u201d. However, as can be seen from the overall tenor of the applicant\u2019s remarks, he did not draw from this the conclusion that they had deserved to be subjected to atrocities or annihilation; he rather accused the \u201cimperialists\u201d of stirring up violence between Turks and Armenians (see paragraphs 13 and 16 above). This, coupled with the amount of time that had elapsed since the events to which the applicant was referring, leads the Court to the conclusion that his statements cannot be seen as having the significantly upsetting effect sought to be attributed to them (see, mutatis mutandis, Vajnai, \u00a7 57; Orban and Others, \u00a7 52, Putistin, \u00a7 38; and Jel\u0161evar and Others, \u00a7 39, all cited above; as well as John Anthony Mizzi v.

The Court has already held, albeit in different circumstances, that statements that contest, even in virulent terms, the significance of historical events that carry a special sensitivity for a country and touch on its national identity cannot in themselves be regarded as seriously affecting their addressees (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 104-07). It has come to the same conclusion with respect to statements contesting the very identity of a national group (see Association of Citizens \u201cRadko\u201d and Paunkovski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 70-75). The Court would not exclude that there might exist circumstances in which, in view of the particular context, statements relating to traumatic historical events could result in significant damage for the dignity of groups affected by such events: for instance, if they are particularly virulent and disseminated in a form that is impossible to ignore. The Court notes in this connection that in Vejdeland and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 56-57), where virulently homophobic leaflets had been left in students\u2019 lockers at an upper secondary school, in finding no breach of Article 10 of the Convention it attached particular significance to the fact that the leaflets had been imposed on persons who were \u201cat an impressionable and sensitive age\u201d and who had no possibility not to accept them. But it cannot be said that there were such circumstances in the present case. The only cases in which the former Commission and the Court have accepted the opposite without specific evidence were those relating to Holocaust denial. But, as already noted, this can be regarded as stemming from the very particular context in which those cases unfolded, which has caused the former Commission and the Court to accept that Holocaust denial, even if dressed up as impartial historical research, must invariably be seen as connoting an antidemocratic ideology and anti-Semitism (see paragraphs 234 and 243 above), and must thus, at this stage, be regarded as particularly upsetting for the persons concerned.",

The Protocol has to date only been ratified by twenty-four out of the forty-seven member States of the Council of Europe, and three of those have availed themselves of the possibility not to apply Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see paragraph 74 above).

These concerns demonstrated that in applying that provision in individual cases the Swiss courts needed to weigh the countervailing interests carefully. Indeed, an interference with the right to freedom of expression that takes the form of a criminal conviction inevitably requires detailed judicial assessment of the specific conduct sought to be punished. In this type of case, it is normally not sufficient that the interference was imposed because its subject matter fell within a particular category or was caught by a legal rule formulated in general terms; what is rather required is that it was necessary in the specific circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, The Sunday Times, cited above, \u00a7 65 in fine).",

This insurmountable difficulty is amply illustrated by the decisions of the Swiss courts. While international law and Swiss national law provide a clear definition of \u201cgenocide\u201d (see paragraphs 47 and 52-54 of the judgment) on which the courts can rely, they struggle to determine which methodology to use in order to reach a decision on the legal characterisation of an event dating so far back in history (reference to scientific literature, to political statements by State bodies and international institutions, and so on \u2013 see paragraphs 22-26 of the present judgment). They are confronted with the problem that there is neither a judgment of an international court nor unanimity in the debate at national and international level, be it among academics or politicians.

This is the relevant difference between the present case and the cases involving Holocaust denial, where the limits of historical debate were clearly defined on the basis of national legislation and where the courts could therefore take the legal characterisation of the Holocaust as \u201cgenocide\u201d as the starting-point for their assessment of criminal responsibility.

That the massacres and deportations suffered by the Armenian people constituted genocide is \u201cself-evident\u201d. The Armenian genocide is a clearly established historical fact. To deny it is to deny the obvious. But that is not the question here. The case is not about the historical truth, or the legal characterisation of the events of 1915.

Applying in turn the various requirements of Article 10 of the Convention, we have no difficulty in finding that there was an interference and that it was lawful. In its decision of 9 March 2007, the Lausanne District Police Court found that the applicant had denied the Armenian genocide by justifying the massacres. The Federal Court, in its judgment of 12 December 2007, dealt at length with the mens rea of the offence (motives of racial discrimination \u2013 points 5.1 and 5.2), concluding that the findings of fact \u201cprovide sufficient evidence of the existence of motives which, above and beyond nationalism, can only be viewed as racial, or ethnic, discrimination\u201d. The applicant was prosecuted under Article 261 bis of the Criminal Code, a provision that does not in itself raise any issues in terms of its content and its legitimacy in relation to the values safeguarded by the Convention. The courts examined the facts and assessed the applicant\u2019s statements. The applicant was aware that making the offending statements rendered him liable to punishment under Article 261 bis of the Code.

In our opinion, a legislature is perfectly entitled to criminalise statements such as those made by the applicant.

An illustration of this is the oft-cited decision of the Commission in Glimmerveen and Hagenbeek v. the Netherlands (nos. 8348/78 and 8406/78, Commission decision of 11 October 1979, Decisions and Reports (DR) 18, p. 187). The applicants were proponents of strongly racist views, with a political programme which the Commission considered contrary to the text and spirit of the Convention, and which would contribute to the destruction of human rights. By reason of Article 17, the applicants could not claim the protection of Article 10. The same approach has been taken by the Court in certain cases, notably Norwood v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 23131/03, ECHR 2004-XI). Garaudy v. France ((dec.), no. 65831/01, ECHR 2003-IX) is another example of this approach, where the analysis ends with the finding that Article 17 applies, and the complaint under Article 10 is rejected as inadmissible ratione materiae. This approach remains current, as is shown by recent case-law (for example, Kasymakhunov and Saybatalov v. Russia, nos. 26261/05 and 26377/06, 14\u00a0March 2013). It is worth noting that the Kasymakhunov and Saybatalov case can be seen as a response to the criticism that once Article 17 enters the scene, it signals the absence of any proper legal analysis. The Court set out its assessment of the applicants\u2019 political views (those of the fundamentalist group Hizb ut-Tahrir) in some detail, giving its reasons for withdrawing the protection of Articles 9, 10 and 11 through the application of Article 17.",

Germany, no.\u00a012194/86, Commission decision of 12 May 1988, DR 56, p. 205).

The applicant in that case had been convicted of condoning terrorism because of a cartoon that he had drawn based on the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and published two days later. Following his conviction for condoning terrorism, he complained under Article 10 of the Convention. The Court was not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the case should be considered beyond the scope of Article 10 \u2013 in essence, it distinguished it from the more typical Article 17 cases already referred to, where the hateful, injurious intent of the person had been unequivocal.

This can be seen in Soulas and Others v. France (no. 15948/03, 10 July 2008) and also F\u00e9ret v. Belgium (no. 15615/07, 16 July 2009). Both cases involved restrictions on racist, Islamophobic speech that the Court ultimately held to be justified.

There is more than one tool in the box, to be used as the need is seen to arise in an individual case. I think it can also be said that the Court has made rather sparing use of Article 17. Outside of what are recognised as the most egregious and odious forms of hate speech, the Court tends to find the answer to complaints of restrictions on freedom of expression within the boundaries of Article 10. In the present case the Court has found that the question whether Article 17 is to be applied must be joined to the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 10 of the Convention, taking as the decisive point under Article 17 whether the applicant\u2019s statements sought to stir up hatred or violence. To my mind racist speech and genocide denial, combined with the intent to insult others or make others suffer, may as such be characterised as an activity aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention, within the meaning of Article 17. This was the position of the Court in Hizb ut-Tahrir and Others v. Germany ((dec.), no.\u00a031098/08, \u00a7 72, 12 June 2012). The Court has held, in particular, that a \u201cremark directed against the Convention\u2019s underlying values\u201d is removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17 (see Lehideux and Isorni v. France, 23\u00a0September 1998, \u00a7 53, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, and Garaudy, cited above). Thus, in Garaudy, which concerned, in particular, the conviction for denial of crimes against humanity of the author of a book that systematically denied such crimes perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jewish community, the Court found the applicant\u2019s Article 10 complaint incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention.",

However, the specific procedural position of the Grand Chamber was that the Article 10 complaint had already been declared admissible by the Chamber. The application of Article 17 could therefore not have led to the inadmissibility of the Article 10 complaint. In that context I would have preferred an approach involving the application of Article 17 on the merits, before entering the domain of Article 10. Only after dealing with Article 17 on the merits should the Court in my view have adopted the subsidiary approach of applying Article 17 as a guiding principle for the interpretation of Article 10 at the \u201cnecessity\u201d stage of Article 10 \u00a7 2.",
