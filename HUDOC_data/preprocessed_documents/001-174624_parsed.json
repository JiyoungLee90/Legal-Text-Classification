Judge D.P. did not have any family ties with the applicant\u2019s opponent in the civil proceedings. Nor had he at any point during the proceedings represented the applicant\u2019s opponent as a lawyer (see, a contrario, Wettstein v.

Judge D.P. was the father of N.P., who was a trainee lawyer in the law firm of the lawyers V.Lj. and Z.V. who represented M.R. in the civil proceedings, but N.P. had not been involved in the case in any manner. Thus, N.P. had not at any point during the proceedings represented M.R., nor had he in any way worked on the case.",

It seems rather theoretical and far-fetched to say that Judge D.P., in the processing or adjudication of the civil dispute, would have been influenced by the fact that his son was a trainee lawyer in the firm of lawyers representing the applicant\u2019s opponent in the civil proceedings, and I find it difficult to say that the applicant\u2019s fears in this regard are objectively justified.",

When the Supreme Court decided the applicant\u2019s case on 14 September 2011 (see paragraph 10 of the judgment), it emphasised the fact that the trainee lawyer \u201cdid not participate in any manner in the proceedings at issue\u201d. Thus, the fact that the judge\u2019s son was a trainee lawyer in the law firm representing the applicant\u2019s opponent in the civil proceedings was not in itself sufficient to call into question the impartiality of the judge. A few years earlier, on 27 September 2005, the Supreme Court had adopted a decision (see paragraph 19 of the judgment) that may be read as being in contradiction with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the applicant\u2019s case. However, only a few months before the decision in the applicant\u2019s case, on\u00a011 June 2009, the Supreme Court had adopted a decision in which it emphasised the fact that the trainee lawyer had represented the other party to the proceedings, or in other words, that the trainee lawyer had participated in the proceedings (see paragraph 21 of the judgment). Therefore, the practice of the Supreme Court, to the extent that there may be any inconsistency, does not amount to a situation where a failure to comply with domestic requirements is sufficient to call into question the impartiality of a judge (see, for example, Pfeifer and Plankl v. Austria, 25 February 1992, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 227; Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), 23 May 1991, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 204; and Me\u017enari\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 27).",
