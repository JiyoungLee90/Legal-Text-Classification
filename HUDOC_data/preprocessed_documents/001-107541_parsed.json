On the basis of the ICTY\u2019s statement, the court found that the published assertions had not been true and, in particular, that the applicant had not been interested in their veracity. The court refused to hear the author of the article, considering it unnecessary in the light of the information provided by the ICTY. It considered that the applicant\u2019s proposal that the author be heard was also aimed at delaying the proceedings as the applicant did not know his exact address. In any event, the author had not mentioned in his text the number of the case file, dates or any other data which would in a convincing manner support the veracity of the information. The court held that the applicant should not have allowed the publishing of untrue information, as it represented a misuse of freedom of expression, and that he should have attempted to check its accuracy first instead of trusting his correspondent unreservedly. The court further held that personal beliefs and convictions could not justify the publishing of such information and concluded that the assertions in question had harmed the honour and the reputation of the plaintiff.",

He submitted that the information was of particular importance to the public and proposed additional evidence, namely that the court hear a colleague of his as an additional witness, as he was present when the fax with the impugned information was received and whom he consulted on whether to publish the information or not, as well as to see a documentary film broadcast in 2004 by the same media outlet whose editor-in-chief in the early 1990s had been the plaintiff himself, and which allegedly contained an unfavourable reference to the plaintiff and his work at the time.

In so doing, it endorsed the reasoning of the Court of First Instance, adding that the applicant should have focused on the accuracy of the information in question rather than having it published as soon as possible. The court took the view that the veracity of the assertions could not be established by the applicant consulting the article\u2019s author or another colleague but only by reliable evidence, which was lacking in this case. It further held that, according to the legislation in force at the time the article was published, the editor-in-chief, inter alia, could also be held responsible for publishing untrue information (see paragraph 32 below).

Such a situation continued until an unspecified date in 2010, with the majority of decisions not having been made public even afterwards. As the applicant had filed his application with the Court before any decision of the Constitutional Court was published and because the issue of whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is normally determined by reference to the date when the application was lodged, the Court considers that the applicant was not obliged to exhaust this particular avenue of redress before turning to Strasbourg (see, mutatis mutandis, Vin\u010di\u0107 and Others v. Serbia, no. 44698/06 et seq. \u00a7 51, 1\u00a0December 2009, as well as Cvetkovi\u0107 v. Serbia, no. 17271/04, \u00a7 41, 10\u00a0June 2008). Therefore, the Government\u2019s objection in this regard must be dismissed. The Court might in future cases reconsider its view if the Government demonstrate, with reference to concrete published decisions, the efficacy of the remedy, with the consequence that applicants may be required first to exhaust that remedy before making an application to the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013378/05, \u00a7\u00a7 43-44, 29 April 2008).",

The Court does not consider that section 198 of the Obligations Act, invoked by the applicant (see paragraph 30 above), was applicable in the present case, as it concerned compensation for pecuniary damage. The Court further accepts that the impugned judgment was adopted in pursuit of a legitimate aim, namely \u201cfor the protection of the reputation\u201d of another. What remains to be resolved, therefore, is whether the interference was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",

It must therefore be examined whether there were any special grounds in the particular circumstances of the present case for requiring the applicant as the editor-in-chief of the magazine to verify whether the information, which was allegedly defamatory of the plaintiff, had a basis in fact. The Court notes in this connection that the information amounted to a serious accusation against the plaintiff, the more so given the sensitivity of the regional context at the material time. On that account, the Court considers that particular diligence was required before transmitting the information to the public. Furthermore, the situation must be examined as it presented itself to the applicant at the material time, rather than with the benefit of hindsight on the basis of the information contained in the ICTY letter obtained in the course of the domestic proceedings a long time thereafter (see paragraph 9 above, see also Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.

The domestic courts themselves established only in 2002 that the information was untrue, namely six years and seven months after the domestic proceedings had been instituted. However, it is unclear whether this was due to the domestic courts\u2019 inactivity in this regard or because it had been impossible to establish the veracity of the information earlier.",

The Court is aware that news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest (see, inter alia, Bozhkov v. , no. 3316/04, \u00a7 48, 19 April 2011, and the authorities cited therein). However, in the present case, the article was not published in a daily newspaper, but in a weekly magazine, which gave the applicant more time for double-checking. In addition, the applicant\u2019s statement made during the domestic proceedings clearly implies that he was not concerned with verifying the truth or reliability of the information before publishing it (see paragraph 10 above).",

It is significant that at all times the applicant maintained that he had confidence in the professionalism of the magazine\u2019s special correspondent and, on that account, requested the domestic courts to hear the special correspondent. The courts refused to do so (see paragraphs 11 and 49 above). The applicant was thus denied an opportunity to attempt to clarify the situation. The Court recalls that it is not, in principle, incompatible with Article 10 to place on the defendant in libel proceedings the burden of proving to the civil standard the truth of defamatory statements. However, this is subject to the proviso that the defendant must be allowed a realistic opportunity to do so (see Kasabova v. Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 58 in limine, and the relevant autorities cited therein).",

However, the Court does not consider it necessary to take a firm stance on these matters, because it is in any event of the view that the damages awarded against the applicant were disproportionate (see, mutatis mutandis, Kasabova v. , cited above, \u00a7 68).",

However, there is no information in the case file that he was also working at the time when the domestic judgments were rendered. In any event, the Court considers that the damages and costs he was ordered to pay to the plaintiff were very substantial even when compared to the highest incomes in the respondent State in general (see paragraph 21 above, see also, mutatis mutandis, Sorgu\u00e7 v.
