The decisions taken by administrative or other authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 must be subject to subsequent control by a \u201cjudicial body that has full jurisdiction\u201d, including the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the challenged decision (see Bistrovi\u0107 v.

Both the Commission and the Court have acknowledged in their case-law that the requirement that a court or tribunal should have \u201cfull jurisdiction\u201d (\u201cpleine juridiction\u201d in French) will be satisfied where it is found that the judicial body in question has exercised \u201csufficient jurisdiction\u201d or provided \u201csufficient review\u201d in the proceedings before it (see Fazia Ali v. the United Kingdom, no. 40378/10, \u00a7 76, 20\u00a0October 2015, and cases cited therein).

However, without taking any further action in that respect such as by allowing him to question the witnesses or to put the relevant doubts before the same experts or commissioning another expert report, the Ministry ignored his specific complaints and the Administrative Court endorsed such conduct of the Ministry, considering the applicant\u2019s specific complaints to be irrelevant for reaching a decision on his request for family disability benefit (see paragraphs 16-19 above).

This holding deserves, in my opinion, some qualification. Article 6 \u00a7 1 applies only to the judicial stages of the proceedings. Where the Court in its case-law refers to the proceedings \u201cas a whole\u201d, it generally refers to the judicial proceedings as a whole, and in particular to the possibility that later stages in the proceedings may have remedied the shortcomings in earlier stages (see the cases referred to in paragraph 55 of the judgment: Feldbrugge, cited above, \u00a7 46 (shortcoming not cured); and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, \u00a7 52, Series\u00a0A no. 263 (shortcoming cured)). It is true that Article 6 \u00a7 1 may be relevant before a case reaches the judicial stage of the proceedings if and in so far as the fairness of the trial before the court is likely to be seriously prejudiced by a shortcoming during the administrative stage (compare, with respect to the pre-trial stage and the trial stage in criminal proceedings, Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 275, and Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2008).
