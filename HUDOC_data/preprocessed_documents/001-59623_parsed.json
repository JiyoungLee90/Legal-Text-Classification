The applicant association also pointed out that, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, a judge could be a Freemason without this casting doubt on his or her objective impartiality (see Kiiskinen v. Finland (dec.), no.\u00a026323/95, ECHR 1999-V). Additionally, the debate which had taken place in Parliament after the enactment of the 1996 Law had shown the unreasonable nature of the measure in question.

Consequently, the damage which the applicant association may suffer is likewise limited. The Court considers, however, that freedom of association is of such importance that it cannot be restricted in any way, even in respect of a candidate for public office, so long as the person concerned does not himself commit any reprehensible act by reason of his membership of the association. It is also clear that the association will suffer the consequences of its members\u2019 decisions.

The concept of lawfulness used in the Convention, apart from positing conformity with domestic law, also implies qualitative requirements in the domestic law such as foreseeability and, generally, an absence of arbitrariness (see Rekv\u00e9nyi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, \u00a7 59, ECHR 1999-III).",

In the present case, however, the applicant association could not challenge the constitutionality of the impugned provision in the courts, a fact which was not disputed by the Government. That being so, the Court concludes that the legal position was sufficiently clear to enable the applicant association to regulate its conduct and that the requirement of foreseeability was consequently satisfied. The contested restriction was therefore \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 11 \u00a7 2.",

According to the Court\u2019s case-law, \u201cthe notion of \u2018administration of the State\u2019 should be interpreted narrowly, in the light of the post held by the official concerned\u201d (see Vogt v. Germany, judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, p. 31, \u00a7 67). The Court reiterates that in Vogt it did not consider it necessary to determine the issue whether a teacher \u2013 a permanent civil servant \u2013 was part of the administration of the State (ibid., p. 31, \u00a7 68). In the present case it notes on the basis of the evidence before it that the link between the offices referred to in Schedules A and B to the 1996 Law and the Marches Region is undoubtedly looser than the link which existed between Mrs Vogt, a permanent teacher, and her employer.",
