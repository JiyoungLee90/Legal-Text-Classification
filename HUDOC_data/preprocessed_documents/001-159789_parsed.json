In this connection, in the above-cited Varnava and Others judgment the Court noted that where the lack of progress or ineffectiveness of an investigation was readily apparent, the requirements of expedition might require an applicant to bring such a case before the Court within a matter of months, or at most, depending on the circumstances, a very few years after the events in question. This is particularly pertinent in cases of unlawful death, where there is generally a precise point in time at which the death is known to have occurred and some basic facts are in the public domain; thus, the lack of progress or ineffectiveness of an investigation will generally be more readily apparent (see Varnava and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0162).",

It cannot be the case that any assertion or allegation can trigger a fresh investigative obligation under Article 2 of the Convention.

As to the present case, the Court notes that in May 2010 the body of J.T. was finally identified. This certainly amounted to important fresh evidence. Further, the Court notes that in July 2010 the \u0160ibenik-Knin Criminal Police Department submitted a list of missing persons to the Knin Police Station, together with a request for an inquiry into their disappearance and for interviews to be conducted with their families and neighbours; J.T. was listed as one of those missing persons (see paragraph\u00a022 above).",

The scope of the fresh obligation to investigate will vary according to the nature of the purported new evidence or information. It may be restricted to verifying the reliability of the new evidence. The authorities can legitimately take into account the prospects of launching a new prosecution at such a late stage. Due to the lapse of time, the level of urgency may have diminished; the immediacy of required investigative steps in the aftermath of an incident is likely to be absent (e.g. Brecknell, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 79-81). The standard of expedition in such historical cases is much different from the standard applicable in recent incidents where time is often of the essence in preserving vital evidence at a scene and questioning witnesses when their memories are fresh and detailed (see Pali\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no.\u00a04704/04, \u00a7 70, 15 February 2011 concerning complex post-conflict situations; Emin and Others v.

However, only in 2007 \u2013 when the applicants addressed the State Attorney\u2019s Office with their claim for damages against the State \u2013 did the authorities learn that the applicants deemed that his death might have been the result of a criminal offence. The police opened an inquiry, but given that almost twelve years had elapsed, the prospect of establishing the truth had significantly diminished. Furthermore, it appears that J.T. was killed during the shelling of Knin in August 1995 by the Croatian army and that the majority of persons who remained in Knin had been hiding in shelters such as basements of buildings, as had the applicants. According to the statement of the applicants\u2019 neighbour I.M., J.T. had come to the shelter in the basement of their building only on occasions. Given these circumstances, it appears that there were no direct eyewitnesses to the killing of J.T.",

The Court notes that the police pursued every line of enquiry (contrast to Charalambous and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no. 46744/07, \u00a7 65, 3 April 2012). The applicants have not pointed to any other concrete avenues of enquiry that the police could have pursued. The fact that the investigation did not succeed in identifying the perpetrators of J.T.\u2019s death does not necessarily mean that the investigation was ineffective.
