The court allowed the claim in part and awarded compensation to the applicant in the amount of about 500 euros (EUR) for his detention in Pazardzhik Prison between 4\u00a0November 2013 and 24 April 2018. The court referred to the Court\u2019s pilot judgment in the case of Neshkov and Others v. Bulgaria (nos. 36925/10 and 5 others, 27 January 2015), observing that any assessment of the conditions of detention had to be made by examining their cumulative effects on the detainee. The court also explicitly held that, according to the Court\u2019s caselaw, the mere fact of placing a detainee in inadequate conditions was presumed to cause him or her non-pecuniary damage even in the absence of specific evidence about the negative emotions experienced. The court then acknowledged that the absence of running water and lack of ready access to a toilet must have exposed the applicant to a level of suffering beyond what was normal in detention. In particular, the fact that he had been dependent on the availability and goodwill of a prison guard to let him out of his cell so that he could use the toilet was in itself demeaning.",

The court concluded that, in the light of the witness statements and written evidence, it could not be proven that the applicant had asked the prison administration whether he could participate in either work or further studies. Furthermore, he had had the possibility of choosing a book from among those brought to his cell once a week, and a psychologist had been working with him.

The prisoner had not shown that he had approached the prison administration with his request prior to bringing his case to court. In addition, the request could not be granted because of the characteristics of the \u201cspecial regime\u201d under which he was serving his sentence, which required cells to remain permanently locked and security to be high, and which did not include the possibility to walk in the corridor. Finally, allowing the prisoner to leave his cell would be wrong because of the numerous disciplinary offences which he had committed, most of which had been violence-related. The court added that, in any event, the prisoner had the ability to do regular physical exercise twice a day (see \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u2116\u00a02135 \u043e\u0442 8.05.2018\u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 972/2018 \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0441\u044a\u0434 \u0411\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0441).",

The prison governor must then issue a reasoned order, based on reports prepared for that purpose by the relevant prison authorities. A decision refusing to change the regime to the lighter one can be challenged by the prisoner in the administrative court within fourteen days of the order being served on him or her. The decision of that court is final.

In doing so, the court referred, among other things, to the fact that under the \u201cspecial regime\u201d, walks in the corridor were not permitted and cells had to be permanently locked (see paragraph 30 above).

Bulgaria, no.\u00a04374/05, \u00a7 53, 10 March 2015, with further references). Significantly, the applicant\u2019s related complaints were examined by the domestic courts following amendment of the relevant legal provisions, which were meant to address the deficiencies in the regulatory framework flagged by the Court in similar earlier cases. Despite the newly clarified parameters of the meaning of inhuman and degrading treatment in section 3 of the 2009 Act, however, it cannot be said that requisite judicial attention was paid to the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning the lack of purposeful activities and almost complete isolation, and to their effects on his mental and physical well-being. The Court concludes in the circumstances that, on the basis of the characteristics of the special regime as established in its earlier case-law (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, among many others) and the fact that the applicant had been serving his sentence under the \u201cspecial regime\u201d, he was held in prolonged isolation and in the absence of purposeful activities during the period in question.",

In the present case, the Court observes that the amount awarded to the applicant in May 2018, namely EUR 500 for inadequate conditions of detention for a period of just under four and a half years (see paragraph 10 above), is several times lower than what the Court would have awarded in similar cases (contrast Neshkov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 300-02, 27\u00a0January 2015, in addition to Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0296).",

Taking into account the cumulative effect of the conditions in which the applicant had been held in Pazardzhik Prison between 4 November 2013 and 24 January 2019 (the latter date being when the final judgment in respect of his claim for damages was delivered), and the fact that he has not received adequate redress, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.",
