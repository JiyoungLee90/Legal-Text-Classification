In particular, in C.G. and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04247), the Court found, first, that the national courts had allowed the executive to stretch the notion of national security beyond its natural meaning and, second, that those courts had not examined whether the executive had been able to demonstrate the existence of specific facts serving as a basis for its assessment that the first applicant presented a national security risk. The Court found, in addition, that the domestic courts had applied a formalistic approach and had left a governmental agency full and uncontrolled discretion to certify, with reference to little more than its own general statements, that an alien was a threat to national security and had to be expelled. As such \u201ccertifications\u201d were considered to be beyond any meaningful judicial scrutiny, there was thus no safeguard against arbitrariness (see also Kaushal and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 28-32, and M. and Others, \u00a7\u00a098, both cited above; also Amie and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 58149/08, \u00a7\u00a098, 12 February 2013).",

The expulsion order against the first applicant was based on statements declaring him to be a member of an international criminal group, involved in extortion, money laundering, smuggling, drug trafficking and other criminal activities, and therefore representing a national security threat (see paragraph\u00a07 above). However, the document containing these statements, proposal no.\u00a0B848, referred to no evidence on which those declaratory statements were based. In addition, it has not been alleged that the first applicant was ever charged with related offences by the Bulgarian authorities. Thus, the expulsion order appeared to be based on a purely internal assessment by the National Security Service, made on the basis of undisclosed evidence.",

Secondly, the courts had not assessed whether the interference with the applicants\u2019 rights met a pressing social need and was proportionate to any legitimate aim pursued (see C.G. and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 59-64, M. and Others, \u00a7 125, both cited above; also Madah and Others v.

It also observes that the Supreme Administrative Court failed to conduct any meaningful analysis on the question of proportionality, merely stating that any restriction of fundamental rights was acceptable as long as it was justified on grounds related to national security (see paragraph 9 above). It follows that the judicial review proceedings in the present case did not secure to the applicants the effective domestic remedy which Article\u00a013 requires in respect of their complaints regarding breach of their right to family life (see M. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 125).
