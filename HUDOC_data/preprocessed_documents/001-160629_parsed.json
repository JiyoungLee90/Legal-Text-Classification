Therefore, it does not follow clearly from the judgment that no time-limit is applicable in the view of the Constitutional Court. On the contrary, the judgment can equally be read as confirming the Constitutional Court\u2019s earlier case-law, in a judgment of 16 November 2004 (paragraph 24 of the judgment), according to which applicants who had been prevented on objectively justified grounds from lodging a request to purchase State-owned flats that they occupied could not have been required to lodge such a request as long as those obstacles existed.

In other words, holders of a specially protected tenancy, who for unknown reasons had not submitted a request to purchase their flat before the end of 1995, may now, with reference to the Court\u2019s interpretation of domestic legislation, lodge a request to buy their State-owned flat more than 30 years after the adoption of the 1995 Act, thereby allowing individuals to speculate on the development of the market value of real estate to the detriment of the State and tax-payers. The applicant was 79 years old when she, in 2006, decided to request to buy the flat in which she had been living since 1961, and today she is 89 years old.
