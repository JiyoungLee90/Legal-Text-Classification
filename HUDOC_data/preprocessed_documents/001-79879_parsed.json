The lawyer had been a member of an independent and self-governing professional association, which adopted its own rules of conduct and disciplinary regulations. The public authorities had not had powers to exercise any direct control over the methods of the lawyers' work and could not impose on a legal aid lawyer an obligation to draw up a cassation appeal.",

Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a044-46) and somewhat complicated, so that when one lawyer refuses to provide legal representation it does not seem possible to have another appointed speedily. In the event of refusal to prepare a cassation appeal, this would make it impossible for the new lawyer to submit such an appeal within the prescribed time-limit (see the submissions by the Polish Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, paragraph 117). Moreover, the applicants in the present case were informed by the Bar that, where an ex officio lawyer found no grounds on which to lodge a cassation appeal, the Bar Association would not appoint another lawyer for that purpose (see paragraph\u00a037).",

The Court has repeatedly held that, for the effective exercise of the right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, it is also important that legal aid lawyers discharge their obligation to give appropriate legal advice with due diligence (see Artico\u00a0v.\u00a0Italy, judgment of 13\u00a0May 1980, and Daud v.\u00a0Portugal, judgment of 21\u00a0April 1998), even if the lawyer's conclusion is that a case, or a further remedy, do not offer prospects of success.

In particular, the refusal must not be formulated in such a way as to leave the client in a state of uncertainty as to its legal grounds. However, the majority proceeds to observe \u201cthat under the applicable domestic regulations the legal aid lawyer was not obliged to prepare a written legal opinion on the prospects of the appeal. It was also stated that the domestic law \u201cdid not set any standards as to the legal advice he had to give to justify his refusal to lodge a cassation appeal\u201d.",
