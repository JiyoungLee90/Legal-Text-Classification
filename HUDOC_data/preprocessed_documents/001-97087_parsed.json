He stated that the court of first instance had been able to examine the two requests separately, allowing the first and rejecting the second, finding that the indication at issue was not compatible with Article 24 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution.

There is no generally accepted definition for such terms in international law, and many States have had difficulty in defining these terms. It has been argued that such terms cannot be defined in a legal sense because of the inherent ambiguity of the concept of religion. A common definitional mistake is to require that a belief in God be necessary for something to be considered a religion. The most obvious counter-examples are classical Buddhism, which is not theistic, and Hinduism, which is polytheistic. ...",

It operated in conformity with the principle of secularism and was responsible for taking into consideration the fundamental bases of the Muslim religion which were valid for all Muslims. Furthermore, referring to Article 10 of the Constitution (see paragraph 12 above), they pointed out that the State was bound to ensure that the various sects and interpretations within the same religion were treated equally.",
