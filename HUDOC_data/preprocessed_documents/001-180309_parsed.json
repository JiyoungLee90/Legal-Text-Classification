The poet-prince (k\u00f6lt\u0151fejedelem) happily introduced to the world his then yet unknown lover, who became his muse and who was 65 years younger than him. The Kossuth Prize winner and internationally recognised poet had a tendency to push the boundaries, openly admitted his homosexual adventures and love affairs, and held that taboos were to be dismantled. Therefore, when the country just began to digest and accept his relationship with Fanny, the poet accepted an offer from Penthouse magazine, which has since closed down, agreeing to be presented in the magazine in high-quality erotic pictures with his lover ... [The plaintiff] had even been subject of numerous hurtful and degrading remarks and attacks during Gy\u00f6rgy Faludy\u2019s life. The media echoed that opinion, doubting her true feelings towards her husband, and some of the publications stressed that theirs was a marriage of convenience ... They planned to adopt a child during the poet\u2019s lifetime, but since that plan failed, Gy\u00f6rgy Faludy came up with the idea of having a child through his son, but since his son was terminally ill, that plan could not go ahead either.",

The Court has held, moreover, that Article 8 cannot be relied on in order to complain of a loss of reputation, which is the foreseeable consequence of one\u2019s own actions such as, for example, the commission of a criminal offence (see Axel Springer AG v.
