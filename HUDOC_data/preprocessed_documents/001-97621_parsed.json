Moreover, it did not follow from the wording of Article 281 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that by giving his consent to the reading out of the pre-trial statements the applicant definitely waived his right to examine those witnesses. We would like to stress that the applicant was not represented during the trial or on appeal and that there is no indication that he was well versed in the law (see Bonev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a060018/00, \u00a7\u00a041, 8\u00a0June 2006; Isgr\u00f2 v. Italy, 19\u00a0February 1991, \u00a7\u00a029, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0194A; and also, by contrast, Andandonskiy v.

Thus, we are not satisfied that the applicant was sufficiently put on notice as to the consequences of his refusing legal assistance or his consenting to the admission of the officers' pre-trial statements. We reiterate in that connection that the ultimate guardian of the fairness of the proceedings was the trial judge (see Timergaliyev v. Russia, no. 40631/02, \u00a7\u00a059, 14 October 2008). It is true that, on 15 November 2002, noting the officers' absence, the trial judge enquired of the parties whether the officers' pre-trial statements could be admitted in evidence (see paragraph 13 of the judgment). But at the same time, as already mentioned, there is no indication that the judge apprised the applicant of his right to examine prosecution witnesses (see paragraph 5 above) and of the consequences of a waiver of this right.
