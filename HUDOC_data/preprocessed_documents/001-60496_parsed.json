It further found that the order was in conformity with Section 172 (3) of the Municipality Act, that therefore it was not necessary to examine the question whether or not the conditions set out in Section 175 of the Municipality Act had been fulfilled, and that the Burgomaster had not exceeded his competence under the Municipality Act.

Given that the decision dismissing the objection was given before the Administrative Jurisdiction Division delivered its decision of 14 May 1996 ..., the absence of such a provision cannot be held against the appellant.

In fact, the length of time that had passed since the Burgomaster had first designated a part of Amsterdam as an \u201cemergency area\u201d, the number of additional areas so designated since then and the continued existence of an \u201cemergency\u201d proved that such designations were ineffective; the impugned measures could therefore not be considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. The behaviour which might give rise to prohibition orders was in any case designated as criminal by the law and it was thus more appropriate to arrest offenders than to impose prohibition orders on them.
