The parties waiting for legal-aid services cannot be held at fault for shortcomings in the system. A party who was obliged to have recourse to legal aid should not be put in a worse situation than that of a person who did not seek it. A request to appeal out of time should therefore be submitted within seven days from the date on which the lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file or had an effective possibility of drafting an appeal (4\u00a0March 2005, II UZ 72/04; 27\u00a0June 2000, I CZ 62/00), or from the date when the lawyer was informed that he had been assigned to the case by the local Bar Association (11\u00a0October 2001, IV CZ 163/01; 17\u00a0November 1998, II UZ 122/98; 11\u00a0October 2001, IV CZ 163/01;",

The Government stressed that the notion of legal aid was not to be understood as providing legal representation in proceedings in all cases. It also comprised provision of legal advice on the prospects of success offered by a given legal remedy in the particular context of each case. The lawyers' tasks could not be perceived as following their clients' instructions and wishes uncritically and lodging remedies against their better judgment. Nor was it the role of the State to compel lawyers to do so.

However, an adequate institutional framework should be put in place so as to ensure effective legal representation for entitled persons and a sufficient level of protection of their interests. In particular, the existence of regulations concerning the time-frame within which the lawyer should inform the party of a refusal to prepare a cassation appeal has been considered crucial for the assessment of whether the party's interests have been properly safeguarded (Sia\u0142kowska v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0114-115).",
