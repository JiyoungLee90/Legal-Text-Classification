The consequences flowed from the initial decision to refuse Mr\u00a0Couez extended sick-leave and to regard his ordinary sick-leave as having been due to a work-related accident; those decisions, however, primarily concerned the development of the career of a civil servant, who contributed to the performance of one of the State\u2019s fundamental inherent functions, the maintenance of public order. Furthermore, the relevant legislation in this instance (see paragraph 17 above) conferred unilateral discretionary powers on the State and these were based on the public service and not, as in the case of private-law employees, on contract and agreement.",

A civil servant is, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, protected by Article 6 \u00a7 1 only if the dispute concerns, not his or her recruitment, career or termination of service, but, for instance, a purely economic entitlement. In addition, it is a requisite for the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 that the discretionary powers of the administrative authority in question should not be in issue.
