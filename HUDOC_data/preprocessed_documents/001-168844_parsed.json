E.K. advised V.M. that it was better if the contract with that person (G.O.) was signed by four family members and not just one, because that way they could obtain four separate plots of land. E.K. dealt with all the related paperwork and contacted public officials, while V.M. only signed the sale agreements with G.O.

That claim was amended in June and September 2002 and June 2005. The prosecutor submitted that the Law on Restitution, in force at the material time, entitled G.O. to receive one plot of up to 0.2\u00a0ha, with the remainder of his land being compensated for in other ways (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below), so the applicants were not entitled to be allocated a plot of land of that size each. The prosecutor also submitted that the VCA had unlawfully restored the applicants\u2019 rights to property in the order of priority: even though the second applicant had been a deportee, G.O. had not, and thus he did not have the right to transfer to the applicants priority rights which he himself did not have.",

However, the court upheld the prosecutor\u2019s argument that G.O. did not have the right to sell more rights than he had himself, and that the applicants\u2019 property rights could only have been restored under the same conditions as would have been applied had they been restored to G.O. The court observed that although such a rule had not been explicitly stipulated in the Law on Restoration at the time when G.O. sold his rights to the applicants, that rule stemmed from a systemic and logical interpretation of that Law, as well as from legal acts of lower rank (see paragraphs 32 and 34 below). Accordingly, the court held that the applicants had the right to receive one plot of land of up to 0.2 ha, but not three separate plots of that size, and they were not entitled to restoration in the order of priority.

In line with Article\u00a06.147 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 38 below), when property subject to restitution is transferred and the person who transferred it has acted in good faith, he or she has to compensate in the amount of the market value of the property at the time when it was received or transferred, or at the time of restitution, whichever is lowest. The court noted that the prosecutor had not alleged that the unlawful transaction had occurred because of the applicants\u2019 fault or that they had acted in bad faith; nor had it been determined, at the time of the proceedings, that any crime had been committed. Accordingly, the court ordered the applicants to return to the State an amount corresponding to the market value of the land at the time they sold it, as that value was the lowest.

It underlined that the applicants had received the land from the State for free, and that they had immediately sold it to third parties who had to be considered bona fide acquirers. The court held that by selling their plots for a price that was significantly lower than their market value the applicants had acted at their own risk, and thus the difference between what they had received (LTL\u00a025,000 each) and what they were obliged to pay to the State (LTL\u00a0216,000 each) could not be regarded as pecuniary damage. The Supreme Administrative Court further held that even if the applicants had suffered pecuniary damage, they could not be awarded damages because they themselves had acted unlawfully. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 5 June 2007 (see paragraph 19 above), the Supreme Administrative Court considered that the applicants had abused their rights by attempting to get from the State more land than G.O. had been entitled to receive. Accordingly, having concluded that both the applicants and the VCA had acted unlawfully, the court relied on Article 6.282 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 40 below) and held that there were no grounds to award them pecuniary damages.",

Furthermore, the Government contended that any hardship suffered by the applicants had resulted from their own actions. The applicants obtained rights to property restoration not because their or their relatives\u2019 property had been nationalised by the Soviet regime, but because they had bought those rights from G.O., after a consultation with E.K., with the purpose of immediately selling the land. The land was given to them by the State for free, and, as established by domestic courts, the applicants acted in violation of peremptory legal norms because they received more plots than they had bought from G.O. and because their property rights were restored in an order of priority to which G.O. was not entitled. The Government further submitted that the applicants had themselves freely decided to sell their land at a price which was significantly lower than the market value, and that in doing so they had acted at their own risk. As a result, the applicants should have lodged a claim against the buyers of their land, who had benefited from that transaction, in order to oblige the buyers to return the difference between the land\u2019s market value and the price for which it was sold to them.

Nor did the applicants dispute that, following that cancellation, the State was justified to require them to return the amount which they had received from selling their land to third parties (LTL 25,000 each). What the applicants complained about was that they had been ordered to pay the State more money than they had actually received (LTL 216,000 each), and had thereby incurred financial loss.",

The Government argued that there had not been an interference with the applicants\u2019 property rights because they remained entitled to receive a new plot (see paragraph 50 above). However, the Court observes that no such land has been given to them to date, and thus they have not been compensated for their expenses and prospective losses. The Court also considers that the question as to whether the allocation of a new plot would offset the applicants\u2019 losses is relevant for the assessment of the proportionality of the interference with their property rights, and will examine it in due course (see paragraph 64 below). While the Government also submitted that the applicants had received the land from the State for free, the Court observes that it was the original beneficiary, G.O., who had acquired the right to restoration of title to that land for free, whereas the applicants acquired it for a payment of LTL 15,000 (see paragraphs 6-7 above).",

The Court finds this conclusion difficult to accept. While taking note of the domestic courts\u2019 conclusions that ignorance of the law does not absolve anyone of responsibility (see Article 7 of the Constitution, quoted in paragraph 31 above), and that in the restoration process the applicants had consulted a land specialist E.K., the Court nonetheless does not see sufficiently strong reasons to find that the applicants should have questioned the actions of competent public authorities instead of expecting the latter to take all measures to avoid mistakes in application of legislation \u2013 especially taking into account the complexity and technical nature of legal acts governing the process of restoration of land titles (see, mutatis mutandis, Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 79-80, and Albergas and Arlauskas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 17978/05, \u00a7\u00a7 62 and 67-68, 27 May 2014). The Court also considers that the applicants\u2019 belief that as the family of a former deportee they were entitled to have their property rights restored in the order of priority, albeit incorrect, does not appear to be manifestly unreasonable in the light of the domestic legal acts which were applicable at the time when those rights were restored to them (see paragraphs 16 and 32 above).",

The Court sees no reasons to question those findings (see, mutatis mutandis, Visti\u0146\u0161 and Perepjolkins v.\u00a0Latvia [GC], no. 71243/01, \u00a7 120, 25 October 2012, and \u017dilinskien\u0117 v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 57675/09, \u00a7 51, 1 December 2015). When challenging the applicants\u2019 good faith, the Government emphasised the fact that their representative V.M. (who was the first and second applicants\u2019 son and the third applicant\u2019s brother) consulted his distant relative, land specialist E.K., who was one of the officials investigated on suspicion of fraud (see paragraphs 11-12 above). While the Court is sympathetic to the Lithuanian Government\u2019s efforts to ensure that individuals are not allowed to profit from criminal schemes designed to obtain property in violation of domestic law, it notes that in the present case the pre-trial investigation was discontinued as time-barred, without establishing whether any crime had been committed in the allocation of land to the applicants. Accordingly, a statement by the prosecutor that it had been \u201cindisputably established\u201d that some public officials had acted unlawfully (see paragraphs\u00a014 and 23 above) could not be relied on to conclude that the applicants had abused their rights, especially since neither the applicants nor their representative V.M. were ever officially suspected or accused in that investigation.",

The applicants were ordered to return to the State not what they had actually received from selling the land but what they would have received had they sold it in accordance with market prices. The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s submission that by selling their land for a price which was significantly below the market value the applicants acted at their own risk (see paragraph\u00a052 above). However, it reiterates that the applicants had a legitimate expectation that the land which had been allocated to them by public authorities would not be subsequently taken away (see paragraph 60 above). The Court further notes that the applicants, who at that time had been recognised as the legitimate owners of the land, were not under an obligation to sell it at market value or for any other specific price. In this connection the Court observes that the price which they received from the buyers corresponded to the indexed value of the land, which had been estimated by a relevant State enterprise (see paragraph 9 above). It notes that the indexed value is often used by the relevant Lithuanian authorities to determine, inter alia, the amount of compensation to be awarded to individuals for property which had been nationalised (see Nekvedavi\u010dius v.\u00a0Lithuania (just satisfaction), no. 1471/05, \u00a7 22, 17\u00a0November 2015, and Pauk\u0161tis v. Lithuania, no. 17467/07, \u00a7 34, 24\u00a0November 2015), and thus the applicants\u2019 choice to sell their land at its indexed value cannot be considered manifestly unreasonable. Therefore, while the applicants must have decided, for whatever reason, to make only a small profit from selling the land, it cannot be reasonably assumed that by doing so they accepted the risk of a possible future cancellation of the allocation of land to them, accompanied by an obligation to return to the State an amount not corresponding to what they had actually earned. In the Court\u2019s view, to hold otherwise would have required the applicants to repeatedly question the validity of the decisions taken by the public authorities and would be contrary to the principle of legal certainty (see, mutatis mutandis, Nejdet \u015eahin and Perihan \u015eahin v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a056-57, 20\u00a0October 2011).",

In the present case the Court is particularly concerned about the fact that the applicants asked domestic courts to allocate civil liability proportionately between them and the VCA, but domestic courts dismissed that request without providing any justification and thereby absolved the VCA of any liability despite the undisputed conclusion that the latter had acted unlawfully (see paragraphs\u00a024-25 above).",

In this connection the Court firstly notes that the applicants were put on the list to receive a new plot in 2007 but no land has been given to them to date (see paragraphs 28-30 above). In any event, the Court is of the view that recovery from the new plot would nonetheless continue placing the sole burden of remedying the authorities\u2019 mistakes on the applicants, whereas the State would not suffer any losses at all even though its own institutions acted in breach of domestic law.",
