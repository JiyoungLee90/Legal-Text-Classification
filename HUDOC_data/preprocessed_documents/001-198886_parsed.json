Since Article 8 of the Convention required sufficient guarantees against arbitrariness, the Court pointed out that the absence of a prior warrant could be counterbalanced by the availability of effective retrospective judicial review. Such a review had been even more necessary considering that the authorities had been unable to show that the cases had indeed been pressing, justifying immediate search and seizure without a judicial warrant (see Gutsanovi, \u00a7\u00a7 218-25, and Govedarski, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a081-87, both cited above, and Prezhdarovi v. Bulgaria, no. 8429/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a044-47, 30 September 2014). No effective retrospective judicial review had been carried out as the judge examining the records of search and seizure had merely signed them, without giving any particular reasons for his or her approval (see Gutsanovi, cited above, \u00a7 223). These circumstances led to the conclusion that the search-and-seizure operations had not been \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, and that they had thus breached the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention.",
