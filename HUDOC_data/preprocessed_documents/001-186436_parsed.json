Furthermore, the court considered that the passage could not be regarded as concerning the claimant specifically, since neither his name nor the position he held had been mentioned. The applicant had referred to \u201cbig Bryansk thieves\u201d, and, given that the article contained comments on criminal proceeding instituted against other people from the Bryansk administration, it was impossible to regard the passage as relating specifically to Mr Denin. In the court\u2019s view, that conclusion was not altered by the publication of Mr Denin\u2019s photograph next to the article, since other people had appeared in the photograph as well. Accordingly, the passage in question could not be considered as defamatory in respect of the claimant.\u00a0As regards the second passage, the court held that it could not be considered as defamatory either since it had not constituted a statement of fact but had rather been a supposition, which was reflected in the use of the word \u201ccould\u201d.",

Germany, no. 3690/10, \u00a7 55, 26 November 2015). The Court emphasises that, in order for Article 8 of the Convention to come into play, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and its manner must cause prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see A. v. Norway, no.\u00a028070/06, \u00a7 64, 9\u00a0April 2009, and Axel Springer AG\u00a0v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, \u00a7 83, 7 February 2012).

Furthermore, the passage at issue remains within the acceptable limits, being closely connected with the factual information provided by the applicant in his article, given that criminal proceedings had been instituted and discontinued against Mr Simonenko, and another set of criminal proceedings had led to the conviction of another regional official (see Marian Maciejewski v.
