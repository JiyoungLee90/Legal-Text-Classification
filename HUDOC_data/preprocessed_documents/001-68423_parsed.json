Alternatively, it might be proper to reduce the period of imprisonment that is considered appropriate, if any is considered appropriate. It may transpire that by the time that the question of implementing the suspended committal order is considered, the circumstances of the defendant have changed. Whereas before she might have been able to pay perhaps, through illness or whatever reason, by now she cannot. Thus, it would be wrong to commit her.

Applying legislation similar to regulation 41 of the Community Charge Regulations (for which, see below), the magistrates found that his failure to follow the accountant\u2019s advice constituted culpable neglect and they committed him to prison. On appeal from the judgment of Mr Justice Simon Brown, the Court of Appeal held that no causal connection had been established between the failure to follow the advice in 1986 and the failure to pay the rates in 1984; and that the magistrates had not properly entered into the inquiry as to whether the failure to pay was due to culpable neglect, which was required by the legislation as a statutory condition precedent to the exercise by the justices of their power to issue a warrant of commitment.

Lord Justice O\u2019Connor observed that \u201cthey never carried out the inquiry required [by the law]\u201d. Lord Justice Neill found that \u201csome inquiry about the applicant\u2019s finances was made\u201d, but that \u201ca clear and crucial distinction can be drawn between the inquiry required by the statute and the inquiry which was in fact carried out. The justices never examined the question whether failure to pay was due to culpable neglect ... In my judgment, the statutory inquiry was not held in the present case\u201d. He explained that the making of an enquiry was a statutory condition precedent to the issue of a warrant of commitment: \u201cIn other words, if the justices failed to hold any inquiry at all as required by the section they would have no jurisdiction to issue a warrant.\u201d Sir\u00a0Roger Ormrod (who dissented from the majority decision) said: \u201c... it is quite clear that the justices carried out an inquiry into means carefully and in detail ... It is equally plain that they misdirected themselves completely ... They ... failed to realise that the question they had to decide was whether the applicant\u2019s failure to pay his rates was \u2018due either to his wilful refusal or to his culpable neglect\u2019 \u201d.",

He noted that the power to imprison a person under the age of 21 was only to be exercised if the court was of the opinion that no other method of dealing with him was appropriate and that it was the duty of the court, if of that opinion, to state in open court why the court believed that to be the case. He further noted that the magistrates had failed to state in open court why they believed that no alternative to imprisonment was available, that there was no evidence to show that the magistrates in fact felt that no other method was appropriate, or the reasons why they might so have felt; and that it was quite clear that alternatives to imprisonment had been available to them.

In that case, the responsibility for calculating the date on which the respondent was to be released from prison lay with the Governor of the prison. He had calculated her date of release to be 18 November 1996. However, accepting her arguments on judicial review, the  held that the release date should actually have been 17 September 1996. On appeal to the House of Lords, the Governor accepted that the respondent\u2019s continued detention after 17 September 1996 had therefore been unlawful. Nevertheless, he contended that he could not be liable for false imprisonment since he had complied with the law as it was understood at the time of his decision. The House of Lords held that the tort of false imprisonment was one of strict liability and that its consequences could not be escaped even by showing that the Governor had acted in accordance with the view of the law which at the time was accepted by the court to be correct. There was no lawful justification for the action of the Governor, as the responsibility for calculating the release date lay with him, and not with the order of the court that sentenced the respondent to prison.

The quotation further confirms that the means inquiry required by regulation 41(2) was at the centre of the enforcement procedure which was laid down by the 1989 Regulations, and that, without it, the magistrates plainly could not properly arrive at a conclusion as to whether the failure to pay had been due to the applicant\u2019s wilful refusal or culpable neglect. The Court recalls that the ex parte Johnson case was subsequently considered by the Commission, which unanimously concluded that it could be said, with the practically possible degree of certainty, that the magistrates had acted in excess of jurisdiction in the circumstances of that case and that therefore there had been a violation of Article 5 of the Convention (Johnson v. the United Kingdom, Commission report of 9 September 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 41-44).

As pointed out by the Government, it does not apply to committal of persons for fine defaulting and the inclusion of a reference to section 3 in the consent order in Jason Taylor (56231/00) appears, on its face, erroneous. While the applicants\u2019 argument that the spirit of the provision is clear may be persuasive, it is not apparent that the magistrates\u2019 actions in failing to apply section 3 to these two applicants can be impugned as failing to comply with a statutory condition precedent. Doubtless all were in agreement at the consent order stage that on grounds of general procedural fairness persons of such an age should have been given the opportunity to obtain representation and thus that the warrants be quashed.

The Court concludes that the detention of the applicants in these cases cannot therefore be considered on that ground as falling outside the jurisdiction of the magistrates or, therefore, in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Furthermore, it has had careful regard to the case-law referred to in the consent orders, in the Christison (56429/00) application and set out in the \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d part of this judgment. It notes that the judges in those cases repeatedly described the notification to the applicant of the hearing as \u201ca matter of natural justice\u201d, and variously described the failure to give proper notification as \u201cperverse\u201d, \u201ca [flagrant] disregard for an elementary principle which every court ought to obey\u201d and one which would render the magistrates\u2019 order \u201cvitiated\u201d and the hearing \u201cfatally flawed\u201d.

The Government further submitted that they were not responsible for the distress caused by actions of various of the applicants\u2019 relatives or girl friends.

It is true, as pointed out by the Government, that in cases concerning procedural defects under Article 5, in particular Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4, the Court has held that just satisfaction was to be awarded only in respect of damage resulting from a deprivation of liberty that the applicant would not have suffered if he or she had had the benefit of the missing guarantees (e.g. Nikolova v. Bulgaria, [GC] no. 31195/96, ECHR 1999-II, \u00a7\u00a076). However where there are findings of unlawfulness in the detention itself under the first paragraph of Article 5, it may be noted that generally the Court makes an award which reflects the importance of the right to liberty which should not be removed save under the conditions provided for in domestic law and in conformity with the rule of law. As well as the length of the resulting detention, the degree of arbitrariness disclosed by the circumstances of the case may be a significant factor influencing the appropriateness of any award (e.g. Conka and Others v. , no.\u00a051564/99, ECHR 2002-I; Assanidz\u00e9 v.

In Perks, the Court saw no reason to disregard the Government\u2019s concession that the situation of Mr Perks was exceptional given that the appeal court had found it unlikely that the magistrates\u2019 court would have committed him to prison if they had known more about his health problems and personal circumstances, matters to which, the Government had also accepted, a reasonably competent solicitor would have drawn the magistrates\u2019 court\u2019s attention. An award for non-pecuniary loss was therefore made to Mr Perks. It is noteworthy that the Court went on to find that there was no basis to speculate, as regards the other applicants in Perks, as to the outcome of their proceedings before the magistrates\u2019 courts, and found that the finding of a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction.",

There is no finding as in the case of Mr Perks, whether in a High Court judgment or by agreement of the parties in a consent order, that it was unlikely that the magistrates would have committed the applicants to prison, as a result of having greater knowledge about their circumstances or otherwise. While the applicants argued generally that a reasonably competent solicitor would have made a difference in their cases and that the High Court, once they were represented, quashed the committal decisions, this was also the position for the other applicants in Perks. The Court cannot engage in speculation as to which domestic cases it was likely that the applicant\u2019s representative would have brought to the attention of the magistrates nor what action the magistrates would have taken had they been referred to those cases. It requires a more concrete indication that the detention would not have occurred but for the lack of legal aid for representation before the magistrates. Though the applicant Waller (34327/96) made reference to health problems as indicating, as in Perks, that the magistrates would not have detained him if properly addressed by a legal representative, this element was not referred to in the consent order concerned and did not play any apparent part in the quashing of the order by the magistrates.",
