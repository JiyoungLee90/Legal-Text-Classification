It further reiterates that in the Russian legal system although a court itself has no competence to institute criminal proceedings, its power to annul a refusal to institute criminal proceedings and indicate the defects to be addressed appears to be a substantial safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power by an investigating authority (see Trubnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 49790/99, 14\u00a0October 2003).

The Court notes with regret that despite the need to act swiftly in such situations the authorities initially appeared to have moved quite slowly, which prompted the applicant to bring court proceedings and resulted in a delay in carrying out certain investigative actions (see paragraphs 25-34 above). However, by the end of the investigation the Court considers that the authorities identified all of the relevant witnesses who could give evidence in respect of the events of 1\u00a0June 2005 and conducted interviews with these people with a view to establishing the exact course of the events. The summary of these findings was made in the decision of 24 April 2007 (see paragraph 34 above), which addresses the apparent inconsistencies in statements of various witnesses and makes a reasonable conclusion by dismissing the applicant\u2019s version of the events.",

Furthermore, the Court reiterates that it is not called upon to examine alleged errors of fact and law committed by the domestic judicial authorities, provided that there is no indication of unfairness in the proceedings and provided the decisions reached cannot be considered arbitrary. On the basis of the material submitted by the applicant, the Court notes that he was fully able to present his case and contest the evidence that he considered false. The Court has not found any other circumstance which could give reason to believe that the proceedings did not comply with the fairness requirement of Article 6 of the Convention. Accordingly, the Court finds that these complaints are manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention and rejects it pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4.",

Even assuming that the applicant had no effective remedies at his disposal, the complaints were brought by the applicant on 3 April 2006, which is more than six months after the events in question took place.
