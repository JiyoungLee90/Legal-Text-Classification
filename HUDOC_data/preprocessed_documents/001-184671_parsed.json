Indeed, the cases brought before this Court, as well as the CPT reports (see paragraph 19 above), indicate that the majority of the cells in the Corradino Correctional Facility are of more or less the same quality, particularly those in Divisions 2 and\u00a03 (the latter being the division used for foreigners), in respect of which urgent refurbishment has been called for by the CPT since 2013 (see, for example, Yanez Pinon and Others v. Malta, nos. 71645/13 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a077, 19\u00a0December 2017). It follows that it has not been shown that the remedy offered by the Government would have in fact improved the applicants\u2019 situation. In the specific circumstances of the instant applications, the applicants\u2019 refusal to transfer therefore cannot be held against them for the purposes of the exhaustion requirement (ibid.).",

Given the similarity of the complaints, as well as the submissions and documentary evidence provided by the parties, the Court refers to its general findings in the case of Story and Others concerning each of the issues mentioned, and reiterates its concerns (particularly at \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0115117, and 120-121).

However, in the present cases the applicants did not submit detailed information as to specific periods when the temperature inside had dropped to very cold or close to freezing temperatures, and for how long such conditions persisted during the winters over the years during which they had been detained. In such circumstances the Court finds it difficult in the present cases to determine precisely the severity of the situation (ibid.). Moreover, the first applicant admitted to having received further blankets from NGOs and did not claim that he had requested blankets which had been denied him, nor did the second applicant claim that he had requested further blankets and been refused.",

The Court takes issue with this matter, despite the fact that in the present case insufficient details were brought to its attention, since it is not insensitive to these repeated complaints made by applicants in cases before it. The Court notes that the CPT also commented on the humidity in the cells in Division 3 (see paragraph 19 above). In this connection, the Court considers that positive action by the Government is indeed called for, as humidity worsens the resulting situation where there are extremes of both cold and heat. The Court reiterates that the cold suffered might in itself amount to a violation of Article 3, and does not exclude the finding of such a violation if an applicant were to set out his case in a more concrete and detailed manner. However, on the facts as submitted by the applicants the Court cannot reach that conclusion.",

It noted that it would be of even more concern if, contrary to the Government\u2019s submission, the prison authorities were not making available the required equipment (be it a two-foot arm, or any other appropriate tool) to open and keep open high windows, as detainees should not have to put themselves in peril by having to climb on beds or sinks, or be dependent on other detainees to lift them up in order to access such windows. The Court notes that, two years later, the applicants are still claiming that their vents are blocked and that they have to open or close the window by climbing onto the sink, thereby putting their life at risk (see paragraphs 7 and 13 above). The Court thus reiterates the need for all wallmounted vents to be fully functional in all cells. Nevertheless, it notes that the applicants have not specified that they asked for and were refused access to an appropriate tool to open or close the windows, nor have they rebutted the Government\u2019s argument to that effect (see paragraph 38 above).",

This is even more so if, as stated by the applicants, water was not always readily available to enable them to flush by using a bucket (see also CPT comments, at paragraph 19 above). This matter raises particular concern to the Court as this may cause unpleasant smells but also a perilous hygiene situation, particularly given that the toilets were situated in the vicinity of the applicants\u2019 beds without any partition. It is thus imperative that running water be available at all times, together with the relevant cleaning materials to ensure the required hygienic standards in each cell. The Court notes that the Government claimed (see paragraph 44 above) that detergents and cleaning facilities were readily available, as was running water.",

The Prison Standards developed by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture make specific mention of outdoor exercise and consider it a basic safeguard of prisoners\u2019 well-being that all of them, without exception, be allowed at least one hour of exercise in the open air every day and preferably as part of a broader programme of outofcell activities (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7\u00a0150, 10 January 2012). In examining the cumulative effect of the above factors, the Court cannot but take account of the fact that cells were unlocked at 7.30 a.m. and left open until 12.30\u00a0p.m.; they were unlocked again at 2 p.m. and locked at 8.30\u00a0p.m. Therefore inmates were free to move around and access the exercise yard, as well as other recreational facilities, for more than ten hours a day. Such a favourable situation has a particular bearing when assessing the applicants\u2019 conditions of detention (see Story\u00a0and Others, cited above, \u00a7 126 and Yanez Pinon and Others, cited above, \u00a7 116).",
