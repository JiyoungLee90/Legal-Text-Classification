While acknowledging that the oil spill had been caused by an accident, the judge said that some of the information in the file, although still provisional at that stage in the proceedings, suggested that the applicant had been at fault in several respects, in particular in failing to cooperate sufficiently with the port authorities when they had tried to take the vessel in tow. The applicant\u2019s conduct could constitute an offence of causing damage to natural resources and the environment and one of failing to comply with the instructions of the administrative authorities.

The judge took the view that the seriousness of the offences of which the applicant stood accused justified his continued pre-trial detention and that the latter measure was exceptional, subsidiary, temporary and proportionate in nature and thus satisfied the remaining criteria laid down by the case-law of the Constitutional Court. As to the amount set for bail, the judge stated that the applicant\u2019s appearance at trial was vital in order to elucidate the sequence of events following the leak in the vessel. He also reiterated the arguments of the first investigating judge to the effect that the seriousness of the offences, the public outcry caused by the marine pollution, the applicant\u2019s Greek nationality, the fact that his permanent address was abroad and the fact that he had no ties with Spain justified setting a high level of bail in order to rule out any risk that the applicant might fail to appear.",

The ECJ further held that \u201cserious negligence\u201d within the meaning of the Directive should be understood as entailing an unintentional act or omission by which the person responsible committed a patent breach of the duty of care which he should have and could have complied with in view of his attributes, knowledge, abilities and individual situation (paragraph 77).",

The European Union legislative process culminated in the adoption of Directive 2008/99/EC. Recital 3 in the preamble to the Directive states that the availability of criminal penalties demonstrates social disapproval of a qualitatively different nature compared to administrative penalties or a compensation mechanism under civil law. It also makes an explicit link between the need for criminal penalties and past experience in the field of environmental protection.",

In doing so, the Tribunal has laid down a number of criteria in order to determine what constitutes a reasonable bond within the meaning of Article 73 of UNCLOS taken in conjunction with Article 292 of that Convention. Hence, it is interesting to examine the approach taken by the Tribunal in cases relating to the detention of a foreign national by the coastal State and the fixing of the amount of bail. However, it should be borne in mind, firstly, that the Tribunal, unlike the Court, is tasked with striking a balance between the competing interests of two States rather than the interests of an individual and those of a State. Secondly, the issues brought before the Tribunal concern the detention and release of both crews and vessels. Thirdly, unlike the instant case, which is about an environmental disaster, the vast majority of cases before the Tribunal concern fisheries-related violations. In its judgment of 6 August 2007 in the case of Hoshinmaru (Japan v. the Russian Federation), the Tribunal summarised the principles it applies in deciding what constitutes a reasonable bond.

In the Camouco case it stated: \u2018the Tribunal considers that a number of factors are relevant in an assessment of the reasonableness of bonds or other financial security. They include the gravity of the alleged offences, the penalties imposed or imposable under the laws of the detaining State, the value of the detained vessel and of the cargo seized, the amount of the bond imposed by the detaining State and its form\u2019 (ITLOS Reports 2000, p. 10, at p. 31, para. 67). In the Monte Confurco case it added that: \u2018This is by no means a complete list of factors. Nor does the Tribunal intend to lay down rigid rules as to the exact weight to be attached to each of them\u2019 (ITLOS Reports 2000, p. 86, at p. 109, para. 76). In the Volga case it stated that: \u2018In assessing the reasonableness of the bond or other security, due account must be taken of the terms of the bond or security set by the detaining State, having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case\u2019 (ITLOS Reports 2002, p. 10, at p. 32, para.\u00a065). In the Juno Trader case the Tribunal further declared: \u2018[t]he assessment of the relevant factors must be an objective one, taking into account all information provided to the Tribunal by the parties\u2019 (ITLOS Reports 2004, p. 17, at p. 41, para.\u00a085).",

It took the view that the seriousness of the environmental disaster justified the domestic courts\u2019 concern to determine who had been responsible and that, accordingly, it had been reasonable for them to seek to ensure that the applicant would appear for trial by fixing a high level of bail. It considered that the domestic authorities had demonstrated that the amount required from the applicant by way of bail had been proportionate and that they had taken sufficient account of his personal circumstances, and in particular his status as an employee of the shipowner, which had taken out insurance to cover this type of risk. The Chamber therefore concluded that the amount of bail, although high, had not been disproportionate in view of the legal interest being protected, the seriousness of the offence in question and the disastrous environmental and economic consequences of the oil spill. Accordingly, it held that there had been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",

While the domestic courts may have assumed that the ship\u2019s owner or the insurers would put up bail, he had spent eighty-three days in detention.

In the latter case, the insurer could pay the bail, but was by no means legally required to do so. Cover against certain shipping-related risks was left to the discretion of the insurer. The applicant referred in that regard to Rule 9.28 of the London P&I Rules (see paragraph 55 above), which the London P&I Club had apparently agreed to apply \u2013 in view of the exceptional nature of the situation \u2013 in order to pay the bail and secure the applicant\u2019s release after eighty-three days in detention. He pointed out that, in any event, while the insurance contract had been binding on his employer and the ship\u2019s insurer, he had not taken out any personal insurance with the London P&I Club, which had no obligations towards him. In giving reasons for the level of bail, the domestic courts had not stated that the company which insured the applicant\u2019s employer had been obliged to put up bail, or that they expected it to do so. In the applicant\u2019s submission, the appeal courts were not required to read the decisions of the lower courts in the light of new arguments not referred to by the latter.",

The sum set cannot accordingly be fixed by reference to the amount of any loss which might eventually be imputable to the accused or his employers but must be assessed principally by reference to him, his assets and his relationship with those persons, if any, who offer themselves as sureties to guarantee his appearance. Where no such sureties are offered, it is the accused person and his assets which must be the principal reference point for the setting of bail (see Bonnechaux v. Switzerland, no. 8224/78, Commission report of 5 December 1979, Decisions and Reports (DR) 18, pp. 126, 144, \u00a7 73, and Moussa v.

The authorities must take as much care in fixing appropriate bail as in deciding whether or not continued detention is indispensable (see Toshev v. Bulgaria, no. 56308/00, 10 August 2006). In certain special circumstances, it may be legitimate to take into account also the extent of the losses imputed to the accused in fixing a higher level of bail. However, such cases have in general concerned offences involving fraud or the misappropriation of funds, where there is evidence to suggest that the accused may have substantial undisclosed assets (see, for example, Moussa, cited above, and Skrobol v. Poland, no. 44165/98, 13 September 2005).",

Nor can the danger of absconding be evaluated solely on the basis of considerations relating to the gravity of the penalty likely to be imposed. As the Court observed in the Neumeister v. Austria case (27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, \u00a7 10), other factors must also be taken into account, including \u201cthe character of the person involved, his morals, his home, his occupation, his assets, his family ties and all kinds of links with the country in which he is being prosecuted\u201d. Regard should also be had to the use of other preventative measures, alone or in conjunction with bail, to reduce the risk of absconding and ensure the accused\u2019s attendance at the trial.",

At the time of fixing bail, no sureties had offered to post bail on his behalf and there is no suggestion that, as the Master of a cargo ship, the applicant himself was in a position to find sureties to meet such a sum. Further, the circumstances of the case were not, in our view, such as to justify the national courts in taking account of the losses resulting from the acts imputed to the applicant: unlike the cases mentioned above, the offences of which the applicant was suspected did not involve fraud or imputations of personal and unlawful gains.",

Nor was any such reference made by the Corunna no. 1 investigating judge in the applicant\u2019s two requests for release or by the Audiencia Provincial on his appeal. The only suggestion that the financial support of the owners or insurers of the vessel played a part in the decisions of the courts in setting or upholding the amount of the bail is in the delphic statement of the Constitutional Court that the applicant\u2019s \u201cprofessional environment\u201d had been taken into account, a phrase which is interpreted in the judgment as embracing the applicant\u2019s relationship with the shipowners. However, what is clear is that at no stage prior to the applicant\u2019s release was any inquiry made by the national courts as to the legal obligations, if any, of the owners to post bail or as to the relevant insurance arrangements which existed between the owners and their insurers. In particular, there appears to have been no investigation of the question whether the insurers had any responsibility to indemnify the shipowners in respect of the bail bond of a ship\u2019s Master who had been detained by the maritime authorities in the circumstances of the present case. Indeed, according to the undisputed evidence of the third-party interveners, there was no such legal obligation under the 1992 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage and neither the shipowners nor their insurers had any legal responsibility in regard to bail, whether by custom, practice or contractual arrangement.",

The fact that the applicant\u2019s bail was eventually posted by the insurers is, in our view, of limited importance in terms of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. Of more significance is the fact that, in setting bail, the national courts based themselves on what was, at best, an unsupported assumption that the shipowners or their insurers would feel morally obliged to come to the applicant\u2019s rescue by posting bail rather than allowing him to languish in detention on remand. Moreover, by the time they did so, the applicant had already spent two and a half months in custody. This approach to the fixing of bail was not, in our view, consistent with the responsibilities required of national courts by that provision of the Convention.",

However, even if, as the majority argue, these new realities have to be taken into account in interpreting the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3, the seriousness of the offence of which a person is suspected cannot be the decisive factor justifying the size of the bail; still less can the gravity of the offence or of the damage allegedly caused thereby, whether environmental or otherwise, justify the setting of bail at an exorbitant level which renders illusory the applicant\u2019s ability to secure his release from custody. Even accepting, as the judgment asserts, that it was \u201chardly surprising\u201d that the judicial authorities should adjust the amount of the bail in line with the level of civil liability incurred, \u201cso as to ensure that the persons responsible [had] no incentive to evade justice and forfeit the security\u201d, this was not in our view compatible with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3, particularly in a case where the legal relationship of those persons had not even been examined by the courts themselves. Nor was it in our view consistent with the principles governing that provision to fix bail at a level far beyond the reach of an individual accused by reference to the strength of the public outcry over the damage caused by the acts or omissions imputed to him.",

We observe, however, that the applicant was prepared to put up bail of EUR\u00a060,000, a substantial sum for an individual in the position of the present applicant. Moreover, a striking feature of the present case is that the national courts do not appear to have taken account, when setting and upholding the bail, of the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances other than his Greek nationality and his lack of ties to Spain. There is no reference to his assets, the fact that the applicant was 67 years old and of good character, the fact that he was a citizen of another Member State of the European Union or his family circumstances, all of which had relevance to the risk that he might abscond. Nor was any account apparently taken of the penalty which might be imposed on a person of the age of the applicant, who was at least unlikely to be subject to a custodial sentence if tried and convicted of the offences of which he was suspected. Of equal importance is the fact that no consideration appears to have been given at the time to combining bail with other measures designed to secure the applicant\u2019s attendance at trial, such as those which were imposed when he was eventually released (see paragraph\u00a021) and when the applicant was subsequently allowed to return to Greece (see paragraph 26).",

We disagree. In our view, the approach of the Spanish courts in fixing the applicant\u2019s bail was not compatible with the principles established by the Court under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, the fundamental purpose of which is to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty.",
