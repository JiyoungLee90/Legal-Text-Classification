She argued that during the excessively lengthy proceedings the defendant company had been using the house without paying any rent and had thus been unjustly enriched at the applicant's expense for which the applicant sought compensation. The applicant calculated the amount of her claim on the basis of section 3 of the Act on Competence of Municipalities in the Matters of Lease and Sublease of Nonresidential Premises (Law 500/1991 Coll., as amended). This provision pertained to the lease and sublease of nonresidential premises in certain specific situations. It was repealed as from 1 April 1996 by operation of the Price Regulations Act (Law no. 18/1996 Coll.).",

The Court further observes that, even assuming that the provision of section 3 of the Act no. 500/1991 Coll. on which the applicant based her calculations as such once applied to her case, at the time when the judgment became final it had been repealed and no longer had any legal effect.
