The reasoning of the impugned decision states that the meeting, held after the indictment had been lodged, at which the panel deliberated on [the defendant's] detention, was held in the absence of D.O., the defence lawyer officially appointed for the defendant \u00d0er\u0111et Ha\u0111i, in accordance with Article 105 \u00a7 2 of the CCP. However, the defendant questioned the finding of the first-instance court that defence counsel had been properly summoned to the panel meeting in question, pursuant to Article 105 \u00a7 1 of the CCP. The defendant alleged in his appeal that his officially appointed defence counsel had not been served with the decision of his appointment prior to the panel meeting of 12\u00a0December 2007 where [the panel] had been deliberating on his detention. Defence counsel had not been summoned to the panel meeting in question. The defendant maintained that the summons for the panel meeting had been sent to his defence counsel by fax on 12 December 2007 at 10.55 a.m. He enclosed a copy of the minutes of a different hearing held before the Slavonski Brod Municipal Court on 12\u00a0December 2007 in proceedings no.

As a consequence, a deprivation of liberty which is lawful under domestic law can still be arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention. While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute \u201carbitrariness\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis.

The Court has considered the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time to be incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Sta\u0161aitis v. Lithuania, no. 47679/99, \u00a7 67, 21 March 2002; Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no. 55669/00, \u00a7 70, 2\u00a0March 2006; and Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, \u00a7 91, 1 March 2007). Conversely, it has found that an applicant's detention could not be said to have been arbitrary if the domestic court gave certain grounds justifying the continued detention on remand (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 131), unless the reasons given are extremely laconic and without reference to any legal provision which would have permitted the applicant's detention (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 157).",

Thus, the Court considered in the context of sub-paragraph (c) that a period of less than a month between the expiry of the initial detention order and the issuing of a fresh, reasoned detention order following a remittal of the case from the appeal court to a lower court did not render the applicant's detention arbitrary (see Minjat, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 48). In contrast, a period of more than a year following a remittal from a court of appeal to a court of lower instance, in which the applicant remained in a state of uncertainty as to the grounds for his detention on remand, combined with the lack of a time-limit for the lower court to re-examine his detention, was found to render the applicant's detention arbitrary (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 136-37).",

In contrast, a delay of eighty-two days between the expiry of the initial order of detention in a psychiatric institution and its renewal and the lack of adequate safeguards to ensure that the applicant's detention would not be unreasonably delayed was found to be inconsistent with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 to protect individuals from arbitrary detention (see Erkalo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a057-60 in respect of both sub-paragraphs (a) and (e) of Article 5 \u00a7 1).\u201d",

Indeed, as a matter of domestic law, it had the authority to order the applicant's detention in relation to the pending criminal proceedings against him before that same court. The detention order of 12 December 2007 was not quashed because the Municipal Court had not given reasons to justify the necessity of holding the applicant in custody, but owing to a procedural flaw. The Court notes that the Municipal Court appointed the applicant defence counsel as early as 6\u00a0December 2007, before a decision ordering his detention was adopted and before he was arrested. Before holding a hearing concerning the applicant's detention, the Municipal Court summoned the defence lawyer by fax on 12\u00a0December 2007 at 10.55 a.m. However, it turned out later that the defence lawyer had not received the summons since he had been attending another hearing at that time. In these circumstances the Court considers that the procedural flaw in question did not amount to a \u201cgross or obvious irregularity\u201d in the exceptional sense indicated by the case-law (compare Lloyd and Others\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a029798/96 et seq., \u00a7\u00a0114, 1\u00a0March 2005).",

There is no doubt that an appeal court is empowered to quash a decision subject to its review and remit the case for fresh examination. Indeed, as a matter of domestic law, it had the authority to quash the first-instance decision on detention under Article 398 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As regards the County Court's decision to maintain the applicant's detention, the Court notes that in the reasoning of its decision, the County Court, as stated above, relied on formal defects of the procedure leading to the impugned decision of the Municipal Court. On the other hand, the County Court in no way questioned the grounds for ordering the applicant's detention, namely, the danger that he would reoffend. Furthermore, it in no way called into question that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed a criminal offence. Thus, the Court accepts that the County Court's decision to maintain the applicant's detention was based on these grounds. It can therefore be presumed that the decision of the County Court accepted the reasons given by the Municipal Court for maintaining the applicant's detention (see, a contrario, Bakhmutskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a036932/02, \u00a7 112, 25 June 2009).",

Thus, the period in question amounted to five days which, in the Court's view appears reasonable in the given circumstances. The Court finds that the time that elapsed between the County Court's finding that the detention order was defective and the issuing of a fresh detention order by the Municipal Court did not render the applicant's detention arbitrary either (see, by way of comparison, Mooren, cited above, \u00a7 96).",
