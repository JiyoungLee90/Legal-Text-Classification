The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until July 2010, the \u201cMRT\u201d was only able to continue to exist, and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region, because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Ivan\u0163oc and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116-20; Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012122; and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110).

The rule is based on the assumption that the domestic system provides an effective remedy in respect of the alleged breach.

In the present case, the parties did not submit any argument which would indicate that the Moldovan Government had changed their position in respect of Transdniestria in the intervening years up to the period of the applicant\u2019s release from detention in April 2012.
