As there were no compelling reasons to restrict the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer when he was giving statements to the police, the Court must apply a very strict scrutiny to its fairness assessment (see Dimitar Mitev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a034779/09, \u00a7 71, 8 March 2018). More importantly, the onus is on the Government to demonstrate convincingly why, exceptionally and in the specific circumstances of the case, the overall fairness of the trial was not irretrievably prejudiced by the restriction on access to legal advice (see Simeonovi, cited above, \u00a7 132, and Ibrahim and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0265).",

In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy.

Thus, the applicant was stripped of the important procedural safeguards that are, at least in theory, capable of providing a meaningful response to his grievances and thus remedying his situation at the domestic level. In addition to that, in convicting him, the trial court relied on his statements to the police without examining their admissibility at the trial. Likewise, the Court of Cassation dealt with this issue in a formalistic manner and failed to remedy this shortcoming (see Bayram Ko\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 38907/09, \u00a7 23 in fine, 5\u00a0September 2017). Therefore, neither the assistance provided subsequently by a lawyer nor the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings were sufficient to remedy the defects which had occurred earlier. In view of the above, the Court considers that the Government have not demonstrated that the procedural shortcomings at the initial stage of the investigation did not irretrievably prejudice the applicant\u2019s defence rights (Salduz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058; and Ibrahim and Others, cited above, \u00a7 274).",
