In the objection by which he had challenged the penalty notice the applicant had merely cited the notice in question, had denied having committed the offences, and had asked the court to acquit him. He had not attended the hearing. Thus, Judge B.L.V. had not had a significant role in the proceedings and his alleged partiality had been of no relevance to the adjudication of the case. He had based his judgment on the written report of the police, the credibility of which had never been put to doubt.

According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 must be determined according to (i) a subjective test, where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge \u2013 that is, whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and (ii) an objective test, that is to say, by ascertaining whether, quite apart from the personal conduct of any of its members, the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, among other authorities, Micallef v.

The Government noted that the applicant claimed to have sent a fax asking for the judge\u2019s withdrawal, without then appearing at the hearing, but never filed a fax transmission report with our Court.

Dealing with this issue, in fact, would involve complex assessments in law and in fact, including with regard to the role of recusal of judges vis-\u00e0-vis selfdisqualification in the domestic system, as well as the nature (in the light of its effectiveness) of the complaint which the applicant, instead of filing a request for recusal, brought before the Constitutional Court of Croatia seeking the setting-aside of the Pazin court\u2019s judgment of 6 July 2012 (see, mutatis mutandis, with reference to a different constitutional-law framework, Horvat v. Croatia, no.\u00a051585/99, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45, 26 July 2001). Such complex assessments are made unnecessary by the approach I will take as to the object of the applicant\u2019s complaint before our Court and the extent of our Court\u2019s assessment of judicial impartiality. I will nonetheless discuss a few general implications of the need for a request for the recusal of a judge \u2013 if such a remedy is available at the domestic level \u2013 to be brought in the domestic courts before an issue of judicial impartiality is raised before our Court.",

On the contrary, the applicant stated clearly that, in his view, it was the decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia of 17 October 2012 which was in violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, since that court had allegedly neglected to consider that the Pazin court\u2019s decision had been taken by a partial judge and thereby infringed the domestic Constitution (Article 29). Furthermore, the applicant assumed that the Constitutional Court \u201c[had] not read\u201d his complaint, as the allegedly \u201csuperficial\u201d reasoning that it gave stated that no fundamental right was at stake (whereas, according to the applicant, the issue of judicial impartiality had been clearly argued by him). Consequently, the applicant sought the \u201coverturning\u201d of both the Constitutional Court\u2019s and the Pazin court\u2019s decisions, as well as the reopening of the proceedings.",

In my opinion (which, again, differs from that of the majority), this decision is in full conformity with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as far as the principle of judicial impartiality is concerned. Such conformity may be affirmed on two grounds: firstly, because the decision was itself taken by a \u201ctribunal\u201d meeting the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (since no doubt at all has been cast on the fact that the Constitutional Court judges were impartial); and, secondly, because the issue of the impartiality of the Pazin court, brought to the attention of a Constitutional Court with the power to quash the allegedly unlawful judgment (see, for instance, mutatis mutandis, S\u00fcssmann v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 20024/92, \u00a7 41 et. seq., and in particular \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 1996-IV; Kyprianou v.

The most common remedy, however, is a request for recusal, the omission of which has been noted by the Government. Regardless of the differences between such remedies, the case-law of our Court states that the existence of national procedures for ensuring impartiality, namely rules governing the withdrawal of judges, is a relevant factor in assessing the impartiality of national tribunals. As our Court has found in the past, such rules manifest the national legislature\u2019s concern to remove all reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the judge and constitute an attempt to ensure impartiality by eliminating the causes of such concerns. In addition to ensuring the absence of actual bias, they are directed at removing any appearance of partiality, and so serve to promote the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public. Our Court takes such rules into account when making its own assessment as to whether a tribunal was impartial and, in particular, whether the applicant\u2019s fears can be held to be objectively justified (see, for instance, mutatis mutandis, Pescador Valero v. Spain, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a7 24-29, ECHR\u00a02003-VII; Micallef, cited above, \u00a7 99; and Pasquini v. San Marino, no. 50956/16, \u00a7 144, 2 May 2019).",

Aside from the possible difficulty of identifying persons by name only, one should also consider that the applicant has a surname different from his mother\u2019s and that in the previous set of proceedings the judge had been able to recognise the applicant as his mother\u2019s son only after a recusal clarifying the issue had been filed with the court. In saying this, I regret that I further disagree with my distinguished colleagues of the majority, who found that the judge had been aware of the circumstances and should therefore have reported the situation to the president of the court (see paragraph 45 of the judgment). I do not need to recall, in this context, the reasons for which the personal impartiality of the judge is presumed. However, I do need to state that, in my opinion, the previous withdrawal from another case, in the particular setting of that case (which was conducted in a \u201csmall claims\u201d court and in absentia), cannot constitute enough evidence to rebut this presumption.",

In my opinion, failure to comply with the rules concerning selfdisqualification should in principle constitute sufficient reason for the parties to request a recusal, so that, in the absence of such a request by the interested party, any impact of the aforementioned failure on the lawfulness of the proceedings and decision, as well as on their compliance with Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1, should normally be excluded.",

One example that comes to mind is that of a member of the judiciary deciding a case even if he or she has a direct and personal interest in it, placing him or her substantially in the position of a party to the proceedings. In such cases the violation would be blatant, in that the decision was given a non iudice, that is, by a tribunal so evidently lacking impartiality that the decision was in rem propriam.",

In view of this link, I would not underestimate the risk to the independence of national judges which the majority\u2019s decision entails. Litigants who have not duly requested the recusal of a judge in their domestic system might raise issues of bias directly before our Court, even on the basis of minor suspicions different from the serious ones I just mentioned. In most systems, the delicate position of the judge is protected from suspicions of bias raised at a late stage by the provision of specific remedies subject to strict deadlines for challenging impartiality, which otherwise is to be presumed. A judge whose impartiality is subject to public scrutiny for too long is less independent, as he or she may fear that, at all stages of the procedure, justice administered by a judge may be transformed into justice trying the judge. It is true that, in the case at hand, the Croatian system offered a domestic remedy in the form of a complaint to the Constitutional Court (a complaint whose role, as I said, could be further clarified vis-\u00e0-vis the role of a request for recusal). But this is not true for all European systems, in many of which the only remedy is an application for recusal (and, if recusal is not requested, bias may no longer be a ground for appeal). The non-existence in many countries of domestic remedies other than an application for recusal, therefore, entails the danger \u2013 given that the majority substantially considered a previous application for recusal to be unnecessary \u2013 that national judges may be placed in the uncomfortable situation of seeing their impartiality directly challenged in Strasbourg.",
