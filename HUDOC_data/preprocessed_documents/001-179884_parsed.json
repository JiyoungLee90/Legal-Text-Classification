The court further held that Z.B. had complained about the bailiff\u2019s eviction notice about the forced eviction but had also asked that the execution proceedings be suspended and the eviction postponed. The court held that Z.B. had already asked the bailiff to suspend the eviction but the bailiff had refused to satisfy this request.

The Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the applicants should have started new court proceedings for damages if they had considered the eviction process flawed on account of the authorities\u2019 actions. It is the Court\u2019s view that a new set of court proceedings would only have delayed the outcome of the eviction process without necessarily bringing any tangible result (see Pauk\u0161tis v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 17467/07, \u00a7 56, 24 November 2015, Kavaliauskas and Others v.

Moreover, the legal action advanced by the Government constitutes a purely compensatory remedy and even if the domestic courts had ruled in favour of the applicants, such a decision would only have produced the same results, the only outcome being confirmation of the judgment\u2019s legal force enabling the bailiff to proceed with the enforcement proceedings, and would not have offered appropriate protection in respect of the applicants\u2019 complaint.",

They claimed that Z.B. and G.B.\u2019s numerous complaints to the authorities had to be examined following the procedure provided for by law, taking into account the interests of all the relevant parties to the proceedings. The authorities had to balance the right of Z.B. and G.B. to respect for their home on one hand and the right of the applicants to peacefully enjoy their possessions on the other. While acknowledging the delayed enforcement of the decision of the \u0160iauliai District Court of 21 December 2011 (see paragraph 7 above), the Government stated that the behaviour of Z.B. and G.B. had to be taken into account also when assessing the question of proportionality. In this context, the Government submitted that the bailiff had immediately taken action to enforce the judgment of the \u0160iauliai District Court on forced eviction (see paragraph 7 above) by issuing repeated notices to Z.B. and G.B. to vacate the house and, when that had been unsuccessful \u2013 by issuing notices of forced eviction. The bailiff also drew the courts\u2019 attention to the fact that Z.B. had possibly abused his procedural rights. However, the domestic courts had not taken that into account. The Government further stated that the bailiff had tried to help the applicants by advising the first applicant to lodge court proceedings in order to be able to evict other persons temporarily present in the house (see paragraph 21 above). Furthermore, the bailiff had asked Z.B. to submit the relevant documents concerning G.B.\u2019s illness, had asked Z.B.\u2019s daughter and the Children\u2019s Rights Protection Service about the place of residence of Z.B.\u2019s granddaughter. Numerous applications submitted by Z.B. and G.B. had to be thoroughly examined by the domestic courts, seeking to carefully balance the competing interests of the debtors and the applicants. After the court had concluded that Z.B. had been seeking to delay the enforcement of the judgment of the court and the court then had urged the bailiff to continue the eviction proceedings (see paragraph 25 above), the eviction had taken place straight away (see paragraph 28 above). The Government concluded that it had been Z.B. and not the authorities who had delayed the eviction proceedings by submitting numerous complaints, sometimes even false information, which the courts had had to examine nevertheless.",

The Court further notes that the applicants were able to challenge the actions of the bailiff, which they successfully did (see paragraph 25 above). As soon as the decision of the \u0160iauliai District Court of 16 August 2013 became final, the forced eviction took place and the second applicant, who was the owner of the house at the time, was able to take possession thereof (see paragraph 28 above). Moreover, the applicants have received and are still receiving payments of EUR 289 for every month from 28\u00a0December\u00a02010 until the eviction of Z.B. and G.B. from the house on 18\u00a0November 2013, an amount that, as it appears, has not been challenged before the courts (see paragraph\u00a07 above). Lastly, the second applicant was assigned as the property manager of the goods that had been left in the house, and Z.B. and G.B. were given three months to take their belongings that had not been seized (see paragraph 32 above). As they had failed to do so, the property was sold in accordance with domestic law (see paragraph 50 above). The second applicant did not object to his assignment as the property manager of the moveable property of Z.B. and G.B., as he submitted no such complaint before the domestic courts or the Court. Moreover, the goods that had not been seized were removed from the house in due time.",
