According to the inflation calculation tool provided on the website of the Turkish Central Bank that amount would have been worth approximately TRY 122,305 in January 2010. However, the applicants received a total of TRY\u00a0133,830 on 22 January 2010 (see paragraph 13 above). The legal interest applied to the award therefore sufficiently offset the negative effects of inflation, contrary to the arguments of the applicants (see, mutatis mutandis, Ciddi v. Turkey (dec.), no. 7280/13, 13 March 2018).",
