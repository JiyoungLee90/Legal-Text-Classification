As far as the second applicant was concerned, it can be accepted that he only got involved in order to help his brother whom he thought to be, along with the whole family, at great risk of retaliation from the Dutch drug dealer (see paragraph 18 above).

It is therefore hard to discern on what basis the operation was mounted and whether the authorities had a good reason to instigate the operation. On the basis of the information in the file the Court notes that the first applicant had no relevant prior criminal record, and the mere fact that he was a drug user could not justify the police intervention (see, mutatis mutandis, Constantin and Stoian, cited above, \u00a7 55). As regards the financial gain sought by the first applicant from the sale of drugs, it appears that from the first batch of drugs, besides the tablets sold to the infiltrated agent (160 of the 250 tablets) he either gave away most of the remaining tablets or consumed them himself (see paragraphs 6, 7 and 17 above). No other potential buyer was either identified or even mentioned by the police investigation.",

Certainly it was the first applicant who showed the ability to obtain more drugs on a short notice, but the Court cannot but note the significant role played by the undercover agent in arranging the next deal, which runs counter to the requirement of passivity on the State agent\u2019s part. The undercover agent was the main buyer of the first batch of drugs and, although the crime had already been committed, he insisted that the first applicant bring in more drugs to sell exclusively to him. He renewed his offer, was insistent, and threatened the first applicant that he would take his business elsewhere if drugs were not produced rapidly.",
