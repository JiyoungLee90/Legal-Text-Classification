The Court cannot overlook the fact that as far back as 5\u00a0June 1995 civil proceedings had been instituted by the initial owners whose property had been nationalised during the communist era. It follows that there was only a rather short period when the applicant could have reasonably considered himself as being the undisputed owner of the land (see, by converse implication, Panikian v. Bulgaria, cited above). What is more, as early as 27 June 1995 the Kaunas District Court ordered the seizure of the applicant\u2019s land, allowing him to grow only annual plants and at the same time prohibiting him from carrying out any long-term agricultural or construction activities on that land while the court proceedings were pending. In this relation the Court notes that there was some activity at the plot \u2013 perennial plants were planted and a pond was dug (see paragraph 17 above). It is not for the Court to speculate as to whether those actions were completed by the time the Kaunas District Court issued its injunction, or after that ban. The Court can only note that the applicant\u2019s title to the plot of land was annulled in 2003 and that therefore during that period he was not prevented from making use of the plot and the pond as well as enjoying the fruits of the plants which, under Article 6.151 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code, he did not have to return to the lawful owners of that land.",

This was one of the arguments prompting the Court to find a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention (see Pinc and Pincov\u00e1, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61-64). That reasoning, however, does not apply to the present case, where the restitution process in particular aimed at protecting the rights of former owners (see paragraph 18 above). What is more, the applicant had another dwelling, had not built a house on the plot of land at issue and, in addition, was explicitly prohibited from doing so by the domestic courts pending the civil litigation. It follows that as regards the possibility to have a roof above his head the applicant was not placed in a particularly vulnerable situation and therefore did not have to bear an excessive burden which would have upset the fair balance that should be maintained between the demands of the general interest on the one hand and protection of the right to protection of property on the other.",

It is true that some of the defendants in that case complained that they would have no use for \u201csingle-use investment vouchers\u201d. However, as is clear from the material before the Court, the applicant purchased the land in roubles, whereas the courts ordered restitution in litas, which is the Lithuanian currency after 1993.

It is the role of the domestic courts to interpret and apply the relevant rules of procedural and substantive law (see, among many authorities, Baumann v. Austria, no. 76809/01, \u00a7 49, 7 October 2004). The Court notes, however, that in the present case the courts did give detailed reasoning, addressing every relevant objection raised by the applicant and explaining their factual findings and the interpretation of the law.",

It must be borne in mind that on 19\u00a0June 2002 the applicant\u2019s lawyer already knew that the hearing of the appellate court would take place on 27\u00a0June 2002. She requested the  to postpone the hearing because she had another court hearing at that time; however, as observed by the Supreme Court, she failed to bring any proof in that connection (see paragraph 21 above). The Court sees no reason to depart from the Supreme Court\u2019s findings, which were based on its direct knowledge of the facts of the case. Consequently, the applicant\u2019s complaints that there has been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention cannot be entertained and should be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 thereof.",
