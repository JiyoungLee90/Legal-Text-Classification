Within several minutes his team was ready and equipped. When they arrived at the scene, he noted that the flat was on the ground floor, surrounded by abundant vegetation, with the blinds down. He was informed by a police officer that the electricity had been cut off inside the flat, that the persons inside might be in possession of firearms and that the suspect\u2019s wife was actively resisting the police. Because there was a lot of sunlight outside and it was dark inside (the electricity had been disconnected in the flat, which was on the first floor and poorly lit by daylight), it was decided to immobilise completely whoever was inside in order to prevent the use of arms.

The fact is that, given the information about the presence of firearms in the flat, the officers could not be entirely sure that the danger to their lives and safety had disappeared until such time as they had secured all the occupants of the flat. When they entered the apartment they could not have known that the applicant was in a state of shock and barely able to control her movements.

In the Court\u2019s view, at that point it can no longer be said that the officers were acting in the heat of the moment or that they could still have held a genuine belief that their lives or safety were endangered. As acknowledged by Officer O.R. and the Government, the applicant had been afraid to the point of hysteria and could barely control the movement of her arms (see paragraph 13 above). In such circumstances, it is highly doubtful that the officer who saw the applicant raise her head felt any kind of danger when forcing her down with his boot. Rather, this appears to have been a form of reprisal against the applicant for disobeying the order to remain still and thus witnessing the alleged ill-treatment of her husband (see, mutatis mutandis, Dedovskiy and Others v.

Moreover, when it was eventually decided to call the special forces, the latter were completely unaware of the operation until the unit commander was called at around 1.45 p.m. Thereafter, the unit scrambled to the scene and received summary information about the situation in the flat, and had to make its own assessment of the situation on the spot (see paragraph 13 above). This means that the unit had to improvise many of its actions, making the possibility of the use of excessive force more likely than if the entire operation had been thoroughly planned.",
