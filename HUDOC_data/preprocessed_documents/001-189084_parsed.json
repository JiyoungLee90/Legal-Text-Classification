He complained about the fact that no identification parade had been carried out: this would have allowed the applicant to identify the police officers who had ill-treated him during the arrest. Nor was this done in respect of the time after he was transferred to the Special Operations Unit, where he had stayed for about seven hours. He also noted that he had requested footage from the video surveillance cameras in the street where the arrest operation had taken place, but that his request had received no response. By a letter of 15 January 2009 the prosecutor dealing with the case informed the applicant\u2019s lawyer that the investigation was still pending, and that in view of the conflicting evidence it was impossible to establish whether the force used against the applicant during the arrest had been proportionate or not. The applicant\u2019s lawyer was also informed that the surveillance cameras in question had not been working on the day of the applicant\u2019s arrest, so no video recording could have been obtained.",

There were more than ten armed police officers involved. The applicant was suspected of possession of illegal drugs (see the relevant police report cited in paragraph 5 above). There was no indication, and the Government did not plead to the contrary, that the applicant posed a threat to the police officers. Furthermore, according to the relevant police reports, the applicant did not attempt to run away. He was forced out of his car and pushed immediately to the ground. At no stage was it claimed that any of the police officers were injured, a factor which might have been relevant to assessing whether in fact the applicant had resorted to violence. In such circumstances, particularly given the pre-planned nature of the operation (see in this respect Bal\u00e7\u0131k and Others v. Turkey, no. 25/03, \u00a7\u00a032, 29 November 2007, and Rehbock v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 29462/95, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2000XII) and the fact that the police officers clearly outnumbered the unarmed applicant and his friend, the nature and scale of the injuries sustained by the applicant do not appear commensurate with the circumstances of his arrest.",

They claimed that the applicant had continued the resistance even after being forced to the ground. While this could serve as a plausible explanation for the applicant\u2019s multiple bruises and scratches in the area of his knees and elbows (the applicant was wearing shorts and a short-sleeved shirt during the arrest), questions remain as to the applicant\u2019s black and swollen eyes and the fracture of his face. In this connection the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant was never charged with resisting police officers (see paragraph 13 above). In such circumstances, the official version, namely that the applicant had sustained all the multiple injuries as a result of proportionate use of force used to suppress his resistance, does not appear convincing to the Court.",

The consequence of such use of force was injuries which caused suffering to the applicant of a nature amounting to inhuman treatment (see Mikiashvili, \u00a7 76; Rehbock, \u00a7 77; and Davitidze, \u00a7 96, all cited above).",

Furthermore, in view of the requirement that any use of physical force by State officials during an arrest must never be excessive and must be essential in the particular circumstances, the Court considers that the above facts called for an investigation of the applicant\u2019s allegations of illtreatment in order to establish all relevant circumstances of the use of physical force against him.",

The forensic examination of the applicant, and the examination of three of the arresting police officers, were also conducted within a couple of days (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above).

Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09 and\u00a02\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a0323, ECHR 2014 (extracts), and Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0133).
