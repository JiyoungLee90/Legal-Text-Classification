Moreover, the applicants submitted numerous observations, which alternatively extended or limited the subject-matter of the proceedings.

The adjournments of 5 April 1995 and 29 November 1995 were justified because the reporting judge had to take into consideration the additional observations of the applicants submitted on 5 January 1994. The adjournment of 8 May 1996 was justified by the fact that the applicants had challenged some further acts and submitted new evidence. The remaining four adjournments until 21\u00a0May 1997 were justified by the need for the reporting judge to correlate the application of 6 April 1993 with a previous application introduced on 3\u00a0August 1992. All these adjournments were to the benefit of the applicants who had thus the opportunity to improve the grounds of appeal contained in their original application. It should be stressed that the application of 6 April 1993 was manifestly ill-founded because it challenged acts which had not an executory character. As a result, the applicants submitted further observations on 24 September 1997 and 6 October 1997.
