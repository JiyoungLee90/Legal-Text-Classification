He asked the Administrative Court to establish that, by keeping him in poor living conditions, Tallinn Prison was acting unlawfully. By a judgment of 15\u00a0September 2009 the Administrative Court dismissed the complaint. It referred, inter alia, to the Tallinn Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 21 October 2008 (see paragraph 20 above), and noted that the applicant had in the meantime undergone medical examinations by a neurologist and a rehabilitation specialist. The latter had taught him special exercises. However, the doctors had not given any instructions to the prison to ensure special conditions or equipment for the applicant, such as the use of a gym. The applicant could do the exercises recommended to him in his cell or in the exercise yard. The Administrative Court concluded that the applicant should have been able to do the exercises in the framework of the applicable prison regime. The size of the applicant\u2019s cell \u2013 15 square metres for six detainees \u2013 had been in line with the Internal Prison Rules (Vangla sisekorraeeskiri), according to which there had to be at least 2.5 square metres of floor space per prisoner.",

However, it considered that the applicant had not proved that Tallinn Prison was responsible for the deterioration of his health. He had had the possibility of independently doing the exercises recommended by the doctors without the use of a gym or special equipment. The free floor surface of 6.5\u00a0square metres was in itself not insufficient for doing physical exercise. It was clear that not all the detainees could have used that surface at the same time but they could have agreed among themselves who wanted to do exercises and when.

The Court has also taken note of the applicant\u2019s argument that he had not received rehabilitation treatment of sufficient quality, and, as a result his health had deteriorated. However, the Court considers that this complaint, too, in substance related to the lack of sufficient space to do the physical exercises. In other words, the applicant did not complain of the inadequacy of the medical assistance as such, but rather that he had had no possibility to do the recommended exercises.",

According to the information provided by the Government, there had been 2.55 square metres of floor area per inmate (excluding the toilet area) at the time the cell accommodated six detainees. According to the applicant, the floor area per person had been 2.38 or 2.5 square metres. However, the Court considers that it does not need to determine this issue, regard being had to the fact that, in any event, the personal space available to the applicant was less than 3\u00a0square metres. In the Court\u2019s opinion, this area, which also included the furniture, was so limited as to create in itself a strong presumption that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention amounted to degrading treatment and were in breach of Article 3. Considering that the applicant was confined in the cell round the clock with the exception of one hour of daily outdoor exercise time in a yard of about 15 square metres, to be shared with five other persons, the Court finds that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention amounted to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. This conclusion is not affected by the fact that the applicant did not raise complaints about other aspects of the detention conditions in his cell or in the prison in general.",
