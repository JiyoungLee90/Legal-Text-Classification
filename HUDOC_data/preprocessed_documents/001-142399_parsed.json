He maintained before the administrative court that the deportation order was unlawful, in view of his marriage to a Turkish citizen and possession of a residence permit valid until May 2010. The unlawful deportation order had moreover not been communicated to him at any point, nor had the Ministry sought his response prior to its delivery. The State authorities had similarly not put forward any concrete evidence to demonstrate why his continued presence in Turkey was perceived as a threat to national security. The applicant claimed that in the event of his deportation to Israel or elsewhere, his right to life and right to liberty and security would be put at risk, that he would face torture or even death at the hands of Israeli forces or their collaborators, and that the unity of his family would be destroyed. Furthermore, his medical treatment would be stopped, causing irreversible harm to his health. The applicant lastly complained that his detention was unlawful, and also maintained that the conditions of his detention at the Kumkap\u0131 Foreigners\u2019 Admission and Accommodation Centre were highly degrading, in view of the lack of basic infrastructure to accommodate people with disabilities in his situation. As he was not able to use the squat toilet available at the place of detention, he had to be taken to a hotel nearby by police officers each time he had to relieve himself. It appears that his wife was occasionally able to accompany them to the hotel. His medical treatment was also stopped during his detention there, which was likely to result in the worsening of his condition.",

If the Ministry went through with its decision, his physical integrity would be irreparably damaged on account of the termination of the medical treatment he was undergoing in Istanbul. Furthermore, his deportation would disrupt the family life he had since established in Turkey, and would deprive him of the vital assistance and care undertaken by his wife. In addition, if deported he would most certainly be subjected to torture by Israeli forces and his life would be put at risk.

Treatment has been held by the Court to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch, and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering. Treatment has been considered \u201cdegrading\u201d when it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their physical or moral resistance. Furthermore, in considering whether treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a03, one of the factors which the Court will take into account is the question whether its object was to humiliate and debase the person concerned, although the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see Jalloh v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a054810/00, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2006IX).",

A remedy must be made available during a person\u2019s detention to allow the individual to obtain speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of the detention. That review should be capable of leading, where appropriate, to release (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia, cited above, \u00a7 139). The forms of judicial review satisfying the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 may vary from one domain to another, and will depend on the type of deprivation of liberty in issue. Nonetheless, whatever the form of judicial review may be, it is essential that the competent domestic court or body expressly pronounce on the question of the lawfulness of a deprivation of liberty when so requested. Moreover, the question whether a person\u2019s right under Article 5 \u00a7 4 has been respected has to be determined in the light of the particular circumstances of each case.",

This is despite the fact that there was clearly no legal basis for the applicant\u2019s detention, as established under Article 5 \u00a7 1 above. The Court stresses that the Ankara Administrative Court was in an even better position than the Strasbourg Court to observe this lack of legal basis in domestic law governing the procedure for detention pending deportation (see, mutatis mutandis, Athary v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 50372/09, \u00a7 41, 11 December 2012).",

Moreover, unlike in some other cases where the applicants were released within a matter of hours before any judicial scrutiny of their detention could in practice have taken place (see, for example, Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7\u00a045, Series\u00a0A no. 182; Slivenko v.

In fact, the administrative court could reasonably have been expected to rule on the unlawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention on that very day, if for no other reason than that its interim decision, by its very nature, had the automatic effect of rendering the detention absolutely groundless, regardless of whatever legal regime it may have been governed by before.",

Despite these limitations of the interim measure, the Court notes that there have been no further attempts to remove the applicant on the grounds of national security since then to any third countries that were willing to accept him, even after the applicant withdrew his application for refugee status from the UNHCR. Moreover, whereas in the initial period following the quashing of the deportation order the applicant was granted short-term residence permits not exceeding six months, on 18 March 2013 the General Security Directorate of the Ministry finally decided to grant the applicant a long-term temporary residence permit, valid for one year with the possibility of renewal, on the strength of the genuine family life he had established in Turkey.",

Nevertheless, in immigration matters, where there is an arguable claim that expulsion threatens to interfere with the alien\u2019s right to respect for his private and family life, Article 13 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention requires that States must make available to the individual concerned the effective possibility of challenging the deportation order and of having the relevant issues examined with sufficient procedural safeguards and thoroughness by an appropriate domestic forum offering adequate guarantees of independence and impartiality (see De Souza Ribeiro, cited above, \u00a7 83).",

There were policemen (as well as the applicant\u2019s wife, on occasion) readily available to assist the applicant, and the hotel facilities to which he was carried by the policemen were not located at a very great distance. In fact the distance could have been the same within the detention facility, requiring the same help from the policemen. The applicant\u2019s detention under these conditions lasted only seven days, and its short duration should not have been discounted when assessing whether the treatment constituted a violation. Were the Court to apply its standards and impose a positive obligation on States to provide accessible detention facilities for persons with disabilities, for example under Article 8 in conjunction with Article 14, I would have no difficulties in applying those considerations to the present case. But the treatment of the applicant, while far from ideal, does not meet the threshold of inhuman or degrading treatment required by Article 3.",

These considerations apply for the period the applicant was detained and actually faced deportation. In a deportation case in which the deportation has been stayed and the applicant has arguable victim status, it appears entirely speculative to comment on the lack of an effective remedy were the domestic proceedings or the detention to have continued. It would be another matter if the deportation proceedings had progressed further and the applicant had subsequently found himself without an effective remedy. Given that these were not the circumstances of this case after the applicant\u2019s release, I find it difficult to vote in favour of a violation of the right to an effective remedy where the need for such remedy was obviated to some extent by the outcome or staying of the proceedings.",
