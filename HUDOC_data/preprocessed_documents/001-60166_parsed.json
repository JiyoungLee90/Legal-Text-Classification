That did not mean that the bodies responsible for deciding legal aid applications conducted a detailed analysis of the merits of the applicant's arguments. On the contrary, their task was confined to eliminating appeals that were based solely on arguments that were incapable of constituting a valid ground of appeal against the impugned decision. Instances of this were to be found, firstly, in cases in which the arguments challenged issues that were within the sole discretion of the tribunals of fact. In that connection, the Government pointed out that appeals to the Court of Cassation were in a special category, as the Court of Cassation decided only issues of law, not fact. Other examples were to be found in cases in which it was immediately apparent from the documents in the file that the argument was seriously flawed or, a fortiori, in which the notice of appeal disclosed no ground of appeal.",

Belgium (judgment of 30 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-V, pp. 1964-65, \u00a7 60), in which similar bodies had determined whether the applicant's appeal was \u201c[currently] well-founded\u201d, that is to say whether it was founded. The latter test was therefore stricter than that used in the French system, in which legal aid was only refused for grounds of appeal that were unsustainable. On that subject, the Government said that following the Court's judgment in Aerts, the Belgian legislature had amended the provisions on legal aid, which now provided, in wording similar to that of the French statute, that only \u201cmanifestly ill-founded applications shall be refused\u201d.",

The Legal Aid Office was composed of judges, lawyers, civil servants and members of the public. That diversity ensured that it had due regard to the demands of the proper administration of justice and the rights of the defence, in particular to free access to a court. The suggestion that the decisions of the Legal Aid Office reflected a policy of unfairly depriving applicants for legal aid of access to the courts was untenable. The right of appeal to the President of the Court of Cassation against decisions of the Legal Aid Office, which was afforded by section 23 of the Law of 10 July 1991, guaranteed an objective scrutiny of the proposed grounds of appeal to the Court of Cassation. It enabled applicants for legal aid to contest the Legal Aid Office's assessment of the validity of their arguments and, if applicable, to demonstrate that it was ill-founded. The Government consequently submitted that the system used by the Legal Aid Office of the Court of Cassation and the President of that court for examining legal aid applications, pursuant to the Law on legal aid, did not in itself contravene the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

That criterion was \u201cobjective\u201d and was applied without any examination of the merits of the appeal. Its purpose was to avoid legal aid being granted in cases where the appeal was manifestly bound to fail. Thus, in the instant case, the letters sent by the applicant to the Legal Aid Office showed that she had at no stage set out her reasons for appealing to the Court of Cassation or, a fortiori, any ground of appeal on points of law, despite the fact that Article 33 of the decree of 1991 required applicants for legal aid to set out \u201cthe purpose of the application and a brief summary of the reasons\u201d. Quite obviously, the authorities responsible for examining the application for legal aid were obliged in the absence of any indication of the ground of appeal on points of law to rule that there were no arguable grounds of appeal. In any event, the applicant's letters to the registry of the Court showed that her complaints against the Court of Appeal concerned its refusal to allow her to rely on the \u201cexceptional hardship\u201d clause contained in Article 240 of the Civil Code. However, it was the settled case-law of the Court of Cassation that the issue of exceptional hardship lay within the sole discretion of the tribunals of fact. Consequently, even if the applicant had relied on a violation of Article 240 of the Civil Code as a ground of appeal to the Court of Cassation, it would have carried no weight before the Court of Cassation and could not be regarded as an arguable ground of appeal. The Government submitted in conclusion that the application was manifestly ill-founded.",

Admittedly, as the Court said in 1979, the States have a free choice of the means to be used towards this end and are not compelled to provide for the assistance of a lawyer unless such assistance proves indispensable for an effective access to court either because legal representation is rendered compulsory, as is done by the domestic law of certain Contracting States for various types of litigation, or by reason of the complexity of the procedure (see Airey v. Ireland, judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no.\u00a032, pp. 14-16, \u00a7 26). That was the position in the present case. The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 that the Legal Aid Office of the Court of Cassation and subsequently the President of that court had refused her application for legal aid, despite acknowledging that she satisfied the means test, on the ground that \u201cno arguable ground of appeal [could] be made out\u201d.",

Belgium (judgment of 30 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-V), in which it had found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, noted that \u201cthere is no doubt that the fact that Mr Aerts was required to have legal representation [by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar] was decisive\u201d. Indeed, the Court explained that the reason for this was that litigants in cases concerning educative assistance measures were exempted from the requirement of representation by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar and that the refusal of legal aid did not ipso facto prevent them from pursuing their appeal (Gnahor\u00e9, cited above, \u00a7 39). However, in the instant case, it is common ground that the applicant was required to be represented by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar and could not therefore conduct her appeal without the assistance of a specialised lawyer. The Court's finding that there has been no violation of Article 6 of the Convention therefore quite clearly marks a departure from its previous case-law. We find it surprising that a Chamber should thus decline to follow two previous decisions (Airey and Aerts), as such a major change to the case-law is within the sole province of the Grand Chamber.",

It is not for the Court, whose task is to ensure compliance with the rights guaranteed by the Convention and their implementation, to determine the inherent validity or not of choices made by the national legislatures and in a number of decisions concerning, notably, length-of-proceedings cases it has declined to take the budgetary implications of a finding a violation into account.",

However, that is clearly the position in the present case, since only the least well-off litigants, those who have to apply for legal aid, are subjected to a prior scrutiny of the merits of their ground of appeal to the Court of Cassation. Unless there is an \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d for it, such difference in treatment may amount to discrimination. No system may impair the essence of the right of a particular class of litigant to a court, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, and the existence of safeguards, even substantive ones, against abuse of the system intended, as the present judgment notes, to afford protection from arbitrariness, will not suffice to compensate for any such impairment (see paragraph 26 of the judgment).",

Even though not of direct relevance to the present case, it is worth observing that where, as in Gnahor\u00e9, appellants are permitted to pursue their proceedings in the Court of Cassation despite being refused legal aid, the court will necessarily have a \u201cpreconception\u201d of the merits of the grounds of appeal, putting such appellants at a disadvantage in comparison to appellants who have not applied for legal aid. In addition, even in cases in which parties are permitted to pursue proceedings before the Court of Cassation without representation by a specialised lawyer, the real prospects of their being able to do so on equal terms needs to be put into its proper perspective for, as the President of the French Court of Cassation has observed: \u201cStatistically, the prospects of success of an appeal to the Court of Cassation are far higher if the appellant is assisted by such an officer of the court.\u201d [G.

The Government concluded: \u201cQuite obviously, the authorities responsible for examining the application for legal aid were obliged in the absence of any indication of the ground of appeal on points of law to rule that there were no arguable grounds of appeal\u201d (see paragraph 18 of the judgment). Unless one considers the drafting of an arguable ground of appeal on points of law to be within the grasp of all litigants, quod non, it seems perverse to suggest that the applicant, who was unassisted by counsel, was to blame for her inability to formulate an arguable ground of appeal to the Court of Cassation. It is precisely the technical and highly specialised nature of proceedings in the Court of Cassation that justifies, in our view, requiring appellants to seek the assistance of members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar.",
