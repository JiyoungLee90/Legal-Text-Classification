The Court notes that the first set of proceedings in the present case lasted until 15\u00a0September 1998, when the applicant was re-instated following the Supreme Court of Justice's final judgment (see paragraph 9 above). Following further dismissals and re-instatements, the applicant was again dismissed on 17\u00a0July 1999. However, throughout the period between 15\u00a0September 1998 and 17 July 1999 and thereafter the authorities considered that the judgment of 5 February 1997 had not been enforced properly (see paragraphs 10 to 12 and 15 above). It follows that on the date of the applicant's dismissal on 17 July 1999 she had still not been properly re-instated. Hence, the annulment of that latest dismissal (see paragraph 13 above), did not change the fact that the 1997 judgment had still not been enforced. In fact, the judgment of 8 December 1999 resulted in the same order to properly re-instate the applicant in her position as chief accountant, that is, the same outcome as in the 1997 proceedings. The Court considers that the fact that a new judgment was adopted regarding an additional period of the applicant's unlawful dismissal subsequent to the original judgment does not mean that the period of time during which the original set of proceedings had lasted should be excluded from the overall length of the proceedings in the present case.",

What the parties referred to as the third set of proceedings in fact represents a re-hearing of the case which was examined in the second set of proceedings and must thus be considered as part of the overall length of proceedings. The courts eventually decided that the second order of 11 December 1999 which re-instated the applicant in the specific position had represented enforcement of the judgment in her favour (see paragraphs 28 and 31 above).

However, it is to be noted that the person preventing the enforcement of the court judgments in the present case was the director of a public theatre which was directly subordinated to and funded by the Ministry. Accordingly, the State had a greater range of avenues in obliging the employer to abide by the judgment than if the matter had concerned a private entity. While there were some attempts to sanction the theatre director (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above), they remained limited to relatively small administrative fines, some of which were, moreover, annulled by the courts (see paragraph 17 above), while criminal proceedings never resulted in charges and a judgment. It follows that, faced with the theatre director's overt refusal to abide by final court judgments, the courts did very little to sanction him.",
