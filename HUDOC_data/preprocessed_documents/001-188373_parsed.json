The Court reiterates that at the time when the applicant brought her complaint about the length of proceedings to the Court, that is in July 2007, there was no effective remedy under Russian law capable of affording redress for the non-enforcement of domestic judgments imposing either monetary obligations or obligations in kind on the domestic authorities (see Burdov v.\u00a0Russia (no.\u00a02), no.\u00a033509/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0101-17, ECHR 2009, and Gerasimov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a029920/05 and 10\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0157-66, 1\u00a0July 2014). As regards the domestic remedies introduced by the Compensation Act in 2010 and 2017, the Court reiterates its settled approach that in any event it would be unfair to request the applicants whose cases have already been pending for many years in the domestic system and who have come to seek relief at the Court to bring again their claims before domestic tribunals (see Burdov (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7\u00a0144, and Gerasimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0230).
