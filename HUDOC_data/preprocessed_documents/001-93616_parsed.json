There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article\u00a06 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, first, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, second, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v.

Furthermore, the applicant failed to apply for a ruling by the court to accelerate the disciplinary proceedings as provided for by Article 61 of the Code which would have enabled the Administrative Court to impose a time-limit for the submission of the charges or the discontinuation of the proceedings if it considered that the proceedings had been unreasonably long (see paragraph 31 above). In so far as the applicant alleged that such an application would have been dismissed, the Court considers that even where there are doubts as to a domestic remedy's chances of success, that remedy must be tried (see, mutatis mutandis, Kaja v. Greece, no. 32927/03, \u00a7 54, 27 July 2006). The Court also notes that, apart from his failure to use the aforementioned remedies, the applicant did not contribute otherwise to the length of the proceedings.",

In this connection the Court observes that the Government did not submit any plausible reason for the suspension of the disciplinary proceedings until 3 May 1995 although the parallel criminal proceedings had already ended on 12 December 1991. Furthermore, the President of the Court of Appeal ordered the compilation of the applicant's charges on 25\u00a0August 1997, that is more than six months after the final report had been drawn up on 5 February 1997. The Court accepts that a delay in the preparation of the charges was caused by the ill-health of the prosecutor who had to withdraw on 17 October 1997. However, it considers that the period of almost two years between this force majeure circumstance and the finalisation of the charges was too long. Lastly, a period of three months elapsed between the finalisation of the charges and their receipt by the  and a delay of six months was caused by the remittal of the charges to the Frankfurt Court of Appeal for the correction of mistakes.",

Given the need for bailiffs in the newly-created regions (L\u00e4nder) during that period he argued that he would have found a new position as court bailiff with relative ease. Therefore the following pecuniary damages were directly linked to the length of the proceedings: loss of fees granted for fulfilling his responsibilities (EUR 164,818.89), loss of reimbursement of clerical expenses (EUR 61,077.06), loss of reimbursement of travel expenses (EUR\u00a0138,002.58), loss of lump sums for printing official forms (EUR\u00a015,209.53), damages resulting from the loss of promotion to a higher position (EUR 19,837.62), loss of his official supplement (Amtszulage) (EUR 24,818.94), and loss of remuneration as of August 2003 (EUR\u00a051,573.75).
