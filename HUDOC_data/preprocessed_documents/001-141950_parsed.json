They also complained about the refusal of the trial court to admit expert opinions submitted by the defence in evidence and obtain a new expert examination of the condition of Ms S.D. On 25\u00a0March 2010 the Khabarovsk Regional Court upheld the conviction. The court of appeal did not find any breach of the domestic substantive or procedural law in the proceedings before the trial court. The Regional Court ruled, inter alia, that the defence had conceded to the reading out of the previous testimony of the alleged victim and her relatives. The Regional Court noted that the record of Ms S.D.\u2019s questioning by the investigator was a reliable source of information because when she had given that evidence she had not been suffering from a mental condition.",

Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Luc\u00e0 v.

First, it had to be established that there was a good reason for the non-attendance of the witness. Second, even where there was a good reason, where a conviction was based solely or to a decisive extent on statements made by a person whom the accused had had no opportunity to examine, the rights of the defence might be restricted to an extent incompatible with the guarantees of Article 6. Accordingly, when the evidence of an absent witness was the sole or decisive basis for a conviction, sufficient counterbalancing factors were required, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, which permitted a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 119 and 147).",

The decision of the national judges not to call Ms\u00a0S.D. to testify was based on two medical certificates issued in January 2006 and March 2007, which stated that her appearance in court was not recommended since it might cause a relapse (see paragraphs 58 and 88 above). Thus, the judge\u2019s decision not to call Ms S.D. to testify in person was based on the known facts of the case and supported by the doctors\u2019 opinion. The Court is prepared to accept that the decision at issue was not arbitrary (cf. Vronchenko v.

Their case was built upon other arguments which pertained to the examination of medical issues (namely, the existence of a causal link between Ms S.D.\u2019s mental disorder and her participation in the programme) and legal issues (determination of the \u201cmedical\u201d nature of the practices used by the associations). It is unlikely that Ms S.D., as a lay person, would have been able to elucidate on either of those points.

At the same time, the Court will not lose sight of a distinction which is made in the Russian law between two forms of expert evidence: opinions by \u201cexperts\u201d and opinions by \u201cspecialists\u201d, both oral and written (see the \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d part above, paragraph 111).",

In analysing whether the personal appearance of an expert at the trial was necessary, the Court will therefore be primarily guided by the principles enshrined in the concept of a \u201cfair trial\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, and in particular by the guarantees of \u201cadversarial proceedings\u201d and \u201cequality of arms\u201d. That being said, some of the Court\u2019s approaches to the personal examination of \u201cwitnesses\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) are no doubt relevant in the context of examination of expert evidence and may be applied mutatis mutandis, with due regard to the difference in their status and role (see B\u00f6nisch v.

Similarly, under Article 6 it is normally not the Court\u2019s role to determine whether a particular expert report available to the domestic judge was reliable or not (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7 700). Subject to some exceptions, the general rule is that the domestic judge has a wide discretion in choosing amongst conflicting expert opinions and picking one which he or she deems consistent and credible. However, the rules on admissibility of evidence may sometimes run counter to the principles of equality of arms and adversarial proceedings, or affect the fairness of the proceedings otherwise (see, for example, Tamminen v.\u00a0Finland, no. 40847/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 15 June 2004). In the context of expert evidence, the rules on its admissibility must not deprive the defence of the opportunity to challenge it effectively, in particular by introducing or obtaining alternative opinions and reports. In certain circumstances the refusal to allow an alternative expert examination of material evidence may be regarded as a breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 (see Stoimenov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 17995/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a038 et seq., 5 April 2007).",

In the absence of further explanations from the Government on this point, and in view of the brevity of the entry in the trial record, the Court concludes that Judge M. failed to verify what the reason for the absence of Dr Ig. was, and whether it was possible to secure her attendance and questioning.\u00a0The Court further notes that Dr\u00a0Ig. was not questioned in the first round of the trial proceedings either. This was explained by the fact that she was about to move to another country (see paragraph 61 above). However, Dr\u00a0Ig. was available for cross-examination at least until 29\u00a0March 2007. When the court decided to read out her previous statement (on 27 March 2007) she was still in the country.\u00a0Thus, it had been possible to examine that witness at the first trial, but the authorities missed that opportunity.\u00a0Finally, the Court observes that the defence was not able to question Dr Ig. at the stage of the preliminary investigation \u2013 again, for reasons which remain unknown.",

As is demonstrated by the facts of the present case, the prosecution or the court may dismiss a request for further expert examination of a person or an item without much explanation, because, in their view, the case is clear as it is (see, in particular, the answer of the investigator to such a request quoted in paragraph 36 above).",

However, it is clear that the status of a \u201cspecialist\u201d in Russian law is different from that of an \u201cexpert\u201d. Although a specialist may \u201cexplain to the parties and to the court matters which come within his or her professional competence\u201d, his primary role is to assist the court and the parties in carrying out investigative actions which require special skills or knowledge. The difference between the \u201cexpert\u201d stricto sensu and the \u201cspecialist\u201d is well illustrated by Decree no.\u00a028 of the Supreme Court, summarised in paragraphs 125 et seq. above. Although that Decree was adopted several months after the end of the applicant\u2019s trial, it interpreted the same legal provision which had been applied in the applicant\u2019s case and reflects how the Supreme Court understood the status of \u201cspecialists\u201d under the CCrP. Thus, the opinion of a \u201cspecialist\u201d cannot replace a full-scale examination of the matter by an expert (see point 1 of the Decree). The specialist cannot examine physical evidence directly; he may only give an \u201copinion\u201d, whereas the expert delivers \u201cconclusions\u201d (see point 20 of the Decree). Where an examination of a complex technical or scientific matter is needed, the court must appoint an \u201cexpert\u201d, not a \u201cspecialist\u201d. In sum, although opinions by \u201cspecialists\u201d and \u201cexperts\u201d can be used in evidence, and both may be professionals in a particular field, the role of a specialist and the weight of his opinion is not, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, identical to that of an \u201cexpert\u201d.",

As to the oral examination of the \u201cspecialists\u201d, the Court notes that the IAPR was a Moscow-based expert institution, whereas the trial took place in Khabarovsk, over six thousand kilometres away. Therefore, it would have been difficult and onerous for the defence to ensure the personal attendance of their \u201cspecialists\u201d at the trial. In addition, a specialist must appear at the request of the investigator or the court (see paragraph 114 above), whereas he has no such obligation where the defence seeks his questioning.",

It is difficult to see how Article 58 of the CCrP can be reconciled with its Articles 53 \u00a7 3 and 86 and with section 6 \u00a7 3 (4) of the Advocacy Act of 2002 (see paragraphs 122 and 123 above), which provide that the defence may engage the services of a specialist within criminal proceedings.

Furthermore, Dr Iv., who prepared the expert report of 1\u00a0April 2005, was not examined in person. However, from the materials of the case it is unclear whether the defence solicited the examination of the absent experts in person (cf. to the situation pertaining to Dr Ig., the rapporteur of the group who had prepared report no. 1170, whose presence was sought by the defence).

(which defined the notion of \u201cmedical activities\u201d and thus related to question no. 2). The court refused to admit his report in evidence for the very same reason it did not accept the report by the IAPR (see paragraphs 49 and 103 above). Thus, the defence did not have an option of an \u201cactive defence\u201d: they were unable to introduce written opinions of their own \u201cspecialists\u201d and, in any event, any opinion of a \u201cspecialist\u201d would be of a lesser weight than that of the \u201cexpert\u201d.",

(see paragraph 29 above). The Court observes that the expert opinion of Dr\u00a0A. was obtained at the pre-trial investigation stage on the initiative of the investigator. The report by Dr\u00a0A. was clearly favourable to the defence. However, there is no reference to that expert report in either of the two judgments rendered in the present case. It appears that either the report of Dr A. was never produced in court, or it was produced but the courts disregarded it. The Court considers that in either scenario the authorities breached the fundamental principles of a fair trial. The Court\u2019s case-law states that the prosecution must disclose to the defence \u201call material evidence in their possession for or against the accused\u201d (see, amongst many other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16 December 1992, \u00a7\u00a036, Series A no.\u00a0247B). Certain exceptions to that rule are permissible, but the Government did not refer to them. A fortiori, the rule of disclosure of exculpatory evidence requires the prosecution to submit such evidence to the court for consideration. However, that rule would make no sense if the courts were allowed to leave such evidence without any consideration and not even mention it in their judgments.",

The criminal provision of Article 235 of the Russian Criminal Code is a blanket legal norm, which makes the punishability of the criminal offence of quackery dependent on non-criminal laws and regulations. In the case at hand, both the experts and the courts referred to several administrative laws and regulations that allegedly defined and circumscribed \u201cmedical practice\u201d. While the compatibility of blanket criminal provisions with the principle of legality (nullum crimen sine lege praevia, certa et stricta) has been a subject of heated discussions, it is nonetheless generally accepted that these provisions are, in principle, necessary in certain fields of criminal law, namely where complex technical details of the constitutive elements of the offence are provided for by other non-criminal laws and regulations. Thus, the blanket criminal provision is applied in conjunction with the supplementing non-criminal provisions. In any case, these non-criminal laws and regulations which supplement the constitutive elements of the offence missing in the blanket criminal provision must themselves comply with the requirements of the principle of legality. An individual must know from the wording of the criminal provision, interpreted in conjunction with the relevant non-criminal provisions and, if need be, with the assistance of a third person\u2019s legal expertise, what acts and omissions will make him or her criminally liable and what penalty will be imposed for his or her acts or omissions. Thus, the non-criminal laws and regulations which supplement the blanket criminal provision must comply with the requirements of lex praevia, certa et stricta.

Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure provides that, if the defendant objects to the termination of the proceedings owing to the expiry of the statutory time-limits set out in Article 24 \u00a7\u00a7 1-3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the proceedings must continue and the court must decide the case on the merits. The legal interpretation of Article 27 \u00a7 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure is unclear as to whether the courts may impose a criminal sentence, besides finding the person guilty. The most important commentaries on the Code of Criminal Procedure are not unanimous on this point: if the person is found guilty of the prescribed offence, some commentators say that courts cannot in any case impose any penalties on the convicted person, whereas others say that the judge has a choice to impose or not to impose a sentence, thereby granting judges unlimited discretion, which is unacceptable under the principle of legality. The case-law in this respect is not uniform either. Owing to the lack of clarity in the law and the unfettered discretion granted to judges in applying such law, the applicant did not have an advance fair warning, as required by the principle of legality, as to what consequences the waiver of the statute of limitations would entail for her and it was thus impossible for her to make a proper informed decision related to a waiver of her right. Although she might have had some understanding of the risk she was taking by waiving the statute of limitations, the degree of risk was completely unforeseeable. The principles of advance notice and limitation of official discretion, as embodied in the principle of legality guaranteed under Article 7 \u00a7 1, of the Convention, should be considered the minimum requirement for the rule of law to be upheld.",

The waiver by the defendant of his or her legal right to terminate time-barred criminal proceedings is a voluntary submission to a trial court, which can take place at any time in the future, regardless of the applicable law on the statute of limitations. The practical result is that any person may agree to be tried, and ultimately punished, for any crime, even minor offences, committed a long time ago, where criminal prosecution and conviction no longer serve any legitimate purpose, no penological needs justify punishment and the evidence may have already vanished. In our view, such a waiver is per se incompatible with the Convention, since it defeats both the remedial purpose and the mixed \u2013 both substantive and procedural \u2013 nature of the statute of limitations.",

Hence, its assessment is a substantive prerequisite of the State\u2019s right to prosecute offenders and punish criminal conduct.

In Previti v. Italy the Court interpreted this passage of Co\u00ebme and Others as if it had stated that the statute of limitations had an exclusively procedural nature and was not under the guarantees of Article 7. But this approach was rightly abandoned in K.-H.W. v.\u00a0Germany [GC] and Kononov v. Latvia [GC]. The Court\u2019s present approach is clear and unambiguous. It can be summed up as follows: the statute of limitations sits alongside, with equal force, the conditions of the existence of a criminal offence and therefore shares the substantive nature of the constituent elements of the offence, with the logical consequence of the full applicability of Article 7, including the prohibition of the retroactive application of criminal laws with harsher statute of limitations provisions to the detriment of the defendant. Thus, the statute of limitations has, in the light of the Convention, a mixed nature, being both procedural and substantive at the same time.",

Secondly, since the statute of limitations relates to the State\u2019s right to prosecute, try, convict and sentence citizens, the principle of legality fully applies to its regime. The grounds for limitation, suspension or interruption of the effect of the lapse of time, and any exceptions to or extensions of the statute of limitations, are a legislative responsibility, and can neither be determined by courts nor manipulated by the defendant. Thirdly, the statute of limitations cannot be waived: the running of the statute of limitations extinguishes the court\u2019s power to try the case and punish the defendant, and no waiver by the defendant can supply the requisite jurisdiction. In a State governed by the rule of law and human rights, criminal jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon the court by a unilateral act of the defendant. Any punishment for a time-barred act or omission, even when he or she expressed his or her wish to be tried, is not only irrevocably disproportionate, but furthermore contrary to the requirements of the principle of legality.

The trial court had to assess whether the alleged victim had suffered any psychological or physical harm during the material time from April to June 2002 and, if so, whether that harm was caused by the applicant\u2019s practices. Both the criminal harm and the link of causality could and should have been ascertained on the basis of the alleged victim\u2019s direct testimony before the court. Neither the domestic courts nor the sole expert (Dr Iv.), whose report was used by the domestic courts to ground the conviction, ever saw, let alone questioned, the victim or evaluated whether she had suffered any harm caused by the applicant\u2019s practices.

The same applies to the reading-out of the testimony of other witnesses submitted by the prosecution. The irrefutable fact is that, at the hearing before the second trial court on 2 July 2009, the defence objected explicitly to the reading-out of statements from Ms\u00a0S.D. and from other witnesses for the prosecution that had been obtained during the previous stages of the proceedings. The position of the defence was clear, and moreover justified: they wanted to question the witnesses about the facts of the case in view of the new evidence, such as the history of mental problems among members of the alleged victim\u2019s family, together with the \u201creconciliation\u201d and the withdrawal of the complaint by the alleged victim. The defence had the right to assess what was in its best interest and its judgment should have been respected by the court for the sake of the fairness of the trial, including the basic right to examine or have examined witnesses for the prosecution. The trial court simply assumed that the defence\u2019s input to the trial was pointless \u2013 a form of conduct not much different from the police investigator\u2019s conduct at the investigation stage of the proceedings.",

In addition to the expert opinion of Dr Iv and some documentary evidence, including the medical history of Ms S.D., the charter of incorporation of the association, its brochures and leaflets, the second trial court based its factual findings on the records of the testimony of the alleged victim Ms S.D., given on 24\u00a0March 2003 and 22\u00a0April 2004, and the testimony of Ms\u00a0N.D.

The whole case against the defendant was based on untested evidence given by the victim, corroborated by one sole expert who had never seen the victim and who was never cross-examined in a court hearing, as well as other witnesses whose testimony was not cross-examined before the second trial court either. In straightforward words, the core of the prosecution\u2019s case was not weak. It simply did not exist. Any court of law would have thrown out the prosecution\u2019s case on the grounds of a lack of reliable evidence. As the first trial court rightly did.",

The principle of the fair trial and the principle of cross-examination of the evidence require that testimonial evidence be produced before the judge who is responsible for returning the verdict. The assessment of the reliability of that evidence depends on the judge\u2019s immediate perception of it. The immediacy of the relationship between the judge and the testimony (or the Unmittelbarkeitsprinzip, as the German doctrine calls it) is a constituent element of the adversarial proceedings inherent in the concept of fair trial. Thus, as a matter of principle, the trial court may not base a criminal conviction on testimonial evidence produced prior to the trial, even where the evidence has been produced in a previous trial before the same or other court and its judgment has subsequently been quashed and the case remitted for a fresh trial, and regardless of whether or not the composition of the first and second trial courts is different. A fortiori, this conclusion applies also to testimonial evidence that was produced at the pre-trial stage of the criminal proceedings. The obvious consequence of this principle is that only exceptionally may the testimonial evidence produced at the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings or at the trial stage, in the event of remittal for a fresh trial, be considered admissible and used as a ground in the judgment.",

Furthermore, the catalogue of these grounds must distinguish between the evidence produced before the judge, the public prosecutor or the police. For the purposes of an adversarial and fair examination of the evidence, the evidence produced before the police or the prosecutor cannot be equated with the evidence produced before the judge at the pre-trial stage. The catalogue of the grounds for reading out the absent witness\u2019s testimony in open court must be more expansive when a judicial authority collects the evidence and less expansive when it is collected by a non-judicial authority. For the same purposes, when deciding whether the absent witness\u2019s testimony should be read out, courts must take into consideration the presence or absence of the defence lawyer at the witness\u2019s hearing. Experience shows that the intervention of the defence lawyer at a later stage is often too late, and may not suffice to remedy the shortcomings of a previous non-adversarial hearing of the witness. The catalogue of the grounds for reading out the absent witness\u2019s testimony in open court must be more expansive when the defence lawyer participated, or had the opportunity to participate, in the pre-trial hearing of the witness, and less expansive when he or she did not have such opportunity.",
