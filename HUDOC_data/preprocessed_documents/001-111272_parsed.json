It was necessary to extend his detention, taking into account the need to carry out a number of investigative measures, the fact that the applicant had committed a grave crime and that remaining at large he might obstruct the proceedings and abscond, as well as the fact that the applicant\u2019s detention was to expire on 30\u00a0December 2005.",

He submitted, inter alia, that the motion had been filed in violation of the time-limits prescribed by Article 139 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP) (see paragraph 54 below). In accordance with the relevant provisions of the CCP, detention in pre-trial proceedings could be imposed and extended only by a court upon an investigator\u2019s motion. The last occasion on which his detention had been extended was on 12 July 2004 until 18 September 2004. Even if the time-limits prescribed by Article\u00a0139\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the CCP were to be calculated from the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision of 16 December 2005, they would still have been violated, given that 13\u00a0days had already passed since that date. As to the investigator\u2019s argument that his detention was to expire on 30\u00a0December 2005, this was not true since his detention had expired on 18\u00a0September 2004. The CCP required that a detainee be released if the detention period had expired and had not been extended. In his case it was not even clear which detention period, that is authorised by which court decision, was being extended. He was being kept in detention without a court decision. The applicant lastly asked the court to indicate the court decision, pursuant to which his detention period was to expire on 30 December 2005.",

The Government justified this with the fact that the case file was transferred to the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office only on 26 December 2005, which was unacceptable as it suggested that a person could remain in detention without an appropriate court decision and for an indefinite period of time just because the case file was transferred belatedly from one public authority to another. Furthermore, if the starting point for his detention under pre-trial proceedings was the decision of 16 December 2005, then the manner in which this decision was taken contradicted the CCP, namely the requirement that time-limits be set when ordering detention during pre-trial proceedings. Lastly, it was not clear which term of detention was extended by the decision of 29 December 2005. The decisions taken between 14\u00a0October and 16 December 2005 did not set any time-limits for his detention. Thus, the practice of keeping a person in detention without any legal basis as a result of the lack of specific rules, as a result of which a detainee could be imprisoned in perpetuity without judicial authorisation, did not meet the principle of legal certainty and protection against arbitrariness.",

His detention was then extended by two more months by the decision of 12\u00a0July 2004.

After more than a year of trial proceedings, on 14 October 2005 the trial court decided to remit the case for further investigation. By the same decision it decided to keep the applicant in detention. This decision was confirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation on 9 November and 16 December 2005 respectively. On 26 December 2005 the case file was transmitted to the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office and on 27 December 2005 the investigator filed a motion seeking to extend the applicant\u2019s detention by two months. It was stated in that motion that his detention was to expire on 30 December 2005. On 29\u00a0December 2005 the court granted that motion.",

In particular, during pre-trial proceedings detention or its extension are authorised by a court only upon the investigator\u2019s or prosecutor\u2019s motion, each time for a period not exceeding two months (Article 136 \u00a7 2, Article 138 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 and Article\u00a0139 \u00a7 3 of the CCP), while during the trial proceedings the court decides on detention or its extension of its own motion and without setting any specific time-limits (Article 136 \u00a7 2 and Article 138 \u00a7 6 of the CCP). Furthermore, a motion seeking extension of detention during pre-trial proceedings must be filed ten days, while the court decision must be taken five days, prior to the expiry of the authorised detention period (Article\u00a0139\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the CCP). If a case is remitted for further investigation, the rules governing detention under pre-trial proceedings are applicable, as in the applicant\u2019s case. Thus, in order to answer the question of whether the applicant\u2019s detention was extended by the court decision of 29\u00a0December 2005 in compliance with the time-limits prescribed by Article 139 \u00a7 1 of the CCP, the Court is required to address first the nature of the detention period preceding that court decision.",

It has no reason to doubt the lawfulness of the decision authorising that period of detention, which was taken on that date by the trial court pursuant to Article 293 \u00a7 2 of the CCP. On 14 October 2005, however, the same trial court decided of its motion to remit the case for further investigation. The Court notes in this respect that the Government\u2019s allegation that the pre-trial proceedings did not restart on that date but only when that decision was upheld at final instance on 16\u00a0December 2005 is not based on any domestic legal provision. Indeed, there is no provision in the criminal procedure law which would clearly indicate the date of resumption of pre-trial proceedings once a decision is taken to remit the case for further investigation. Thus, it is not clear which detention rules were applicable to the applicant\u2019s case during the period between 14\u00a0October and 16 December 2005, those concerning pre-trial or trial proceedings. It therefore cannot be said that the applicant\u2019s detention during that period was based on clear and foreseeable rules.",

At first they claimed that this period of detention included the time necessary to transfer the file back to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office (16 to 26\u00a0December 2005) and the five days which the investigating authority still had at its disposal to keep the applicant in detention by virtue of the decision of 12 July 2004 (26 to 30 December 2005). Later, however, the Government claimed that during that entire period the applicant remained in detention on the basis of the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision of 16 December 2005. As to their first allegation, the Court observes once again that it is not based on any domestic legal provision. As to the second allegation, it is true that the Court of Cassation in its decision of 16 December 2005, while upholding the remittal of the case for further investigation, also stated that the applicant was to remain in detention. However, it is undisputed that from that date onwards the proceedings were once again in their pre-trial stage and, as already indicated above, during pre-trial proceedings detention could be authorised by a court only upon the investigator\u2019s or prosecutor\u2019s motion and with indication of a specific time-limit. In this case there was no such motion and the Court of Cassation failed to indicate any time-limit. It follows that the applicant\u2019s detention during that period was imposed in violation of the domestic procedural law.",

Continued detention may be justified in a given case only if there are clear indications of a genuine public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the right to liberty. It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to examine the circumstances for or against the existence of such an imperative interest, and to set them out in their decisions on the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions, and of the facts established by the applicant in his appeals, that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. The persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. The Court must then establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d to continue to justify the deprivation of liberty (see Kud\u0142a v.

However, the next occasion on which the Armenian courts explicitly referred to this ground was as late as February 2006, which was almost two years after the applicant\u2019s actual arrest in May 2004.

However, in view of the fact that the applicant was deprived of his liberty, the authorities were required to deal with the case with special diligence which they appear to have failed to do. The Court notes in this respect that a significant and unnecessary delay in the proceedings can be attributable to the conduct of the authorities. In particular, because of the failure of the investigating authority to carry out an objective and thorough investigation at the initial stage of the proceedings, the trial court, to which the case was referred for examination on the merits, had to hold 52 hearings and to examine numerous witnesses, which lasted an entire year, only to conclude that it was unable to decide on the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence and to be compelled to remit the case for further investigation (see paragraphs 26 and 27 above). Furthermore, the taking of such a decision in its turn triggered an appeal process and caused another delay of at least two months (see paragraphs 27-32 above). Lastly, no explanation was provided for an interval of at least four months between 2 June and 16 October 2006, during which no proceedings were conducted whatsoever (see paragraphs 45-47 above). Thus, the applicant\u2019s detention was prolonged for a total of at least one and a half years due to the apparent lack of diligence on the part of the authorities.",
