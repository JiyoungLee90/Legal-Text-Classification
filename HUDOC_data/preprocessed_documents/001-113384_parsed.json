This amounted in total to one year and more than nine months during which the applicant was detained without any progress or development in the proceedings. Moreover, as regards the period after the applicant\u2019s maximum period of detention had expired on 1\u00a0February 2012, the Government have not shown that there has been any progress in the conduct of the proceedings. In these circumstances the Court sees no reason to examine the background of the possible reasons for these delays since, even taking into account the problems with obtaining evidence from the Italian authorities, the primary responsibility for delays rests ultimately with the State (see, mutatis mutandis, Kulikowski v. , no. 18353/03, \u00a7 50, 19\u00a0May 2009).",
