The said two testimonies were, however, only indirect evidence, as neither the mother nor H. had witnessed the alleged acts. Both of those witnesses were only able to give an account of what R. had told them and of their observation of her behaviour. H. had also testified on the methods used in conducting the interview and the credibility of R.\u2019s account.",

The recording also enabled them to observe the manner in which the interviews were conducted and to assess for themselves, at least to a certain degree, the credibility of R.\u2019s account. It was open to the applicant to contest and comment on the evidence produced before the trial courts. While the Court acknowledges the significance of such a recording as evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: Bocos-Cuesta v. the , no.\u00a054789/00, \u00a7\u00a071, 10 November 2005; W.S. v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061 in fine; and F.\u00a0and M. v.
