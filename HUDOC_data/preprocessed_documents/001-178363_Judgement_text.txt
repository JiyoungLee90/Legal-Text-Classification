The case originated in six applications (nos.  31189/15, 49973/15, 54813/15, 55625/15, 38250/16 and 40014/16) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Uzbek nationals (“the applicants”) on the various dates indicated in the appended table.
The applicants were represented by various lawyers practising in Moscow, as indicated in the appended table. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
Between 7 September 2015 and 24 January 2017 the applications were communicated to the Government.
On 23 August 2016 the International Commission of Jurists was granted leave to intervene as a third party in the case of S.U. v. Russia, no. 55625/15 under Rule 44 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
On various dates the applicants’ requests for interim measures preventing their removal from Russia were granted by the Court under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. The applicants’ cases were also granted priority (Rule 41) and confidentiality (Rule 33) and the applicants were granted anonymity (Rule 47 § 4).
The applicants are nationals of Uzbekistan. Their initials, dates of birth, the dates on which their applications were introduced, application numbers, as well as the particulars of the domestic proceedings and other relevant information are set out in the Appendix.
On various dates they were charged in Uzbekistan with religious and politically motivated crimes, their pre-trial detention was ordered in absentia, and international search warrants were issued by the authorities.
Subsequently the Russian authorities took final decisions to remove (that is to say extradite or expel) the applicants to Uzbekistan, despite consistent claims that in the event of removal the applicants would face a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.
A summary of the domestic law and practice concerning extraditions was provided in the case of Mukhitdinov v. Russia (no. 20999/14, §§ 29-31, 21 May 2015, with further references).
The relevant reports by the UN agencies and international NGOs on the situation in Uzbekistan up until 2015 were cited in the case of Kholmurodov v. Russia (no. 58923/14, §§ 46-50, 1 March 2016).
