That being the case, the Court concludes that the domestic decisions in issue were fully enforced.

Serbia, nos. 2269/06 and 5 others, 15 January 2008), the general rules of domestic law still apply to any enforcement and insolvency proceedings against such companies. Those with non-enforced judgments against socially/State-owned companies have a possibility of transferring liability for their claims to the State since 2012 (see Marinkovic v. Serbia (dec.), no. 5353/11, 29 January 2013). In the present case, there is no reason to elaborate on the rules which apply to transferred claims, since the judgments in issue were enforced soon after the transfer of liability (see paragraphs 10-11 above).",

In view of a very large number of non-enforced domestic decisions against socially/State-owned companies, the Court reduced that sum to EUR 2,000 (see Sto\u0161i\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia, no. 64931/10, \u00a7 67, 1 October 2013). In doing so, it took into consideration also the economic situation in Serbia to which the Government referred. Since that amount is already much lower than what the Court would have normally awarded in such cases, any lower amount awarded at the domestic level is considered to be unreasonable. It should be added, however, that the Court could accept a lower domestic award, if the respondent State opts for a comprehensive solution and transfer the liability for all non-enforced domestic decisions against socially/State-owned companies to the State by virtue of law (see Kne\u017eevi\u0107 v. Bosnia and\u00a0Herzegovina (dec.), no. 15663/12, \u00a7\u00a7 11-15, 14 March 2017, accepting a domestic award of EUR 50 in respect of non-pecuniary damage).",
