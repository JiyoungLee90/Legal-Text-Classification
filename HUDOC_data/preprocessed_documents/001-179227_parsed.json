In this connection section 10 of the Act provided that land designated by an urban plan for the construction of objects in public use or of public interest could not be restored into possession, but that compensation would be paid instead. The domestic authorities relied on that provision in order to refuse to restore the plots of land to the applicants\u2019 possession and awarded them compensation instead (see paragraph 10 above). Having regard to the information before it and considering that it has only limited power to deal with alleged errors of fact or law committed by the national courts (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no.\u00a030544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999-I), the Court is satisfied that the domestic authorities established convincingly that the applicants\u2019 claim for restoration in possession had not satisfied a statutory requirement in that it concerned a land designated with a valid legal instrument for the construction of objects of public interest. Such an approach, as noted above (see paragraph 35 above), the national authorities consistently applied to all similar restitution claims.",
