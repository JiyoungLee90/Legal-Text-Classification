Having said that, the case has a number of disturbing features: (1) the autopsy was grossly inadequate, and even if signs of homicide had been present, they would have been missed; (2) the face was of normal colour \u2013 neither congested nor pale; this argues for death before hanging; (3) there was no accumulation of blood in the lower extremities \u2013 this absence argues against hanging altogether; (4) the furrow around the neck is in a position more often seen in strangulation than suicide; (5) none of the normal scratch marks normally seen outside of the neck when individuals hang themselves were evident. Nor, according to the autopsy pathologist, there none of the soft tissue injuries that are normally expected in hanging. Two other issues are of concern: (1) was the deceased able to tie the complex knot used to support him, and (2) it appears that complete toxicology testing (was not) performed and that is a very serious omission. There are many poisons that are not detected by routine tests \u2013 they are only identified if they are specifically sought. In the absence to these questions, the possibility of murder must be strongly considered. The most likely scenario, based on the evidence at hand, is that the deceased was sedated/poisoned and hung after death.\u201d",

In addition, no other factors such as health issues or financial problems were detected as being of concern, and in general, no plausible grounds for suicide were identified. In the doctor\u2019s opinion, his support system of friends and family, his short-term (excursion) and longterm (wedding) plans, together with the absence of any risk factors, were all indications that Mr Tsalikidis did not commit suicide.",

In the Government\u2019s view, filing a criminal complaint and \u2013 in the event that it was later archived \u2013 lodging an appeal against the public prosecutor\u2019s order were appropriate and effective remedies, as proven by the fact that the first applicant had used them.

Relying on a series of judgments issued by the Supreme Administrative Court, the Government claimed that an application for compensation in respect of damage caused by unlawful acts or omissions committed by the State could have resulted in an award of compensation in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage and it was therefore an appropriate and effective legal remedy that the applicants should have used. In the Government\u2019s view, the present case should be distinguished from the Court\u2019s judgments in Papapetrou and Others v. Greece (no. 17380/09, 12\u00a0July 2011) and Zontul v. Greece (no. 12294/07, 17 January 2012) in which the Court dismissed the Government\u2019s objection of non-exhaustion for failure to use the remedy under Article 105. In the former case the applicants had submitted an application for damages which was still pending at the time they applied to the Court and, in any event, no violation of Article 2 was found. In the latter, the Court had dismissed the Government\u2019s objection on the basis that the applicants had joined the proceedings as civil parties; however, in that case criminal proceedings had already been initiated. It should be also distinguished from other cases where an application for damages had been considered ineffective remedy for complaints under other articles of the Convention.",

They also claimed that the domestic legislation had not provided for an effective remedy in respect of any deficiencies in the investigation. As regards an action for damages under Article 105 of the Introductory Law, the applicants argued that, on the one hand, such an action would have had very little prospect of success and, on the other hand, that it was not effective. In any event, they had already joined the criminal proceedings as civil parties and it would therefore have been pointless to submit an application for damages, since both legal remedies served the same goal and it would have been excessive to have to exhaust both penal and administrative remedies in relation to the same case. The applicants referred to several judgments of the Court to illustrate that it has on many occasions rejected the Government\u2019s argument that an action for damages constitutes an effective remedy for complaints related to various Articles of the Convention (Yotova, cited above, \u00a7 101; Zontul v. Greece, no 12294/07, \u00a7 73, 17\u00a0January 2012).

Thus, the authorities must have taken the steps reasonably available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including eye witness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death, or the person or persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see Anguelova, cited above, \u00a7 139; Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 113; and Ognyanova and Choban, cited above, \u00a7 105).",

To that end, the Court considered in its judgment in the case of Brecknell v. the United Kingdom (no. 32457/04, \u00a7 71, 27 November 2007) that, where there is a plausible or credible allegation, the discovery of any new piece of evidence or item of information relevant to the identification and eventual prosecution or punishment of the perpetrator of an unlawful killing would require the authorities to take further investigative measures. The steps which would be reasonable to take will vary considerably according to the facts of the situation. The lapse of time will, inevitably, be an obstacle as regards, for example, the location of witnesses and the ability of witnesses to recall events reliably. Such an investigation may in some cases, reasonably, be restricted to verifying the credibility of the source or of the purported new evidence (see Gasyak and Others v.

Where an allegation or new evidence tends to indicate police or security force collusion in an unlawful death, the criterion of independence will, generally, remain unchanged (see, for the importance of this criterion from the very earliest stage of the procedure, Ramsahai and\u00a0Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7\u00a7. 325, 333-341, ECHR\u00a02007II). Promptness will be unlikely to come into play in the same way, since, for example, there may be no urgency as regards the securing of a crime scene from contamination or in obtaining witness statements while recollections are sharp. Reasonable expedition will remain a requirement, but what is reasonable is likely to be coloured by the investigative prospects and difficulties which exist at such a late stage (see Brecknell v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 71-72).",

Besides this, the new forensic reports drawn up by the coroners following the exhumation of the body concluded that the cause of death remained unclarified, which is a striking difference compared to the initial forensic report.",

In the Court\u2019s view however, some of the investigative measures suggested by the applicants could have elucidated the circumstances surrounding the applicant\u2019s death. In particular, the Court notes that, although the cause of death had not been sufficiently elucidated, no reconstruction of the incident and no forensic examination of the place of death were ever ordered, despite the applicants\u2019 request and their technical advisors\u2019 suggestion to this effect. While the Government alleged that such a reconstruction would not have been appropriate as the applicants had tampered with the evidence at the place of death, the Court opines that a reconstruction and/or a forensic examination, even at a later stage, would have shed light on the possible proximity of the body to nearby furniture and would have provided answers as to whether his body should have suffered injury, given the position in which it was hanging.",

Although the Government maintained that no inconsistencies existed between the coroners\u2019 opinions, the Court cannot fail to notice that the first coroner attributed Mr Tsalikidis\u2019 death to pulmonary edema and the second coroner to cardiac arrest, but both conclusions were strongly contested by the applicants\u2019 technical advisors. In addition, the conclusion of the initial autopsy was that Mr Tsalikidis had been hanged with a noose, whereas after the supplementary investigation the cause of death was noted by two of the three coroners as unclarified. The Court cannot share the Government\u2019s view that after so many years this was the only possible conclusion in respect of the cause of death and that establishing the cause of death had anyway not been the purpose of the exhumation. In the Court\u2019s view, the purpose of exhumation had been precisely to clarify the circumstances of Mr Tsalikidis\u2019 death and to identify any traces of criminal activity which could have led to it. If this had not been so, the coroners would not have stated the cause of death in their reports and would simply have commented on the findings or the absence thereof. Lastly, the knot was initially described as an \u201ceveryday, simple knot\u201d; however, the applicants\u2019 technical advisor considered that it was particularly complex and would have required sailing knowledge to tie it.",

The order by which the supplementary investigation was closed did not contain any presentation or analysis of the available evidence such as the new findings of the histology report or the conclusions of the forensic reports.

At the same time, they expressed their wish to join the proceedings as civil parties. Apart from the possibility of requesting compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage, as civil parties and by virtue of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicants had the right to participate in the criminal procedure and to request that certain investigative acts be conducted by the investigating authorities and to have technical experts present when the investigative acts were carried out (see Papapetrou and Others, cited above, \u00a7 39, 12 July 2011). The Court observes that the applicants duly made use of the above-mentioned possibilities provided to them by law.
