Under domestic law the applicant company was only obliged to indicate an address for service, which it did (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above). Furthermore, once the case was before it, the SCC accepted as valid an authority form presented before it by counsel for the applicant company signed by Askon AD based in Sofia and represented by the managing director elected in November 2003 (see\u00a0paragraph 13 above). In the minutes of the hearing before the SCC of 14\u00a0June 2004 it was also noted that the party was Askon AD Sofia (see\u00a0paragraph 11 above).",
