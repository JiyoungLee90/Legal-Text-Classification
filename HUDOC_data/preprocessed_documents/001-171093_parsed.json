Two periods of inactivity of approximately six months led to the applicant company\u2019s two complaints about the administration\u2019s failure to decide (see paragraphs 19 and 35 above); in both cases the Administrative Court had to set a time-limit and prolonged it upon the Ministry\u2019s request (see paragraphs 20, 24, 36 and 39 above).
