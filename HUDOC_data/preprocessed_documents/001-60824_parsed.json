Nor, as the Government point out, may it even be desirable, even if possible, to do so if those having custody of the child are seen as the source of an immediate threat to the child, since giving them prior warning would be liable to deprive the measure of its effectiveness. The Court must however be satisfied that the national authorities were entitled to consider that there existed circumstances justifying the abrupt removal of the child from the care of its parents without any prior contact or consultation. In particular, it is for the respondent State to establish that a careful assessment of the impact of the proposed care measure on the parents and the child, as well as of the possible alternatives to the removal of the child from its family, was carried out prior to the implementation of a care measure (see K. and T. v.

It cannot be overlooked that the Child Welfare Board advised the doctors at  to discuss their concerns with Mr and Mrs\u00a0Venema (see paragraph 15 above). This advice was not followed. The Court finds it surprising that the Child Welfare Board's representative at the meeting held on 20 December 1994 to discuss Kimberly's case did not renew this advice or ascertain whether the applicants had been consulted about the concerns being expressed about them (see paragraph 18 above). In the event, the Board obtained a joint report of  and Curium on 2 January 1995. In response to questions put by the Board, a revised version was transmitted to it on 3 January 1995. This report concluded that Kimberly's life was at risk and that urgent action was required. On the basis of this report, the juvenile judge decided on 4 January 1995 to issue provisional orders, valid until 11 January 1995, ordering Kimberly's placement under supervision and away from her family. At no stage were the applicants asked to comment on the concerns about them or in any other way involved in the procedure. ",

The Court is not persuaded by the opinion in the revised report sent by Curium to the Child Welfare Board on 3 January 1995 (see paragraph 21 above) that the applicants might have reacted unpredictably if the matter was discussed with them. In the Court's opinion, this justification, while it may be relevant, cannot of itself be considered sufficient to exclude Kimberly's parents from a procedure of immense personal importance to them, the less so having regard to the fact that Kimberly was in perfect safety in the days preceding the making of the provisional order. It would observe further that the failure in this case to involve the applicants in the investigative procedure before applying for the provisional order contrasts sharply with the procedure of consultation and information followed by the domestic authorities in P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, where arguably there was more evidence of a threat posed to the welfare of the child (loc. cit., \u00a7\u00a7 124-26).",

However, it remains the case that the applicants were at no stage able to influence the outcome of the procedure by, for example, contesting the reliability of the information compiled in their case or adding information from their own sources to the file. It was not before 10 January 1995, when the hearing before the juvenile judge took place, that Kimberly's parents could express their views. This was six days after the juvenile judge, on the basis of the untested fears of the Child Welfare Board, had issued the provisional supervision order and an order for Kimberley to be placed away from her family and four days after the juvenile judge had issued an order to have Kimberly placed in a foster home. Before Kimberly's parents were heard and given a chance to dispute the validity of the Child Welfare Board's fears, measures had already been taken which, because of their immediate impact and Kimberly's age, were difficult to redress.",
