In the latter case, the decisive factor is not whether the rights at issue are transferable to heirs willing to pursue an application, but whether the persons wishing to pursue the proceedings can claim a\u00a0legitimate interest in seeking that the Court decide the case on the basis of the applicant\u2019s desire to use his or her individual and personal right to lodge a case before the Court (see also Ergezen v.
