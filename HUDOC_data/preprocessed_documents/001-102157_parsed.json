The applicant in application no. 31267/07 submitted under Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 (b) of the Convention that he had not had adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence on account of the excessive pretrial detention. He contended under Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention that he had been denied the right to education due to his pre-trial detention. The applicant in application no. 21014/08 claimed under Article 2 of the Convention that his excessive pre-trial detention had breached his right to life. He further claimed that the postponement by Law no.\u00a05320 of the date of enforcement of Article 102 of the CCP, which regulates the maximum authorised length of pre-trial detention, to 31\u00a0December 2010 for certain types of offences including his own, violated Articles\u00a06, 13 and 14 of the Convention.
