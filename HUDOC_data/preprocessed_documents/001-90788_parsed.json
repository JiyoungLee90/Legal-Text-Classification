The traditional canons did not allow challenges to his legitimacy. Patriarch Maxim was therefore the legitimate and internationally recognised Bulgarian Patriarch and would continue to hold this title until the end of his life. By recognising that fact the State had not interfered with the internal affairs of the religious community. To accept the contrary would be tantamount to considering that by recognising the Pope as head of the Roman Catholic Church, the member States of the Council of Europe interfered with the rights of believers who did not recognise his leadership.",

Participation in the organisational life of the community is a manifestation of one\u2019s religion, protected by Article 9 of the Convention. For these reasons, the Court has held that under Article 9 of the Convention, interpreted in the light of Article\u00a011, the right of believers to freedom of religion encompasses the expectation that the community will be allowed to function free from arbitrary State intervention in its organisation. The autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is thus an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 of the Convention affords.

There is no doubt that many believers came to adopt the view that a person appointed by the Communist Party could not claim legitimacy as the canonical Patriarch. This led to believers, church councils and senior clergy members throughout the country accepting the applicant organisation as the legitimate leadership of the Church. As a result, a number of church councils and clergy members in charge of temples and other Church property became associated with the applicant organisation and the latter thus obtained control over certain Church assets without any arbitrary or unlawful State involvement.
