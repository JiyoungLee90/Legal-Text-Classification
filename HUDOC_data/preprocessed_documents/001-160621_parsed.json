The officer had run after him and continued shouting from time to time: \u201cStop! FSB!\u201d Having understood that Mr Apti Dalakov had no intention of stopping, the officer shouted: \u201cFSB! Stop or I\u2019ll fire!\u201d and then fired once into the air when Mr Apti Dalakov was about ten to fifteen metres away from him. At that point Mr Apti Dalakov had stopped, turned round to face the officer, taken a grenade out of the right pocket of his trousers and tried to pull out the fuse. Having assessed the situation as threatening, the officer opened fire, aiming to hit Mr Apti Dalakov. When the shots were fired Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s body was flung about in various directions and then he fell to the ground face down. After ascertaining that Mr Apti Dalakov was dead, the officer reported the incident to the head of the operation. The latter ordered the officer and his colleagues from the FSB to cordon off the area and wait for the investigators\u2019 arrival.",

This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention.

In determining whether the force used is compatible with Article 2 of the Convention, it may therefore be relevant whether a law-enforcement operation has been planned and controlled so as to minimise to the greatest extent possible recourse to lethal force or incidental loss of life (see Bubbins v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a7 135-36, ECHR 2005II (extracts), and McCann and\u00a0Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0150 and 194, Series A no.\u00a0324).",

Greece [GC], no. , \u00a7 73, ECHR 2004XI). What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances.

The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances and to the identification and punishment of those responsible for an unlawful killing. This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its capacity to establish the circumstances of the case or identify the person responsible is liable to fall foul of the required standard of effectiveness (see Leonidis v.\u00a0Greece, no. , \u00a7\u00a068, 8\u00a0January 2009, and Anguelova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. , \u00a7 139, ECHR\u00a02002-IV).",

No confrontation was ever held between him and Ms F.Kh.Ts., or between the FSB officers and the police officers concerning the alleged placing of the grenade under the body of Mr Apti Dalakov (see paragraphs 14, 17, 22 and 26 above). The Court observes further that the applicant consistently requested that the authorities take measures aiming at opening of a criminal case and grant him victim status in the criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 36, 38 and 40 above).

In a situation where he did not have procedural status enabling him to appeal against decisions taken within criminal case no. 27520028 (see, for a similar situation, Abdurashidova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 32968/05, \u00a7 57, 8 April 2010), and when no proceedings concerning the death of Mr Apti Dalakov were pending, the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the failure to open a criminal case could have led the courts to decide either that the refusal to open a criminal case was unlawful or that the applicant\u2019s complaint was unsubstantiated (see paragraphs 51-53 above).",

However, from the crime scene examination report it follows that at least forty shots were fired during the special operation, and the grenade was found under Mr\u00a0Apti Dalakov\u2019s body (see paragraph 14 above). Further, according to the forensic expert examination, the four bullet wounds sustained by Mr Apti Dalakov were all in the back and the back of the head. Therefore, the account of the FSB officer A.K., that he fired just one warning shot and had to use lethal force only after seeing the grenade in Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s hand in front of him, does not appear either plausible or convincing. In addition, from the statements given by the other FSB officers implicated in the incident (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above) it appears that more than one officer ran after Mr\u00a0Apti Dalakov and that they saw two of their colleagues standing next to his body. This was confirmed by the statements of Ms F.Kh.Ts and the police Captain G.G., according to whom two men were running after the applicant\u2019s nephew and firing at him as they ran. Therefore, it is clear that by opening fire on Mr Apti Dalakov while running after him, the FSB officers subjected him to a high risk of death.",

While bearing in mind the limitations on the scope of its review, as mentioned above, the Court finds that such conduct by the State agents could hardly be found to be compatible with the requirement to minimise the risk to life of persons in need of protection.",
