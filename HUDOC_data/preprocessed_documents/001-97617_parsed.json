However, having regard to the preparatory work to Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and the interpretation of the provision in the context of the Convention as a whole, the Court has established that this provision also implies individual rights, including the right to vote and to stand for election (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v.

Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a037; United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, \u00a7\u00a033, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I; and Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, \u00a7 100, ECHR 1999-III). The right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic regime, would be merely illusory if one could be arbitrarily deprived of it at any moment. Consequently, while it is true that States have a wide margin of appreciation when establishing eligibility conditions in the abstract, the principle that rights must be effective requires the finding that this or that candidate has failed to satisfy them to comply with a number of criteria framed to prevent arbitrary decisions. In particular, such a finding must be reached by a body which can provide a minimum of guarantees of its impartiality. Similarly, the discretion enjoyed by the body concerned\u00a0must not be exorbitantly wide; it must be circumscribed, with sufficient precision, by the provisions of domestic law. Lastly, the procedure for ruling a candidate ineligible must be such as to guarantee a fair and objective decision and prevent any abuse of power on the part of the relevant authority (see Podkolzina, cited above, \u00a7 35).",

The Central Electoral Office interpreted the provisions of Law no. 68/1992 to mean that the seat should be allocated to the list of the organisation of citizens belonging to a national minority which had secured the largest number of votes in a single constituency. It did not specify whether that was a first interpretation of that provision or whether there was an established practice in that regard. Neither did it explain why the criterion of territorial representation applied to national minorities while, in other electoral matters, such minorities benefited from specific provisions relating to the criterion of national representation. Lastly, although the Court had requested it, the Government failed to provide additional information on the interpretation by the national authorities or legal authorities of Article 68 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(g) of Law no. 68/1992. The Court therefore considers that the decisive provisions governing the allocation of a parliamentary seat to the organisation representing a national minority did not, at the material time, satisfy the requirements of precision laid down in its case-law (see paragraph 47 above).",

The Court found that the election law was not sufficiently clear as concerns the provisions on national minorities, that the authorities entrusted to deal with election disputes were not sufficiently impartial and that no court had ruled on the interpretation of the law or indeed the very dispute. This led the Court to find a violation of Article 3. As for the violation of Article 13, the Court noted its findings concerning the absence of judicial review (see paragraph 62 of the judgment).",

In other words, what effective remedies should be in place where violations of the right to free elections are alleged? In its case-law so far the Court has developed several elements that clarify the notion of effective remedy under Article 13. The Court has thus accepted that for a remedy to be effective it need not always be a judicial remedy or a single remedy. The Court has accepted the possibility of an aggregate of remedies. Furthermore, the notion of effectiveness is construed as ensuring either the prevention of the alleged violation, or the provision of adequate redress, including compensation, for the victim of a violation (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 158, ECHR 2000XI).",

Since the Court referred back to its finding regarding the absence of judicial review, it did not elaborate either on the submissions of the parties or on its own understanding of the notion of effectiveness of a remedy for the purposes of the applicant\u2019s claim. I note in this regard that the 2002 Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters of the Council of Europe\u2019s Venice Commission accepts that an effective appeal can exist where such appeals are heard not only by courts but also by electoral commissions (see under Chapter 3.3 of the Code, cited in paragraph 22 of the judgment). I believe that the Court\u2019s reference to the fact that no judicial appeal was available in general, and to the applicant in particular, is not sufficient to answer the question that Article 13 poses, namely whether there was a meaningful system of institutions and procedures that enabled the applicant to challenge in substance the fact that he was allegedly deprived of his mandate and to seek appropriate redress.",
