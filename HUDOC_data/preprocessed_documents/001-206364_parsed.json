Russia, no\u00a04977/05, \u00a7 44, 4 April 2013, and Ghiulfer Predescu v. Romania, no.\u00a029751/09, \u00a7 52, 27 June 2017). Moreover, the Government did not contest the fact that D.O. had also been invited to join in the show, but had never responded to that invitation (see paragraph 8 above), and had therefore willingly renounced the opportunity to respond directly to the applicant\u2019s allegations during the show.",

However, although a final criminal conviction amounts to incontrovertible proof that a person has committed an offence, the Court has already found it unreasonable to similarly circumscribe the manner in which allegations about that person\u2019s criminal conduct are proved in the context of a defamation or insult case (see, in this connection, Kasabova v. Bulgaria, no. 22385/03, \u00a7 62, 19 April 2011).",

In particular, they failed to take into account that the applicant had been exercising her right of reply in relation to a serious accusation made against an association of which she was president, or carry out an adequate proportionality analysis with a view to assessing the overall context in which the impugned expressions had been used and their factual basis.
