The applicant also emphasised that at the time he had acquired the licence the law had not provided for the measure of revocation in a case of conviction for a criminal offence. In this connection, he referred to Article\u00a028 of the Slovenian Constitution, which sets out the principle of legality in criminal law prohibiting, inter alia, any retroactive application of criminal law. Accordingly, he could not have been expected to anticipate that such legal consequences would have arisen from his actions which, furthermore, had no bearing on the performance of his duties as a liquidator. He argued that over the years in this profession, he had gained extensive experience and had built up his reputation. His job as a liquidator had constituted his only source of income and he and his family had thus suffered a grave and unexpected loss of earnings following the revocation of his licence.",

The relevant provision of section\u00a0109 of the Financial Operations Act was unambiguous and did not require any particular interpretation; it was clear from its wording that it applied equally to those liquidators who had acquired their licence prior to the enactment of the Financial Operations Act as well as to those who had acquired it after the new Act had come into force.

He argued that his case was an important one and that if the current position of the courts remained in effect, he would never be able to work as a liquidator again. The applicant disputed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, which had required him to show that there had been inconsistencies in the case-law. The Supreme Court ignored his argument to the effect that the relevant provisions were unconstitutional and instead took a position that only a departure from caselaw would merit the examination of his appeal. The applicant furthermore argued that the interpretation of the relevant legislation had not yet been settled.",

Section 8(5) of the Notary Act set out three elements which needed to be satisfied in order for a person to be considered worthy of public trust for the performance of the functions of a notary, namely (a) the lack of pending criminal proceedings concerning a crime which would render him or her morally unworthy to be a notary; (b) lack of criminal conviction for crime which would render him or her morally unworthy to be a notary; and (c) lack of conduct which would lead to a conclusion that the person would not conduct his or her function conscientiously and justly. The Constitutional Court found that condition (a) was in breach of, inter alia, the presumption of innocence. However, as regards condition (b) it did not find it unconstitutional. It noted in this connection that \u201cthe contested provision [condition (b)] ... represented the legal consequence of conviction because it banned [the person] from accessing a certain profession\u201d.

The Government also submitted that the applicant\u2019s licence had been withdrawn on the basis of the Financial Operations Act because licences acquired under the previous legislation had been treated in the same way as those acquired under the aforementioned Act. They pointed out that the Bankruptcy Act, which had been in force at the time the crimes had been committed, had also included a condition of not having a criminal conviction which would render a person morally unfit to hold such a licence. The competent ministry had been obliged to ensure that those holding a liquidator\u2019s licence had been in compliance with the criteria set out in the law. Referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 8 May 2014 (see paragraph 38 above), the Government argued that the ministry had acted lawfully in the present case as it had based its decision on the law as in force at that time and had been bound by the findings of the criminal court.",

Greece (nos.\u00a03453/12 and 2 others, \u00a7 87, 30 April 2015) that in cases such as Vagenas (decision cited above) the disciplinary proceedings had had a certain autonomy vis\u00e0vis the criminal proceedings, in particular as regards the manner in which they had been carried out and their purpose.",

San Marino ((dec.), no. 8162/13, 13\u00a0September 2016) that the offences brought against the applicants \u2013 a lawyer, and both a notary public and a lawyer respectively \u2013 in the disciplinary proceedings had not been criminal but disciplinary in nature. It observed that the fact that acts which could have led to a disciplinary sanction had also constituted criminal offences (specifically in those particular cases fraudulent conversion and making false declarations in public documents respectively) had not been sufficient to consider a person responsible under disciplinary law as having been \u201ccharged\u201d with a crime. As regards the nature of the disciplinary offences in question, the Court further noted that the offences had related solely to professional misconduct and the applicable disciplinary law had not been aimed at the general public but to members of a professional group possessing a special status (see M\u00fcller-Hartburg, cited above, \u00a7 44, and Biagioli, decision cited above, \u00a7\u00a054). In both cases the purpose of the proceedings had been to protect the public trust in, and the reputation of, the profession (see M\u00fcller-Hartburg, cited above, \u00a7\u00a045, and Biagioli, decision cited above, \u00a7 55). The Court further observed in M\u00fcllerHartburg that the disciplinary authorities had been required to have particular regard not only to the degree of culpability but to the damage resulting from the commission of the offence, in particular to members of the public (cited above, \u00a7 45).",

The Court went on to note that, although not crucial to this finding, being disbarred did not necessarily have a permanent effect because a professional who had been disbarred might be reinstated if he or she had been rehabilitated and it were shown that his or her conduct had not been reprehensible (ibid., \u00a7 56).",

It took into account, inter alia, the fact that the licence had been withdrawn a while after the relevant driving offences had been committed, which had meant that prevention and deterrence for the protection of the safety of road users could not have been the only purposes of the measure, and that the severity of the measure, namely suspension of the applicant\u2019s driving licence for eighteen months, had been in itself so significant, regardless of the context of his criminal conviction, that it could ordinarily be viewed as a criminal sanction. In a similar, more recent, case (Rivard v. Switzerland, no. 21563/12, \u00a7 24, 4 October 2016) the Court, finding under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 that the revocation of the applicant\u2019s driving licence was of a criminal nature, took account of the potential seriousness of the measure, including a possibility of revocation for an unlimited period.",

Moreover, the Court appreciates from the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 1 June 1995 that although a measure that prevented a person from obtaining a licence to practise a certain profession amounted to a \u201clegal consequence\u201d of a conviction, it was not to be considered to be a sanction that was criminal in nature (see paragraph 37 above).

However, bearing in mind the above principle and taking into account the considerations made in respect of other factors mentioned in paragraphs 62 to 65 above and the fact that the revocation of the applicant\u2019s licence did not prevent him from practising any other profession within his field of expertise (see, mutatis mutandis, Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a021722/11, \u00a7 93, ECHR 2013), the Court finds that, in the circumstances of the present case, the mere fact that the impugned measure was of a permanent nature does not suffice for the revocation of the applicant\u2019s licence to be regarded as a penalty within the meaning of Article 7.",

Paragraph 90 contains a similar reminder regarding Article 4 of Protocol No. 7: it is stated that \u201cthe notion of \u2018criminal procedure\u2019 in the text of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 must be interpreted in the light of the general principles concerning the corresponding words \u2018criminal charge\u2019 and \u2018penalty\u2019 in Articles 6 and 7\u201d (for the sake of accuracy, Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 does not actually contain the words \u201ccriminal procedure\u201d, but the words \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d, \u201cpenal procedure\u201d and \u201cprevious proceedings\u201d are used). It is also rightly reiterated that in any assessment of the existence of a \u201cpenalty\u201d account may be taken not only of the impugned measure\u2019s imposition following a decision that a person is guilty of a criminal offence, but also other factors, in particular the nature and the severity of the measure in question.

The distinction between the purpose of law and its function comes from the sociology of law primer. The purpose of law (legislative provision) belongs to the domain of wishful normativity; but its function points to its real impact on individuals and society at large. Moreover, the impact on individuals may diverge from the impact on society as a whole. The function of a legal provision may correspond to its purpose, but often it does not. Many legal provisions in fact perform not one but a number of functions.

These two functions differ as regards their \u201caddressees\u201d and purport. The provision applied not only ensures that the professional corps of liquidators is composed exclusively of persons with no criminal record containing \u201cpublicly prosecutable\u201d offences and thus enhances public confidence in this profession, but also safeguards the said profession from such persons who have ever, in their lives, committed such criminal offences with intent, because they are prohibited for life from practising this profession even after they have served their court-imposed sentences, and furthermore, even after the convictions have been expunged from their criminal record.

Notwithstanding the doctrinal principle of Sergey Zolotukhin, as confirmed not long ago in, inter alia, A and B and Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e S\u00e1 v. Portugal (all cited above), the cumulative approach is preferred to the alternative. Why? It is nowhere explained. A proper reference would do, but the reference to Welch (cited above) does not help at all. That reference is a camouflage. Yes, the phrase, which the majority cite, is in Welch. But of much more importance is the point that in that case the Court found a violation of Article 7 \u00a7 1! (I will pass over a range of both similarities and differences between the situation examined in that case and the instant applicant\u2019s situation.)

In contrast, it mentions as falling within the scope of the notion of \u201cpenalty\u201d the \u201cpermanent prohibition on engaging in an occupation ordered by a trial court as a secondary penalty\u201d and refers in this context to the rather recent case of Gouarr\u00e9 Patte v. Andorra (no.\u00a033427/10, 12 January 2016). Gouarr\u00e9 Patte is referred to in the instant judgment in a different context, noting that, unlike in the instant case, that prohibitive measure was set out in criminal law and was not imposed separately from the sentencing procedure (paragraphs 62 and 63). What is noteworthy indeed is that in Gouarr\u00e9 Patte the Court found a violation of Article 7. Despite the difference between the nature of the measure examined in Gouarr\u00e9 Patte and that of the measure examined in the instant case, the case of Gouarr\u00e9 Patte is perhaps the closest to the instant one in the sense that it deals with a conviction-related prohibition.

The brief reasoning underlying this conclusion, as provided in one short paragraph, boils down to the reliance on the finding of the inapplicability of Article 7, which is based on the assessment of the impugned measure as such, which is not only of a non-criminal nature, but not even a sanction at all (paragraph 90). Indeed, if a measure entailed by a conviction is not a criminal sanction not only under domestic law, but also in the autonomous meaning of Article 7 (\u201cthe revocation of the applicant\u2019s licence did not amount to a criminal punishment\u201d; ibid.), it hardly makes sense to speak of a person being \u201cpunished twice\u201d.",

The disputed measure was imposed as an automatic consequence of the applicant\u2019s final criminal conviction. No assessment of the relevance of the criminal offence in question to the applicant\u2019s suitability for the profession of liquidator was carried out by the competent administrative authority and the applicable legislation in fact left no room for such assessment. In this connection, the legislation, that is the Financial Operations Act, contained an irrebuttable presumption (praesumptio iuris et de iure) that a person convicted of any publicly prosecutable criminal offence committed with intent was to be considered unfit to be a liquidator and was to be divested of his or her licence (see, by contrast, M\u00fcller-Hartburg v. Austria, no. 47195/06, \u00a7 44, 19 February 2013). This criterion speaks unequivocally for the penal nature of the measure.",

Instead, as rightly and unanimously held by the Chamber in the framework of its examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the measure is to be characterised as a \u201clegal consequence of conviction\u201d. However, this issue alone does not detach the impugned measure from the applicability of the provisions of criminal law, i.e. in the specific context of the domestic law of the respondent State, of its Criminal Code or Old Criminal Code. Notably, the basis, incurrence and limits of a \u201clegal consequence of conviction\u201d were set out in the criminal law. In particular, Article 100 of the Old Criminal Code (as well as Article 79 of the Criminal Code) set out measures which were to be regarded as \u201clegal consequences of conviction\u201d, including termination of authorisation to perform a public function and a bar to the acquisition of certain rights, such as the right to hold public office and to practise certain professions. Furthermore, Article 99 of the Old Criminal Code (as well as Article 78 of the Criminal Code) limited the incurrence of a \u201clegal consequence of conviction\u201d to cases of a custodial sentence. It further provided that only a statute could prescribe \u201clegal consequences of conviction\u201d and that the latter should not be applied retroactively (ibid.). We wish to highlight that these requirements are expressions of two fundamental principles of criminal law, namely the principle of legality and the prohibition of retroactive application of law, as embodied in Article 7 of the Convention (see Del R\u00edo Prada v. Spain\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a042750/09, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2013).",

Maintaining an inability to reapply for the licence beyond the time limit of legal rehabilitation clearly indicates that the measure\u2019s purpose was essentially punitive, adding another, and in many respects much heavier, legal burden upon the applicant than the imposed criminal sanction itself.",

Switzerland, no. 21563/12, \u00a7 24, 4\u00a0October 2016).",

It is undisputed that this law was not applied to the applicant\u2019s case, but instead a later law (the Financial Operations Act) extending the condition to, inter alia, the absence of any publicly prosecutable criminal offences committed with intent, was applied. This, in our opinion, amounted to a retrospective application of the law to the applicant\u2019s disadvantage and was therefore in violation of Article 7 of the Convention (see Del R\u00edo Prada, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116).",
