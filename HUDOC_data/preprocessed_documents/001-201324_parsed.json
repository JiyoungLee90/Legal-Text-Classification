It discussed possible options for a voter who did not like any of the candidates on the ballot paper. The article indicated that some choices might result in ballots being declared invalid, and that such a finding would benefit the United Russia party. At the same time, the article expressed a fear that the \u201cleftist\u201d parties might only win less than seven percent of votes and thus would not obtain any seats in the State Duma. Those circumstances might result in the excessive dominance of the ruling party, United Russia.
