The courts\u2019 denial of that right forms the essence of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, put forward in her submissions before the Court. Whereas it is true that in her submissions before the Constitutional Court the applicant did not expressly relied on her right to peaceful enjoyment of her possessions, she complained that she had been unable to purchase the flat she occupied. She submitted the same arguments as those in her application to the Court (see\u00a0paragraph 19 above). She thus gave the Constitutional Court adequate opportunity to remedy the situation she is now complaining of before the Court. Thus, the Court considers that the applicant, having raised the issue in substance in his constitutional complaint, did raise before the domestic courts the complaint which she has submitted to the Court (see, by contrast, Ma\u0111er v. Croatia, no. 56185/07, \u00a7 137, 21 June 2011, and Merot d.o.o. and Storitve Tir d.o.o. v. Croatia (dec.), nos. 29426/08 and 29737/08, \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 36, 10 December 2013).

Such rights and obligations were later transferred to the municipalities by Government decree of 19 June 1997 (see paragraph 25 above). The duty incumbent on those bodies to complete pending proceedings for granting specially protected tenancies was reinforced by the Lease of Flats Act.

However, once the appeal by the applicant\u2019s co-workers had been rejected on the basis of the Housing Act and any possible doubts as to their right to challenge the list in front of the court had been dispelled, Zagreb Municipality, which had in the meantime taken responsibility for managing the flat, failed to comply with its own duty under the Housing Act to grant the applicant a specially protected tenancy (see paragraph 52 in conjunction with paragraph 25 of the judgment).",

In our view, the present case presents a new issue (see paragraph 2 above) that requires a reflective approach to the interpretation of the existing general principles. The present judgment relies on general principles from the Radomilja case which are not directly relevant for resolving the complex issue in the present case and clearly fall short of giving careful consideration to that new issue (see paragraphs 47 and 48 of the judgment).",

In reaching the conclusion that it cannot be said that the applicant had a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No.1 (see paragraph 5 above), the majority completely disregarded the fact that the applicant was not able to fulfil the statutory condition because the competent authorities themselves made that impossible for her. Specifically, even though the applicant had fulfilled statutory prerequisites to be granted protected tenancy and on her part did everything that was required of her in this respect, the competent authorities failed to grant her such a tenancy in breach of the relevant provisions of domestic law without providing any reasoning (see paragraphs 19 and 25 of the judgment, and paragraph 4 above).",

Their interpretation to the effect that after the entry into force of the Lease of Flats Act on 5 November 1996 the applicant could no longer be granted a specially protected tenancy is incorrect. In reaching their conclusion they disregarded the transitional provision of the Lease and Flats Act according to which all the proceedings instituted under the Housing Act should be completed under the provisions of that Act even after it was repealed (see paragraph 25 of the judgment). Thus, the situation of the applicant is not irreversible, as they claim. Consequently, the conclusion reached by Judges Lemmens and Ravarani that the failure of the authorities, if any, necessarily fell outside the jurisdiction ratione temporis of the Court, given that Protocol No. 1 entered into force in Croatia on 5 November 1997, that is after the Housing Act had been repealed, appears to be incorrect as well.",

The Court provides an overview of the notion of \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d in Kopeck\u00fd v. Slovakia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45-52) and in B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 74-79). In referring to general principles pertaining to the protection of possessions under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the majority cited two paragraphs from Radomilja Grand Chamber case (see paragraphs 47 and 48 of the judgment, which correspond to paragraphs 142 and 143 of Radomilja case, cited above) and refused to rely on the general principles presented in the B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy Grand Chamber case, in particular those expressed in paragraphs 74 and 79, finding these paragraphs to be contrary to the Court\u2019s established case-law predating the B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy case (see paragraph 48 of the present judgment, where the text quoted from the Radomilja case is compared and contrasted to paragraphs 74 and 79 from the B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy Grand Chamber judgment). In paragraph 74 the B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy judgment merely reaffirmed the principle we find in an earlier Grand Chamber case which followed the Kopeck\u00fd case, namely that of Anheuser-Busch Inc. (see Anheuser-Busch Inc. v. Portugal [GC], no. 73049/01, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2007-I). We consider that the general principles framed in those two Grand Chamber cases (Anheuser-Busch Inc. and B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy), which we do not see as contradicting the general principles reaffirmed in Kopeck\u00fd, set the scene for resolving the present case. Indeed, \u201cin certain circumstances a \u2018legitimate expectation\u2019 of obtaining an asset may also enjoy the protection of Article 1 Protocol No. 1\u201d (id.), and it may so even when the claim is denied (e.g. arbitrarily) or when the statutory conditions have not been fulfilled in the conditional claim (for example where the conditions imposed are discriminatory in nature).

In legal literature, the Court\u2019s notion of legitimate expectations, and in particular its relationship [of legitimate expectations] with the notions of right, claim and legally protected interest, is criticised as being unclear. Different authors demonstrate in particular that the Court\u2019s case-law is controversial regarding both the relevance of legitimate expectations in constituting \u201cpossessions\u201d and the exact nature of claims qualifying as \u201cassets\u201d. We find that the present judgment does not address and discuss sufficiently thoroughly the Court\u2019s general principles relevant to this really rather unusual and complicated case.",

Indeed, in Kopeck\u00fd v. Slovakia (id., \u00a7 35) the Grand Chamber confirmed the principle that a conditional claim which has lapsed as a result of the non-fulfilment of the condition cannot be considered a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1. However, as we have demonstrated above, this principle, without further elaboration, does not provide adequate guidance in the circumstances of the present case.",

We do not see any reason for the Court to adopt a different approach to situations in which the authorities themselves interfere with a claim pendente conditione such that they themselves frustrate the possibility of fulfilling the statutory condition(s), albeit only accidentally or by negligence, as the authorities did in the present case by omitting to grant specially protected tenancy to the applicant, in breach of the applicable law. Indeed, although there is the list which according to the law has a character of a final, enforceable legal act, as also confirmed by the 2004 Zagreb County Court\u2019s judgment, and on which the applicant appeared in first position, the relevant authorities failed to issue a decision granting specially protected tenancy to her without giving reasons for their refusal (see paragraph 4 above, see Kopeck\u00fd, cited above, \u00a7 45).",

Consequently, non-fulfilment of the licit statutory condition, if fulfilment is possible but frustrated by the authorities themselves, should not affect the application of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for lack of legitimate expectations, but the existence of possession should be assumed if the substantive proprietary interest is otherwise sufficiently established under national law. In such a scenario the legitimate expectation should rather play a role in the fair balance test as an argument in the applicant\u2019s favour on a par with other arguments. Otherwise, the responsibility for errors committed by State authorities would be shifted to the applicants even where the latter have at all not contributed to any error. It could also foster arbitrary behaviour on the part of the authorities. It would be absurd if the doctrine of legitimate expectations, which seeks to protect legal certainty, had the effect of compromising legal certainty itself. It should not be forgotten that the essential aim of the legitimate expectation doctrine is to counter arbitrariness. We believe therefore that it is important in the present case to examine whether the circumstances of the case, considered as a whole, conferred on the applicant title to a substantive interest protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Bozcaada Kimisis Teodoku Rum Ortodoks Kilisesi Vakfi v.\u00a0Turkey, nos.\u00a037639/03, 37655/03, 26736/04 and 42670/04, \u00a7 41, 3\u00a0March 2009; Depalle v.

This sharply contrasts with the conclusion of the Constitutional Court in the present case, where it failed to consider the reasons behind the fact that the applicant had no document granting her the protected tenancy over the apartment in which she has now been living for thirty years (see paragraph 54 of the judgment). In our view there is hardly any difference between cases in which the applicants had a specially protected tenancy which they had subsequently lost, and the present case, in which the applicant was not issued with the document granting her protected tenancy even though she fulfilled all the relevant preconditions.",
