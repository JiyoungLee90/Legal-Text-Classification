Italy [GC], no.\u00a064886/01, \u00a7\u00a082, to be published in ECHR 2006). In doing so, the Court has to examine the period between the date of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Croatia and the date of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision (see, by analogy, Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a0103). If the \u2019s decision is consistent with Convention principles, the Court will, when examining the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies, refrain from dealing with the length of the proceedings subsequent to that decision. Otherwise, a genuine examination of the total length after the ratification is warranted.",

It reiterates that Article 6 of the Convention does not compel the Contracting States to set up courts of appeal or of cassation. However, where such courts do exist, the guarantees of Article 6 must be complied with, for instance in that it guarantees to litigants an effective right of access to the courts for the determination of their \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d. The manner in which Article 6 \u00a7 1 applies to courts of appeal or of cassation depends on the special features of the proceedings concerned and account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings conducted in the domestic legal order and the court of cassation\u2019s role in them; the conditions of admissibility of an appeal on points of law may be stricter than for an ordinary appeal (see, inter alia, Brualla G\u00f3mez de la Torre v.

In particular, the Court considers that increasing the financial threshold for appeals to the Supreme Court in order to stop that court being overloaded with cases of lesser importance, was a legitimate aim. Moreover, the solution adopted in the instant case by the Croatian legislator followed a generally recognised principle that procedural rules apply immediately to the pending proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Brualla G\u00f3mez de la Torre v.
