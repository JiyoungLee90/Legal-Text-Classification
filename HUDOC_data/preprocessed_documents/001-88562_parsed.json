I concur in this opinion. The view taken by the majority as regards this question in Rt-1994-1244, the 'Women's Prison' case, cannot be maintained following the adoption of the Human Rights Act. Given the relatively limited requirements that can now be made in this respect for this type of suit, I also find that [the applicant] has a sufficient actual interest in the suit; see NOU 2001:32 Rett p\u00e5 sak (Straight to the Point), pp. 201-202.",

Once it has been accepted that a suit may be brought with a claim for a declaratory judgment asserting a breach of the Convention, the way in which such a claim should be dealt with depends, in my view, on Norwegian rules of procedure. It is therefore not decisive that the screening system, which according to the first voting judge should be applied, will not be contrary to the Convention. Under Norwegian procedural law, the assessment of whether the conditions for filing suit have been satisfied is based on the plaintiff's submissions with regard to the claim he or she is putting forward. If the claim \u2013 in the event manifestly ill-founded \u2013 cannot succeed, judgment must be given for the respondent after a hearing on the merits of the claim. In my view, it would be contrary to this principle to procedurally dismiss on a non-statutory basis manifestly unfounded lawsuits regarding breaches of the Convention after a summary examination on the merits, cf. the majority vote in Rt-1994-1244, NOU 2001:32 Rett p\u00e5 sak, p. 201, and Schei: Tvistem\u00e5lsloven med kommentarer (The Code of Civil Procedure, with commentary), 2nd edition, p. 270.",

I would also note that the considerations that serve as grounds for the various dismissal provisions in Article 35 of the Convention may appear in a different light as regards lawsuits brought before national courts. A rule on summary dismissal of the kind at issue in this instance will, in my view, give rise to several procedural problems, concerning notably the legal force of the orders. My objections to such an arrangement also hold good if a rule of summary dismissal departing from Article 35 \u00a7 3 were to apply on a non-statutory basis, for instance if one were to apply a less stringent practice of summary dismissal than that of the European Court or if the scope of the summary dismissal rule were to be limited in another discretionary manner.",

However, such suits are \u2013 in my view \u2013 a consequence of the fact that it has now been made permissible to file suit complaining of a Convention breach irrespective of whether a judgment of this nature would entail specific legal effects for the plaintiff. In my view, an attempt must be made to reduce the problems that arise in this connection by adopting rules regarding simplified judicial hearings as has been proposed by the Civil Procedure Committee. In this connection, I wish to comment that the purpose of the screening system in question here will in actual fact be to introduce, on a non-statutory basis, a simplified hearing on the merits of the claims covered by the arrangement.\u201d",

The disclosure of information to the child welfare authorities was of limited nature, was subject to a duty on their part to maintain the confidentiality of the information and was notified to the applicant; it was thus accompanied by effective and adequate safeguards against abuse (see M.S. v.

Its guarantees extend only to rights which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21\u00a0February\u00a01986, Series A no. 98, and Z and Others, \u00a7 81, and the authorities cited therein, together with McElhinney v.

Where, moreover, the superior national courts have analysed in a comprehensive and convincing manner the precise nature of the impugned restriction, on the basis of the relevant Convention case-law and principles drawn therefrom, this Court would need strong reasons to differ from the conclusion reached by those courts by substituting its own views for those of the national courts on a question of interpretation of domestic law (see Z and Others, cited above, \u00a7 101) and by finding, contrary to their view, that there was arguably a right recognised by domestic law (see Fogarty, cited above, \u00a7 120).",

In instances where the relevant conditions were deemed to be fulfilled the authorities were under an obligation to carry out an investigation and the duty of secrecy pertaining to personal data did not apply. With regard to the latter point, the present case can be assimilated to those of Anne Marie Andersson (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 34-37) and M.S. v. Sweden (cited above, pp. 1451-52, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a048-50), in which the Court found that a \u201cright \u201c to prevent communication of the personal data in question could not, on arguable grounds, be said to be recognised under comparable provisions of Swedish law and that, accordingly, Article 6 \u00a7 1 was not applicable. The Court is further mindful of the fact that the disputed measures were not classified as a \u201cdecision\u201d that could form the subject of an administrative appeal under the Public Administration Act or a judicial appeal under Article 54 of the Code of Civil Procedure, according to traditional doctrine and as applied by the lower courts in the present case. It could hardly be said that the investigation itself had a decisive effect on the applicant's rights. Only subsequent measures taken in light of the findings made during an investigation, notably compulsory taking into care or restrictions on access, would have been capable of having such effect.

Since it was not decisive for the applicant's rights and obligations, he did not have a \u201clegal interest\u201d in the sense of Article 54 in having it judicially established whether the investigation had been unlawful. While acknowledging the correctness of this interpretation according to national case-law, the Supreme Court emphasised that the investigation had been closed by the time the case had reached it (see paragraph 25 of the Supreme Court's decision, quoted at paragraph 36 above). Furthermore, an investigation under section 4-3 of the 1992 Act and a request for disclosure of personal data under its section 6-4 did not constitute an individual decision in the sense of the Public Administration Act but \u201cprocedural steps\u201d, the lawfulness of which could not form \u201cthe object of a separate lawsuit pursuant to Article 54 of the Code of Civil Procedure\u201d.

Whilst the dismissal of the lawsuit was upheld, it could therefore arguably be maintained, in view of the scope of the Supreme Court's review, that this review complied with the right to a court under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Zumtobel v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 21 September 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0268A, p.\u00a010, \u00a7\u00a032; Fischer v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 18, \u00a7 34; Z and Others, cited above, \u00a7 101). However, for the reasons set out below, the Court does not find it necessary to determine this issue.",

The situation, here, is unusual: on the one hand we have a father with a disability, who was nonetheless awarded custody of his children, and on the other we have the social services, whose role is to secure the children's well-being and who have wide powers in that respect. The mother, for her part, appears to play only a secondary role. The investigations were in fact therefore carried out in respect of the applicant. Although conducted in an administrative context, the investigations are of a type such as to affect the applicant, that is, the children's father. In order to answer the question as to whether a dispute over a \u201cright\u201d is in issue, one cannot base oneself on the fact that the applicant has not been adversely affected. If one were to proceed in that way, the existence of a right would be conditional on the \u2013 favourable or unfavourable \u2013 outcome of the dispute.",

The existence of a\u00a0\u201cright\u201d cannot therefore be seriously disputed. That the right is also a \u201ccivil\u201d one is manifestly clear from the family-law context. This has been confirmed by the Court's case-law from the outset. Measures affecting parent-child relationships (visits, return etc.) indisputably fall within the civil-law sphere, as they are an aspect of contentious proceedings relating to personal rights (see, for example, O. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8\u00a0July\u00a01987, Series A no. 120, \u00a7 60). In the present case the measures in question could potentially have been part of pre-contentious proceedings that could have given rise to measures affecting custody of the children. The points made in paragraph 100 of the judgment show clearly that this could have been the case.",
