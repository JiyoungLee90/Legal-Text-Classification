As a practising Muslim, he prayed five times a day and kept the fast of Ramadan. The documents produced by the Government for the first time when the proceedings were already before the Court did not constitute evidence of his alleged membership of the Muslim fundamentalist S\u00fcleyman sect (S\u00fcleymancilik tarikati), whose existence he had been unaware of. Moreover, the Supreme Military Council\u2019s decision infringed the principle of judges\u2019 security of tenure, which was set forth in Article 139 of the Constitution. ",

The Government argued that the question whether Mr Kala\u00e7 should be allowed to remain a member of the armed forces lay at the heart of the problem submitted to the Court. His compulsory retirement was not an interference with his freedom of conscience, religion or belief but was intended to remove from the military legal service a person who had manifested his lack of loyalty to the foundation of the Turkish nation, namely secularism, which it was the task of the armed forces to guarantee. The applicant belonged to the S\u00fcleyman sect, as a matter of fact, if not formally, and participated in the activities of the S\u00fcleyman community, which was known to have unlawful fundamentalist tendencies. Various documents annexed to the memorial to the Court showed that the applicant had given it legal assistance, had taken part in training sessions and had intervened on a number of occasions in the appointment of servicemen who were members of the sect. On the basis of those documents, a committee of five officers drawn from the highest echelons of the military had concluded that by taking and carrying out instructions from the leaders of the sect Group Captain Kala\u00e7 had breached military discipline and should accordingly be compulsorily retired pursuant to section 50 (c) of the Military Personnel Act. The Supreme Military Council had based its decision on this opinion, which had been approved by the high command and the air force chief of staff.",

The Delegate observed that, in support of their memorial to the Court, the Government had produced documents which, during the proceedings before the Commission, had been said to be \"secret in the interests of national security\". In any event, these documents did not support the argument that Mr Kala\u00e7 had any links with a sect. ",

The Court reiterates that while religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies, inter alia, freedom to manifest one\u2019s religion not only in community with others, in public and within the circle of those whose faith one shares, but also alone and in private (see the Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260-A, p. 17, para. 31). Article 9 (art. 9) lists a number of forms which manifestation of one\u2019s religion or belief may take, namely worship, teaching, practice and observance. Nevertheless, Article 9 (art. 9) does not protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief. Moreover, in exercising his freedom to manifest his religion, an individual may need to take his specific situation into account. ",
