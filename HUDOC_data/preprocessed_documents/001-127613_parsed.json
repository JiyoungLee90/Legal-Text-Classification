The minimum standards of effectiveness defined by the Court\u2019s case-law include the requirements that the investigation be independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny. It is beyond doubt that a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. A prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Bat\u0131 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 136). When the official investigation has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirement of the prohibition of ill-treatment. While there is no absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction or in a particular sentence, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow grave attacks on physical and moral integrity to go unpunished (see Okkal\u0131 v. Turkey, no. 52067/99, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2006-XII (extracts)).",

Firstly, neither the public prosecutor nor the national courts obtained statements from the other police officers who were on duty at the time of the applicant\u2019s detention in police custody, or from any other witnesses, such as persons detained at the same time as the applicant. The courts relied solely on the statements of the applicant, who apparently was unable to give evidence in court on account of mental instability. Furthermore, the national courts failed to give the applicant or his lawyer the opportunity to examine the accused in person. As a result, relying on the medical reports and in the absence of any witness statements, the Samsun Assize Court found it established that the applicant had been ill-treated but it failed to identify and punish the perpetrators. Thirdly, there is nothing in the case-file to indicate that the accused police officer was suspended from duty while he was under investigation. On this point, the Court underlines the importance of the suspension from duty of the agent under investigation in order to prevent any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman cited above, \u00a7 55). Finally, the Court cannot but notice that there were substantial delays in the criminal proceedings in question: they lasted more than nine years, a delay that runs contrary to the requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition.",
