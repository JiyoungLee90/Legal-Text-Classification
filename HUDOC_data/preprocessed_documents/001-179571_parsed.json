On the contrary, an obligation to carry out an effective investigation has its own distinct scope of application and operates independently from the substantive limb of Articles\u00a02 and\u00a03 (see Varnava and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a016064/90 and 8 others, \u00a7\u00a0136, ECHR 2009). Throughout the Court\u2019s case-law, that obligation has evolved into a separate and autonomous duty, capable of binding the State even when the death or ill-treatment took place before ratification (see \u0160ilih v.\u00a0Slovenia [GC], no.\u00a071463/01, \u00a7\u00a0159, 9\u00a0April\u00a02009; Stanimirovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a028-29; and Ota\u0161evi\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia, no.\u00a032198/07, \u00a7\u00a024, 5\u00a0February\u00a02013). The obligation is of a continuing nature, in the sense that it binds the State throughout the period in which the authorities can reasonably be expected to take measures with the aim of elucidating the circumstances of the death or ill-treatment and establishing responsibility for them (see \u0160ilih, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0157).",

Where the impugned events occurred before ratification, only procedural acts and/or omissions occurring after that date can fall within the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0162). Furthermore, there must be a genuine connection between the death or ill-treatment and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State for the procedural obligations imposed by Articles\u00a02 and\u00a03 to come into effect. For that connection to be established, two cumulative criteria must be met: firstly, the lapse of time between the death or ill-treatment and the entry into force of the Convention must have been reasonably short (not exceeding ten years) and secondly, it must be established that a significant proportion of the procedural steps that were decisive for the course of the investigation were or ought to have been carried out after the ratification of the Convention by the State concerned (see Janowiec and Others v.\u00a0Russia [GC], nos.\u00a055508/07 and\u00a029520/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0145-148, ECHR 2013).",

The Court has already held that a constitutional appeal should, in principle, be considered an effective domestic remedy within the meaning of Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention in respect of all applications introduced against Serbia after 7\u00a0August\u00a02008 (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], nos.\u00a017153/11 and 29 others, \u00a7\u00a084, 25\u00a0March\u00a02014, and Vin\u010di\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Serbia, nos.\u00a044698/06 and others, \u00a7\u00a051, 1\u00a0December\u00a02009). It sees no reason to depart from this practice in the present case. If the applicant had raised a substantive complaint under Article 3 concerning the events in 2003, the complaint would have been (as the Constitutional Court also established) incompatible with the provisions of the Convention ratione temporis. However, the applicant\u2019s complaint concerns the procedural obligation to conduct an effective investigation. The applicant raised this complaint in his appeal to the Constitutional Court but the reply he received did not deal with the specific complaint. The Government\u2019s contention, that the remedy was not capable of addressing the issues because of the temporal limitation on the Constitutional Court\u2019s jurisdiction, is therefore not convincing. No other argument has been made which would suggest that the applicant could not reasonably have expected that the Constitutional Court was able to consider a complaint concerning the procedural obligation, and so the Court accepts that the six month period should be calculated from the moment when the applicant received the decision of the Constitutional Court.",

Firstly, an effective investigation is one which is adequate, that is an investigation which is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Labita [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a0131; Boicenco v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a041088/05, \u00a7\u00a0120, 11\u00a0July\u00a02006; and Stanimirovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040). Secondly, for an investigation to be considered effective it may generally be regarded as necessary for the persons responsible for and carrying out the investigation to be independent from those implicated in the events, which means not only a lack of hierarchical or institutional connection but also a practical independence (see Ramsahai and Others [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a0325; see also \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a052442/09, \u00a7\u00a085, ECHR 2011 (extracts), and the authorities citied therein). Thirdly, the investigation has to be thorough, which means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions (see Assenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0103; see also Stanimirovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040). Fourthly, there is an obligation to react promptly and take action as soon as an official complaint has been lodged. Even when strictly speaking no complaint has been made, an investigation must be started if there are sufficiently clear indications that ill-treatment has been used (see Stanimirovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a039). Fifthly, an effective investigation is one which affords a sufficient element of public scrutiny to secure accountability. While the degree of public scrutiny may vary, the complainant must be afforded effective access to the investigatory procedure in all cases (see \u0110eki\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Serbia, no.\u00a032277/07, \u00a7\u00a033, 29\u00a0April\u00a02014).",
