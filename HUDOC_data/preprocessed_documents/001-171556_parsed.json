However, the Court observes that two notable periods of inactivity occurred when the case was pending before the Constitutional Court for more than one year and one month during the first set of proceedings (from 5 August 2005 to 25 September 2006; see paragraph\u00a012\u00a0above) and for another one year and eight months during the second set of proceedings (from 25 March 2009 until 29 November 2010; see paragraph 21 above) before the Constitutional Court declined to examine the complaint. There are no indications that these delays, which significantly added to the overall length of the proceedings, can be attributed to the applicant\u2019s conduct.",

However, the Court considers that the importance of the matter was somewhat reduced by the fact that the applicant only initiated the proceedings more than one year after the employment relationship had ended. In the light of the fact, accepted by both parties (see paragraphs 26 and 27 above), that the total period of the applicant\u2019s unemployment amounted to one and a half years, the Court finds that most of that period was not related to the length of the proceedings at issue.",
