The case originated in an application (no. 75985/12) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Mr Vasile Bahnă (“the applicant”), on 23 November 2012.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr D. Afloroaei, a lawyer practising in Iaşi. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the physical conditions of detention in Romanian prisons, the illnesses he had developed during his detention, and the lack of adequate medical care for his illnesses had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention.
On 4 April 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1976. He is currently detained in Iaşi Prison.
On an unspecified date the applicant was convicted of rape and sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment.
According to the medical documents submitted by the parties, the applicant started serving his prison sentence on 9 August 2004.
In his initial letters to the Court the applicant contended that conditions had been overcrowded and squalid in the Romanian prisons. In addition, he submitted that the cells had lacked sufficient air, had been infested by insects and rodents, and constituted a major health hazard. Also the food was insufficient and inadequate and the detainees did not have a place on which meals could be served.
Between 28 September 2004 and 10 October 2012 the applicant had been detained on six occasions in Târgu-Ocna Prison Hospital for periods of time varying from one week to more than three months in cells measuring 50.6 sq. m. The number of detainees he had to share the cells with changed every day. For the last seven days of his detention he had been detained in cells with nine beds. The rest of the time he was detained in cells with sixteen beds. The number of detainees had not been higher than the number of beds.
From 5 January 2005 to date the applicant was detained on fourteen occasions in Iaşi Prison in various sections of the prison. During his detention he was afforded between 1.33 and 3.98 sq. m of living space.
Between 6 July 2006 and 10 January 2007 the applicant was detained three times in Rahova Prison Hospital, for six days on each occasion. During his detention he was afforded between 6.2 and 7.46 sq. m of living space.
Between 24 August 2006 and 13 March 2008 the applicant was detained four times in Jilava Prison for periods varying from twelve days to more than three months. During most of his detention he was afforded between 1.54 and 3.65 sq. m of living space. During the last month he spent in the aforementioned detention facility, he was occasionally afforded 5.80 sq. m of living space.
From 15 September to 16 November 2006 the applicant was detained in Arad Prison. During his detention he was afforded between 3.46 and 5.77 sq. m of living space.
Between 30 September 2011 and 20 November 2012 the applicant was detained on three occasions in Tulcea Prison for periods between two weeks and two months. During his detention he was afforded between 1.69 and 4.96 sq. m of living space.
Between 10 October 2011 and 12 July 2012 the applicant was detained on two occasions in Timişoara Prison. During his detention he was afforded between 2.33 and 2.60 sq. m of living space.
From 18 November 2011 to 27 April 2012 the applicant was detained in Botoşani Prison. During his detention he was afforded between 2.31 and 3.52 sq. m of living space.
Between 11 September and 5 November 2012 the applicant was detained on two occasions in Vaslui Prison. During his detention he was afforded between 1.98 and 2.45 sq. m of living space.
From 14 to 21 November 2012 the applicant was detained in Focşani Prison where he was afforded 4.72 sq. m of living space. The number of available beds in the cell was forty-six and the number of detainees was fifty-two.
All the detention cells had sanitary facilities, were fitted with one or more windows and were connected to electricity and running water. They could be ventilated by opening the windows and were equipped with storage areas. In addition they were furnished with beds, tables and chairs, amongst other items.
The detention cells were disinfected daily with chlorine. The detainees were provided with cleaning materials and they were responsible for cleaning the cells. At least every trimester the prison authorities or specialised contractors carried out work to eradicate rodents and insects. In some prisons, like Focşani Prison, the prison authorities undertook measures to eradicate bed bugs. The bed bugs had been spotted occasionally by detainees, but had not developed into a general problem. In Iaşi and Jilava prisons the walls were also painted at regular intervals or whenever necessary. The latter prison authorities also provided the detainees with waste baskets and collected garbage daily.
The food was prepared hygienically and was fresh. Its quality was inspected daily by a representative of the prison personnel, a member of the medical staff and a representative of the detainees. It also had the legally required quality and number of calories.
On 10 August 2004 the applicant underwent a medical examination to determine his medical condition at the time of incarceration. According to the medical paper issued on the same day, he was suffering from a psychological disorder. No other medical condition was identified in the medical paper.
From 28 September 2004 to 5 January 2005 the applicant was a patient in Târgu-Ocna Prison Hospital. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis, reactivated chronic sinusitis and antisocial personality disorder. He was provided with treatment for these conditions and given a special food diet. He was discharged from the hospital to Iaşi Prison upon request, after his condition had improved. He was recommended anti-tuberculosis treatment under strict supervision.
From 6 to 22 June 2005, from 19 January to 1 February 2006, 21 March to 6 April 2007 and 16 to 26 September 2008 the applicant was hospitalised repeatedly in Târgu-Ocna Prison Hospital for medical evaluation of his condition following his tuberculosis. He was examined, provided with treatment and a special diet.
On 15 November 2006 and 10 January 2007 the applicant was diagnosed and treated for otitis, amongst other things, in Rahova Prison Hospital, having initially refused treatment. His condition improved and he was discharged with the recommendation to avoid getting water in his ears and to steer clear of infections. Subsequently, his condition was monitored and treated repeatedly.
On 13 October 2011 the applicant was examined by the Timişoara Prison doctor and was diagnosed with a deviated septum.
On 16 March 2012 the applicant was examined by a specialist doctor at the Botoşani Emergency County Hospital. He was diagnosed inter alia with sinusitis and was provided with treatment.
From 2 to 9 October 2012 the applicant was again hospitalised in Târgu-Ocna Prison Hospital. He was diagnosed and treated for toxic hepatitis, chronic obstructive bronchopneumonia, microcytic anaemia and breathing difficulties. The fact that he was a smoker was considered a risk factor. According to his discharge papers, he was discharged at his own request and ignoring medical advice to remain hospitalised. His condition had evolved favourably. He had been advised to avoid smoking or inhaling toxic agents, and to obtain treatment with antibiotics or other stronger medication if needed during periods of respiratory infection.
After he had been discharged from the prison and civilian hospitals, the applicant’s medical condition continued to be monitored and treated regularly in prison and civilian hospitals every time he agreed to be examined, tested and to take his medication.
On 12 March 2007 the applicant asked the Iaşi Prison authorities to release a copy of his medical file in order for his family to be able to send it to the Romanian Ministry of Health. In his request he had mentioned that the prison doctor had refused to examine him and provide him with medical treatment.
On 5 June 2011 and 5 March 2012 the applicant allegedly lodged two separate sets of complaints with the Iaşi and Botoşani District Courts, respectively, concerning the inhuman and degrading conditions in Romanian Prisons. However, his complaints allegedly remained unanswered.
On 20 May 2013 the Rahova Prison Hospital informed the Government that the illnesses that the applicant had complained about before the Court, namely anaemia, breathing difficulties, sinusitis, otitis, deviated septum, bronchopneumonia and toxic hepatitis – some of them chronic – had not been generated purely by the ambience the applicant lived in. Consequently, the fact that he had developed the said illnesses during his detention had been only a coincidence.
On the same date the prison authorities informed the Government that, except for his request of 12 March 2007, the applicant had not lodged any other complaints before the relevant domestic non-judicial or judicial authorities in respect of the alleged lack of adequate medical care.
Excerpts from the relevant domestic legislation and international reports – namely Emergency Ordinance no. 56/2003, and subsequently Law no. 275/2006 on the serving of prison sentences; the reports of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”); and Recommendation Rec(2006)2 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to member States on prison conditions are set out in the cases of Bragadireanu v. Romania (no. 22088/04, §§ 73-75, 6 December 2007), Artimenco v. Romania (no. 12535/04, §§ 22-23, 30 June 2009), and Iacov Stanciu v. Romania (no. 35972/05, §§ 116-29, 24 July 2012).
In its report (CPT/Inf (2011) 31) published on 24 November 2011 following a visit from 5 to 16 September 2010 to a number of detention facilities in Romania, the CPT expressed concerns over the limited living space available to the prisoners and the inadequate amount of space specified by the regulations in place at that time.
