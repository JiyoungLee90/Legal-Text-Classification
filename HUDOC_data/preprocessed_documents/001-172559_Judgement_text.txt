The case originated in eight applications (nos. 20589/13, 21219/13, 33164/13, 33593/13, 52270/13, 65308/13, 26424/14 and 26994/14) against the Republic of Azerbaijan lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eight Azerbaijani nationals, Mr Sakhavat Sarhad oglu Mehtiyev, Mr Tunjay Asaf oglu Guliyev, Mr Azer Nadir oglu Sadikhov, Mr Osman Hidayat oglu Ahmadov, Ms Khadija Rovshan gizi Ismayilova, Mr Javid Nizami oglu Garayev, Mr Javid Ibrahim oglu Hajibeyli and Mr Tural Alovsat oglu Sadigli (“the applicants”), on various dates in 2013 and 2014 (see Appendix).
The applicants were represented by various lawyers practising in Azerbaijan (see Appendix). Mr Sadikhov (application no. 33164/13), Mr Ahmadov (application no. 33593/13) and Mr Sadigli (application no. 26994/14) were granted legal aid. The Azerbaijani Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Ç. Asgarov.
On 19 May 2014 (application no. 21219/13), 29 August 2014 (applications nos. 20589/13, 33164/13, 33593/13, 52270/13 and 65308/13) and 2 October 2014 (applications nos. 26424/14 and 26994/14) the complaints concerning Article 5, raised in all the applications except for application no. 65308/13, Article 6, raised in all the applications except for application no. 65308/13, Article 10, raised in all the applications except for applications nos. 26424/14 and 26994/14, and Article 11, raised in all the applications, were communicated to the Government. On the same dates the remainder of applications nos. 20589/13, 21219/13, 33164/13, 33593/13 and 52270/13 were declared inadmissible.
The Government objected to the examination of the applications by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejected it.
The applicants’ dates of birth and places of residence are given in the Appendix.
On 12 January, 26 January, 10 March and 29 December 2013 demonstrations were planned to be held in Baku. It appears that the organisers of the demonstrations gave no proper prior notice to the relevant authority, the Baku City Executive Authority (“the BCEA”). Information about the demonstrations was disseminated through Facebook or the press.
According to the applicants, the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were conducted in a peaceful manner. The demonstrations of 12 January and 10 March 2013 were aimed at protesting about the deaths of soldiers in the army. The demonstration of 26 January 2013 condemned the use of force by the police against the participants of previous demonstrations, while those taking part in the demonstration of 29 December 2013 were protesting against bureaucratic injustices which had allegedly caused a disabled war veteran to set himself on fire on 25 December 2013.
Each applicant attended one of the demonstrations (see Appendix), but shortly after they had begun the police started to disperse those who had gathered. All the applicants were arrested during the dispersal operations and were taken to various police stations.
The applicants were questioned at the police stations they were taken to.
On the day of each applicant’s arrest administrative offence reports (inzibati xəta haqqında protokol) were issued, which stated that the applicants had committed an administrative offence under Article 298.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences (“the CAO”) (participation in a public assembly that had not been organised in accordance with the law).
Some of the applicants refused to sign the administrative offence reports (applications nos. 52270/13, 26424/14 and 26994/14).
According to most of the applicants, they were never served with copies of the administrative offence reports or with other documents from their case files. They were not given access to a lawyer after their arrest or while they were in police custody.
According to statements (ərizə) written by the applicants in applications nos. 20589/13 and 33164/13 at the police stations on the day of their arrest (12 January and 10 March 2013 respectively), they refused the services of a lawyer.
The applicants in applications nos. 20589/13 and 26424/14 were released after being kept in police custody for a few hours, subject to an undertaking to reappear at the police station on various dates.
Most of the applicants were taken to trial courts directly from the police stations, either on the day of their arrest or the following day. The applicants in applications nos. 20589/13 and 26424/14 were brought before first-instance courts on the day they returned to the police station.
According to most of the applicants, the court hearing in each case was very brief. Members of the public were not allowed in the courtroom, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public.
According to most of the applicants, they were not given an opportunity to appoint lawyers of their own choosing. State-funded lawyers were asked to assist some of them. The applicants in applications nos. 21219/13, 33164/13, 33593/13 and 26994/14 were not represented by a lawyer. According to documents from the case files, the applicants in applications nos. 21219/13, 33164/13 and 26994/14 refused the assistance of a State-funded lawyer and decided to defend themselves in person.
According to the transcript of the hearing concerning the applicant in application no. 20589/13, the State-funded lawyer stated briefly in his oral submissions that the applicant was guilty and asked the court for lenience. Similarly, the State-funded lawyer for the applicant in application no. 26424/14 stated in general terms that the applicant was not guilty and asked the court to discontinue the case. In addition, none of the material submitted to the Court contains any record of showing that the State-funded lawyer, Mr V.M., made any oral or written submissions on behalf of the applicant in application no. 52270/13.
The only witnesses questioned during the court hearings with respect to the applicants in applications nos. 20589/13 and 26424/14 were the police officers who, according to the official records, had arrested them. The police officers testified that the applicants had staged unauthorised demonstrations. No witnesses were questioned by the courts in the other applicants’ cases.
The first-instance courts found that the applicants had participated in unauthorised demonstrations. The applicants were convicted under Article 298.2 of the CAO and sentenced to a period of administrative detention, varying from thirteen to seventeen days, or to a fine of 400 or 500 Azerbaijani manats (AZN) (see Appendix).
On various dates the applicants lodged appeals with the Baku Court of Appeal, arguing that their convictions had been in violation of their rights because the demonstrations in which they had participated or attempted to participate had been peaceful. The applicants also complained that their arrests had been unlawful and that the hearings before the first-instance courts had not been fair. They asked the Baku Court of Appeal to quash the first-instance courts’ decisions in their cases.
The applicants in applications nos. 21219/13, 52270/13 and 26424/14 were assisted before the Baku Court of Appeal by lawyers of their own choosing. The other applicants were not represented by a lawyer.
On various dates the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants’ appeals and upheld the decisions of the first-instance courts (see Appendix).
In its decision with regard to the applicant in application no. 33593/13 the Court of Appeal noted, inter alia, that he had voluntarily refused legal assistance at the pre-trial stage.
At the time of the applicants’ arrest, Article 5 § IV of the Law on Freedom of Assembly of 13 November 1998 provided that no prior written notification was required for spontaneous assemblies.
Before amendments introduced by Law no. 462-IVQD of 2 November 2012, a breach of the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies was punishable under Article 298 of the Code of Administrative Offences of 2000 (“the CAO”) by a reprimand or a fine of seven to thirteen manats (AZN).
Law no. 462-IVQD of 2 November 2012, which entered into force on 1 January 2013, introduced new wording to Article 298 of the CAO on breaching the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies. According to that amendment, participation in an assembly organised in breach of such rules became explicitly punishable under Article 298.2 of the CAO and punishments in the form of administrative detention of up to 15 days or community service were introduced for the first time. In addition, the fine for a breach of the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies was increased and the amounts fixed as follows: between AZN 300 and 600 for participants of an assembly; AZN 1,500 to AZN 3,000 for individuals who organise an assembly; AZN 3,000 to AZN 6,000 for persons in charge (vəzifəli şəxslər) who organise an assembly; and between AZN 15,000 and AZN 30,000 for legal entities involved in the organisation of an assembly.
A further increase in the penalties for breaching the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies occured in May 2013. By Law no. 651-IVQD of 14 May 2013, which entered into force on 5 June 2013, the administrative detention sentence foreseen in Article 298.1 and Article 298.2 of the CAO was increased to “up to two months”.
According to Presidential Order (sərəncam) no. 1866 of 1 December 2011, which was in force until 1 September 2013, the minimum wage in Azerbaijan was AZN 93.5.
The relevant extracts of Resolution 1917 (2013) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, “The honouring of obligations and commitments by Azerbaijan”, read as follows:
“... 10.  Regrettably, there is no political dialogue with the opposition parties outside parliament. The Assembly is concerned by the restrictive climate for the activities of the extra-parliamentary opposition, which complains about limitations imposed on freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and the lack of access to the public media.
The establishment of an inclusive political system and a truly competitive and unrestrictive political environment requires full implementation of basic freedoms, including freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of association. The situation in Azerbaijan is preoccupying and the Assembly expresses its deep concern in this regard.
Recently adopted amendments to the Criminal Code and the Administrative Code, which have increased penalties for the organisers of, and participants in, “unauthorised” gatherings, raise concern. Considering the authorities’ ongoing blanket ban on protests in the Baku city centre, these amendments are likely to have a further negative impact on freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. The restrictive use of certain articles of the Criminal Code, in particular Articles 221 and 233, against participants in peaceful, albeit unauthorised, demonstrations, is another matter of concern. ...”
The relevant extracts of Report (CommDH(2013)14) of 6 August 2013 by Nils Muižnieks, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, following his visit to Azerbaijan from 22 to 24 May 2013, read as follows:
“... 76.  The Commissioner is deeply concerned by the recent amendments to the Law on Freedom of Assembly, the Criminal Code and the Code of Administrative Offences, which further erode the right to freedom of assembly. The sanctions which can now be imposed, coupled with the fact that local authorities have not authorised a single rally in Baku city centre in recent years, clearly have a chilling effect on the organisation of or participation in demonstrations.
The Commissioner is of the view that participants in peaceful assemblies should not be sanctioned for the mere fact of being present at and actively participating in the demonstration in question, provided they do not do anything illegal, violent or obscene in the course of it. The Commissioner therefore urges the authorities to ensure that no disproportionate sanction, which would undermine the fundamental right to peaceful assembly, is imposed. ...”

Azerbaijan (no. 60259/11, §§ 27-42, 15 October 2015).
