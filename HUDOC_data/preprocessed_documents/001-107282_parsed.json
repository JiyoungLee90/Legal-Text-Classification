The rule is based on the assumption that the domestic system provides an effective remedy in respect of the alleged breach.

However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Mirazovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 13628/03, 6 May 2006).",

The proceedings then continued as regards the remainder of the impugned contract, which was itself cancelled by judgment of the Fifth Municipal Court of 17 June 2003 (see paragraph 21 above). On 24 March 2004 judge B participated in the adoption of the decision to quash this judgment on appeal (see paragraph 22 above). In such circumstances, the Court notes that the decisions of 25 December 2000 and 24 March 2004 seemingly concerned different issues, i.e. the partial annulment of the contract on the one hand and the cancellation of its remainder on the other. However, on both occasions the decisions in question relied on the same set of inter-related facts concerning the deceased\u2019s complex relationship with his son and his wife, and essentially dealt with the same original claim through which the latter sought a comprehensive determination of her interests arising in this context (see, mutatis mutandis, Fatullayev v. Azerbaijan, no. 40984/07, \u00a7 139, 22 April 2010). Moreover, whilst the decision of 25 December 2000 had clearly been rendered partly against the interests of the applicant, the decision of 24\u00a0March 2004 contained no pronouncements as to how the remainder of the plaintiff\u2019s claim ought to be adjudicated. Taking into account the overall context in which the decision to quash the earlier decision on technical grounds was adopted and the fact that it did not finally determine the outcome of the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s favour, it cannot either reasonably be argued that judge B had ruled once against the applicant and once in line with his interests. Lastly, the Court notes that judge D had taken part in the adoption of the District Court\u2019s said decision of 24 March 2004, ordering a remittal, as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 20 April 2006 whereby the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law had been rejected, and that both decisions concerned the cancellation of the remainder of the contract at issue (see paragraphs 21, 22 and 25 above).",
