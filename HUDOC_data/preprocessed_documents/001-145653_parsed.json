With regard to the alleged violations of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention, he responded that it had already been shown that the applicant had abandoned his wife and putative children, that the parent-child relationship had not been established and that the applicant had not shown that he had maintained ties with them. The applicant responded by arguing that an anomaly in the referencing of the birth certificates was not sufficient to establish the doubtful authenticity or fraudulent nature of the documents submitted by his wife. He noted firstly, with regard to Benjamin\u2019s birth certificate, \u201cthat it was not certain that the certificate sought by the authorities was related to the document in question, given that the first component of its reference number seemed to be made up of three figures, rather than two (\u201c?78/2004\u201d) (see paragraph\u00a019 above), which would be more coherent, given the date it had been drawn up, in September 2004\u201d. He argued that the Minister did not explain how UNHCR/Cameroon had issued a Family Composition Certificate (dated 26\u00a0September 2008, referring to his wife and his three children) and official travel documents permitting his family to travel internationally. He pointed out that he had submitted to the court correspondence from the Cameroonian Ministry for External Relations, dated 11 March and 13\u00a0August 2008, drawn up in the context of the checks conducted with a view to issuing those travel documents (travel document for the child Michelle, issued on 26\u00a0August 2008 following the favourable opinion of 13\u00a0August 2008). He added that the authenticity of the other documents submitted to the court had not been called into question, namely the declaration of Michelle\u2019s birth, issued by the Cit\u00e9 Verte District Hospital in Yaound\u00e9, and the declaration of Benjamin\u2019s birth, issued by the Yaound\u00e9 Police Medical Centre, nor that of the travel documents for his first two children, drawn up on 26 August 2008. Lastly, he indicated that other evidence submitted to the court, photographs and bank transfer statements, invalidated the Immigration Ministry\u2019s arguments as to the reality of his ties with his wife and children.",

In order to conclude that the matter has been resolved within the meaning of Article 37 \u00a7 1 (b) and that that there is therefore no longer any objective justification for the applicant to pursue his application, the Court considers that it is necessary to examine, firstly, whether the circumstances complained of directly by the applicant still obtain and, secondly, whether the effects of a possible violation of the Convention on account of those circumstances have also been redressed (see Pisano v.

The substantive facts complained of by the applicant have thus ceased to exist. It remains therefore to be ascertained whether the possibility of leading a family life following the issuing of the visas is sufficient to erase the possible consequences of the situation of which the applicant complained to the Court. In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant, who held a residence permit issued following the granting of refugee status, applied in June 2007 for family reunification in respect of those members of his family who remained under the international protection afforded by the remit of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Cameroon. Yet it was not until December 2010, that is, three and a half years after the application for family reunification, and following more than six years of family separation, that the French authorities issued the visas that would enable the family to be reunited. During this period, the applicant took all the necessary legal steps to establish his parent-child relationship with Michelle and Benjamin in order to overcome the obstacles to the reunification of the family, which had also suffered an ordeal as a result of the lengthy separation following his departure from Cameroon (see paragraph 52 above). In view of this long period of uncertainty and of the serious consequences of this separation for the applicant and for his family (see paragraph 52 above), the Court considers that the effects of a possible violation of the Convention have not been sufficiently redressed for it to find that the matter has been resolved within the meaning of Article 37 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Polidario v. Switzerland, no.\u00a033169/10, \u00a7 58, 30 July 2013). In this connection, it considers that the present case differs from the above-cited Shevanova judgment, in which the applicant, who was subject to an expulsion order, had had her situation regularised several years later, having remained on Latvian territory throughout and having adopted \u201ca manifestly fraudulent attitude\u201d, thus delaying through \u201cher own conduct\u201d the issuing of a permanent residence permit that would have enabled her to maintain her relationship with her adult son and to exercise freely her right to respect for her family life in Latvia. Furthermore, in the present case the applicant\u2019s children were minors and had been separated from him for more than six years; they were in a difficult situation following their flight from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which necessarily entailed serious consequences that their subsequent reunion had not been able to redress sufficiently.",

He submitted that the judgment of 3 June 2010 reconstituting his daughter Michelle\u2019s birth certificate could not have come as a surprise to the French authorities, or been a decisive factor in granting all of the requested visas, given that the documents forwarded directly by the UNHCR to the French authorities as far back as 2007 confirmed that the parent-child relationship was genuine. The production of this judgment changed nothing, since, on the one hand, the case file enabling filiation to be proved was fairly convincing, and, on the other, because the decisions to refuse visas to the whole family did not depend on this reconstitution. The applicant pointed out that the urgent-applications judge had held that the criterion of urgency was not met because he had not maintained relationships with his relatives and because the birth certificates of the children Michelle and Benjamin were fraudulent.

With regard to the certificate submitted by UNHCR/Cameroon, the Government considered that a document of this sort had no bearing on the checks carried out by the consular authorities.

Accordingly, and contrary to what was consistently asserted by the relevant ministry throughout the interlocutory proceedings and the proceedings on the merits (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above), and until the communication of the application to the respondent Government, the applicant could not be held responsible for the separation from his family. The arrival of his wife and children, who were aged three, six and thirteen at the time of the request for family reunification and were themselves refugees in a third country, was thus the only means by which family life could resume.",

It further reiterates that it has held that obtaining such international protection constitutes evidence of the vulnerability of the parties concerned (see Hirsi Jamaa and Others v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a027765/09, \u00a7\u00a0155, ECHR 2012). In this connection, it notes that there exists a consensus at international and European level on the need for refugees to benefit from a family reunification procedure that is more favourable than that foreseen for other aliens, as evidenced by the remit and the activities of the UNHCR and the standards set out in Directive 2003/86 EC of the European Union .... In this context, the Court considers that it was essential for the national authorities to take account of the applicant\u2019s vulnerability and his particularly difficult personal history, to pay close attention to his arguments of relevance to the outcome of the dispute, to inform him of the reasons preventing family reunification, and, lastly, to take a rapid decision on the visa applications.",

Thus and before further examination of the merits, it observes that the International Convention on the Rights of the Child recommends that applications for family reunification be examined in a flexible and human manner. It attaches importance to the fact that the Council of Europe\u2019s Committee of Ministers and its Human Rights Commissioner have supported and clarified this objective... With regard to forms of evidence, it notes in Directive 2003/86/EC of the European Union ... and in various texts issued by international sources and NGOs that national authorities are encouraged to take into consideration \u201cother evidence\u201d of the existence of family ties if the refugee is unable to provide official supporting documents. The UNHCR, the Council of Europe and the NGOs have concurred in drawing attention to the importance of broadening these forms of evidence; ... and the Cimade has expressed the hope that the relevant French authorities would take account of documents serving as civil-status documents issued by the OFPRA, and those already verified by that Office .... Lastly, it is important to note that several reports have criticised the practices preventing family reunification, on account of the excessive length and complexity of the procedure for issuing visas; they have emphasised the need to shorten the procedure by showing greater flexibility in respect of the requirements regarding the evidence attesting to family ties ....",
