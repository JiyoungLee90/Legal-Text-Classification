Owing to their status as public servants, only actions directly prescribed by the law were allowed. The restrictions to which prosecutors were subject were meant to ensure the lawfulness of their actions. The court proceeded to analyse the concept of \u201cmisconduct discrediting a prosecutor\u201d. It noted that while such misconduct was not a criminal offence, \u201cit was by its nature not compatible with the high status of a prosecutor and undermined the authority of the State\u201d. The court referred in this connection to the open letters the applicant had published on 15 and 21\u00a0March 2007 and held that \u201cit had been correctly established by the [Odesa regional] prosecutor that \u201cfor no good reason [the applicant had] spread unfounded, false and insulting statements about employees of the prosecutor\u2019s office, [and] allowed the dissemination of confidential and official information relating exclusively to the prosecution authorities\u201d. Based on the above reasoning and referring to Articles 2, 8, 9\u00a0and 10 of the Disciplinary Statute of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the court found that the applicant had therefore committed misconduct discrediting her as a prosecutor and undermining the authority of the prosecutor\u2019s office, and that her dismissal was therefore lawful.",

In her additional submissions, she also referred to Article 10 of the Convention and claimed that her dismissal was in breach of her right to freedom of expression, as it was, inter alia, disproportionate. She stated that in her open letter she had provided her own vision, namely her value judgments, as to the problems within the prosecution system which needed to be discussed by the wider public. She claimed that the prosecution authorities were \u201cuncontrollable\u201d and that, according to certain research, Ukraine was one of the most corrupt States. In this connection, she noted that the appellate court had failed to address these issues, limiting its arguments to general statements. She further asserted that the appellate court had failed to provide sufficient reasons why it had considered her statements abusive and untrue and to indicate the basis on which it had found them to constitute dissemination of confidential information.",

This is particularly so in the case of public service, since the very nature of public service requires its employees to be bound by such a duty (see Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, \u00a7 53, Series A no. 323, and Kudeshkina, \u00a7 93 and Langner, \u00a7 43, both cited above). Disclosure by civil servants of information obtained in the course of their work, even on matters of public interest, as well as of their criticism, should therefore be examined in the light of their duty of loyalty and discretion (see Kudeshkina, \u00a7 93 and 94, cited above).",
