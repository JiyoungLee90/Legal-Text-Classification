Unlike penalties for tax offences, the new surcharges were to be determined solely on objective grounds, and, accordingly, without regard to any form of criminal intent or negligence on the part of the taxpayer.

It is not only express statements that may lead to the imposition of a surcharge; concealment, in whole or in part, of relevant facts may also be regarded as incorrect information. However, incorrect claims are not penalised; if the taxpayer has given a clear account of the factual circumstances but has made an incorrect evaluation of the legal consequences thereof, no surcharge is imposed. The burden of proving that the information is incorrect lies with the tax authority. A discretionary tax assessment is made if the taxpayer has submitted information which is so inadequate that the tax authority cannot base its tax assessment on it or if he or she has not filed a tax return despite having been reminded of the obligation to do so (Chapter 4, section 3). In the latter case the decision to impose a tax surcharge will be revoked if the taxpayer files a tax return within a certain time-limit. The surcharge amounts to 40% of either the income tax which the tax authority would have failed to levy if it had accepted the incorrect information or the income tax levied under the discretionary assessment. The corresponding provisions on value-added tax and employer's contributions stipulate that the surcharge comes to 20% of the supplementary tax levied on the taxpayer. In certain circumstances, the rates applied are 20% or 10%, respectively, for the various types of tax.",

The rules on oral hearings in Chapter 6, section 24, of the Taxation Act should be seen as a manifestation of the desire to bring taxation procedure into line with the legal safeguards laid down in Article 6 of the Convention. Also, according to case-law (R\u00c5 1987 ref. 42), the rules on voting in Chapter 29 of the Code of Judicial Procedure [in the criminal-procedure part of the Code] are applicable in cases concerning surcharges under the former Taxation Act (1956:623). The tax surcharge appears to have been considered a predominantly criminal sanction in other contexts as well. For example, it was stated in the preparatory documents to the legislation establishing the rule prohibiting ex post facto laws in Chapter 2, section 10, subsection 1, of the Instrument of Government [Regeringsformen] \u2013 which covers penalties, other criminal sanctions and other special legal effects of a criminal offence \u2013 that the proposed rule also applied to administrative sanctions akin to penalties such as tax surcharges, charges for the late payment of taxes and late-payment fees under various tax laws. ... However, under Swedish law, there is no requirement of intent or negligence on the part of the taxpayer for the imposition of a tax surcharge. Also, the surcharge, to a certain extent, has the character of a conditional fine [vitesfunktion] and can be remitted on purely objective grounds. Moreover, it cannot be converted into a prison sentence. Therefore, it has been considered that the surcharge is not to be classified as a penalty under the Swedish legal system but rather as an administrative tax sanction. Accordingly, its classification as such under the Swedish legal system does not constitute sufficient reason for regarding it as a criminal sanction within the meaning of the Convention.",

It should also be noted that the Swedish tax surcharge, in its present form, replaced earlier procedures of a purely criminal nature. As regards the characteristics that have been established by the  as referring to the nature and degree of severity of the sanction, it should be borne in mind that a surcharge is levied in proportion to the tax avoided by the provision of incorrect information.

Moreover, the judgment in Bendenoun must be taken to indicate that financial sanctions other than a fine may also fall under Article 6, at least if they are of some significance. Furthermore, following the European Court's judgments in Lauko ... and Kadubec [Lauko and Kadubec v. Slovakia, judgments of 2 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, pp. 2492 and 2518, respectively], both of which concerned fines imposed in respect of minor offences, it must now be regarded as established that the imposition of a prison sentence is not a prerequisite for an act to be viewed as a criminal offence within the meaning of the Convention.

The requirements of understanding and meticulousness must be proportionate to the taxpayer's ability and capacity to comprehend the tax rules and apply them to the existing situation.

The rules on remission are, moreover, drafted in such a way as to allow the authorities and courts a certain latitude in assessing questions of remission, having regard to the subjective position of the taxpayer. Indeed, the grounds for remission \u2013 in conjunction with the rules providing, on objective grounds, for surcharges not to be imposed or to be set aside in particular circumstances \u2013 may in certain cases allow of considerations that lead to greater exemption from surcharges than would be the case if the imposition of surcharges were conditional on the taxpayer having acted intentionally or negligently. Although the grounds for remission are not entirely comparable to the conditions for accountability which the subjective elements represent in criminal law, they must, when taken together with the cases in which surcharges are excluded on purely objective grounds, be considered as affording the taxpayer, where appropriate, sufficient scope for avoiding the imposition of surcharges to prevent a conflict with the presumption of innocence as set out in Article 6 of the Convention arising. In general, however, this requires that the courts, in applying the rules on surcharges, should indeed make a nuanced and not too restrictive assessment in each individual case as to whether there are grounds for setting aside or remitting the tax surcharge.\u201d",

Firstly, under the Swedish legal system, the surcharges belonged to administrative law. Secondly, their purpose was not primarily deterrent or punitive, as shown, inter alia, by the fact that they were imposed exclusively on objective grounds without the need to show any criminal intent or negligence. Instead, the main purpose of the surcharges was to protect the financial interests of the State and the community as a whole by emphasising the importance of providing the tax authorities with adequate and correct information as a basis for tax assessments. Thus, they were intended to have a preventive effect and were basically fiscal in nature. Thirdly, although the surcharges in the present case had been substantial, the imposition of a large pecuniary sanction did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d was involved.

Consequently, although in some respects the surcharges have been placed on an equal footing with criminal penalties, the Court finds that the surcharges cannot be said to belong to criminal law under the domestic legal system.",

It is true that the tax surcharges were imposed on the applicant on objective grounds without the need to establish any criminal intent or negligence on his part. However, the lack of subjective elements does not necessarily deprive an offence of its criminal character; indeed, criminal offences based solely on objective elements may be found in the laws of the Contracting States (see Salabiaku v. France, judgment of 7 October 1988, Series A no. 141-A, p. 15, \u00a7 27). In this connection, the Court notes that the present system of tax surcharges has replaced earlier purely criminal procedures. It appears that the change from the earlier system, which was one of penalties for intentional or negligent conduct, to the new system based on objective factors was prompted by the need for greater efficiency (see paragraph 32 above).",

Indeed, in the present case the surcharges imposed by the Tax Authority's decisions were very substantial, totalling SEK 161,261.

They claimed that even in the proceedings before the Tax Authority the applicant had benefited from many of the legal safeguards afforded by Article 6. Furthermore, the applicant had had recourse to the administrative courts which had jurisdiction to examine all aspects \u2013 both facts and law \u2013 of the matter before them. Throughout the tax assessment proceedings, it was for the Tax Authority to prove that incorrect information had been furnished and that, consequently, there were grounds for imposing tax surcharges. In so far as the immediate enforcement of the tax debt as determined by the Tax Authority could be considered to have limited the applicant's access to a court, the Government contended that that limitation had been proportionate. Enforcement served to protect the financial interests of the State and the community as a whole. Given the considerable length of time allowed for lodging an appeal against a tax decision \u2013 normally five years after the assessment year \u2013 a system giving an absolute right to a stay of execution without security having been provided would probably lead to a vast increase in the number of appeals with a view to postponing or even avoiding the payment of taxes. The Government argued, moreover, that the applicant had had a preliminary examination by the courts of the Tax Authority's decisions concerning taxes and tax surcharges in the stay-of-execution proceedings; in both those proceedings and the bankruptcy proceedings, the courts had to conduct a summary review of the merits of the applicant's tax case. They also pointed out that the applicant had been declared bankrupt on account of a tax debt of which the surcharges formed only a minor part. As he had virtually no assets, he would have been declared bankrupt even if no surcharges had been imposed. Furthermore, in the event of a successful appeal against the Tax Authority's decisions, the applicant's position could be restored by having the bankruptcy decision quashed and by bringing a claim for compensation from the State for any financial loss incurred on account of that decision.",

Such a system is not incompatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 so long as the taxpayer can bring any such decision affecting him before a judicial body that has full jurisdiction, including the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the challenged decision (see Bendenoun v. France, judgment of 24 February 1994, Series A no. 284, pp. 19-20, \u00a7 46, and Umlauft v. Austria, judgment of 23 October 1995, Series A no. 328B, pp.\u00a039-40, \u00a7\u00a7 37-39).",

Indeed, the applicant has availed himself of that remedy. It is thus clear that the administrative courts are competent to examine questions relating to tax surcharges. It is true that, as a consequence, they sit in proceedings that are of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention although they have no general jurisdiction to deal with issues that are classified as belonging to the criminal law under the Swedish legal system. However, the Court notes that the administrative courts \u2013 like the courts of general jurisdiction that determined the bankruptcy issue \u2013 have jurisdiction to examine all aspects of the matters before them. Their examination is not restricted to points of law but may also extend to factual issues, including the assessment of evidence. If they disagree with the findings of the Tax Authority, they have the power to quash the decisions appealed against. For these reasons, the Court finds that the judicial proceedings in the case have been conducted by courts that afford the safeguards required by Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01.",

However, he was not left without any means of defence. It is clear that, in challenging the Tax Authority's decisions on taxes and tax surcharges, the applicant has maintained that he submitted correct information in his tax returns and that the Authority's tax assessments were erroneous as they were based on inaccurate information gathered during the tax audit. In so doing, the applicant has relied in his defence in so far as the surcharges are concerned on Chapter 5, section 11, of the Taxation Act (and similar provisions in other relevant laws), according to which a successful objection to the taxes themselves will automatically result in a corresponding reduction in the surcharges. However, it was open to the applicant to put forward grounds for a reduction or remission of the surcharges and to adduce supporting evidence. Thus, he could have claimed, as an alternative line of defence, that, even if he was found to have furnished incorrect information to the Tax Authority, it was excusable in the circumstances or that, in any event, the imposition of surcharges would be manifestly unreasonable. However, apart from his contention that the surcharges should be remitted due to the length of the proceedings, the applicant has not made any such claim and the County Administrative Court \u2013 which was obliged to examine of its own motion whether there were grounds for remission \u2013 concluded, in its judgments of 7 December 2001, that no legal basis for remitting the tax surcharges had been found.",

However, considering that the early enforcement of tax surcharges may have serious implications for the person concerned and may adversely affect his or her defence in the subsequent court proceedings, as with the position with the use of presumptions in criminal law, the States are required to confine such enforcement within reasonable limits that strike a fair balance between the interests involved. This is especially important in cases like the present one in which enforcement measures were taken on the basis of decisions by an administrative authority, that is, before there had been a court determination of the liability to pay the surcharges in question.",

This is because, although tax surcharges may involve considerable amounts of money, they are not intended as a separate source of income but are designed to exert pressure on taxpayers to comply with their obligations under the tax laws and to punish breaches. Thus, surcharges are a means of ensuring that the State receives taxes due under the relevant legislation. Accordingly, whereas a strong financial interest may justify the State's applying standardised rules and even legal presumptions in the assessment of taxes and tax surcharges and collecting taxes immediately, it cannot by itself justify the immediate enforcement of tax surcharges.",

Moreover, a bankruptcy decision can be quashed upon a request for the reopening of the bankruptcy proceedings. It is also possible to bring proceedings against the State for compensation for any financial loss caused by the bankruptcy. Nevertheless, in cases where considerable amounts have been the subject of enforcement, reimbursement may not fully compensate the individual taxpayer for his or her losses. A system that allows enforcement of considerable amounts of tax surcharges before there has been a court determination of the liability to pay the surcharges is therefore open to criticism and should be subjected to strict scrutiny.",

On the contrary, my preference would be to state that, in principle, the presumption of innocence should be seen as excluding the execution of criminal sanctions before a court has decided on the liability of the person concerned. Otherwise, the right of the individual to have a criminal charge determined by a court could be sapped of any real meaning. This would apply also to proceedings concerning tax penalties.",

This might occur, for example, when the consequences of execution cannot be undone or are irreparable or when the amount of money executed is such that it gives rise to serious financial problems for the person concerned, or leads to bankruptcy. In that respect I am not convinced by the majority that the fact that a bankruptcy decision caused by early enforcement of a fine can be quashed upon a request for a reopening of bankruptcy proceedings (paragraph 108 of the judgment) could genuinely compensate for a disturbing and invasive bankruptcy decision.",

I reach that view on the same facts and for the same reasons that led the Court to find violations as regards the right of access to a court and the length of the proceedings. The Tax Authority's decisions on the taxes and tax surcharges were taken in December 1995, but it was not until December 2001 (almost six years after the applicant's appeal) that the  delivered its decision on the merits. Indeed, the case is still pending [See paragraph 95 of the judgment]. However, in the meantime, in June 1996, even before ruling on the application for a stay of execution [Decisions of the Administrative Court of Appeal of 21 May 1997 and the Supreme Administrative Court of 3 November 1998, see paragraph 15 of the judgment. See also paragraph 89 in fine] when the conditions laid down in the Tax Collection Act for granting the applicant such a stay were satisfied [See paragraph 87 of the judgment], enforcement proceedings were commenced and the applicant declared bankrupt by the District Court [Decision of 10 June 1996, see paragraph 86 of the judgment], with the serious irreparable financial and professional consequences which that entailed for him [See paragraph 87 of the judgment] ",

Unlike the earlier system, there is no requirement of intentional or negligent conduct on the part of the taxpayer, and a presumption of criminal liability now operates against him or her [See paragraph 100 in fine of the judgment]. While the Convention does not prohibit certain presumptions of fact or of law in principle, it does require the Contracting States to remain within certain limits in this respect as regards criminal law. In addition, Article 6 \u00a7 2 requires States to confine presumptions of fact or of law provided for in the criminal law within reasonable limits which take into account the importance of what is at stake and maintain the rights of the defence [See Salabiaku v. France, judgment of 7 October 1988, Series A no.141-A, pp. 15-16, \u00a7\u00a028.]. The presumption is, of course, rebuttable, assuming the taxpayer has a genuine opportunity of negating it [The majority accept that it was difficult for the applicant to rebut such a presumption, see paragraph 102 of the judgment] before a court affording all the guarantees required by Article 6. However, in the instant case, since the Tax Authority did not refer the case to the County Administrative Court until February 1999, that is to say three years after the applicant's appeal and more than two and a half years after the execution proceedings had ended [See paragraph 90 of the judgment], it seems to me self-evident that he was denied such a possibility. The Court rightly held that the applicant had been deprived of effective access to a court.",

That is clearly a general interest but, as the Court says in the judgment, a fair balance must be struck between the importance of what is at stake and the rights of the defence; in other words, the means employed have to be reasonably proportionate to the legitimate aim sought to be achieved. The majority recognise that a system that allows enforcement of considerable amounts of tax surcharges before there has been a court determination of the liability to pay is open to criticism and should be subjected to strict scrutiny [See paragraph 108 in fine of the judgment]. However that did not stop them giving their blessing for such a system.",

These subsidiary considerations cannot take precedence over the presumption of innocence. In any event, while the possibilities referred to above may perhaps have existed if the applicant had been given effective access to a court within a reasonable time, that, as the Court has found, did not happen in the instant case.",
