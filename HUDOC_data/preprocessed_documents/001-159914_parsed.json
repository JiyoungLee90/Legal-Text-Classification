These cases are part of the Barbu Anghelescu group of 21\u00a0cases, concerning primarily ill-treatment inflicted on the applicants while they were under the responsibility of law enforcement officers, and the ineffectiveness of the investigations into the allegations of ill-treatment.

It reiterates that the effectiveness of an investigation into allegations of police brutality constitutes the most important, if not the only, issue of general interest in such a case (see Kaburov, cited above, \u00a7 57). The Contracting States\u2019 procedural obligation to investigate possible racist motives for acts of violence has repeatedly been stressed by the Court in cases similar to the present one (see paragraph 105 below). The first six applicants, some of whom were also parties to the domestic proceedings from their initiation and all continued those proceedings after I.B.\u2019s death, had a strong moral interest in the case. Indeed, they also alleged that they had been victims of police brutality and discrimination, and the first three applicants made their own complaints along with their father\u2019s before the domestic authorities.

There is no evidence that at that point he showed signs of injuries on his body, and no medical report was drawn up at the police station.

The Court cannot see how the police agents who interrogated him and thus were supposed to be in his close vicinity for a long period of time did not see such injuries with their trained eye during his stay in the police station. If they had seen them or suspected their existence they would have called an ambulance or, at least, have documented the victim\u2019s state of health at that moment.

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability, but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibilities under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention - to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention - conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In proceedings before the Court there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or predetermined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made, and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see, among others, Ciorcan and\u00a0Others v. Romania, nos. 29414/09 and 44841/09, \u00a7 157, 27 January 2015; and Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 147).",

The Court notes that the only documented use of the word \u201c\u0163igani\u201d by the authorities is in the mission statement concerning the police intervention to settle the brawl (see paragraph 23 above). Apart from the remarks made in the police mission statement, the allegation of use of abusive language by the authorities remains unsubstantiated. Indeed, the Court is aware that the main reason the allegations could not be substantiated is because the investigations did not consider them at all. However, this is a matter to be examined under the procedural aspects of Article 3 read in conjunction with Article 14 (see paragraphs 107 to 109 below).",
