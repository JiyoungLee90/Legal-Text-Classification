The applicant contested the legality of the revocation of his permit and the issuance of the detention and deportation orders against him. The Supreme Court, sitting as a full bench (that is, all thirteen judges), dismissed his recourse in its judgment of 21 September 2006.

Belgium, no. 51564/99, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2002I, and Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15\u00a0November 1996, Reports 1996V, \u00a7\u00a7 112-113). All that is required under this provision is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation\u201d. It is therefore immaterial, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national or Convention law (see Chahal, cited above, \u00a7 112). Any deprivation of liberty, however, under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) will be justified only for as long as deportation proceedings are in progress. If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 113).",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is at issue, including the question of whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1, and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013229/03, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2008).",

Cyprus, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 67-72). Although a recourse did not have automatic suspensive effect under domestic law, upon such an application, the Supreme Court had the power to issue provisional orders suspending the enforcement of a decision taken by an administrative authority, pending the case being heard on the merits (ibid., \u00a7\u00a079). In the context of such a recourse and an application for a provisional order, the applicant could have raised his complaint under Article 8 of the Convention and under Article 15 of the Constitution, which also protects private and family life. In cases involving deportation and the right to respect for family life, the Supreme Court took into account the Court\u2019s case-law on Article 8 of the Convention and examined whether, in the circumstances of the case before it, deportation would be in breach of the provision. The first applicant could have challenged those decisions before or after his deportation within seventy-five days of their being issued (referring to Abbasi v. Cyprus (dec.), no. 21713/06, 5 July 2007 with regard to challenging such a decision in that manner after deportation).",
