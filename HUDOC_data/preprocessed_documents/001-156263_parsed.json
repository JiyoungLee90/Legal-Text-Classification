The Asylum Service noted that the reason for which the applicant had left Syria was not at all relevant to the conditions set out in Article 3 of the Refugee Law and Article 1 of the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951). Further, the Asylum Service considered that there was no possibility that the applicant would be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment if he returned to Syria. It observed that contradictions had been identified between the applicant\u2019s written application and the statements he had made during his interview which affected the credibility of his claims.

The applicant had also claimed that someone else had filled in the asylum application form on his behalf but then had stated that he had filled it in himself. He had also stated that he did not remember the contents of his application. The Reviewing Authority considered that if the applicant\u2019s life was in danger he would have remembered the reasons for which he left Syria and thus what he had written in his application form.

The purpose of the demonstration was to go to Qamishli to show solidarity with the Kurdish demonstrators following the events of 12\u00a0March 2004. Following the intervention of the authorities this had not been possible. The applicant stated that the police had attacked the demonstrators killing two persons. After going into hiding for a month in a neighbouring village, the applicant was arrested in Qamishli. He was detained for fourteen days and subjected to ill-treatment. He was subsequently transferred to the central prison of Damascus where he was detained for two and a half months. After bribing the authorities he was released on the condition that he would present himself to the authorities in Damascus every fifteen days. He did not do so, however, out of fear of being detained and tortured again. He subsequently found out that an arrest warrant had been issued against him. He submitted that after these events he had asked the girl he loved to marry him but her family had not consented. She then left her family to be with him. On 29 December 2004 the family managed to track her down. They killed her because she had dishonoured the family and were looking for him. The applicant decided to leave Syria as he feared that he would either be detained or ill-treated by the police or killed by the girl\u2019s family.",

Furthermore, the translation of the document had been certified by the PIO on 5 May 2010 and therefore had been in the applicant\u2019s hands before 10\u00a0May 2010. In addition, the Reviewing Authority noted the contradictions between the first interview with the Asylum Service and his second interview. In the former he had stated that he had left Syria legally but in the latter that he had left illegally, after having bribed officials to secure a passport and leave the country. Furthermore, the applicant had not claimed that he risked political persecution in his asylum application, interview or appeal.

The court noted, inter alia, that the Reviewing Authority\u2019s conclusions as to the lack of credibility of the applicant\u2019s claims mainly due to the existence of significant contradictions were reasonable. As the applicant\u2019s claims were not plausible, the documents he submitted could not stand alone and substantiate his asylum application.

About 150 Kurds from Syria, including the applicant, remained in the area around the clock, having set up about eighty tents on the pavement. According to the Government, the encampment conditions were unsanitary and protesters were obstructing road and pedestrian traffic. The encampment had become a hazard to public health and created a public nuisance. The protesters performed their daily chores on the pavement, including cooking and washing in unsanitary conditions. The sewage pits had overflown, causing a nuisance and offensive odours. The public lavatories were dirty and the rubbish bins of the Government buildings were being used and, as a result, were continuously overflowing. Furthermore, the protesters were unlawfully obtaining electricity from the Printing Office. Members of the public who lived or worked in the area had complained to the authorities. The Government submitted that efforts had been made by the authorities to persuade the protesters to leave, but to no avail.

An arrest warrant had been issued against him and the authorites were still after him. In addition, he had been involved in a sad situation of honour killings amongst the Kurdish community in Syria from which he had tried to escape (see paragraph\u00a031\u00a0above). He pointed to the delay in the examination of his asylum claim and a number of shortcomings in the proceedings. He also claimed that during the interview, when he had tried to tell his story relating to the Qamishli events, he had been interrupted by the officer in charge who had told him that he did not want to hear about these events again as all Syrian Kurds had the same story. As a result he had only been able to focus on the events surrounding his persecution by the girl\u2019s family.

Secondly, as a failed asylum seeker, he ran the risk of being imprisoned upon return to Syria. Thirdly, he relied on his connections with the Yekiti party or other political activities. He had participated in demonstrations organized by the Yekiti party and Syrian Kurds in Cyprus, including that of 17 May 2010. He believed that his activities were well known to the Syrian Embassy in Cyprus and the Syrian authorities in general.

He therefore did not face a risk of deportation from Cyprus to Syria. Accordingly, they invited the Court to declare the applicant\u2019s complaint under this provision inadmissible on this ground. In the alternative, the Government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies. They noted in this respect that the applicant had not filed a recourse against the second decision of the Reviewing Authority dated 26\u00a0March 2011 nor had he lodged an appeal against the first instance judgment of the Supreme Court of 31 January 2012. Last but not least, they argued that the applicant following his departure, could have had filed a new administrative appeal or submitted new information before the authorities concerning his asylum appeal or lodged a fresh claim for asylum under the Refugee Law which had, in the meantime been amended (see A.H. and J.K., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a098-99).",

The above orders had been issued against him, on the basis that he had been an unlawful immigrant pursuant to sections 6 and 14 of the Aliens and Immigration Law. This law was, however subject to the Refugee law under which he had asylum seeker status at the time as no final decision had been taken on their asylum claims. The applicant pointed out that, at the time the orders were issued his recourse against the decision of the Reviewing Authority was still pending before the Supreme Court. The provisions of the Refugee Law should have therefore prevailed. The applicant maintained that his detention could have only been justified under Section 7 of the Refugee Law which allowed for the detention of asylum seekers in specific circumstances. None of these, however, applied to the applicant. He had thus been detained for the sole reason of being an asylum seeker contrary to Section 7 of the Refugee Law. Furthermore, he had not been taken before a court and his detention exceeded the maximum of thirty-two days provided by that section (see paragraph 82 above)",

Section\u00a014 of that law provided a wide margin of discretion to the Chief Immigration Officer to detain indefinitely for the purpose of deportation. Although at the material time the Minister of the Interior had a policy of a six-month maximum detention period if asylum seekers or migrants could not be deported for any reason, unless there were other concerns, such as public order or security, this policy was not applied consistently. Once the deadline for transposition of the EU Returns Directive had expired on 24\u00a0December 2010 and it had direct effect in domestic law (see M.A., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 85-87 above), the applicant had brought a habeas corpus application on the ground that the maximum detention period of six months, had elapsed in his case. The Supreme Court, however, then ruled that his detention had been lawful as the period during which deportation had been suspended by the Court, did not count when assessing the length of detention and that the six-month time-limit would start to run from the moment that the interim measure had been lifted. As a result, although the applicant had been detained for over ten months the six-month time-limit did not apply to him. This was despite the fact that the specific circumstances provided for in Article 15 (6) of the Directive allowing the extension of detention with a view to deportation were not applicable in his case (see M.A., cited above, \u00a7 86 ). Furthermore, the applicant pointed out that domestic law did not provide for periodic review of detention for the purpose of deportation as provided for in the Directive (see paragraph 82 above). His lawyer had sent letters to the authorities requesting a review but these had remained unanswered.",

The authorities had not been able to deport him because of the Court\u2019s interim measure. In addition, the maximum period of detention of six months, provided for in the EU Returns Directive which had been directly applicable in domestic law, had elapsed. Despite this the authorities had continued to detain him. The Government had not provided any evidence that they had taken any action after the interim measure had been adopted in respect of the applicant\u2019s deportation. Furthermore, as the Court had decided to maintain Rule 39 in this case, unlike in the majority of cases that had been filed at the same time with his (see paragraph 76 above), it should have been evident to the authorities that it would take some time for Rule 39 to be lifted.",

He had been arrested and detained as punishment for demonstrating against the Government. The authorities had therefore acted in bad faith. Instead of treating him as an asylum seeker within the meaning of the Refugee Law, they had treated him as an illegal immigrant who did not comply with the residence requirements of the immigration law. The authorities could have released him and granted him a temporary residence permit on humanitarian grounds pending the examination of his case by the Supreme Court and by the Court.

The applicant had been a \u201cprohibited immigrant\u201d within the meaning of 6 (1) (k) of the Aliens and Immigration Law as he had stayed in the Republic unlawfully after the rejection of his asylum application. The Reviewing Authority had dismissed his appeal and he had therefore become an illegal immigrant by virtue of section 6 (1) (k) of the above law. The applicant had been asked to leave Cyprus by a letter dated 15 October 2009 (see paragraph 25 above). He had been charged with the criminal offence of unlawful stay which was a flagrant offence punishable by imprisonment under section 19 (2) of the Aliens and Immigration Law (see M.A., cited above, \u00a7 65). Article 11 (4) of the Constitution permitted arrest without a warrant for flagrant offences carrying a term of imprisonment (see M.A., cited above, \u00a7 181). His detention continued on the basis of deportation and detention orders issued on the same day before the lapse of the twenty-four hour time-limit set by Article 11 (5) of the Constitution pursuant to Section 14(6) of the Aliens and Immigration Law on the ground that he had been a \u201cprohibited immigrant\u201d within the meaning of section 6(1)(k) of that Law. Contrary to the applicant\u2019s submissions, the letters sent by the District Aliens and Immigration Branch of the Nicosia Police to the Director of the Aliens and Immigration Service and the Ministry of Justice and Public Order stated that after ascertaining that the applicant had been staying unlawfully in the Republic, the applicant had been arrested and charged with the commission of this offence and had been informed of his rights under Law 163(I)/2005 (see M.A., cited above, \u00a7 93).",

In the meantime, the Supreme Court had ruled that the applicant\u2019s detention had been lawful and had dismissed his habeas corpus applications.

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III). Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: any deprivation of liberty should, in addition, be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness \u2013 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and contrary to the Convention (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 67).",

The applicant was detained on the basis of deportation and detention orders which were issued pursuant to section\u00a06(1)(k) of the Aliens and Immigration Law on the ground that he was a \u201cprohibited immigrant\u201d staying in the Republic unlawfully. The applicant\u2019s asylum claim had been rejected by the Asylum Service and his appeal by the Reviewing Authority.

Consequently, the applicant could have been kept in detention for an indeterminate period of time pending the determination by the Court of his application (see, mutatis mutandis, Louled Massoud v.\u00a0Malta, no. 24340/08, \u00a7 71, 27 July 2010). However, this did not happen as despite the outcome of his habeas corpus application he was released by the authorities.
