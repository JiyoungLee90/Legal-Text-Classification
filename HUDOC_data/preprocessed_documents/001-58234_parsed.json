It was not punishable by imprisonment and commission of such an offence was not entered on a criminal record (see paragraph\u00a024 above). Unlike criminal offences, it did not result in the more severe penalties imposed on habitual offenders and was subject to a shorter statutory limitation period. None of the restrictions on personal freedom typical of criminal proceedings applied to the minor offence committed by the applicant; nor did criminal responsibility extend to preparatory acts and attempts to commit such an offence. The Government also pointed to the fact that the penalty imposed on the applicant was not a severe one as it was equal to one-twentieth of the average monthly income.",

The Commission noted the general character of the legal rule infringed by the applicant (see paragraphs\u00a023 and 26 above). Furthermore, the penalties imposed on those who committed minor offences are intended to deter and are of a punitive nature. The Minor Offences Act contains several procedural guarantees such as the presumption of innocence and the right to remain silent which are indicative of the criminal nature of minor offences (see paragraph\u00a032 above). Under the\u00a0Act the operative part of the decision on the guilt of an accused comprises, inter alia, the fact of conviction and the determination of the sanction (see paragraph\u00a033 above). Significantly, both the Minor Offences Act and the Criminal Code use the same approach in this respect (see paragraph\u00a025 above). ",

Sentences imposed for minor offences and criminal offences produce similar effects for the purpose of civil proceedings since civil courts are bound by the decisions of administrative authorities concerning convictions for minor offences in the same way as for convictions for criminal offences (see paragraph\u00a040 above). Finally, the Commission noted that under the Constitution there existed the possibility of granting pardons in relation to minor offences (see paragraph\u00a019 above). For these reasons in particular the minor offence committed by the applicant was of a criminal nature and Article\u00a06 was therefore applicable in the case.",
