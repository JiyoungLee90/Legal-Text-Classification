Similarly to that civil action, a complaint under Chapter\u00a025 of the CCP would be devoid of any prospects of success as the domestic courts interpreted the domestic law in a strictly formal manner. The Government had failed to provide any examples of successful challenges, under Chapter\u00a025 of the CCP, of the FSIN\u2019s decisions on the geographic distribution of prisoners. Nor had they provided examples of successful requests, under Article\u00a081 of the CES, for transfer to another detention facility on account of the inability to receive family visits in a remote facility.

In sum, he insisted that he had not had at his disposal effective domestic remedies in respect of the alleged violation of Article 8, as required by Article 13 of the Convention.",

Furthermore, his transfer had not pursued a legitimate aim of avoiding overcrowding as claimed by the Government, because IK-7 had been overcrowded. Lastly, the interference had not met the proportionality requirement, as the Government had not explained why the applicant had not been placed in a region adjacent to his home one and the FSIN had not taken into account his interests in maintaining family ties while in detention. The Russian system of geographic distribution of prisoners had not provided him with a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by the public authorities. Article 81 of the CES precluded any possibility of having the decision on his transfer to a remote detention facility reassessed after a lapse of time and of having the requisite balancing exercise carried out.",

The scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article\u00a013 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint. However, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law. The \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a013 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant (see, with further references, Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a016483/12, \u00a7 268, ECHR 2016 (extracts)). In view of its findings concerning Article 8 of the Convention in Polyakova and Others (cited above, \u00a7 122), it considers that the applicant has an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under Article 8 within the meaning of the Court\u2019s case-law.",

However, the domestic courts had rejected their claims in a summary fashion, referring to the FSIN\u2019s position expressed in objections to the claims, according to which domestic law did not provide for an opportunity to obtain a review of the decision on the geographic distribution of prisoners on account of considerations pertaining to the right to respect for family life (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 24, 32\u00a0and 40). No attempts at balancing the claimants\u2019 interests against those of the State had been made. The Court observes in this connection that, in accordance with its established caselaw, the effective remedy required by Article 13 of the Convention is one where the domestic authority examining the case has to consider the substance of the Convention complaint. In cases involving Article 8 of the Convention, this means that the authority has to carry out a balancing exercise and examine whether the interference with the applicants\u2019 rights answered a pressing social need and was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued, that is, whether it amounted to a justifiable limitation of their rights (see, with further references, C.G. and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 1365/07, \u00a7 62, 24 April 2008). In Polyakova and Others (cited above, \u00a7 116) the Court found that Russian domestic law governing the geographical distribution of prisoners as interpreted by the domestic courts did not enable an individual to obtain a judicial review of the proportionality of the FSIN\u2019s decision to his or her vested interests in maintaining family and social ties.",

It considers the applicant\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to claim compensation for damage caused by the Oryol FSIN\u2019s decision (see paragraph 13 above) relevant in this context, as the Zavodskoy District Court found that the Oryol FSIN had acted lawfully when deciding to send the applicant to the Krasnoyarsk Region without making any reference to his family situation or to the difficulties he would have in maintaining family ties. The Government do not suggest that the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning and findings as regards the lawfulness of the impugned measure would have been different in any way merely because the proceedings before it were initiated under Chapter 25 of the CCP.",

As the Court says in paragraph 42: \u201cNo attempts at balancing the claimants\u2019 interests against those of the State had been made\u201d. For the Court, the proportionality test is a tool to secure the protection of Convention rights.

In the present case, the Government had to justify the existence of a specific reason to choose a faraway prison. For instance, in some circumstances this could be justified because of the dangerousness of the prisoner or for security reasons.",

In the first stage, it would be necessary to examine the weight and gravity of the goal of avoiding prison overcrowding. We could attribute to this goal of the State a moderate degree of weight because it is an organisational aim, although it may be important for the purpose of protecting order and security in prisons. In the second stage, we could analyse the right of the prisoner to have a family life under Article 8 of the Convention. The intensity of the interference will be serious if the Government do not allow the fulfilment of this right (on the protection of family life of prisoners in Russia, see the joint concurring opinion of Judges Pinto de Albuquerque and Turkovi\u0107 in Khoroshenko v. Russia [GC], no. 41418/04, ECHR 2015). In the third stage, we have to weigh up the results of the first two stages to see whether or not the overcrowding in some prisons justifies the decision to send the applicant to IK-7 prison 4,200\u00a0kilometres from his home.",

The fact is that this great distance is a serious interference with his right to maintain family and social ties. Consequently, it is possible to conclude, after an analysis of the proportionality, that the legitimate aim of the Government to ensure better organisation of prisons could be fulfilled through a less severe interference with a fundamental right of the applicant. Here the overcrowding in some prisons does not justify the decision to send the applicant 4,200 kilometres away from his home. In this concrete case, the Government have not adequately weighed in the balance the applicant\u2019s right to a family life, the limitation of which is not proportionate and is not justified in this case.",
