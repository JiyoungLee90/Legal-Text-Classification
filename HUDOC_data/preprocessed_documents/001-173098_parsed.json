The Court reiterates in this connection its consistent position \u2013 which is also reflected in the Committee of Ministers Declaration on freedom of political debate in the media \u2013 that in a democratic society public officials must accept that they will be subject to public scrutiny and criticism, particularly through the media, over the way in which they have carried out or carry out their functions, insofar as this is necessary for ensuring transparency and the responsible exercise of their functions. It has been the Court\u2019s consistent position that the limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to a government official in the course of performance of his or her functions than in relation to a private citizen (see, with further references, OOO Ivpress and Others, cited above, \u00a7 70).

They confined their succinct analysis to establishing that the statements (\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f) were disseminated, accepting without question the plaintiff\u2019s assertion about the damage to his reputation. Indeed, the District and City Courts expressly proclaimed that it sufficed for T. to provide an issue of the newspaper to prove that the alleged damage had occurred. Neither the District nor the City Court gave any consideration to the applicant company\u2019s position as the newspaper publisher or to the plaintiff\u2019s status as head of the commonhold association and a public official. In the Court\u2019s view, the Russian courts did not seem to recognise that the proceedings in the present case involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and the protection of reputation. It does not appear that they carried out an analysis of whether or not the contested publications sought to make a contribution to a debate on matters of general interest or public concern. The Court reiterates in this connection that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest and that very strong reasons are required for justifying such restrictions (see, with further references, OOO Ivpress and Others, cited above, \u00a7 71).",

While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 of the Convention. The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, \u00a7 76, and Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055).",

Furthermore, in the Court\u2019s view, there was a sufficient factual basis to the impugned statement. As follows from the Government\u2019s assertion (see paragraph 22 above), the defendants provided proof to the District Court that there had been a legal dispute concerning the lawfulness of a lease of an attic concluded by T. Contrary to the Government\u2019s claim, the fact that the dispute was resolved by a court in itself does not imply that any further discussion of the contested issue should be curtailed. Moreover, as follows from the text of the District Court\u2019s judgment (see paragraph 9 above), the Zyuzinskiy District Court sitting in the first instance delivered its judgment regarding the lease of the attic, which could be further appealed against, on 19 May 2004, that is, one day before the date of the publication of the impugned article in the newspaper issue of 20 May 2004. Given the realities of the print media production process, it is highly probable that at the time when the article was sent to the printing press the journalist was unaware of the existence of the judgment of 19 May 2004, or that it had not yet been delivered. The Court thus considers that it has not been shown that the journalist acted in bad faith (see B\u00e9dat, cited above, \u00a7 58).",

What is important is that the domestic courts held the applicant company responsible for failing to prove the truthfulness of value judgments, that they did not assess the issue whether or not the publication contributed to a debate on a matter of public interest or general concern, and that they failed to recognise the wider limits of permissible criticism in respect of State officials (see OOO Ivpress and Others, cited above, \u00a7 79).",

Nevertheless, faced with the domestic courts\u2019 failure to give relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the interference, the Court finds that the domestic courts cannot be said to have \u201capplied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 of the Convention\u201d or to have \u201cbased themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts\u201d (see Ringier Axel Springer Slovakia, a.s. v. Slovakia (no. 2), no. 21666/09, \u00a7 54, 7\u00a0January 2014; Cumhuriyet Vakf\u0131 and Others v.

The Court thus concludes that the interference with the applicant company\u2019s right to freedom of expression cannot be said to have been \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
