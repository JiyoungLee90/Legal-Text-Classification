Moreover, the respondent had been reorganised in the course of the proceedings and the courts had had to establish its legal successor. The Government further claimed that the case was adjourned five times because of the applicant\u2019s failure to appear, which resulted in four months\u2019 delay. On 11 April 2002 the claim was left unexamined because the applicant failed to appear at two hearings. The applicant did not appeal against that decision, but requested that the proceedings be resumed only on 16 January 2003. As a result, the proceedings were delayed by nine months. The domestic courts conducted the proceedings properly. The hearings were scheduled at regular intervals. Only on two occasions was the case adjourned because the judge was on sick leave and was busy in unrelated proceedings. The case was examined several times. The decisions of lower courts were quashed because the case involved complex legal issues and facts, but not because of serious mistakes committed by judges.",

The Court observes that on 13 January 1999 the supervisory court quashed the decisions of lower courts on the ground of serious shortcomings and it gave them detailed indications as to how to proceed with the case. However, the  had failed to implement those instructions and the appeal court quashed its decision of 26 October 1999 on those grounds.

The Court considers that the shifting of the case between several levels of jurisdictions several times was the main reason for the lengthy examination of the case.
