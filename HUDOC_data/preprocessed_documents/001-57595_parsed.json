He further stressed that he had brought civil actions against his debtors and therefore had to appear as plaintiff before several District Courts at least five times a week. On the other hand, he pointed out that it was not possible for him to flee from West Berlin: by reason of his numerous previous journeys he was so well known at the Berlin airport that he could not take an aeroplane there; having been detained for several years in the Soviet Occupied Zone he could enter neither this territory nor East Berlin. Finally the fact that he stayed at  after the discovery of his transactions by the Thyssen Bank on 27 October 1961 showed clearly that he never had any intention of fleeing.",

As a matter of fact, he was likely to receive an appreciably higher sentence than had formerly been thought, as in the meantime the Public Prosecution had extended the accusation against the Applicant to certain offences under the Bankruptcy Code some of which he was said to have committed while in detention. On the other hand, the court considered that it was not yet possible to forecast whether the Applicant, in the event of a conviction, would be conditionally released in accordance with Section 26 of the Criminal Code after serving two-thirds of his detention and whether, in the event of such conviction, the time he had spent in detention pending trial would be counted as part of the sentence.",

If the person is being held in detention on remand it must not exceed a reasonable period. The most important problem, therefore, is to determine the exact meaning of the words \"reasonable time\". The Commission finds this expression vague and lacking in precision, with the result that it is not possible to determine abstractly its exact meaning, which can be evaluated solely in the light of the particular circumstances of each case.",

Whereas the English version (\"entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to be released pending trial\") would permit the interpretation that the period referred to ends with the opening of the case before the trial court, the French version (\"\u00eatre jug\u00e9e dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, ou lib\u00e9r\u00e9e pendant la proc\u00e9dure\") would cover a longer period, ending at the date on which judgment is pronounced. The Commission has not stated any definite opinion on this question, but at the hearing its Principal Delegate expressed a clear preference in favour of the interpretation based on the French text, the meaning of which is, unlike the English version, clear and unequivocal and also more favourable to the individual. In particular, the delegate of the Commission rejected the argument of the German Government that the English version should be accepted for the simple reason that it limits the sovereignty of States to a lesser degree.",

The Court had, in the light of the documents in its possession, discovered that the Applicant had deposited the sum of 100,000 DM in an account opened in the name of his wife in a Swiss bank, and that he had withdrawn this sum when his offences came to light. In the course of the proceedings, the Applicant had given highly contradictory explanations of this transaction; the judicial authorities have not been in a position to discover what Wemhoff had done with the sum of money in question. Whatever the position may be, the Applicant did not take up the offer of bail of the Court.",

This last phrase cannot be interpreted as being restricted to the case of a final conviction, for this would exclude the arrest at the hearing of convicted persons who appeared for trial while still at liberty, whatever remedies are still open to them. Now, such a practice is frequently followed in many Contracting States and it cannot be believed that they intended to renounce it. It cannot be overlooked moreover that the guilt of a person who is detained during the appeal or review proceedings, has been established in the course of a trial conducted in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6). It is immaterial, in this respect, whether detention after conviction took place on the basis of the judgment or - as in the Federal Republic of Germany - by reason of a special decision confirming the order of detention on remand. A person who has cause to complain of the continuation of his detention after conviction because of delay in determining his appeal, cannot avail himself of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) but could possibly allege a disregard of the \"reasonable time\" provided for by Article 6 (1) (art. 6-1).",

But his detention lasted in fact until 17 December 1965, when the judgment became final. Has the Court competence to deal with this latest period between 1964 and 1965 when in actual fact this latest period is not formally dealt with in the complaint which was declared admissible by the Commission? This is a question of the scope of the case before the Court. We are dealing with a continued manner of conduct on the part of the German authorities. It goes without saying that Wemhoff, when claiming that he was detained beyond a reasonable time, implied the whole period the provisional detention goes on and until it ends. Any later date than 9 January 1964, the date of the application, is therefore - once the complaint is raised - part and parcel of the case. This applied to internal practice: it is the situation at the time of the decision the national courts in cases of this kind take into consideration. The same applies to the . The Commission has also in good sense followed this concept in regard to the factual limitation of the case. The complaint goes back to 1963, but the Commission has not hesitated to consider the detention up till November 1964.",

I agree that the Court has full competence to decide upon the lawfulness of the detention on remand for the full period until it was brought to an end, although this of course does not depend upon any formal request by the Commission, but upon the fact that the case brought before the Court comprises the question of the lawfulness of the detention as a whole.",

In this respect I hold the following opinion. Certainly, the interpretation proposed by the German Government and accepted in the Commission\u2019s Report, which gives as the end of the period the appearance of the detained person before the trial court, may be upheld by the English text.

This clearly shows that the detention of Wemhoff on remand in accordance with Article 5 (1) (c) (art. 5-1-c) continued until the final judgment, and I see no reason why he should not have the protection of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) for the whole of this period.",

It goes without saying that the German authorities, who have the direct knowledge of all the details and implications of the Wemhoff case are in a better position to evaluate whether a continued detention at any time is reasonable or not. Nevertheless, when the case is brought before the Court, the Court has to decide - both in regard to the facts and the law - if Wemhoff has not been released \"within a reasonable time\". In regard to the facts, the Court will have to rely upon the evidence produced, and so far there is on the whole not any disputed point. In regard to the law the Court will have to decide if the grounds given for the detention of Wemhoff are relevant grounds which legally can be taken into consideration in the Wemhoff case, and secondly the Court will have to exercise control in regard to the question whether the German authorities - when applying legally relevant grounds for upholding the detention of Wemhoff - have applied not too severe a yardstick of measurement in evaluating the requirements of the case, when Wemhoff was not released earlier than his final conviction in December 1965. The last part of the task is by far the most difficult one. In my opinion the judgment of the German authorities should not be reversed unless the Court is convinced that an abuse of power (d\u00e9tournement de pouvoir) has taken place - or unless it is clear that the yardstick of measurement has been too severe - that is to say unreasonable.",

Firstly, the list can never be complete, and in addition it is the grounds given for the detention in each specific case, and not a list of grounds of a general character set up, that the Court has to examine. There may - true enough - be grounds for continued detention in a specific case, which have not been specifically advanced by the authorities.

Because whether Wemhoff was rightly or wrongly refused bail, during his long term of detention, this would not absolve the legal or judicial authorities from the obligation to conclude his trial within a reasonable time. The crux of the case is therefore the ascertainment of the extent of the \"reasonable time\" specified in Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) in relation to the facts and accompanying circumstances of the case we are dealing with.",

The decisive factor in this respect is the judicial concept of reasonableness. In the absence of any provision in the law or constitution of a country precisely indicating the maximum length of time an unconvicted person can be confined to detention prior to the end of his trial, it falls, in the first instance, on the national courts and ultimately on this Court in exercising their jurisdiction to designate the principles indicating when such detention exceeded the limit and became unreasonable under Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3).",

The security of a State, the enforcement of the law of the country and public order and interest do require a certain amount of sacrifice of the right to liberty of a citizen. On the other hand, in a democratic society the right to liberty is one of the valuable attributes cherished by the people living therein. One has to strike a fair and just balance between the interest of the State and the right to liberty of the subject.",

It is true in the case of Wemhoff that the trial ended with a conviction, but it might have ended with an acquittal as well. By detaining a man too long before he is tried, you throw him into despair and the will and desire of a despairing man to defend his innocence is materially impaired.",

In a case for instance, where a series of offences has been committed by a man along with other persons, surely there is a procedural device to sever the case of one person from others and/or to limit the charges against him to certain offences if by not doing so the man has to be detained for a very long time. The legal authorities might continue or discontinue proceedings against the man for a remaining offence or offences later on. Long unreasonable delays in trials will thus be averted.",
