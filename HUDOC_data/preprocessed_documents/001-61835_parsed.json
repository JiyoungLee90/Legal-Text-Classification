An award of compensation for damage of a non-pecuniary nature in proceedings under Article 11 et seq. of the Civil Code is made subject to conditions and invokes considerations which are distinct from the question whether or not a person\u2019s rights under Article 5 of the Convention have been violated.

However, it is understood that paragraph 5 of Article 5 does not prohibit the Contracting States from making the award of compensation dependent upon the ability of the person concerned to show damage resulting from the breach (see Wassink v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 185-A, p. 14, \u00a7\u00a038).",

Such compensation is limited to infringements of one\u2019s personal rights within the meaning of Article 11 of the Civil Code and to cases where a person\u2019s dignity and position in society have been considerably diminished. It has not been shown that in that context compensation is available for distress, anxiety and frustration which may result from violations of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 or 4 of the Convention and which may call for compensation depending on the particular circumstances of the case (see Rakevich, cited above, \u00a7 52).",
