However, the anonymous letter, which had been included in the article, fulfilled the actus reus of defamation, as it accused C.M. and J.M. of dishonesty and other disreputable character traits, relating to both their professional and private lives. Both had experienced negative repercussions as a result of the article in their professional activities as lawyers, in that they had repeatedly been confronted with the allegations made in the anonymous letter.",

This rule would even apply if the identity of the third person having made the statement was unknown. In any case, the court held that it was required to balance the public interest in disseminating information about the statements quoted against the claimants\u2019 interest in protecting their reputation. It accepted that the local public had an interest in knowing about a campaign against the chairman of the tourism association and a local politician. However, public interest did not justify reproduction of the anonymous letter in the article. The applicant company could have provided information on the campaign against C.M. and J.M. without printing the defamatory letter. In that connection, the court observed that by printing the letter the applicant had also made its entire content known to a far greater number of people than the letter itself had reached.",

In such cases, the person concerned could seek compensation from the person who had made the offensive statements in the first place. As in the present case the person who had made the offensive statements had remained anonymous, the applicant company could not rely on section 6(2)(4) of the Media Act.

It noted that in such cases the Court may be required to verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the Convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases, namely freedom of expression protected by Article 10, and the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8 (see MGN Limited, cited above \u00a7 142; Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 106; and Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7\u00a084).

Regarding the veracity of the information, the applicant company did not claim that the allegations made in the anonymous letter against C.M and J.M. were true or had any factual basis. It merely relied on the argument that printing the letter was no more than a quotation of someone else\u2019s statements. However, the domestic courts argued that the publication of an anonymous letter had to be distinguished from the quotation of a third person\u2019s statement and that in any case, the question whether there was an overriding public interest in publication of the anonymous letter had to be examined.",

It has repeatedly held that \u201cpunishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person ... would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so\u201d (see Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, \u00a7\u00a035, Series A no. 298; Thoma v. , no. 38432/97, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2001III; and Verlagsgruppe News GmbH v. , no. 76918/01, \u00a7 31, 14\u00a0December 2006). Most of the cases concerned statements made by third persons whose identities were known. However, it is important to note that the Court\u2019s own examination of whether there had been a violation of Article\u00a010 of the Convention involved an assessment of the news item or newspaper article as a whole in accordance with the criteria developed by its case-law. Among other criteria, the Court looked into the question whether the reporting was balanced and had regard to the context in which the offensive quotations had been made (see for instance, Jersild, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 31-34). The case cited by the applicant company, which related to the publication of a letter to the editor, whose author could not be identified, indicates that journalists or editors may also quote anonymous statements (Albert-Engelmann-Gesellschaft mbH, cited above, \u00a7 32). However, the case also demonstrates that the final assessment of whether there has been a violation of Article 10 depends on a balancing of all relevant criteria: the Court did not share the domestic courts\u2019 view that the fact that the letter to the editor had been an anonymous one was of relevance. Its finding of a violation of Article 10 in that case was mainly based on the consideration that the offending statements contained in the anonymous letter were value judgments which had a sufficient factual basis in statements which the claimant himself had previously made (ibid.).",
