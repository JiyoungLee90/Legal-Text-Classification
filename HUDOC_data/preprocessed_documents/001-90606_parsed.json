The court accepted that there had been unjustified delay in the proceedings but noted that it was not of such an exceptional nature as to require the applicant\u2019s discharge. The length of the proceedings was taken as a mitigating factor in the imposition of the sentence. In this regard it was noted that given the seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant a sentence of imprisonment was required.

In this respect the Court recalls that the mitigation of a sentence on the account of the excessive length of the proceedings does not, in principle, deprive the individual concerned of his status as victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. This general rule is subject to an exception when the national authorities have acknowledged the failure to observe the reasonable time requirement in a sufficiently clear way and have afforded redress by reducing the sentence imposed in an express and measurable manner (see, inter alia, Beck v. , no.\u00a026390/95, \u00a7\u00a027, 26 June 2001).",
