By doing so, the applicant had failed to allow the President of the N\u00e1mestovo District Court sufficient time to ensure acceleration of the proceedings. Moreover, as the proceeding before the Doln\u00fd Kub\u00edn District Court had ended prior to the introduction of the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint, its part concerning the Doln\u00fd Kub\u00edn District Court was belated. Lastly, as the case had been pending before the N\u00e1mestovo District Court only since 1 January 2008, the length of the proceedings before that court was not sufficient to pose any issues under the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",
