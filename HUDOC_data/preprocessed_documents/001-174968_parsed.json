The relevant provisions on judicial review and duration of preventive detention (Article 67e \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code, Article 67d \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Criminal Code, in the version in force prior to 31 January 1998 and Article 67d \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code in its amended version) are contained in the case of Glien (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 35-37). The rules on the detention of mentally-ill persons (Article 63 of the Criminal Code and section 1 of the Therapy Detention Act) are equally spelled out in the case of Glien (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39). The relevant provision on the transfer for enforcement of a different measure of correction and prevention (Article\u00a067a of the Criminal Code) is also laid down in the case of Glien (cited above, \u00a7 41). Information on the Act on establishment, at federal level, of a difference between the provisions on preventive detention and those on prison sentences (Gesetz zur bundesrechtlichen Umsetzung des Abstandsgebotes im Recht der Sicherungsverwahrung, hereinafter the \u201cPreventive Detention (Distinction) Act\u201d) is contained in the case of Bergmann (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 43 et seq.). Finally, a summary of the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s leading judgment on preventive detention of 4 May 2011 can be found in the case of Bergmann (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 66-72).",

It notes, in particular, that the domestic courts endorsed the findings made by psychiatric expert J., in line with the previous findings of another psychiatric expert, that the applicant suffered from a dissocial and schizoid personality disorder as defined by the ICD-10. That disorder was of a sufficiently serious nature, had manifested itself in the serious offences including rape of randomly chosen victims committed by him and necessitated specific therapeutic treatment. Moreover, in view of the high risk that the applicant would commit further similar serious offences if released, the applicant\u2019s mental disorder was shown to be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement, which, furthermore, depended upon the persistence of that disorder. The applicant was therefore a person \u201cof unsound mind\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e).",

It observes that during the period here at issue, the applicant was initially detained, from 9 April 2012 (when he had served ten years in preventive detention) until January 2013, in a separate department for persons in preventive detention in Schwalmstadt Prison. The Court, referring to its established case-law in this respect (see, inter alia, O.H. v. , no. 4646/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a087-92, 24 November 2011; Kronfeldner v. , no. 21906/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-85, 19 January 2012; and Glien v. Germany, no. 7345/12, \u00a7\u00a7 92 et seq., 28 November 2013), finds that during the time in which the applicant was detained in Schwalmstadt Prison in the said department, he had not been remanded in an institution suitable for the detention of mental health patients.",

In the latter institution, the conditions of detention for persons in preventive detention and the offers of therapy were gradually improved so as to comply with the requirements of the Preventive Detention (Distinction) Act. Having regard to the material before it, the Court observes that in the applicant\u2019s case, there was a considerable change in the institutional setting, the general staffing situation particularly in the psychology service and concerning specific offers of therapy made to the applicant in order to address his mental disorder. In particular, the applicant was repeatedly invited to participate in a sex offender treatment programme in May 2013. The Court can therefore accept that from May 2013 onwards, the applicant was offered the therapeutic environment appropriate for a person detained for being of unsound mind in the building on the premises of Weiterstadt Prison and was thus detained in a suitable institution for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) (compare also Bergmann, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 118-128).",
