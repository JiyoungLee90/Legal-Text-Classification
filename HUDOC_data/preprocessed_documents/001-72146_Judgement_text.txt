Article 72 of the Constitution provides:
“Patriotic service is a right and a duty for every Turkish citizen. The conditions in which that service shall be performed or deemed to have been performed in the armed forces or civil service shall be laid down by law.”
The legal provisions currently in force govern only the performance of national service in the armed forces. No alternative civil service is provided for by law.
Section 1 of the Military Service Act (Law no. 1111 of 17 July 1927) reads:
“... every man of Turkish nationality shall be obliged to perform military service.”

The Military Penal Code stipulates that once they have been placed on the muster rolls for military service, conscripts are required to report to the designated military unit, failing which they will be regarded as unlawfully absent and liable to a criminal penalty under Article 63 of the Military Penal Code. Any additional act of disobedience is regarded as “persistent disobedience” and falls under Article 87/1 of the Military Penal Code.

“... Incitement to evade military service.
It shall be an offence punishable by imprisonment of two months to two years and a fine ... – except in the cases provided for in the preceding Articles – to incite ... conscripts to evade military service ...”
