Accordingly, the Court concludes that in the exceptional circumstances of the present case, the sixmonth period should be calculated from the time when the applicant became aware of the circumstances which made the remedy used by him ineffective, that is, when the Court of Appeal refused to admit his appeal on 2\u00a0March 2007 on the grounds that a similar appeal had already been examined by the court.
