This is the case when it is irrevocable, that is to say when no further ordinary remedies are available or when the parties have exhausted such remedies or have permitted the time-limit to expire without availing themselves of them\u2019. It follows therefore that a judgment by default is not considered as final as long as the domestic law allows the proceedings to be taken up again. Likewise, this Article does not apply in cases where the charge is dismissed or the accused person is acquitted either by the court of first instance or, on appeal, by a higher tribunal. If, however, in one of the States in which such a possibility is provided for, the person has been granted leave to appeal after the normal time of appealing has expired, and his conviction is then reversed on appeal, then subject to the other conditions of the Article, in particular the conditions described in paragraph 24 below, the Article may apply.",

Therefore, there is no requirement under the Article to pay compensation if the conviction has been reversed or a pardon has been granted on some other ground. Nor does the Article seek to lay down any rules as to the nature of the procedure to be applied to establish a miscarriage of justice. This is a matter for the domestic law or practice of the State concerned.

In any case, the hardship, mental anguish and acute physical pain he had suffered for five and a half years deserved to be compensated in a more reasonable manner than just an apology. Furthermore, on 1 September every year of his detention  television had broadcast a programme prepared by the Armenian police affirming that he had admitted his guilt. Thus, he had been consistently degraded in the eyes of the public and nothing had been done by the authorities after his acquittal to restore his reputation. In 2007 he had married, but was still unable to have a child. The doctors attributed this to the circumstances of his conviction. He also suffered from adhesive otitis media in his left eardrum and first- to second-degree bilateral perceptive deafness on account of the blows to his ears. He was still using painkillers and his deafness was irreversible. No compensation for this had been awarded by the domestic courts, despite the fact that it had been established that he had suffered ill-treatment. Lastly, the Government\u2019s argument that his arrest had been effected in accordance with Article 5 and had been based on a reasonable suspicion was unacceptable, since the signs of his ill-treatment were clearly visible on his person. Furthermore, he had persistently refused to admit to the charges against him before the courts and had appealed to the higher instances against his conviction.",
