The case originated in an application (no. 52848/99) against the Hellenic Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Greek national, Mr Ioannis Papadopoulos (“the applicant”), on 20 August 1999.
The Greek Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mrs E. Skiani and Mr I. Bakopoulos of the Legal Council of the State, Acting Agents.
The applicant complained, in particular, under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings which were instituted against him.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 29 November 2001 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Athens.
On 16 July 1998 the applicant was arrested in flagrante delicto for entering without prior authorisation to the operation block of the hospital where he was working. He was placed in detention for one day.
On 17 July 1998 the Athens First Instance Criminal Court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to six months imprisonment. The same day the applicant appealed against this decision. His appeal has suspensive effect. The hearing was scheduled for 16 September 2002.
