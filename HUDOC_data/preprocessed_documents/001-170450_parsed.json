Several witnesses \u2013 the waitress from the restaurant, some of the applicant\u2019s colleagues, and people who had been present when the accident had happened \u2013 stated that the applicant had looked and sounded drunk. On the basis of that evidence, the court found that before the accident the applicant had consumed between 200 and\u00a0250\u00a0grams of alcohol. A court-appointed expert stated that after consuming so much alcohol the alcohol level in the applicant\u2019s blood must definitely have been above the legally permitted threshold of 0.4 per mille (see paragraph\u00a029 below). The court also noted that even though tests of the applicant\u2019s blood and urine had not detected any traces of alcohol, they had not been reliable because they had been taken more than seventeen hours after the accident. The court held that since the applicant had deliberately hidden from the authorities during that period and had only given himself up the morning after the accident (see paragraph 7 above), he could not use the negative blood and urine tests to his advantage.",

A court-appointed expert examined the tyre marks at the scene of the accident, the damage done to nearby objects and the positions in which the three children had been found, and reconstructed the course of events of the accident. The applicant\u2019s colleague V.J., who had been driving in the car behind the applicant, testified that he himself had been going at around 100\u00a0km/h but had been unable to keep up with the applicant. Several people who had been present at the accident also stated that the noise made by the applicant\u2019s car had indicated a very high speed. The court noted that the speed limit in the village was 50 km/h and that this must have been known to the applicant, who had worked as a police officer in the area. The court concluded that the accident had been caused by the excessive speed of the applicant\u2019s car and not by the weather or the actions of the children.",

The court observed that the obligation to help people in lifethreatening situations was enshrined in the Law on Police Activity, with which the applicant had had to comply. By failing to do so, he had breached Article 144 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 29-30 below).",

As a result, the Klaip\u0117da District Court held that the applicant\u2019s punishment should be close to the maximum provided by law (see paragraph 29 below). He was given a consolidated sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment, prohibited from driving a vehicle for three years, and ordered to pay a total of 3,000,000\u00a0Lithuanian litai (LTL, approximately 870,000 euros (EUR)) in non-pecuniary damages to the families of the three children.",

The applicant stated that this had prevented the first-instance court from examining his case objectively.

However, the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court accepted the applicant\u2019s argument that the age of the victims should not have been considered as an aggravating circumstance because the criminal offence had not been premeditated. Accordingly, the court reduced the consolidated sentence to nine years\u2019 imprisonment. It also considered that the amount of non-pecuniary damages awarded by the first-instance court had been excessive and not reasonably related to the applicant\u2019s means. Instead, the court awarded a total of LTL\u00a0900,000 (approximately EUR\u00a0261,000) to the three families. The prohibition on driving a vehicle for three years was upheld.",

A person is considered as having not committed a crime until his or her guilt has been proven in accordance with a procedure established by law and he or she has been found guilty by a court judgment that has come into effect. The presumption of innocence is inseparably linked with respect for and the protection of other constitutional human rights and freedoms, as well as acquired rights. It is especially important that State institutions and officials respect the presumption of innocence. It should be noted that public persons should in general restrain from referring to a person as a criminal until the guilt of that person in committing the crime has been proven in accordance with the procedure established by law and he or she has found guilty by a court judgment that has come into effect.

Hungary [GC], no.\u00a018030/11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0155-156, 8 November 2016). Article 6 \u00a7 2 cannot therefore prevent the authorities from informing the public about criminal investigations in progress, but it requires that they do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Karaka\u015f and Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 43925/98, \u00a7\u00a050, 28 June 2005). The Court has previously considered that in a democratic society it is inevitable that information is imparted when a serious charge of misconduct in office is brought or where an applicant was an important political figure at the time of the alleged offence. However, this circumstance cannot justify every possible choice of words by officials in interviews with the press (see Butkevi\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050; Arrigo and Vella v.

Nevertheless, judging whether a statement by a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7\u00a043; B\u00f6hmer v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a037568/97, \u00a7 60, 3 October 2002; and Pe\u0161a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0141).",

The Court acknowledges that the circumstances of the accident of 7\u00a0November 2007 \u2013 the deaths of three children and the involvement of a police officer, which followed the pattern of several similar accidents caused by officers \u2013 created a legitimate public interest to be informed about the alleged offence and the ensuing criminal proceedings (see paragraph\u00a045 above). The Court is also of the view that those same circumstances justified the wish of high-level State officials to express their reaction to the accident, particularly as seen in its broader context of several other similar accidents, as well as to keep the public informed about the institutional reforms carried out in its aftermath. However, the Court reiterates that those circumstances in and of themselves could not justify any and every use of words by the officials in their statements to the press (see, mutatis mutandis, Butkevi\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050).",

While that statement implied that the applicant had \u201ccaused\u201d the accident of 7 November 2007, the Court notes that by the time the statement was made the applicant had confessed to driving the car (see paragraph 7 above), so his involvement in the accident could not be disputed.

The Court considers that the statements were of a general nature related to shortcomings within the police and problems concerning road traffic safety, and could not be seen as breaching the applicant\u2019s right to the presumption of innocence (see, mutatis mutandis, Natsvlishvili and Togonidze, \u00a7 104, and Konstas, \u00a7\u00a041, both cited above).",

The Court notes that in line with domestic law the resignation of a minister or the Police Commissioner General is not necessarily related to criminal liability on the part of either those individuals themselves or of anyone else (see paragraphs 31-32 above), and the applicant did not argue that they expressed any views as to his guilt in their resignation statements. Accordingly, the Court is of the view that by resigning from their posts the Minister of the Interior and the Police Commissioner General took political responsibility for a series of events which had occurred within the police, and that their resignation could not have affected the applicant\u2019s right to the presumption of innocence.",

At the same time, the Court observes that the President\u2019s statement did not discuss the applicant\u2019s case in isolation but placed it in the context of inappropriate behaviour by police officers and recurring problems within the police, stressing the need to ensure an adequate level of criminal liability and political responsibility (see paragraph\u00a012 above). The Court considers that the President\u2019s decision to make a public statement is understandable not only in the light of the public attention to such accidents but also in the aftermath of the resignation of the two highest-level State officials responsible for the work of the police \u2013 the Police Commissioner General and the Minister of the Interior \u2013 who were appointed by and reported to the President (see paragraphs 31-32 above).",

The Court emphasises that the President did not make any specific statements about the factual or legal aspects of the criminal case against the applicant, for example, that he had driven while being drunk or that he had exceeded the speed limit, which were the key circumstances in determining his guilt (see paragraphs 18-19 above), or that he had been guilty of any particular criminal offence (compare and contrast Allenet de Ribemont, \u00a7\u00a041; Lavents, \u00a7\u00a7 119 and\u00a0127; Butkevi\u010dius, \u00a7\u00a053; Fatullayev, \u00a7\u00a0162; and G.C.P. v.\u00a0Romania, \u00a7 57, all cited above). The President\u2019s statement spoke of the need to \u201cthoroughly examine\u201d and \u201cespecially strictly evaluate\u201d offences committed by police officers, criticising the past trend of \u201crelatively mild punishments\u201d (see paragraph 12 above). The Court has some concerns about the choice of wording, as the call to \u201cstrictly evaluate\u201d offences caused by police officers and to avoid \u201cmild punishments\u201d could be regarded as expressing an opinion about the sentence to be handed down to the applicant and thus implying his guilt, and reiterates that the President should have exercised particular caution in his choice of words (see, mutatis mutandis, Pe\u0161a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0150). However, the Court reiterates that each statement must be seen in the context of the particular circumstances in which it was made (see, among other authorities, Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7\u00a043). In the present case, regard being had to the history of traffic accidents caused by police officers who had then avoided criminal liability, as well as the ongoing discussion concerning the political responsibility of high-level officials for problems within the police, the Court is unable to conclude that the President\u2019s statement of 12\u00a0November\u00a02007, taken as a whole, should be seen as prejudging the criminal proceedings against the applicant.",

At the same time, the Court notes that press coverage of current events is an exercise of freedom of expression, guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention. If there is a virulent press campaign surrounding a trial, what is decisive is not the subjective apprehensions of the suspect concerning the absence of prejudice required of the trial courts, however understandable, but whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, his or her fears can be held to be objectively justified (see Butkevi\u010dius v.\u00a0Lithuania (dec.), no. 48297/99, 28 November 2000, and G.C.P. v.\u00a0Romania, cited above, \u00a7 46).",

The Court\u2019s approach has been to examine whether there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that the proceedings as a whole are fair. It will require cogent evidence that concerns about the impartiality of judges are objectively justified before any breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 can be found (see Craxi v.

Therefore, although various State officials discussed the applicant\u2019s case in the media, it cannot be said that the coverage was prompted by the authorities (see Butkevi\u010dius and Beggs, \u00a7 127, both cited above); nor did the applicant allege otherwise (see, mutatis mutandis, Craxi, cited above, \u00a7 105).",
