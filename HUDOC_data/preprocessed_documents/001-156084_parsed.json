Article 8 requires that the domestic authorities strike a fair balance between the interests of the child and those of the parents and that, in the balancing process, primary importance should be attached to the best interests of the child, which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parents (see Sahin v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a030943/96, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2003VIII, and P\u0142aza v. Poland, no. 18830/07, \u00a7\u00a071, 25\u00a0January 2011).",

As a result, he lost all his parental rights in respect of A., including contact rights. Indeed, the Family Code provides that only the parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and other relatives are entitled to maintain contact with a child (see paragraphs 35-37 above). As confirmed by the Government, the applicant is not entitled under domestic law to maintain contact with A. because he is no longer considered to be her parent or other relative. In such circumstances, the Court considers that a court application for a contact order is bound to fail on the basis of the existing domestic law.",

As a result a person who, like the applicant, is not related to the child but who has taken care of him or her for a long period of time and has formed a close personal bond with him or her cannot obtain contact rights in any circumstances, irrespective of the child\u2019s best interests. The Government did not give any reasons why it had been considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d to establish an inflexible list of persons entitled to maintain contact with a child and not to make any exceptions to the application of that provision to take account of the child\u2019s best interests in the particular circumstances of each case.",

Germany, no.\u00a017080/07, \u00a7\u00a0100, 15\u00a0September 2011). Accordingly, Article 8 of the Convention can be interpreted as imposing on member States an obligation to examine on a case-by-case basis whether it is in the child\u2019s best interests to maintain contact with a person, whether biologically related or not, who has taken care of him or her for a sufficiently long period of time. By denying the applicant the right to maintain contact with A. without any examination of the question whether such contact would be in A.\u2019s best interests, Russia has failed to comply with that obligation.",

No such reasons were advanced in the present case. It has never been suggested that contact with the applicant would be detrimental to A.\u2019s development. On the contrary, it was established by both the childcare authority and expert psychologists that there existed a strong mutual attachment between the applicant and A. and that the applicant had been taking good care of her (see paragraphs 14-15 above).",
