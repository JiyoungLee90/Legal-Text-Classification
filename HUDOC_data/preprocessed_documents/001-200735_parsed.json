In this case, the applicant challenged the refusal before the court. However, since the criminal case against the applicant was already pending, the national law prevented the court from examining the applicant\u2019s complaint on the merits. The Court notes that the investigating authorities issued a refusal more than two months after the applicant had complained about ill-treatment and nearly a month after his criminal case had been transferred to the trial court (see paragraph 12 above). It is clear that the authorities could have examined the applicant\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment before the criminal case was transferred to the court for trial. In such circumstances, the applicant cannot be blamed for not having his appeal examined on the merits by the Kalininskiy District Court.
