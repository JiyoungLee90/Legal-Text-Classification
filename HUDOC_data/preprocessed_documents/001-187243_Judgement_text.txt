The case originated in an application (no. 2553/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Kenan Avcı and Mr Veysi Dereli, on 24 December 2008.
The applicants were represented by Mr F. Çelik a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 11 December 2009 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants were born in 1980 and 1986, respectively, and were detained at the Tekirdağ F-Type prison when the application was lodged.
On 28 and 29 October 2005 the applicants were arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organisation.
On 31 October 2005 the applicants were brought before a judge at the Istanbul Assize Court which ordered their detention on remand.
On 23 December 2005 the Istanbul public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicants, accusing them, inter alia, of membership of a terrorist organisation and illegal possession of explosives.
On 26 December 2005 the Istanbul Assize Court held a preparatory hearing and ordered the continuation of the applicants’ detention.
Throughout the proceedings the trial court ordered the continuation of the applicants’ detention on remand. Between the hearings, with regular intervals of one month, the court ex officio examined the applicants’ detentions on the basis of the case-file and decided to extend.
At the end of the hearing held on 13 October 2008, the trial court decided once again to prolong the applicants’ detention. Although the applicants’ lawyer was present at this hearing, the applicants were not brought from prison to the court. Subsequently, their lawyer filed an objection against the decision of 13 October 2008. On 11 November 2008 the 13th Chamber of the Istanbul Assize Court dismissed the objection, without holding an oral hearing and based on the written opinions of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicants or to their representative.
On 23 December 2009 the court convicted the applicants and sentenced them to imprisonment. The court also ordered the continuation of the first applicant’s detention and the release of the second applicant.
On 24 March 2011 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first instance court.
