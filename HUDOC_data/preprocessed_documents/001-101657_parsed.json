The Court has further established that police incitement occurs where the officers involved \u2013 whether members of the security forces or persons acting on their instructions \u2013 do not confine themselves to investigating criminal activity in an essentially passive manner, but exert such an influence on the subject as to incite the commission of an offence that would otherwise not have been committed, in order to make it possible to establish the offence, that is, to provide evidence and institute a prosecution (see Teixeira de Castro, cited above, \u00a7 38)",
