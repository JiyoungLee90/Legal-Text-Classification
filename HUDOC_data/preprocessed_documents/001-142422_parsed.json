The leaflet, disseminated in the run-up to the mayoral elections, set out the applicant\u2019s view of a candidate\u2019s suitability for the office of mayor and was therefore of a political nature on a question of public interest at the material time and location. The Court reiterates in this connection that there is little scope, under Article 10 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention, for restrictions on political speech or on debate of questions of public interest (see Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft, cited above, \u00a7 30 (iii)).",

The Court further observes that the German courts considered both to be allegations of fact without further discussion. The Court reiterates that while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the accuracy of value judgments is not susceptible to proof.

The impugned statement was thus an expression of the applicant\u2019s position on that dispute following his assessment of facts which might be accurate or not. The Court notes in this connection that the Regional Court emphasised that the domestic intelligence service was continuing to monitor the association on suspicion of extremist tendencies, which the Court interprets as a sign of the ongoing debate on the association\u2019s political orientation. The Court reiterates that the use of the term \u201cNazi\u201d, like the derivative term \u201cneoNazi\u201d, is capable of evoking in those who read it different notions as to its content and significance (compare, for the term \u201cNazi\u201d and its derivative \u201cneo-fascist\u201d, Karman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040). It cannot be considered as a mere allegation of facts, as it also carries a clear element of value judgment which is not fully susceptible to proof. This is even more the case for the notion of a \u201cparticularly dangerous\u201d neo-Nazi organisation. Thus, the Court cannot accept the view of the German courts that the statement that the association was a particularly dangerous neo-Nazi organisation was a mere allegation of fact.",

The Court reiterates in this context that the degree of precision for establishing the well-foundedness of a criminal charge can hardly be compared to that which ought to be observed when expressing someone\u2019s opinion on a matter of public concern. The standards applied when assessing someone\u2019s political activities in terms of morality are different from those required for establishing an offence under criminal law (see, mutatis mutandis, Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft, cited above, \u00a7 43).
