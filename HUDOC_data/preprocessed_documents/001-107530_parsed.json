It reiterated that a person may have a legal interest even if he or she was not the person to have been defamed, and it threw out the applicant\u2019s explanation of the impugned phrase for the following reasons: from the evidence submitted it transpired that the area close to the Church in Xemxija was indeed a development zone; however, no date could be established as to when the land had been earmarked for such purpose. It further appeared that a company had submitted an application to acquire (tehid) land in Mistra to erect a bulk storage installation for petroleum products. It followed logically, according to the reasoning of the Civil Court, that the applicant had meant that the issuing of building permits during Sir Paul Boffa\u2019s administration had been dependent on his will to build there (on the northern side of the bay of Xemxija), personally. This was the meaning which would have been understood by any ordinary right-thinking person. However, the applicant had not been able to prove that any such permits had been issued, or that Sir Paul Boffa had wanted to build there. Thus, since the allegations were untrue, and the applicant had not proved any basis for such an allegation, mischievous intent was presumed.",

It considered, firstly, that according to established domestic and continental jurisprudence, a descendant of a defamed person did have a right of action. It reiterated the lower courts\u2019 findings in relation to the animus injuriandi and confirmed that their decision based on the finding that the applicant\u2019s statement had been untrue could not be considered to be repressive. It held that an ordinary reader would have definitely understood the applicant\u2019s statement to refer to Dr Boffa\u2019s wish to build there personally and thus did cause harm to his reputation. Moreover, the concept of \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d did not entail the publishing of falsehoods. As to Article 6, it held that according to the \u2019s case-law, the right to a fair trial did not extend to the failure to cross-examine persons who had not given testimony and whose interests were being represented by the heirs who could, themselves, be cross-examined. Thus, there could be no violation of Articles 6 or 10 of the Convention.",

While at the relevant post-war time it had been earmarked as a building site, the only application for development had in fact been that by an oil company for construction of tanks and storage purposes. The Government considered that the impugned phrase was a straightforward statement of fact that could only have the meaning given to it by the domestic courts, particularly bearing in mind that the predominantly Maltese-speaking public would assimilate phrases in English and mentally translate them into their mother tongue, Maltese.

The test of \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d requires the Court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a \u201cpressing social need\u201d. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a \u201crestriction\u201d is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see, among many other authorities, Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2003-V, and Association Ekin v. France, no. 39288/98, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2001-VIII).",

The Court must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the comment held against the applicant and the context in which it was made (see News Verlags GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria, no.\u00a031457/96, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2000-I, and Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2004XI). In particular, the Court must determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the interference were \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d and whether the measure taken was \u201cproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued\u201d (see Chauvy and Others v. France, no. 64915/01, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2004-VI). In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities, basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts, applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 (see Aquilina and Others v. , no. 28040/08, \u00a7 41, 14 June 2011).",

The Court considers that having attributed one of two meanings in which it could have been understood, it stood to reason that the veracity of the statement, as interpreted by the domestic courts made it very difficult, if not impossible, for the applicant to provide direct corroboration of it (see, mutatis mutandis, Bozhkov v. , no. 3316/04, \u00a7 47, 19 April 2011). Indeed, in the Court\u2019s view, while it is true that the applicant could have phrased the impugned statement in a more careful manner, the meaning given to it by the applicant, as can be seen from the English text as published, appears to be a reasonable meaning that could be attributed to it by an ordinary, average reader. Furthermore, the letter had been published in English and was therefore directed at an English-speaking public. The Court considers that the evidence put forward by the applicant in the domestic proceedings, together with the fact that the area was eventually built on in the subsequent years constituted a sufficient factual basis for the statement as intended by the applicant, which in the Court\u2019s view did not amount to a serious allegation. The Court\u2019s case-law is clear on the point that the more serious the allegation is, the more solid the factual basis should be (see, for example, Rumyana Ivanova v. , no. 36207/03, \u00a7\u00a064, 14 February 2008).",

The Court notes that the impugned statement, whatever its meaning may be, was a mere historic sideline to an article which dealt with a totally different subject matter. It held no prominence in the writing; it was of little significance, was written in the calmest of tones and could hardly be considered as provocative or exaggerated in that specific context.",

Indeed, the person who sued the applicant and to whom damages were awarded was not the defamed person, but his heir. In this respect, although the possibility of bringing such an action existed in the Maltese legal system, like in other countries, and though this has never raised an issue, as such, before the Court (see, for example, Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, \u00a7 14, ECHR 2004IV, and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s v. France, no. 71111/01, \u00a7 10, ECHR 2007VII), it is of the view that this element should have been considered by the domestic courts when assessing the proportionality of the interference. Indeed, when considering the harm that may be caused to a person\u2019s reputation, the immediate consequences that come to mind are, inter alia, loss of opportunities, private or professional, or loss of standing in the eyes of the community.\u00a0 The Court notes that, in the present case, the defamed individual passed away more than three decades before the impugned statement was published and any damage that may have been caused to the deceased\u2019s reputation cannot be considered serious in the circumstances (see Editions Plon, cited above, \u00a7 53 and, conversely, \u00a7 47).

The exposure of an individual in such a case to an action in damages for defaming the deceased ancestor of a family is likely to have a seriously chilling effect on the right of freedom of expression, particularly in a case where many years have passed since the death and the burden of proving the truth of the allegation lies on the defendant in any such action. In my view, even if such an action is in principle compatible with the requirements of Article 10, when striking the balance between the competing interests, the weight to be attached to the reputation of the deceased individual must diminish with the passing of the years and that attaching to freedom of expression must correspondingly increase.",
