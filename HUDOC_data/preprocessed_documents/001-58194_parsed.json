A child may therefore be held to have been abandoned even where it is living with its parents (judgment no.\u00a05491/1982), as sometimes the mere presence of a parent may be detrimental to a minor's balanced mental and physical development (judgment no. 7427/1986). The parent does not have to be guilty of wilfully neglecting or harming the minor's interests to have abandoned it. Abandonment is an objective state of affairs and the declaration that a child is available for adoption flows from a decision which is not necessarily intended to penalise the parent (judgment no. 7486/1987).",

That decision was made in proceedings intended to determine the arrangements for returning the child to her original home in which it had come to light, through a new expert report and three meetings organised by the social services, that S.\u2019s mother was suffering from a very serious \u201cpsycho-dissociative\u201d illness and that the child had appeared frightened and anxious and had said that she did not wish to leave her foster home (see paragraph 28 above).",

As the meetings, which were attended only by S.\u2019s father and grandparents, had taken place in a very tense atmosphere (the father had been aggressive and the child had continued to show fear at the prospect of being obliged to return to her family), the Youth Court held that S. should remain with her foster parents. It also ordered that there should be no more contact between S. and her parents and allowed the grandfather three access visits a year (see paragraph 35 above).",

However, the Court is satisfied that the decisions in issue were based on reasons that were not only relevant but also sufficient for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 8. In reaching them the domestic courts relied throughout on the thorough assessments of psychiatric experts and on reports prepared by social workers after each meeting between S. and her natural family. It has to be said that the task of the relevant courts, while not capable of justifying such a delay, has not been and is not easy owing to the sensitive nature of cases of this type and the fact that the applicants exhausted the remedies available to them to challenge the decisions in issue.",
