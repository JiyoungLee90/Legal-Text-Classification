However, it is clear from the facts of the case that the conduct of the authorities, not the complexity of the case, led to the excessive length of the proceedings. In particular, delays resulted from the loss of the case file and the efforts to reconstruct it (see paragraph 8 above). Furthermore, the only investigative steps taken between 1999 and 2002 were the questioning of several witnesses and the commissioning of an expert report (see paragraph 12 above). The proceedings were only terminated three years later, in 2005 (see paragraph 13 above). These delays are clearly attributable to the authorities.
