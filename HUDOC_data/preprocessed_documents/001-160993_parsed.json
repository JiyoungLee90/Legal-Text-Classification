As regards the first applicant\u2019s case, the Government challenged the applicant\u2019s allegations regarding his removal from the hearing. According to the Government, the applicant had been present and had made submissions to the appeal court without any restrictions having been imposed. As regards the second applicant\u2019s case, the Government asserted that the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim of the alleged violation. While the applicant had not been provided with legal assistance at the appeal hearing of 18\u00a0April 2007, the relevant judgment had been later quashed, by way of a supervisory review, expressly because of the State\u2019s failure to provide legal assistance to the applicant.

The second applicant claimed that the quashing by way of supervisory review of the appeal judgment in his case and the fresh consideration of his case by the appeal court had not restored those of his rights that had been infringed in the course of the criminal proceedings against him. The quality of the video link in the supervisory review and appeal hearings had been poor. The lawyer who had represented him before the supervisory-review court had had very little knowledge of his case and had performed his duties in a perfunctory manner. As to the appeal hearing, communication between the applicant and his lawyer had been by means of a video link, which had not ensured privacy. In the second applicant\u2019s opinion, lawyer M. had not acquainted herself with the materials in the case file. Before the appeal court, she had confined herself to reading aloud the statement of the appeal that had been prepared earlier by the applicant himself. Lastly, he submitted that the quality of the video link during the new appeal hearing had been unsatisfactory. There had been delays in the video feeds and sometimes the onscreen image had become frozen.

To ascertain whether or not the applicant has retained his victim status the Court must consider the proceedings as a whole, including those which followed their reopening.
