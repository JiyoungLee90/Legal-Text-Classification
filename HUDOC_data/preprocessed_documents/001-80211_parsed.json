Particulars of the offence play a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of their service that the suspect is formally put on notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him (see Kamasinski v. Austria, judgment of 19\u00a0December\u00a01989, Series A no. 168, pp. 36-37, \u00a7 79). Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the cause of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts. In criminal matters the provision of full, detailed information concerning the charges against a defendant, and consequently the legal characterisation that the court might adopt in the matter, is an essential prerequisite for ensuring that the proceedings are fair. Furthermore, the Court has ruled that sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7 3 are connected and that the right to be informed of the nature and the cause of the accusation must be considered in the light of the accused's right to prepare his defence (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v.

It is not the Court's task to give a ruling as to whether Finnish law, at the time of the proceedings, allowed the Court of Appeal to convict the applicant of aiding and abetting although he had been charged as the principal offender without drawing his attention to that possibility. Given the practice at the relevant time, it is obvious that the impugned interpretation and procedure applied were possible.

Regarding this question in the present case, there was no modification of the timing of the commission of the offences. However, the description of the factual situation set out in the indictment concerning the tax frauds changed during the proceedings in that the applicant had been charged with submitting VAT refund applications, relying on fabricated invoices (allegedly drawn up by H.A., a co-defendant), whereas he had been convicted also of preparation of the documents needed for the commission of the offences (compare and contrast paragraphs 8 and 14 above). This new element did not constitute an element intrinsic to the initial accusation (compare and contrast De Salvador Torres v. Spain, judgment of 24 October 1996, Reports 1996V, p. 1587, \u00a7\u00a033). The Court finds that the applicant's chances to defend himself in respect of the new element of the charges were impaired. As to the Government's argument that the applicant had himself anticipated the possibility that he could be convicted of aiding and abetting (see paragraphs 11 and 27 above), the Court notes that it still remains the case that he was denied the possibility to argue his defence in adversarial proceedings insofar as the element introduced by the Court of Appeal, i.e. the preparation of the documents, was concerned.",

It is true that in previous cases the Court, when assessing the fairness of criminal proceedings as a whole, accepted that a re-qualification of an offence did not impair the rights of the defence when the accused, in review proceedings, had sufficient opportunity to defend him or herself (see Dallos\u00a0v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 29082/95, \u00a7 47-53, ECHR\u00a02001-II and Sipavi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no.\u00a049093/99, \u00a7 30, 21 February 2002). However, this was only the case if in the review or appeal proceedings the accused was entitled to contest all relevant legal and factual aspects of the conviction before the appeal court (see Dallos, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050; Sipavi\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7 31 and Balette v. Belgium (dec.), no.\u00a048193/99, 24 June 2004). In the present case, the Supreme Court only considered whether or not to grant leave to appeal. In the event, it refused leave to appeal. In such circumstances, the applicant did not have sufficient opportunity to defend himself before the highest court.",
