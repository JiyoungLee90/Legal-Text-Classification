In her case no one disputed that her father had owned the land at an earlier stage, but as the land had been sold to a third party in 1995, it was possible that that party would challenge the applicant with its own property claims, which would be based on the purchase of that land. However, such claims would have to be examined in civil proceedings, initiated for instance on the basis of a rei vindicatio action, and not in proceedings under section\u00a014(4) of the ALA. The Court has examined numerous restitution cases against Bulgaria in which the rights of applicants in possession of positive restitution decisions have been disputed by third parties with rival claims to the same land which were based, as in the present case, on a purchase or some other transaction, and in these cases the matter was normally resolved by means of a rei vindicatio action (see for example Sivova and Koleva, cited above; Nedelcheva and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 5516/05, 28 May 2013; and Ilieva and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 17705/05, 3 February 2015). The Court does not consider that, should the applicant in the present case seek to pursue a rei vindicatio action against the third party who bought the land claimed by her, she could do that without having first obtained valid title to the property, that is to say without the restitution procedure having been supplemented with the issuance of plans of the plots and any other necessary formalities. In that regard the Court refers to the domestic decisions illustrating that the courts will not allow a property claim by a person in the applicant\u2019s position without a plan of the plots concerned (see paragraph\u00a018 above).",
