Four months later plain clothes people kidnapped him. Over five months I constantly requested information from the prosecutor, but he did not accept that my husband had been detained. One day, on my way home, a person stopped me and wanted to talk. When I disagreed, he said that he was a police officer. He told me that my husband had been killed; he did not know the place but who did it. He asked me question about many people and I said that I did not know them. He wanted me to work for them, in a way to be their agent. I complained to the HRA and they did not disturb me anymore.\u201d",

However, the above-mentioned procedural obligations extend to but are not confined to cases that concern intentional killings resulting from the use of force by agents of the State. The Court considers that these obligations also apply to cases where a person has disappeared in circumstances which may be regarded as life-threatening. In this respect, it has previously held that the disappearance and unacknowledged detention of a person suspected by the authorities of PKK involvement could be considered as life-threatening in the general context of the situation in south-east Turkey in 1993 (see Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no.\u00a023531/94, \u00a7 85, ECHR 2000VI). Having regard to the cases involving disappearances which it has been called upon to examine and which occurred in 1994, the Court concludes that the general context persisted in that year (see, for instance, \u00c7i\u00e7ek v. Turkey, no. 25704/94, 27\u00a0February 2001; \u0130rfan Bilgin v. Turkey, no. 25659/94, ECHR 2001-VIII; Orhan, cited above; \u0130pek v. Turkey, no. 25760/94, ECHR 2004- ...). It further appears, despite the fact that the exact date cannot be determined by the Court, that the authorities indeed suspected \u0130hsan Haran of PKK involvement (see paragraphs 36-37 and 50\u00a0above). In these circumstances, the Court considers that the disappearance of \u0130hsan  could be regarded as lifethreatening. In this respect, it must be reiterated that the more time goes by without any news of the person who has disappeared, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died (see Tahsin Acar v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a026307/95, \u00a7 226, ECHR 2004... ).",

Since the disappearance of \u0130hsan  in 1994, no evidence was provided by the applicant showing that the applicant or any member of his or her family undertook any steps to inquire about the state of the investigations relating to the disappearance of \u0130hsan . In this respect, the Court notes that the applicant did not object to the public prosecutor\u2019s decision of 21 January 1998. Nor did she petition any national authority requesting information about the investigation. In particular, the Court observes that by failing to submit her new address in Diyarbak\u0131r, the applicant made it difficult for the national authorities to find her and, accordingly, to take her testimony concerning the events. In the Court\u2019s view, such lack of cooperation with the national authorities must be considered to have adversely affected the effectiveness of the investigations into the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of \u0130hsan .",

In the present case, it is Court\u2019s view that there were striking omissions in the conduct of the investigation. In this connection, the Court observes that the initial investigation conducted by the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor appears to have consisted solely of checking custody records of the Diyarbak\u0131r Security Directorate (see\u00a0paragraph 36 above) and that it was not until 29 February 2000 and 15\u00a0May\u00a02001 that the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor\u2019s office tried to obtain statements of the applicant and other family members (see paragraphs 41\u00a0and 43 above). In the Court\u2019s opinion this would have been the logical starting point in an investigation into an alleged disappearance. In particular, the Court finds it difficult to understand why the statements of \u0130hsan\u00a0\u2019s brothers who were sentenced to a prison sentence in 1996 and, hence, under the full authority of the State, were never taken (see\u00a0paragraph 52 above). Moreover, the Court observes that while the identity of one of the eye-witnesses was never disclosed to them, they, nonetheless, were aware of Mr Fahri Hazar who, according to the applicant, was the only eye-witness to the alleged apprehension of \u0130hsan  by police officers on 24 December 1994. The documents submitted by the Government show that he too was never heard by the authorities.",
