In the instant case the applicant did not obtain the money as a result of committing the offence of smuggling, but rather \u2013 as has been noted above \u2013 he earned it through the exercise of his trade. Secondly, the Court observes that the interpretation in question does not appear to be the result of a gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case (compare K.-H. W. v.  [GC], no.\u00a037201/97, \u00a7\u00a045, ECHR\u00a02001-II). The finding that the smuggled object is \u201ccriminally acquired\u201d represented a departure from the previous case-law of the Russian courts. In a series of binding resolutions the Supreme Court clarified that the money or other objects smuggled across the customs border were the \u201cinstruments\u201d or \u201cobjects\u201d of the offence of smuggling. That approach was endorsed by the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in the Petrenko case, to which the Government referred, and also followed by ordinary Russian courts in the cases which have previously come before the Court (see Baklanov, cited above, \u00a7 14). In the applicant\u2019s case, however, the courts did not recognise that the money he had carried was either the \u201cinstrument\u201d or \u201cobject\u201d of the offence. On the other hand, the Government did not cite any other case-law or legal authority supporting the domestic courts\u2019 finding that the money the applicant had omitted to report on a customs declaration had been \u201ccriminally acquired\u201d from the moment he had crossed the customs border.",
