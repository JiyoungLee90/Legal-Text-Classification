That judgment is nevertheless still valid, no proceedings having been instituted under Romanian law to have it varied or annulled by the domestic courts. Apart from enforcement, it is only by means of such annulment or amendment by courts with an equivalent obligation that the continuing situation of non-enforcement may come to an end (see Sabin Popescu v.\u00a0Romania, no. 48102/99, \u00a7 54, 2 March 2004).",

On this point, it notes that the applicant was given a new post and then his salary was reduced following an assessment of his professional achievements (see paragraphs 6 and 7 above). The judgment of 10 October 2001 then ordered the applicant's reinstatement in his previous job and payment of the difference between the salary earned before his reallocation to the new post and his present salary, until his effective reinstatement. The DSV invoked that assessment in its appeal against the judgment of 10 October 2001, but the Court of Appeal did not uphold that argument (see paragraph 10 above).",
