On this point, the Procurator General considered, on the basis of an extensive analysis of the Court's case-law under Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02, that the question arose whether the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that there were sufficient indications that the applicant had committed offences similar to those of which he had been convicted entailed a finding of \u201cguilt\u201d, taking into account that the applicant had been acquitted of those similar offences.",

Austria (no. 28389/95, \u00a7\u00a031, 21 March 2000) \u2013 that following a final acquittal, even the voicing of suspicions regarding an accused's innocence was impermissible and incompatible with Article 6 \u00a7 2. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal had based its finding in the confiscation proceedings on evidence apparently insufficient for a criminal conviction and this had resulted in a decision imposed on the applicant of such severity that it should be regarded as a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Further taking into account that the Court of Appeal had also based its finding that there were sufficient indications that similar offences had been committed by the applicant on a convicting, yet subsequently quashed, judgment given by the Regional Court, the Procurator General was of the opinion that the conclusion that Article 6 \u00a7 2 had been violated was unavoidable. In his opinion, the possibility under Article 36e \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code to impose a confiscation order was limited to offences not included in a charge brought, such as offences appended to the summons for the court's information (ad informandum gevoegde feiten) or other offences that were apparent from the case file (andere feiten die blijken uit het proces-verbaal), as mentioned in the Explanatory Memorandum in respect of Article 36e \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. Consequently, he advised the Supreme Court to accept the applicant's complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 2, to quash the decision of 30\u00a0March 2001 and to remit the case to a different Court of Appeal for a fresh determination of the applicant's appeal.",

Such a determination is preceded by the procedure regulated in Articles 511b et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

One of the changes brought about by this Act was that the proceedings concerning the measure of deprivation of an illegally obtained advantage were disconnected from the substantive criminal proceedings, among other reasons in order to prevent situations in which issues concerning the illegally obtained advantage would overshadow and affect the duration of the substantive criminal proceedings.",

The legislature's choice in setting it out thus was to demonstrate that it concerned a continuation of the criminal prosecution of the convicted person, the purpose being to determine the sanction to be imposed (Kamerstukken (Parliamentary Documents) II, 1989/90 session, 21,504 no.\u00a03, p. 14). The confiscation order procedure is not designed or intended to determine a criminal charge or a criminal penalty, but to detect illegally obtained proceeds, to determine their pecuniary value and, by way of a judicial confiscation order, to deprive the beneficiary of these proceeds. The aim pursued by the possibility of imposing confiscation orders is twofold; in the first place to remedy an unlawful situation and, secondly, to bring about a general crime-prevention effect by rendering crime unattractive on account of an increased risk that proceeds of crime will be confiscated.",
