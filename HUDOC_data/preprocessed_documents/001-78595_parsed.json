If the State transfers such an obligation to a new owner of the shares, as it was in the present case (see paragraph 9 above), the State must ensure that the new owner complies with the requirements, inherent in Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention and Article\u00a01 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01, that a final, binding judicial decision does not remain inoperative to the detriment of a party. In view of the above considerations, the Court finds that the State was responsible for the enforcement of the judgment of the Komsomolskyy District Court of Kherson of 4\u00a0December 2002 throughout the duration of the enforcement proceedings.",
