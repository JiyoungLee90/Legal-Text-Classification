Whilst the final decision as to observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court, it is no part of the Court\u2019s function to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities any other assessment of what might be the best policy in this field. Nonetheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Zubac, cited above, \u00a7 78).",

Section 22 of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office Act, to which the Supreme Court referred in its decision, concerned prosecutors\u2019 orders, which are another type of procedural action by the prosecutor\u2019s office (see paragraph 14 above).
