When the court was informed that no supervised contact had taken place, the District Court sent four fruitless reminders to the contact supervisor without taking more serious measures to ensure the latter\u2019s cooperation. Furthermore the District Court appointed an expert who delayed the proceedings in that he failed to inform the court in timely fashion about his possible reasons for bias and to speedily finalise his report. It is true that the preparation of the expert report was delayed by K.\u2019s unwillingness to cooperate with the expert. However, in view of the considerable lapse of time with the inherent risk of an ever-growing alienation of the child from his father (see paragraph 48 above), the District Court was under a specific obligation to take special precautions in order to prevent any unnecessary delays, such as adhering to a very tight time schedule and to take adequate measures to ensure swift compliance of the persons involved in the proceedings with the court orders. Having regard to the fact that the proceedings were pending for five years and two months before the District Court, the Court considers that the District Court did not display the required diligence in the conduct of the proceedings before it.",
