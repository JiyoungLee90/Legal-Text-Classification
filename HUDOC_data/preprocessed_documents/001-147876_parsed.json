The Court therefore considers that the matter was not of any particular importance for the determination of the applicant\u2019s civil rights (see Gassner v. Austria, no.\u00a038314/06, \u00a7 38, 11 December 2012). The Court does not see any important question of principle involved in the domestic proceedings instituted by the applicant for the readjustment of the boundaries of her hunting grounds. Moreover, the relevant overall period does not appear excessively long. The delay before the Administrative Court was partly caused by the fact that, upon the applicant\u2019s request, it held an oral hearing.",
