The case originated in two applications (nos. 20271/06 and 17517/07) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Slovak nationals, Mr Marián Štetiar (“the first applicant”) and Mr Rastislav Šutek (“the second applicant”), on 4 May 2006 and 13 April 2007, respectively.
The applicants were represented by Mr R. Toman, a lawyer practising in . The Government of the  (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Pirošíková.
The applicants alleged that their detention had been unlawful and unjustified, that the procedure in respect of it had fallen short of the applicable requirements, that they had not had an effective remedy and that they had been discriminated against.
On 1 and 8 March 2010, respectively, the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government.
The applicants were both born in 1977. The first applicant lives in Ružomberok while the second applicant lives in Prievidza.
At 11.10 p.m. on 21 February 2005 the applicants were arrested (zadržaný) by the police and subsequently charged with assaulting a public official (Article 155 § 1 (a) of the Criminal Code (Law no. 140/1961 Coll., as applicable at the relevant time) – “the CC”) and with breaching the peace (Article 202 § 1 of the CC).
It was suspected that, earlier that evening, the applicants had caused damage to goods in a hypermarket, had behaved in an offensive manner in public and had insulted, punched and grabbed by the uniform a policeman who had been called to the scene.
On 17 May 2005 the applicants were charged with a further count of assaulting a public official (Article 156 § 1 (b) of the CC) and with criminal damage (Article 251 § 1 of the CC).
It was alleged that, while being escorted to the police station after the incident of 21 February 2005 and while at the police station, they had made death threats against the above-mentioned policeman and another police officer, and that they had damaged their handcuffs, a bench, a wall and a radiator in their cell.
On 21 July 2005 the Prievidza District Public Prosecutor's Office (Okresná prokuratúra) indicted the applicants to stand trial on the abovementioned charges before the Prievidza District Court (Okresný súd).
On 18 January 2006 the District Court found the applicants guilty as charged and sentenced each of them to two years' imprisonment. The judgment was upheld on appeal by the  (Krajský súd) on 4 May 2006. It thereby became final and binding.
On 18 September 2006 the second applicant was released from prison on parole. The first applicant was released on 21 February 2007 after having served his sentence.
After the arrest at 11.10 p.m. on 21 February 2005, the applicants were taken to the police station and placed in a cell.
At 2.21 p.m. on 23 February 2005, the District Public Prosecutor's Office lodged a request with the District Court for the applicants to be placed in detention pending trial. The request relied, inter alia, on a video-recording by the hypermarket's camera system.
On 23 February 2005 both applicants were examined by a single judge of the District Court in connection with the prosecutor's request. The second applicant was brought before him at approximately 5.15 p.m.. The first applicant was brought before him at approximately 6 p.m.
Assisted by a lawyer of their choosing, who then represented both applicants throughout the proceedings, the applicants denied the charges and argued that there was no admissible evidence against them because all existing witness statements had been taken by officers of the local police force, who had been directly involved in the incident. Those officers were therefore biased by definition.
Moreover, the applicants contended that they had not been brought before a judge within twenty-four hours of their arrest, as required by Article 8 of the Charter of Basic Rights and Freedoms (Constitutional Law no. 23/1991 Coll.) (Listina základných práv a slobôd – “the Charter”).
The applicants asked to be released; they offered a pledge, under Article 73 § 1 (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Law no. 141/1961 Coll., as applicable at the relevant time – “the CCP”), that they would live in accordance with the law and, in the alternative, applied for bail, under Article 73a of the CCP.
At approximately 7 p.m. on 23 February 2005 the District Court gave an order (uznesenie) for the detention of the applicants, rejecting their pledge and refusing bail.
The District Court observed that the suspicion against the applicants was based on the statements of three witnesses and that nothing had been submitted by them or their lawyer that could refute the charges against them.
The District Court held that the admissibility of the evidence would be established in the further course of the proceedings.
The District Court observed that the first applicant had already stood trial and faced charges in two other similar sets of proceedings.
The second applicant had five previous convictions, including for violent offences. In addition, he had stood trial and faced charges in two other similar sets of proceedings also for violent offences. As the second applicant had himself accepted, in the incident of 21 February 2005 he had been intoxicated and “might have eaten some groceries” at the hypermarket.
The District Court concluded that the applicants had a tendency to commit violent offences of the same nature. This prompted fears that, if released, they might complete a previously attempted offence, continue to offend, or undertake new criminal activities within the meaning of Article 67 § 1 (c) of the CCP.
It was therefore necessary to keep the applicants detained and, accordingly, neither their pledge nor bail application was acceptable.
As to the applicants' objection concerning the alleged failure to bring them before a judge within the applicable time-limit, the District Court observed that the applicants had been arrested at 11.10 p.m. on 21 February 2005 and that the application for the detention order had been lodged with the court at 2.21 p.m. on 23 February 2005. The timelimit applicable under the CCP was forty-eight hours and had been observed.
The District Court held, specifically, that “it [was] not up to a judge of an ordinary court, whose task it [was] to decide on detention, to examine compliance of the provisions of the [CCP] with a constitutional law or an international treaty”. The written version of the decision was served on the applicants' lawyer on 2 March 2005.
When the decision was pronounced on 23 February 2005, the applicants orally lodged an interlocutory appeal (sťažnosť) against it. On 28 February 2005 they submitted their grounds of appeal in writing.
The applicants relied on Article 5 of the Convention and reiterated that, under Article 8 of the Charter, their detention was unlawful on the ground that after their arrest they had not been brought before a judge within twentyfour hours. It was true that the time-limit for bringing an arrested person before a judge under Article 17 § 3 of the Constitution (Constitutional Law no. 460/1992 Coll.), as amended with effect from 1 July 2001 (Constitutional Law no. 90/2001 Coll.), and under Articles 76 § 4 and 77 § 1 of the CCP, as amended with effect from 1 August 2001 (Law no. 253/2001 Coll.) was forty-eight hours.
However, neither the Constitution nor any other legislation had expressly repealed the Charter and an implicit repeal was not permissible. The Charter guaranteed them broader legal protection and had to be applied in their case.
The applicants again challenged the evidence and requested release or, in the alternative, bail, and offered a pledge under Article 73 § 1 (b) of the CCP.
On 16 March 2005 the , sitting in private (neverejné zasadnutie), dismissed the applicants' appeal. It noted that the timelimit for bringing the applicants before a judge under the Constitution and the CCP had been observed and that the victim and witnesses had given their statements after duly receiving instructions concerning their procedural rights and duties. The Regional Court held that it was not up to courts in pre-trial proceedings to deal with questions concerning the impartiality of investigating authorities, and observed that “in the recent period, the applicants ha[d] been accused of having intentionally committed several criminal offences, while neither their previous prosecution nor the bill of indictment of 20 April 2004 ha[d] had the required effect on them”. The decision was served on the applicants and their lawyer on 31 March 2005.
On 18 May 2005 the applicants lodged a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution with the  (Ústavný súd). The complaint was amended on 23 May 2005.
Besides the above-mentioned complaints, the applicants contended that the decision of 16 March 2005 was arbitrary and not susceptible to review because of a lack of relevant reasoning and that the proceedings in respect of their appeal against the decision of 23 February 2005 had lasted too long.
The applicants relied on Article 5 §§ 1 (c), 3 and 4 of the Convention and on their constitutional counterparts.
On 5 October 2005 the , sitting in private, declared the complaint inadmissible, essentially for being manifestly illfounded.
As to the time-limit for bringing the applicants before a judge after their arrest, the Constitutional Court endorsed the position which it had taken in previous decisions (on 9 June and 8 September 2004 in cases nos. I. ÚS 100/04 and I. ÚS 141/04, respectively), to the effect that, by virtue of Article 152 §§ 1 and 4 of the Constitution, the Constitution took precedence over legislation (including constitutional laws) which was in effect at the time of the entry into force of the Constitution. Furthermore, the fortyeighthour time-limit under the Constitution also took precedence over the twenty-four-hour time-limit under the Charter in accordance with the maxim lex posterior derogat legi priori.
As to the admissibility of evidence in support of the case against the applicants, the solidity of which was a prerequisite for their detention, the Constitutional Court held, somewhat inconsistently, that it was a matter to be examined by the ordinary courts and that it was not the task of the ordinary courts dealing with detention to examine the lawfulness and constitutionality of the criminal proceedings as such.
Lastly, the Constitutional Court found that the reasons given in the decisions of 23 February and 16 March 2005 were adequate and sufficient and that, although not optimal, the length of the proceedings in respect of the applicants' appeal against their detention was acceptable, the time between submitting their appeal orally (23 February 2005) and in writing (28 February 2005) being attributable to the applicants.
The decision of the  was served on the applicants on 10 January 2007.
During a hearing before the District Court on 21 September 2005, the applicants again requested release or, in the alternative, bail and offered a pledge under Article 73 § 1 (b) of the CCP. The District Court dismissed the request immediately, in response to which the applicants orally lodged an interlocutory appeal and indicated that they would submit the reasons for the appeal in writing once the written version of the decision had been served on their lawyer.
The written version of the decision of 21 September 2005 was served on the applicants on 30 September 2005. “Having regard to the evidence examined hitherto” the District Court was of the opinion that “the reasons for the applicants' detention persisted”. In particular “in view of the applicants' character, their previous conduct and the fact that they had been convicted of a similar criminal offence by the District Court, which conviction was [at that time] pending before the Regional Court on appeal”, the District Court observed that, when shopping, the applicants regularly behaved in the manner of which they stood accused.
The applicants had a tendency to behave, and would continue behaving, this way despite a prosecution in court which had brought about no change in their behaviour. Therefore, the applicants' request for release on bail and their pledge were not acceptable, and those two proposals could not be regarded as more than a mere formality.
Without offering any details, the District Court declared that, “when dealing with the applicants' request, [it] had examined the applicants' remand in custody and the conduct of the prosecuting authorities for compliance with the applicants' fundamental rights and freedoms under the Constitution and international treaties, and that [it] had established no such facts [on the basis of which it could accept the complaint]”.
On 10 October 2005 the applicants submitted written grounds in support of their appeal of 21 September 2005. They referred to the arguments in their appeal against the decision of 23 February 2005 and reiterated that their detention had been unlawful ab initio because the time-limit for bringing them before a judge after their arrest had not been observed. They also submitted that their pledge and bail requests were by no means a mere formality because they were ready to pledge specifically not to behave in the manner for which they had been indicted and, furthermore, the amount that they were offering in bail was substantial.
Relying on the principle of the presumption of innocence, the applicants also submitted that the previous conviction that the District Court had been referring to had been quashed on appeal by the  on 13 September 2005.
On 16 November 2005 the , sitting in private, dismissed the appeal. In a two-page decision, after referring to the impugned decision, the  considered that it was only necessary to add that, although the applicants' previous conviction had been quashed, the existing evidence indicated that they were in fact guilty of assaulting a police officer in a manner similar to the present case. The applicants' detention was justified on the grounds of protecting the public from persons who, having been suspected of committing criminal offences, might commit other such offences. Therefore, neither the bail application nor the applicants' pledge could be accepted. The decision was served on the applicants and their lawyer on 2 and 5 December 2005 respectively. The latter of these dates fell on a Monday.
On 6 February 2006, which was also a Monday, the applicants lodged a complaint with the  under Article 127 of the Constitution. They argued that, as a matter of principle, detention was not to be used as a sanction or a rehabilitative tool. Keeping them in detention was not necessary or proportionate. The purpose of their detention could be served by other measures, such as acceptance of their pledge or bail. The decisions of 21 September and 16 November 2005 were arbitrary and not susceptible of review for lack of reasons. Finally, the time that the District Court and the  had taken to rule on their request for release of 21 September 2005 had been excessive.
By two separate decisions taken on 7 July and 23 August 2006 the  declared the complaint inadmissible in so far as it concerned the first applicant and the second applicant, respectively.
In both decisions the  observed that a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution was subject to a twomonth timelimit.
The  found that in the applicants' case the timelimit had commenced with the service of the last of the impugned decisions on the applicants, that is to say, on 2 December 2005. As the complaint had not been lodged before 6 February 2006, it was out of time.
The 's decisions were served on the applicants on 4 and 12 October 2006, respectively.
On 20 February 2006, following their appeal against his firstinstance conviction, the applicants again requested release.
On 24 February 2006 the District Court dismissed the request finding, inter alia, that the reasons for keeping the applicants detained persisted.
On 28 March 2006 the  dismissed the applicants' interlocutory appeal of 9 March 2006 against the decision of 24 February 2006. From the official Internet site of the  (http://www.concourt.sk) it appears that the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint against the decision of 28 March 2006 and that it was declared inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded on 31 October 2006 and 21 March 2007 respectively.
The Charter was introduced into the legal order by way of a constitutional law which was enacted by the Federal Assembly of the Czech and  on 9 January 1991 and which entered into force on 8 February 1991. It is a valid law in  today.
Pursuant to Article 1 § 1 of that constitutional law, constitutional legislation (ústavné zákony), other Acts of Parliament (zákony) and legal regulations (ďalšie právne predpisy), and their interpretation and implementation, must be compliant with the Charter.
Under Article 8 § 3 of the Charter, a person arrested as a suspect or on the basis of a charge against him or her (zadržaná osoba) must be brought before a judge within twenty-four hours. The judge must examine the arrested person and decide whether he or she should be remanded in custody or released, within twenty-four hours of his or her presentation.
The Constitution was adopted by the National Council of the  on 1 September 1992 and its relevant part entered into force on 1 January 1993. It has the status of constitutional legislation in .
Pursuant to Article 17 § 3, as in force until 30 June 2001, a person arrested as a suspect or on the basis of a charge against him or her (zadržaná osoba) had to be brought before a judge within twenty-four hours of the arrest. The judge had to examine the person and order detention pending trial or release within twenty-four hours of presentation.
Some provisions of the Constitution were amended with effect from 1 July 2001. Since then, pursuant to Article 17 § 3, a person arrested as a suspect or on the basis of a charge against him or her (zadržaná osoba) has had to be brought before a judge within forty-eight hours of arrest. The judge has to examine the detained person and order his or her detention pending trial or release within forty-eight hours and, in the case of particularly serious offences, within seventy-two hours of presentation.
Under Article 152, which has not been affected by any amendments, constitutional legislation, other Acts of Parliament and other generally binding legal regulations remain in force in the Slovak Republic, provided that they are not contrary to the Constitution (§ 1). Their interpretation and application must be compliant with the Constitution (§ 4).
Section 53(3) provides that a complaint to the  can be lodged within two months of the date on which the decision in question has become final and binding or on which a measure has been notified or notice of other interference with the complainant's interests has been given. As regards measures and other types of interference, this period commences when the complainant has a practical possibility of becoming aware of them.
Under section 31a, except where otherwise provided or where the nature of the matter at hand precludes their application, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and the CCP are to be applied accordingly in proceedings before the .
In decisions of 9 June and 8 September 2004 and 13 January 2005, in cases nos. I. ÚS 100/04, I. ÚS 141/04 and I. ÚS 2/05 respectively, the First Chamber of the Constitutional Court held that, by virtue of Article 152 §§ 1 and 4 of the Constitution, the time-limit of forty-eight hours under the Constitution took precedence over the time-limit of twenty-four hours under the Charter. The same position was taken by the Second, Third and Fourth Chambers of the  in decisions of 6 February 2005, 22 November 2006, 30 June 2004 and 9 March 2005 in cases nos. II. ÚS 38/05, II. ÚS 369/06, III. ÚS 220/04 and IV. ÚS 64/05, and appears to have been taken by the First Chamber and the Fourth Chamber of the Constitutional Court in their decisions of 16 December and 25 August 2004 in cases nos. I. ÚS 239/04 and IV. ÚS 235/04.
In a decision of 23 August 2006 in case no. II. ÚS 246/06, the Second Chamber of the  took the view that, in respect of final decisions under the CCP which were served on both the complainant and his or her lawyer, the decisive date for the start of the two-month time-limit was the date when the decision was served on the complainant. The same position was taken by the Third Chamber of the  in decisions of 26 March and 21 August 2003 and 3 November 2004 (cases nos. III. ÚS 90/03, III. ÚS 188/03 and III. ÚS 332/04). The conclusion of the  in all these decisions in respect of the two-month time-limit is supported by analysis.
The same line of interpretation was followed by the  in subsequent decisions, including those of 20 June and 14 September 2006, 17 April 2008, 12 February, 24 June and 8 September 2009 and 21 January 2010 in cases nos. II. ÚS 166/06, II. ÚS 288/06, IV. ÚS 131/08, IV. ÚS 37/09,  ÚS 177/99, III. ÚS 281/09 and IV. ÚS 9/2010.
On 13 January 2005, in case no. I. ÚS 2/05, the First Chamber of the Constitutional Court declared admissible part of a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution which was lodged with the Constitutional Court on 7 December 2004, concerning a decision that had been served on the complainant on 6 October 2004, while he was in detention, and on his lawyer on 7 October 2004. The decision contains no analysis in respect of the twomonth timelimit.
In decisions of 25 November 2004 and 1 June 2005 under respective file numbers IV. ÚS 372/04 and IV. ÚS 157/05, the  took as decisive for the commencement of the two-month time-limit the date when an interlocutory appeal was determined, irrespective of when the decision was served on the detained complainants and their lawyers.
At the relevant time and until 31 December 2005, criminal procedure in  was governed by the 1961 Code of Criminal Procedure. This Code has been amended numerous times.
The time-limit for delivering a detained person to a court was laid down in Articles 76 § 4 and 77 § 1.
Until 31 July 2001 a person arrested as a suspect or on the basis of a charge against him or her (zadržaná osoba) had to be released or brought before a judge with a request for a detention order within twentyfour hours of arrest.
On 1 August 2001 an amendment took effect, pursuant to which a person arrested as a suspect or on the basis of a charge against him or her had to be released or brought before a judge with a request for a detention order within forty-eight hours of arrest.
Under Article 143 § 1, which remained unchanged throughout the relevant period, interlocutory appeals were to be lodged within three days of service of the decision appealed against. If the decision was served on both the accused and his or her lawyer, the time-limit started to run on the later date of service.
In a decision of 16 February 2006 the  overturned a detention order issued by the Galanta District Court on 3 February 2006 and ordered the release of the detainee. The  did so having “examined the written interlocutory appeal of the person charged as submitted by his defence counsel ... and [having] identified itself with the objections raised therein”.
The objections in question included a claim that the authorities had failed to observe the twenty-four-hour time-limit under the Charter for bringing the person charged before a judge. Nevertheless, the  made no specific reference to that argument and offered no reasons other than those mentioned above.
The rules on making legislation were approved by the National Council of the  by way of a resolution passed on 18 December 1996 and published in the Collection of Laws under the number 19/1997.
The rules apply to constitutional legislation and other Acts of Parliament (Article 1 § 1) and provide, inter alia, that amendments to legislation are to be made by means of a direct and explicit amendment and that indirect or implicit amendments are impermissible (Article 11 § 1).
Identical rules were adopted by the Government in the form of a resolution passed on 8 April 1997 under the number 241 and published in the Collection of Laws under the number 372/2000.
Under section 2 of the Collection of Laws Act (Law no. 1/1993), anything that has been published in the Collection of Laws is presumed to have become known to all those concerned on the day of publication. This presumption is nonrebuttable.
Under the Act the State's liability is engaged for damage caused by public authorities, inter alia, through unlawful arrest, detention (zadržanie) or other deprivation of personal liberty (section 3(1)(b)); decisions concerning detention on remand (väzba) (section 3(1)(c)); and wrongful official action (section 3(1)(d)).
The right to compensation for damage caused by a decision on arrest, by detention (zadržanie) or by other deprivation of personal liberty is vested in the person who was subjected to it provided that the decision has been quashed for being unlawful or wrongful official action has been taken in connection with it (section 7).
The right to compensation for damage caused by a decision concerning detention on remand (väzba) is vested in the person who was detained on remand provided that the criminal proceedings against him or her have been dropped (section 8(5)(a)) or he or she has been acquitted (section 8(5)(b)) or the matter has been referred to another authority (section 8(5)(c)).
However, no such right arises when the person concerned himself or herself gave cause for the detention on remand (section 8(6)(a)).
The State is also liable for damage caused by wrongful official action which comprises, inter alia, a public authority's failure to take an action within the time-limit set, inactivity or any other unlawful interference with rights and legally recognised interests of individuals and legal entities (section 9(1)).
The right to compensation for damage caused by wrongful official action is vested in the person who suffered the damage (section 9(2)).
Under section 17 the compensation is to cover pecuniary damage, including loss of profit, and, where appropriate and necessary, non-pecuniary damage.
In a judgment of 16 March 2007 (in case no. 4C 258/2006) the Brezno District Court granted an action for damages by two individuals against the State under the State Liability Act of 2003 and ordered the defendant to pay the costs of their defence in a criminal trial that had ended with their acquittal.
On 22 November 2007 the  upheld the judgment following the defendant's appeal.
On 14 October 2009 the Bratislava Regional Court granted an appeal (case no. 2Co 238/2008) in an action by an individual against the State under the State Liability Act of 2003 for damages and awarded him an amount of money in compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by detention on remand in the context of a criminal trial that had ended with his acquittal.
In a judgment of 17 August 2009 (in case no. 19C 47/2006) the Bratislava District Court granted an action for damages by an individual against the State under the State Liability Act of 2003 and awarded the claimant an amount of money in compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by wrongful official action in connection with his detention pending a criminal trial.
The impugned wrongful official action concerned extension of the claimant's detention pending trial.
The action was preceded by a judgment of the Constitutional Court of 19 October 2005 (in case no. I. ÚS 65/05) in which the  had found a violation of the claimant's rights under Article 5 §§ 3 and 4 in connection with the same facts.
However, the  had been unable to award the claimant damages as he had made no claim to that effect.
