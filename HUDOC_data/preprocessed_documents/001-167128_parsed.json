In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers Ms Lytvyn\u2019s and Mr\u00a0Tokarev\u2019s estimates of their legal fees excessive, in particular on account of the fact that a portion of their submissions on behalf of the applicant concerned the parts of the application declared inadmissible. Accordingly, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant EUR\u00a04,700 in total under this head. This overall award comprises as follows: EUR 2,000 in respect of the Ms Lytvyn\u2019s legal fees incurred in the domestic proceedings and before the Court and EUR 2,700 in respect of Mr\u00a0Tokarev\u2019s legal fees incurred before the Court.",
