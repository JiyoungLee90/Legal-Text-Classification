In fact, instead of seeking to oblige the plaintiff to repair the street, she had demanded resettlement, as in her opinion the street was completely unsuitable for hosting a motorway in the first place. The defendant had been at fault, not only for allowing through traffic, but also for failure to organise its regular supervision by traffic police, environmental and sanitary services to ensure safety, and anti-pollution measures. The claimant asserted that the witnesses had presented inaccurate data. In particular, there had been numerous traffic accidents on , and a recent police response to one of the residents\u2019 complaints about that issue had been included in the case file. Mrs Grishchenko further complained that the court had failed to summon officials from the environmental and sanitary services to present comprehensive information about the environmental situation around the road and so had failed to ensure her and her family\u2019s right of access to environmental information.",

Being mindful of its subsidiary role under the Convention, on many occasions the Court has emphasized that the States should enjoy a considerable margin of appreciation in the complex sphere of environmental policymaking (see, for example, Hatton and Others v. the  [GC], no. 36022/97, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2003VIII). While the authorities of the Member States are increasingly taking on responsibility for minimising or controlling pollution, Article 8 cannot be construed as requiring them to ensure that every individual enjoys housing that meets particular environmental standards (see Ward v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a031888/03, 9 November 2004). In line with these considerations, the Court considers that it would be going too far to render the Government responsible for the very fact of allowing cross-town through traffic to pass through a populated street or establish the applicant\u2019s general right to free, new housing at the State\u2019s expense. All the more so, given that the applicant in the present case has not argued that her house has decreased in value since October 1998 or that she has otherwise been unable to sell it and relocate without the State\u2019s support (see, a contrario, Fadeyeva v. , no. 55723/00, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2005IV).",

Street\u2019s residents, to contribute their views (see, a contrario, Hatton, cited above, \u00a7 128). On the contrary, the nature of this decision and the adequacy of attenuating procedures appear quite ambiguous, particularly in light of the Government\u2019s disagreement with the applicant as to whether the 1998 decision re-routed the traffic from  to  or merely confirmed K. Street\u2019s earlier status as a through road. The Court considers, however, that even if  had been used by through traffic before the 1998 stocktaking project, the State authorities were responsible for ensuring minimal procedural safeguards in this project\u2019s course. Neither the domestic court decisions, nor the Government\u2019s observations contain evidence that these safeguards, and particularly public access to relevant environmental information and decision-taking in the period of contemplating the stocktaking project, existed.",

However, neither the assessment made by domestic courts in their judgments, nor the Government\u2019s observations contain sufficient detail enabling the Court to conclude that this management was effective and meaningful before the measurement of critical pollution levels on 15 May 2002. As transpires from the available materials, this measurement session was carried out only in response to repeated complaints by K.

In particular, while the first-instance court questioned some witnesses as to some points of the municipality\u2019s environmental policy, neither its, nor the higher courts\u2019 judgments contain any express assessment as to why they considered that this policy adequately protected the applicant\u2019s rights. Likewise, no reasoning was provided for dismissing an allegation that the defendant\u2019s decision taken in October 1998 was in and of itself unlawful and arbitrary, and it is unclear from the case file whether this aspect of the applicant\u2019s complaint was at all studied during the proceedings at issue. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning the unlawfulness and arbitrariness of the above decision and the adequacy of the municipality\u2019s environmental policy concerning  were of paramount importance for resolving whether or not the defendant\u2019s conduct struck a fair balance between the applicant\u2019s rights guaranteed by Article 8 and the interests of the community.
