Mr Parnachev, Mr Prokhorov, Mr\u00a0Pestov and Mr Rozhkov considered that the searches of their offices had constituted a disproportionate interference with their rights under Article 8 of the Convention, as it had breached professional secrecy without applying any procedural safeguards as required by the Court\u2019s case-law.

The Court notes that the scope of a judicial review under that provision was limited to reviewing the manner in which State officials had acted. A judge examining such a complaint was required to establish whether or not the investigating authorities had complied with the applicable legal requirements and whether they had abided by the terms of the judicial authorisation. The review under Article 125 of the CCrP did not touch upon the legal and factual grounds for the underlying judicial authorisation, that is to say, whether there had been relevant and sufficient reasons for granting that judicial authorisation and whether it was compatible with the legal requirements (see Avanesyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03133, in respect of searches, and Zubkov and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a029431/05 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a7 95-97, 7\u00a0November 2017, in respect of surveillance activities). Even if a judge had detected irregularities in the manner in which the search had been performed, this would not have affected the validity of the underlying judicial authorisation. The Court concludes that a judicial review under Article 125 of the CCrP could not provide relief in respect of complaints about allegedly unlawful judicial decisions authorising investigative measures such as searches or surveillance activities.",

The applicants submitted their application to the Court on 5\u00a0February 2011, which was outside the six-month period as regards the appeal decision of 11\u00a0May 2010 on the lawfulness of the court search warrant (see \u00a7 51 above) and within the six-month period as regards the final decisions on the complaints under Article 125 of the CCrP (30\u00a0August, 23 and 30\u00a0September 2010, see \u00a7\u00a7 52 \u2013 54 above).

Thus, the manner of the performance of the search of the flat and the seizure of the electronic devices resulted from the search warrant itself and its terms rather than from the authorities\u2019 unlawful actions, for instance, at variance with the search warrant.

Two applicants (applications nos. 32324/06 and 26067/08) argued that the State officials should have stopped their search of the premises after learning on site that those premises had been in fact used by lawyers. Three applicants (applications nos. 2397/11, 19667/16 and 36833/16) considered that the State officials had unlawfully extended the search to encompass the premises not covered by the search warrants. Two applicants (applications\u00a0nos. 11264/04 (second search) and 73629/13) complained about the authorities\u2019 unlawful actions because the searches had been performed under the procedures not requiring a judicial authorisation at all, whether before or after the search. In the above circumstances, the applicants\u2019 grievances stemmed from the manner in which the authorities had acted, rather than from any supposed defects in the underlying judicial authorisation, where it existed. Given the courts\u2019 power to declare such actions unlawful or unjustified, the Court accepts that in the above circumstances the applicants\u2019 attempts to challenge the actions of the investigating authorities under Article 125 of the CCrP were reasonable.",

Thus they were not belated. Mr\u00a0Levchenko (application no.\u00a036833/16) chose to continue the chain of appeals by using the two-tier cassation procedure and lodging an application with the Court within six months of its conclusion. That procedure, although it dealt with the applicant\u2019s claim against the State, was governed by the CCrP. As to the latter, the Court established in Kashlan v. Russia ((dec.), no. 60189/15, 19\u00a0April 2016) that the two-tier cassation procedure is not an effective remedy in proceedings under the CCrP. However, at the material time, the Kashlan decision had not yet been adopted and the previous case-law applied, in which the cassation procedure could be considered to be an effective remedy (see Kashlan, \u00a7 27; Myalichev v. Russia [Committee], 9237/14, \u00a7\u00a013, 8\u00a0November 2016; and Rozhkani v. Russia [Committee], 14918/14, \u00a7 25, 9 July 2019).

The Court will proceed on the assumption that the searches in all applications were lawful in domestic terms and pursued the legitimate aim of the prevention of crime.

To determine whether the measures were \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, the Court has to ascertain whether effective safeguards against abuse or arbitrariness were available under domestic law and how those safeguards operated in the specific cases under examination. Elements to be taken into consideration in this regard are the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure were effected, whether they were carried out pursuant to an order issued by a judge or a judicial officer or subjected to after-the-fact judicial scrutiny, whether the order was based on reasonable suspicion, and whether its scope was reasonably limited. The Court must also review the manner in which the search was executed, including \u2013 where a lawyer\u2019s office is concerned \u2013 whether it was carried out in the presence of an independent observer or whether other special safeguards were available to ensure that material covered by legal professional privilege was not removed.

Finland, no. 50882/99, \u00a7\u00a092, 27 September 2005).

At the material time, there existed no possibility of ensuring the presence of a representative of a Bar association or of having an investigating judge decide whether or not particular documents or objects could be used by the investigation if the applicants objected to it on the grounds of professional confidentiality (compare with Robathin v. Austria, no. 30457/06, \u00a7 48, 3\u00a0July 2012).

The court offered a restrictive interpretation of Article 165 \u00a7 3 of the CCrP (see paragraph\u00a090 above). It did not take into account that the search had already taken place and that there was accordingly no need for the kind of secrecy required in ex parte proceedings. Moreover, that restrictive interpretation appears to have been at variance with the case-law of the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 91 above), according to which that provision did not prevent those concerned from participating in a judicial review of the search. Thus the Court finds that Mr Balyan, Mr Sokolov and Mr Solovyev were restricted in their right to participate in the ex post facto judicial review of the search.",

It is for States to determine who is authorised to practise law within their jurisdiction, and under what conditions. Furthermore, it is also for States to establish a system of particular safeguards of professional secrecy in the interests of proper administration of justice, given lawyers\u2019 role as intermediaries between litigants and the courts (see Andr\u00e9 and Another v. France, no.\u00a018603/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-42, 24 July 2008, and Michaud v. France, no. 12323/11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0118-19, ECHR 2012). In Russia, irrespective of the area of law, legal advice, as well as representation in court proceedings, may be provided by advocates and by \u201cother persons\u201d, with few limitations (see paragraphs 81-87 above). However, professional secrecy is protected only to the extent that advocates are involved, thus leaving exposed the relationships between clients and other kinds of legal advisers (see paragraph 87 above). The Court concedes that potential clients should be aware of the difference between the status of advocates and that of other legal advisers. Advocates enjoy additional privileges which correspond to the fact that their obligations towards clients are greater than those of other legal advisers (see paragraph 87 above). However, it would be incompatible with the rule of law to leave without any particular safeguards at all the entirety of relations between clients and legal advisers who, with few limitations, practise, professionally and often independently, in most areas of law, including representation of litigants before the courts. Therefore, the Court also considers that the searches of the premises of those applicants who were practising lawyers but not members of the Bar were conducted without sufficient procedural safeguards against arbitrariness.",

The Court has previously found that continued retention of seized data-storage electronic devices had no apparent justification where the devices themselves were not an object, instrument or product of any criminal offence, and, thus, constituted a disproportionate interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions protected by Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 (see Smirnov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59).",

The data-storage devices seized were not in themselves an object, instrument or product of any criminal offence, so their continued retention had no apparent justification. There is nothing to explain why the investigating authorities could not have copied the information sought (see, for instance, Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH v. Austria, no. 74336/01, \u00a7 11, ECHR 2007IV). The CCrP currently provides for such a possibility (see paragraph 97 above), but it did not exist at the material time. Furthermore, at least since 2012 the option of returning the devices after examining them (see paragraph 95 above) was available to the authorities, but apparently not used by them in three of the present cases (applications nos. 7101/15, 29785/15 and 36833/16) for unknown reasons. In the case of Ms Fast, the seized computer processing units were returned nine months later; Mr\u00a0Levchenko received his possessions a year and three months after the search; while in three other cases the seized objects were never returned to the applicants. Even though the seized objects were returned to Ms Buraga a month later, the expert had assessed the computers within two days of the seizure, and the authorities did not explain why they had needed to keep the computer units for much longer. Since 2016 (see paragraph 96 above) the legislature has established time-limits for the retention or return of seized objects, but they did not affect the situations of Mr\u00a0Balyan, Mr Sokolov and Mr\u00a0Solovyev, Mr Lazutkin, and Mr Parnachev, Mr\u00a0Prokhorov, Mr Pestov and Mr Rozhkov (applications nos. 2397/11, 7101/15 and 29785/15), whose possessions continued to be retained for unexplained reasons even after the new legislative provisions had been introduced.",
