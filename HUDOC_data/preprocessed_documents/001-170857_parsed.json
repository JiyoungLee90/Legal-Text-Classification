She argued, firstly, that the applicants\u2019 reply to the Security Department\u2019s proposal to change the venue had been submitted within the three-day timelimit established by the Public Events Act. To be precise, it had been lodged on 23 June 2010, three days before the intended march, which was scheduled for 26\u00a0June 2010. Secondly, the applicants could not have replied earlier because they had not received the Security Department\u2019s decision of 21\u00a0June 2010, requiring them to change the venue, until 23 June 2010. The first applicant further submitted that the reasons advanced by the Security Department in its decisions of 17 and 21\u00a0June 2010 had not been sufficient. The Security Department had referred to certain inconveniences that might be caused by the march and the meeting, such as obstructing the traffic, or to other events planned in the city on the same day. However, under section\u00a012 of the Public Events Act it was the authorities\u2019 responsibility to take steps to ensure that public order was respected and that public events could proceed smoothly, including by regulating or blocking traffic. She also referred to the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 2\u00a0April 2009 (see paragraphs 255 to 259 below), which held that neither logistical difficulties that might be encountered by the authorities, nor a certain level of disruption of the ordinary life of citizens, could serve as a valid reason for refusing to approve a public event.",

Domestic law did not impose an obligation on an authority refusing to approve a location or time for a public event to propose an alternative location or time. As to the decision of 23\u00a0June 2010, the court found that it had also been lawful as the first applicant had missed the deadline for replying to the proposal to change the venue. She had not proved that she had been notified belatedly of the decision of 21 June 2010; the list of her incoming calls showing that she had indeed received a call from the Security Department late in the evening of 22 June 2010 could not serve as proof of the belated notification. Lastly, given that the Security Department had not banned the meeting and march planned by the first applicant, but had merely required her to change the venue, her freedom of assembly had not been breached.",

It found that the reasons advanced by the district authorities for their refusal to allow the \u201cpicket\u201d at the location and time chosen by the applicants had been valid. In particular, it had been established that on 26 June 2010 the location in question was the meeting point for the departure of children to sports camps. An assembly in favour of homosexual rights \u201cwould not have furthered the development of their morals\u201d. By contrast, the requirement to obtain the consent of the private sports complex in the grounds of which the intended \u201cpicket\u201d was to take place had no basis in domestic law. Nor could concerns for public order and the safety of the participants serve as a valid reason for the refusal to allow the event, because it was the joint responsibility of the authorities and the organisers to guarantee public order and the safety of all involved. At the same time, the district authorities had not proposed an alternative location or time for the \u201cpicket\u201d, which it was obliged to do pursuant to the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 2 April 2009. The failure to propose an alternative location or time had deprived the first applicant of any opportunity to have the event approved. Lastly, the District Court noted that it was no longer possible to remedy the violation of the first applicant\u2019s rights because the planned date had passed months earlier.

The applicants further argued that any assembly in a public place inevitably caused a certain level of disruption to ordinary life. The public authorities and the population had to show a degree of tolerance towards peaceful assemblies in crowded places, because otherwise it would be impossible to hold an assembly at a time and location where it would draw public attention to social or political issues. Lastly, they submitted that the venue proposed by the Security Department was unsuitable because it was located in a sparsely populated area in the middle of a forest. It was therefore not the right venue to draw the attention of society and the authorities to the violation of homosexuals\u2019 rights, because there would be no representatives of the authorities or the general public present. The applicants also complained of discrimination on account of sexual orientation.",

She found that they had taken part in a gathering which had not received official approval from the authorities. Their argument that no approval was required for gatherings had no basis in domestic law. Section 7 of the Public Events Act provided that all events, except \u201cgatherings\u201d and \u201cpickets\u201d involving only one participant, required prior approval by the authorities (see paragraph 226 below). As the gathering of 20 March 2011 had involved more than one participant, the authorities\u2019 approval had been required. However, the Kaliningrad Town Administration had refused to approve a meeting or a \u201cpicket\u201d planned by the applicants, and no notification of a gathering had been submitted by them. The gathering of 20\u00a0March 2011 had therefore been unlawful. The Justice of the Peace ordered the first, second and fourth applicants to pay a fine of 500 Russian roubles (RUB, about 12 euros (EUR)) each, and the third applicant to pay a fine of RUB\u00a01,000 (about EUR 24). The Justice of the Peace also warned the applicants that if they failed to pay the fines within thirty days they might be charged with non-payment of an administrative fine, an offence under Article 20.25 of the Administrative Offences Code, punishable with either a doubling of the fine or up to fifteen days\u2019 administrative arrest.",

Fencing the area off with metal barriers, blocking it with police buses, diverting the passers-by to other roads, searching the participants and not letting some of them in, had all also been unlawful and unjustified. The security measures taken by the police had made the meeting invisible to the public and thereby deprived it of its purpose.

Firstly, the authorities had not proved that it was impossible to hold the two events simultaneously. A series of \u201cpickets\u201d organised by the Young Guard, the youth wing of the United Russia party, from 10 a.m. to 8\u00a0p.m. every day from 1 July to 15 August 2011, had been allowed by the town administration. There was however no information as to whether the \u201cpickets\u201d had been held as announced, that is for ten hours every day for a month and a half. In any event, according to the notification, the Young Guard\u2019s \u201cpickets\u201d involved no more than twenty participants, while 100\u00a0people were to attend the applicants\u2019 meeting. The venue near the Lenin monument had sufficient capacity to accommodate both events, especially taking into account that the applicants were willing to hold the event in front of the cinema, some distance from the Lenin monument. Secondly, the court found that the area outside the Public Library proposed by the town authorities, was not large enough to accommodate all the participants in the applicants\u2019 meeting. A copy of that judgment was made available to the applicants on 2\u00a0August 2011.",

The Constitutional Court held at the outset that the prohibition on holding public events at those locations was justified by security considerations and the special legal regime applying at those locations. It further found that the perimeter was to be determined by a decision of the regional or municipal executive authorities issued in accordance with the land and urban planning legislation on the basis of the land or urban planning register. Such decisions had to be objectively justified by the aim of ensuring the normal functioning of public utility services situated on the territory concerned.

The ban targeted those whose previous behaviour gave reasons to doubt their ability to hold a peaceful public event in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law. It served the aim of preventing breaches of public order and ensuring the safety of public events. The contested ban concerned only physical persons and did not apply to political parties, public or religious associations, because section 5 paragraph 2 of the Public Events Act explicitly stated that only those political parties, public or religious associations which had been dissolved or the activities of which had been suspended or banned in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law were prohibited from being an organiser of public events. Further, the individuals concerned were not banned from participating in public events organised by others, but were only banned from organising such events. The ban was imposed only in those cases where a person had been found guilty of an administrative offence more than once within a year or if he had been convicted at least once of certain criminal offences. The ban was limited in time and was terminated as soon as the criminal or administrative offence record was expunged. The ban was therefore proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",

The law prohibited any campaigning for participation before the location and time of the public event had been approved by the competent authorities, because in the absence of such approval the time and location were not final. Any calls to participate in a public event before the location and time were approved could therefore mislead citizens. At the same time, the organisers were not prevented from informing prospective participants about the aims, type, location, time and estimated number of participants in the public event even before it was approved by the authorities. They were only prohibited from campaigning, that is from making calls for participation. Such a prohibition was therefore justified. The Court further held that that finding did not remove the obligation on the legislator to amend the legal provisions governing the time-limits for examining organisers\u2019 judicial complaints about the refusal to approve the time or location of a public event so that they were examined before the intended public event.",

The Constitutional Court held that the legislator had a wide discretion in establishing the amounts of fines to be imposed for administrative offences. The increasing of maximum fines to RUB 300,000 for a citizen and RUB\u00a0600,000 for a public official for offences committed in the course of public events was justified by the serious nature of such offences, which infringed public order and undermined public safety. Moreover, in individual cases fines were imposed by the courts taking into account all the circumstances of the case, so that the maximum fines were applied only if a lower fine would not have the necessary preventive effect on the offender and other persons. The Constitutional Court concluded that the increase in the maximum fines was compatible with the Constitution. At the same time, as regards the establishment of minimum fines, the Constitutional Court noted that the minimum fine for a breach of the established procedure for the conduct of public events (RUB\u00a010,000) was higher than the maximum fine for any other administrative offence (RUB\u00a05,000). It also observed that for certain persons even the minimum fine could exceed their monthly income. Given that the judges could not impose a fine below the minimum set out in the Code, they were therefore prevented from taking into account the circumstances of the case and the offender\u2019s personal situation. The minimum fines set out by Articles 20.2 and 20.2.2 of the Administrative Offences Code were therefore incompatible with the Constitution and had to be amended. Further, the Constitutional Court observed that offences related to public events were the only administrative offences which could be punishable by community work. That might be interpreted as a means of suppressing dissenting views and political activity and was therefore incompatible with the Constitution and had to be amended. At the same time, the Constitutional Court held that the increasing of the limitation period for a breach of the established procedure for the conduct of public events from two months to one year was compatible with the Constitution. An increased limitation period of one year was not limited to offences committed during public events. It also applied to some other administrative offences, such as tax offences, electoral offences, and some others. In the case of offences related to public events, the increased limitation period was justified by the difficulty of investigating such offences, which were usually committed during mass gatherings of people.",

The obligation on the organiser to take measures to avoid exceeding the number of participants indicated in the notification therefore pursued the aim of protecting public order and safety. At the same time, even if the number of participants exceeded the number indicated in the notification, that fact alone could not serve as a basis for imposing liability on the organisers. Such liability could be imposed only if the organiser had been directly responsible, through his actions or inaction, for an excessive number of participants, and only then if this might create a threat to public order or public safety, the safety of the participants in the public event or others, or a risk of damage to property. In assessing the organisers\u2019 fault, it was necessary to take into account the reaction of the authorities responsible for maintaining public order during the public event, in particular whether they had requested the organisers to take measures to limit the access of citizens to the public event. The contested legal provisions were therefore compatible with the Constitution. Finally, as regards the provision that the organiser could be held responsible for an administrative offence if damage to someone\u2019s health or property had been caused by participants in the public event, the Constitutional Court held that the organiser could be held responsible only if there was a causal link between the breach of the established procedure for the conduct of public events by the organiser and the damage to health and property, and if the organiser\u2019s fault was established in that connection. That provision was therefore compatible with the Constitution.",

The offender should not be escorted to a police station if he or she had documents permitting his or her identity to be established and if the situation (including the weather) was suitable for drawing up the report on the administrative offence on the spot. Thus, an offender could be escorted to a police station under Article 27.2 of the Administrative Offences Code only when such a measure was necessary in the circumstances and justified. The Administrative Offences Code did not set up any time-limit within which the offender was to be escorted to a police station, because it was impossible to predict all the circumstances that might influence the length of the transfer, such as the distance from the police station, the availability of transport, traffic conditions, weather conditions, the offender\u2019s state of health, and others.

The case concerned the authorities\u2019 refusal to allow \u201cpickets\u201d to mark the anniversary of the murder of Anna\u00a0Politkovskaya and to protest against political repression in the country.

The applicant did not accept that venue, arguing that because of its remoteness from the city centre the purpose of the \u201cpicket\u201d would be thwarted.

The Venice Commission and OSCE/ODIHR wish to stress that the ability to respond peacefully and immediately (spontaneously) to some occurrence, incident, other assembly, or speech is an essential element of freedom of assembly. Spontaneous events should be regarded as an expectable feature of a healthy democracy. As such the authorities should protect and facilitate any spontaneous assembly so long as it is peaceful in nature ... Spontaneous assemblies by definition are not notified in advance since they generally arise in response to some occurrence which could not have been reasonably anticipated ... in order for an assembly to be genuinely a \u2018spontaneous\u2019 one, there must be a close temporal relationship between the event (\u2018phenomenon or happening\u2019) which stimulates the assembly and the assembly itself ... Whether an assembly is \u2018spontaneous\u2019 or \u2018urgent\u2019 will depend on its own facts. In principle, so long as an assembly is peaceful in nature it should be permitted ... The definition would benefit from stating the essence of a spontaneous assembly as being one which cannot be notified and which would not achieve its aim if it were to adhere to notification requirements ... The Venice Commission agrees, in general, that provision for a timeframe for the notification of public events may be helpful as it enables the authorities to take reasonable and appropriate measures in order to guarantee their smooth conduct. It recalls however that there may be cases in which a public event is organised as an urgent or spontaneous response to an unpredicted event, in which case it may not be possible to respect the ordinary timeframe for notification. Spontaneous and urgent assemblies are protected by Article 11 ECHR ...",

It has further been conceded and is indeed explicitly set out in Article 5.5 of the Assembly Law that if the organisers disagree with the local authorities\u2019 motivated proposal to change the format of the public event, the latter is de facto prohibited. Therefore, in the Venice Commission\u2019s view, since the permission is rarely given, the notification or notice, in substance, amounts to a substitute for a request of a previous permission, to an \u2018authorization procedure de facto\u2019.",

Due to this kind of regulation, there is a high risk that in practice reconciliation does not take place. Thus, if the organizer fails to accept the authorities\u2019 proposal, the public event is simply not authorised. The organizer is thus often left with the choice of either giving up the public event (which will then be de facto prohibited) or accepting to hold it in a manner which may not correspond to the original intent. The need to choose only between these two options is not compatible with Article 11 ECHR. This regulation of the notification procedure in the Assembly Act therefore calls for the following comments from the Venice Commission.",

The alteration of the place of the assembly by the authorities means that events cannot be held in places chosen by the organizer within sight and sound of their targeted audiences or at a place with a special meaning for the purpose of the assembly. The Venice Commission recalls that respect for the autonomy of the organizer in deciding on the place of the event should be the norm. The Constitutional Court has rightly specified that the newly proposed time and place must correspond to the social and political objectives of the event, and this requirement provides some safeguard against depriving the proposed public event of any impact. But even assuming that the alternative proposals do comply with this principle, it must be underlined that in principle the organisers should be permitted to choose the venue and the format of the assembly without interference. The Venice Commission agrees with the Institute of Legislation and Comparative Law that \u2018organisers, while implementing their right to determine the place and time of the event should, in turn, endeavour to reach an agreement on the basis of a balance of interests\u2019 and indeed the Commission has recently pointed out the benefits to the organiser, if he/she is willing to cooperate with the authorities, thus preventing \u2018the imposition of further restrictions (and even the termination of the entire assembly, if this is proportionate in the circumstances)\u2019. However, this is only true where the changes in the format are caused by compelling reasons as required by Article 11 \u00a7 2 ECHR. In all other cases, the authorities should respect the organisers\u2019 autonomy in the choice of the format of the public assembly. In this respect, the Guidelines clearly state: \u2018An assembly organizer should not be compelled or coerced either to accept whatever alternative(s) the authorities propose, or to negotiate with the authorities about key aspects (particularly the time or place) of a planned assembly. To require otherwise would undermine the very essence of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.\u2019",

In conclusion as regards the procedure for notification of public events as set out in the Assembly Law, the Venice Commission considers that this procedure is in substance a request for permission. Furthermore, the Assembly Law confers too broad discretion on the executive authorities to restrict assemblies, for instance by giving them the power to alter the format of the public event for aims (in particular the need to preserve the normal and smooth circulation of traffic and people) which go beyond the legitimate aims contained in Article 11 ECHR. The Law fails to indicate explicitly that such discretion must be exercised with due respect for the essential principles of \u2018presumption in favour of holding assemblies\u2019, \u2018proportionality\u2019 and \u2018nondiscrimination\u2019. Judicial review is potentially rendered ineffective because the courts do not have the power to reverse decisions which are within the broad discretion of the executive authorities and they cannot complete review in time before the proposed date of the public event to preserve its original timeframe. As a consequence, in the opinion of the Venice Commission the Assembly Law does not sufficiently safeguard against the risks of an excessive use of discretionary power or even arbitrariness or abuse. Risks of an overbroad use of discretionary powers in order to suppress assemblies can always arise and therefore any assembly law must aim at reducing them as far as possible.",

The Venice Commission agrees with the Institute that it may be necessary and legitimate to prevent a public event from taking place on the premises listed in Article 8.2. However, such a decision should be taken in view of each specific case and according to the criteria indicated by the European Court of Human Rights (notably when it is necessary in a democratic society). Not all assemblies (of all sizes, for example) may be considered to endanger court buildings, or monuments of history and culture. The term \u201cterritories directly adjacent\u201d (Article 8.2.3) is overly broad and calls for narrow interpretation. Rather than listing premises on which public events are always prohibited or are dependent on a procedure determined by the President of the Russian Republic (see Article 8.4 Assembly Act), general criteria in the Assembly Act should set out in what circumstances and to what extent an assembly might pose a threat to the listed buildings or to the function carried out in them. Such criteria could then be applied to specific cases when an assembly is proposed. These criteria should be laid down in the Assembly Act itself in order to give adequate guidelines for implementing decrees.

The Commission delegation was told that the previous organisation of other events, especially cultural events to be held at the venue and on the day of the notified public assembly, regularly entailed the proposal by the municipal authorities to alter the format of the latter. Since such other events are not covered by the time limitation for a notification the organizer of an assembly has to comply with (Article 7 Assembly Law), it violates the freedom of assembly if the assembly cannot take place solely due to the fact that someone else wants to use the place for another kind of event at the same time, who is not bound by the same timeframe-restriction as the organizer of an assembly. Public spaces should be available to all and other events like cultural events should not have automatic priority.

The most common method is a very short statutory time-limit for examining a complaint against the restrictions (for\u00a0example in Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, France, Hungary, Latvia, Montenegro and Spain), often accompanied by a deadline for announcing restriction to the organisers so that they have time to use the remedies (for example in Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Slovenia) and/or immediate enforcement of the first-instance decision on the complaint (for example in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia and Spain). In some States the complainant may apply for an interim measure, such as a suspension of the restrictions order pending the examination of the case (for example in Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy, Lichtenstein, Monaco, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden and Switzerland).",

In all other States under survey additional grounds are necessary to justify a dispersal, such as a threat to public order, danger to the safety of people, to property or environment, commission of violent or criminal acts, anti-social behaviour of the participants, or serious disturbance of traffic). In two States the domestic law requires that any dispersal should satisfy the requirement of proportionality (Lichtenstein and Switzerland), while in one State (Sweden) dispersal is permissible only if other steps taken to stop the disorder have proved ineffective.",

The authorities had three days to propose a change of the location, time or manner of conduct of a public event. If the organisers submitted objections or proposed alternative locations or time, the authorities had again three days to reply to the organisers. Given that the complaint against the authorities\u2019 decision proposing a change of the location, time or manner of conduct of a public event had to be examined within ten days and that that time-limit was rarely observed in practice owing to the heavy case-load of Russian courts, such complaints were in most cases examined only after the intended date of the public event. Exceptions were rare and could be explained by a lighter case-load of a particular judge. That situation was due to the fact that Russian law did not impose an obligation on the courts to examine such complaints before the planned date of the public event. Although the Constitutional Court in its decision of 2\u00a0April 2009 had indeed found that the courts should be required to examine the complaints before the intended public event (see paragraph 258 above), the legislative amendments to that effect had still not been adopted. The Constitutional Court had itself noted that omission in its judgment of 14\u00a0February 2013 and had urged the legislator to amend the domestic law (see paragraph 267 above). Furthermore, there was no evidence that the Constitutional Court\u2019s instructions were followed by the courts in their everyday practice. The Government had not provided any statistical information as to the length of the judicial examination of such cases or any other proof of their allegation that in most cases such complaints were examined before the date of the planned public event (see paragraph 336 below). The facts of the present case provided an ample body of evidence that showed that examination of such complaints was often longer than ten days, and was rarely terminated before the date of the planned public event.",

A posthoc remedy cannot provide adequate redress in respect of Article 11 of the Convention.

The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s assertion, not supported by any documents or statistical data, that the ten-day time-limit was routinely observed and that in most cases the complaints were examined before the date of the planned event (see paragraph 336 above). As demonstrated by the facts of the present cases, the ten-day time-limit was rarely complied with: in the majority of the cases it took the competent District Court between two weeks and seven months to examine the complaint. Indeed, the complaints relating to freedom of assembly were not considered to be urgent, and did not have any priority over other cases, which, combined with the heavy case-load of the Russian courts, resulted in recurrent delays in their examination. The Court reiterates in this connection that a heavy case-load cannot serve as a justification for delays in judicial proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Klein v.

It is significant that the Constitutional Court in its rulings of 2\u00a0April\u00a02009 and 14 February 2013 required the legislator to amend the legal provisions governing the time-limits for examining organisers\u2019 complaints against refusals to approve the time or location of a public event, so that they were examined before the planned date of the event (see paragraphs 258 and 267 above).

It is significant that the Supreme Court expressly stated that the courts had no competence to assess the reasonableness of the authorities\u2019 acts or decisions made within their discretionary powers (ibid.).

The balance appeared to be set in favour of protection of other interests, such as rights and freedoms of non-participants, in a way that made it difficult to turn the balance in favour of the freedom of assembly.

In the Court\u2019s opinion, in the circumstances of the present case, Article 10 is to be regarded as a lex generalis in relation to Article 11, a lex specialis (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 202, and Kudrevi\u010dius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2015). The thrust of the applicants\u2019 complaints is that the authorities imposed various restrictions on holding of peaceful assemblies thereby preventing them from expressing their views together with other demonstrators. The Court therefore finds that the applicants\u2019 complaint should be examined under Article 11, taken alone and in conjunction with Article 14 (see Schwabe and M.G. v. Germany, nos. 8080/08 and 8577/08, \u00a7\u00a0101, ECHR 2011 (extracts); Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, 15 November 2007; and Primov and Others v.

Indeed, the protection of personal opinions, secured by Article\u00a010 of the Convention, is one of the objectives of freedom of peaceful assembly as enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention (see Ezelin, cited above, \u00a7 37; Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2003III; and Barraco v. France, no. 31684/05, \u00a7 29, 5 March 2009). In the sphere of political debate the guarantees of Articles 10 and 11 are often complementary, so Article 11, where appropriate, must be considered in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law on freedom of expression. The Court reiterates that the link between Article 10 and Article 11 is particularly relevant where the authorities have interfered with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in reaction to the views held or statements made by participants in a demonstration or members of an association (see, for example, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v. Bulgaria, nos.\u00a029221/95 and 29225/95, \u00a7 85, ECHR 2001IX, and Primov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 92).",

Bulgaria, no. 48284/07, \u00a7 43, 18 October 2011). The term \"restrictions\" in paragraph 2 of Article 11 should be interpreted as including measures taken before, during and after an assembly (see Ezelin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a039). Although a requirement of prior notification did not as such constitute an interference with the freedoms of expression and assembly, the situation was different where, as in Russia, the notification procedures were not limited to informing the authorities of the organisers\u2019 intention to hold an assembly, but allowed the authorities to impose restrictions on its location, time or manner of conduct. In Russia the organisers\u2019 right to hold a peaceful assembly was conditional on the authorities\u2019 approval of the chosen location, timing and manner of conduct. Failure to reach an agreement following the authorities\u2019 proposal to change the location, time or manner of conduct of a public event resulted in the organisers being prohibited from holding it. The domestic law gave the police powers to disperse public events which took place at a location or time or in a manner not approved by the authorities and to bring the organisers and participants to liability under Article 20.2 of the Administrative Offences Code. Prior restrictions imposed by the Russian authorities on the location, time or manner of conduct of a public assembly therefore constituted an interference with freedom of assembly (see Berladir and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a034202/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a047-51, 10 July 2012).",

The applicants stressed the importance of negotiation and mediation to resolve disputes between the authorities and the organisers. Such negotiation and meditation procedures were however not provided by Russian law. In particular, Russian law did not provide for any mechanism to solve the disagreements between the authorities and the organisers as to the location, time and other parameters of a public event. As a rule, the authorities rejected any attempts at dialogue and turned down all objections or alternative proposals by the organisers, insisting that the public event should be held at the location and time and in the manner determined by the authorities. Thus, in some cases, the authorities had refused to approve an assembly even despite the organisers\u2019 active cooperation, such as agreeing to change the date or the location, in particular by proposing a number of alternative locations for their event (see paragraph 23, 57, 60, 62, 77, 79, 86, 95, 97, 112, 114 and 116 above).

According to the applicants, any demonstration in a public place inevitably caused a certain level of disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, and it was important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings. It was precisely the aim of the notification procedure to inform the authorities about the intended public event in advance so that they could take measures to regulate the traffic and any other measures necessary to avert safety and security risks.

The applicants argued, in particular, that the locations chosen by them had been crucially important, either because of their proximity to the target of their protest (for\u00a0example, a town administration or the police headquarters) or because of their central location, which would allow them to reach a wide audience. They further argued that the alternative locations proposed by the authorities were unsuitable, because they were located either far from the State institutions targeted by the protest or on some occasions even in remote or isolated areas far from the town centre (see paragraphs 77, 110, 130, 138, 160, 180, 187 and 197 above). Those locations lacked visibility and would not have therefore permitted the applicants to draw attention to their message. The applicants disagreed with the Government\u2019s position that any location proposed by the authorities, no matter how remote or desolate, was suitable to ensure an effective exercise of the right to freedom of assembly and therefore had to be accepted by the organisers. In the applicants\u2019 opinion, a location would be suitable only if it permitted the assembly to achieve its aims. The locations proposed by the authorities had not satisfied that requirement. In some cases (see paragraphs 14, 22, 56 and 58 above) the authorities had not proposed any alternative locations at all, in breach of the domestic law.",

For example, reference to public order considerations had been unconvincing in cases of public events that had involved low numbers of expected participants and had not therefore presented any danger to public order (see, for example, paragraph 131 above). Similarly, the authorities had not explained why it had been impossible to hold two events simultaneously at the same location, taking into account, for example, the number of participants, the size of the location, and the aims of the two events (see paragraphs 137, 139, 179, 186 and 196 above). In some cases the authorities\u2019 reference to circumstances allegedly preventing holding a public event at the location chosen by the applicants had turned out to be factually incorrect (see paragraphs 115, 153 and 202 above). In the applicants\u2019 opinion, this showed that the domestic authorities had sometimes resorted to pretexts to refuse approval, while the true aim of the restriction had been to hinder public expressions of criticism against the authorities.

Under Russian law the recourse to forced dispersal was not limited to cases of violent assemblies or assemblies presenting danger to public order or public safety; the mere fact of unlawfulness of a public event was sufficient to legitimise its dispersal under the domestic law. The Court had however already found that the fact that the assembly was unlawful did not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no.\u00a074552/01, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2006XIII). It was important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention was not to be deprived of its substance (see Malofeyeva v. Russia, no. 36673/04, \u00a7 136, 30\u00a0May 2013). In the applicants\u2019 opinion, the mere failure to comply with the restrictions on the location, time or manner of conduct of a public event imposed by the authorities did not justify its dispersal. Such dispersal could be justified only when it was applied as a measure of last resort where there was an imminent threat of violence and where other reasonable measures to facilitate and protect the assembly from harm (for example, by quieting violent individuals) had proved ineffective (they referred to \u00a7\u00a7 165 and 166 of the OSCE/ODIHR Guidelines, cited in paragraph 317 above). A blanket use of dispersals for non-violent assemblies by the Russian authorities might not be considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",

In particular, they submitted that the blanket statutory ban on holding public events at certain locations, such as in the immediate vicinity of court buildings or detention facilities, was incompatible with Article 11 because it prevented the domestic authorities, and ultimately the courts, from carrying out a proportionality exercise on a case-by-case basis. Blanket bans required stronger justification than individual restrictions. The Government however had not provided \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d reasons for its blanket ban on holding events at certain locations. In particular, the applicants argued that it was sometimes essential to hold a public event near a court building, for example if its aim was to promote the independence of the judiciary (see, for example, Kakabadze and Others v. Georgia, no. 1484/07, 2 October 2012), or to criticise perceived dysfunctions in the judicial system (see, for example, Sergey Kuznetsov v. Russia, no. 10877/04, 23 October 2008). The Court had found that the judiciary, as with all other public institutions, could not be immune from criticism, however shocking and unacceptable certain views or words might appear (see Ska\u0142ka v. Poland, no.\u00a043425/98, \u00a7\u00a034, 27\u00a0May\u00a02003). It was also significant in this connection that Russian law did not clearly establish on the basis of which criteria the perimeter of the zones in which public events were prohibited was to be determined. According to the Public Events Act the perimeter of such zones was to be determined by a decision of the regional or municipal executive authorities issued in accordance with the land and urban planning legislation on the basis of the land or urban planning register. However, the land and urban planning legislation did not give any definition of the term \u201cin the immediate vicinity of\u201d. As a result, the determination of the perimeter of such zones was left to the complete discretion of the regional and municipal authorities. In practice, the perimeter of the zones was defined by the local authorities as a certain radius of, for example, 25, 50, 100 or 150 m.",

Many regions had adopted regional laws prohibiting holding of public events at such places as airports, railway and bus stations, seaports, markets and fairs, territories in the vicinity of medical or educational institutions, and religious or military buildings. In some regions, public events were prohibited in town centres where regional legislative, executive and judicial bodies were situated. These prohibitions applied only to public events within the meaning of the Public Events Act (see paragraph 218 above), and did not concern such mass gatherings as military parades, religious ceremonies, fairs, sports events or public celebrations.

Thus, some of the applicants (application no.\u00a04618/11, see paragraphs 29 to 37 above) had been unable to hold a meeting and a march on 19\u00a0January 2010 because the time-limit for lodging a notification had fallen in its entirety on the New Year and Christmas holidays, which ran from 1 to 10\u00a0January. Nonetheless, the date of 19 January was very important to the applicants, because they had planned to hold a meeting and a march on the anniversary of the murder of two social activists, to commemorate their tragic deaths. The authorities had not explained to the applicants on which dates a notification had to be lodged in order to comply with the statutory time-limit and be approved by the authorities. The refusal to approve the meeting and the march had not pursued any legitimate aim. It had been justified by purely logistical reasons and had not been therefore \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. The applicants conceded that they had eventually been able to hold a \u201cpicket\u201d on 19 January 2010 because the notification time-limit for a \u201cpicket\u201d was shorter than that required for a meeting or a march. However, a \u201cpicket\u201d was not an adequate substitute for a meeting and a march. A \u201cpicket\u201d differed from a meeting or a march by its aims and scale, because it involved fewer participants, attracted fewer journalists, and in the end had less social impact.",

The applicant concerned argued that owing to the frequent delays in delivery of correspondence by Russian post, the authorities should have known that there was little chance that he would receive the letter before the planned date of the event and would have enough time to prepare for it. That letter had indeed arrived at the local post office only on the day of the \u201cpicket\u201d. Even if he had received it, it would no longer have been possible to hold the event. The applicant submitted that he had given the authorities his mobile telephone number and the mobile telephone numbers of two other organisers. Accordingly, the authorities had had all the necessary information enabling them to contact the organisers and inform them of the approval of the \u201cpicket\u201d. Instead of contacting them by telephone however, the authorities had preferred to send the decision by post, knowing that the letter would not reach them in time. Despite the formal approval of the \u201cpicket\u201d, the applicant had therefore been deprived of a practical and realistic opportunity to hold it.",

Firstly, in the applicants\u2019 opinion the Town Administration\u2019s decision of 4 June 2009 (see paragraph 126 above) was based on discriminatory grounds. By denying them the right to hold an event entitled \u201cRussia against Putin\u201d on the ground that it might trigger a hostile reaction from Mr Putin\u2019s supporters, the authorities had treated them less favourably than the pro-government associations. Given that the authorities had not provided any convincing justification, the applicants argued that the authorities\u2019 real aim had been to prevent them from expressing their opposition views, which had amounted to discrimination on grounds of political views. Secondly, by allowing the pro-government Young Guard to lodge a single notification for a series of \u201cpickets\u201d, while at the same time denying that opportunity to the applicants (see paragraphs 185 to 193 above), the domestic authorities had treated the pro-government organisation more favourably than the applicants, without any justification. Thirdly, the applicants had lodged their notifications for the meetings of 31\u00a0July and 31 August 2011 and 31 January 2012 at the earliest opportunity, immediately after the opening of the Town Administration (see paragraphs 178, 185 and 195 above). On all three occasions the applicants had not seen anyone enter the Town Administration building and submit a notification ahead of them. The Government had not disputed that the only way to submit a notification at 9 a.m. was to enter the Administration building before its opening hours without an entry pass. They had not disputed either that, unlike the applicants, members of progovernment organisations had been allowed to enter the Administration building without complying with the above entry formalities, and had therefore been able to lodge their notifications before anyone else. As a result of the less favourable treatment they received compared with progovernment organisations, the applicants\u2019 chances of having their notifications approved had been reduced. That difference in treatment had no objective or reasonable justification.",

Those measures had severely affected the applicants\u2019 capacity to share and communicate their political views, while the pro-government organisations had fully enjoyed the opportunity to interact with the passers-by and disseminate their ideas without any hindrance caused by unnecessary security measures. The authorities had not provided any justification for that difference in treatment. There had been no evidence of any changes in the security situation. The authorities had never argued that the terrorist threat was higher on 31\u00a0March 2011 than on the days when the other public events had been held.

The difficulties encountered by the applicants had not been isolated incidents; they originated in a widespread administrative practice resulting from malfunctions in the domestic legislation described above (compare Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, \u00a7 189, ECHR 2004V, and Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2009). Indeed, the lack of clarity of the domestic law and the disproportionate and unnecessary restrictions provided by it, coupled with the absence of an effective remedy, had made possible its arbitrary and discriminatory application. As a result, restrictions on the time, location or manner of conduct were systematically imposed on peaceful assemblies if the message conveyed by them did not please the authorities. The large number of applications pending before the Court demonstrated the recurrent and persistent nature of the problem, which affected large numbers of people from all Russian regions (compare Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 185 and 195). The amendments introduced in 2012 had further aggravated the situation, in particular by providing that all public events were to be held at specially designated locations, and that other locations could be used in exceptional circumstances only.",

Referring to the decision of 2\u00a0April 2009 by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs  to  above), they argued that the Public Events Act required the executive to give weighty reasons for their proposals to change the location or time of a public event. Such reasons might include the need to preserve the normal, uninterrupted functioning of vital public utility or transport services, to protect public order or the safety of citizens, or other similar reasons. It was impossible, however, to make an exhaustive list of permissible reasons, as this would have the effect of unjustifiably restricting the executive\u2019s discretion. The authorities also had to propose another location and time compatible with the public event\u2019s purposes and allowing the participants to bring their message to their target audience. The organisers, in their turn, were also required to make an effort to reach an agreement with the executive. If it proved impossible to reach an agreement, the organisers were entitled to defend their rights and interests in court. The courts had competence to assess whether the executive\u2019s decision was lawful and well reasoned, and whether the restriction on freedom of assembly was proportionate.",

The restrictions imposed on the applicants\u2019 freedom of assembly had therefore pursued the legitimate aims of protecting public order and the rights of others. The authorities had proposed alternative locations or time-slots to the applicants. Accordingly, the applicants had been afforded an opportunity to express their views in another venue chosen by the public authority. Despite the requirements of the national law, the organisers had not been cooperative and had refused, without any valid reason, to accept the authorities\u2019 proposals (see Berladir and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 60). The applicants\u2019 arguments that the locations chosen by them were crucially important and the locations proposed by the authorities unsuitable had been unconvincing because the change of location could not as such restrict the freedom of assembly.

Given that simultaneous holding of several public events at the same location was prohibited, the authorities approved the public event which had been notified first. The authorities had always applied a chronological approach, and had never been guided by any discriminatory attitudes. It was however logical that bigger associations more often succeeded in organising public events. Most of the public associations adopted cooperative attitudes and accepted the authorities\u2019 proposals to change the locations of events. By contrast, the applicants almost never agreed to such proposals, under the pretext that the location near the Lenin monument was the only suitable location owing to its proximity to the Town Administration.",

The enclosing of the location and the bodily searches of the participants had been justified by the high risk of terrorist acts. Such measures were often taken during mass events. As regards the alleged difference in treatment of the notifications of a series of \u201cpickets\u201d, the Government submitted that the notification lodged by the applicants had concerned a series of separate \u201cpickets\u201d, each of which required a separate notification submitted within the statutory time-limit. By contrast, the notification submitted by the Young Guard had concerned a single public event lasting many days. The fact that the Young Guard had been allowed to hold their series of \u201cpickets\u201d while the applicants\u2019 notification had been rejected did not disclose any evidence of discrimination on account of political views. Lastly, as regards the meeting of 31 January 2012, the applicants had lodged their notification at 9.25 a.m. on 16 January 2012, while Mr B. had lodged his notification at 9 a.m. the same day. The applicable procedures did not require the Town Administration to establish how the people wishing to lodge a notification had entered the Town Administration building. The reasons why one notification had been lodged before another had not been therefore taken into account by the Town Administration when deciding which of the public events to approve. There was therefore no evidence of discrimination on the grounds of political views.",

The impossibility of imposing such sanctions would render illusory the power of the State to require notification (see Ziliberberg v.\u00a0Moldova (dec.), no. 61821/00, 4 May 2004). Thus, the Court had found that the dispersal of a demonstration on the ground that the notification requirement had not been complied with and the arrest, prosecution and conviction of its organisers and participants was compatible with Articles\u00a010 and\u00a011 (see \u00c9va Moln\u00e1r, cited above; Rai and Evans v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 26258/07 and 26255/07, 17\u00a0November\u00a02009; and Berladir and Others, cited above).

The applicants in the present case had acted unlawfully by holding public events without the authorities\u2019 approval. Dispersals of their public events had therefore been lawful and justified.

They disputed that the event held by the applicant of application no. 37038/13 could be qualified as genuinely spontaneous. They conceded that the date of the examination of the draft law had indeed been announced two days before, making it impossible to submit a notification within the statutory time-limit. They however stressed that on that date the State Duma had examined the draft law at second reading, while three readings were necessary for a law to be adopted. There had been sufficient time to organise a public event in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law before the third and final reading of the draft law by the State Duma. The facts of the present case had not therefore disclosed special circumstances such as would warrant an immediate demonstration as the only adequate response.

In particular, referring to the decision of 29\u00a0May 2007 by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 253 above), the Government argued that the aim of the prohibition on holding public events in the vicinity of court buildings was to protect the independence of the judiciary and to prevent pressure on judges. The restriction was therefore justified, and did not breach citizens\u2019 constitutional rights. The acknowledged importance of freedom of expression did not require the automatic creation of rights of entry to private property, or even necessarily to all publicly owned property, provided that interested parties had an alternative opportunity to exercise their freedom of expression in a meaningful manner (see Appleby and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 44306/98, \u00a7\u00a7 47 and 48, ECHR 2003VI).",

Hungary, no.\u00a058050/08, \u00a7 21, 27\u00a0November 2012). The Court stresses in this connection that the organisers\u2019 autonomy in determining the assembly\u2019s location, time and manner of conduct, such as, for example, whether it is static or moving or whether its message is expressed by way of speeches, slogans, banners or by other ways, are important aspects of freedom of assembly. Thus, the purpose of an assembly is often linked to a certain location and/or time, to allow it to take place within sight and sound of its target object and at a time when the message may have the strongest impact (see S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 37273/10 and 17 others, \u00a7\u00a0109, 24\u00a0May\u00a02016; see also, for the same approach, \u00a7 40 of the Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association of 21\u00a0May 2012, cited in paragraph 313 above; point 4.2 of the Compilation of Venice Commission Opinions Concerning Freedom of Assembly of 1\u00a0July 2014, cited in paragraph 315 above; and point 3.5 and \u00a7\u00a0101 of the 2010 Guidelines on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly by the ODIHR in consultation with the Venice Commission, cited in paragraph 317 above). Accordingly, in cases where the time and place of the assembly are crucial to the participants, an order to change the time or the place may constitute an interference with their freedom of assembly, as does a prohibition on speeches, slogans or banners (see Stankov and the\u00a0United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 79-80 and 10809; The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Ivanov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a044079/98, \u00a7\u00a0103, 20\u00a0October 2005; and Disk and Kesk v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a038676/08, \u00a7 31, 27\u00a0November 2012).",

The Court reiterates in this connection that any assembly in a public place is likely to cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life, and that this in itself does not justify an interference with the right to freedom of assembly, as it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 155-57, cited in paragraph 412 above). In none of the present cases did the authorities argue that the organisers intentionally structured their public event in such a way as to cause disruption to ordinary life and other activities to a degree exceeding that which is inevitable in the circumstances.

It is significant that in their decisions the executive authorities did not rely on any evidence corroborating the existence of such risks or assess whether they were serious enough to justify a restriction of the freedom of assembly. Moreover, the present case shows that a reference to safety and national security risks was sometimes used selectively to restrict anti-government public assemblies, while during the same period of time pro-government assemblies and public festivities were allowed to proceed unhindered, the alleged terrorist risk notwithstanding (see paragraphs 105 and 171 to 175 above; see also, for the same reasoning, Makhmudov v.

If every possibility of tension and heated exchange between opposing groups during a demonstration were to warrant its prohibition, society would be faced with being deprived of the opportunity of hearing differing views on any question which offends the sensitivity of the majority opinion. Participants in peaceful assemblies must be able to hold demonstrations without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents. It is thus the duty of Contracting States to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful demonstrations to proceed peacefully (Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v.\u00a0Austria, 21 June 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 34, Series A no. 139; Barankevich v.\u00a0Russia, no. 10519/03, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 32, 26 July 2007; and F\u00e1ber v. Hungary, no.\u00a040721/08, \u00a7\u00a7 38-40, 24 July 2012). The Court therefore considers that a reference to negative attitudes of others towards the views expressed at a public assembly cannot serve as a justification either for a refusal to approve such an assembly or for a decision to banish it from the city centre to the outskirts. There is no indication that an evaluation of the resources necessary for neutralising the threat of clashes was part of the domestic authorities\u2019 decision-making process. Instead of considering measures which could have allowed the applicants\u2019 public event to proceed without disturbance, the authorities chose to relocate it out of the town centre to a remote and deserted location (see paragraphs 126 to 130 above).",

Although the Constitutional Court held that the authorities should propose a location and time compatible with the assembly\u2019s purposes (see paragraph 257 above), an analysis of the present case reveals that the Constitutional Court\u2019s instructions were not complied with in practice. Indeed, on many occasions the authorities proposed locations outside the city centre, far from any government officers and with limited passage of people, that is not within sight and sound of the target audiences (see, for example, paragraphs 77, 86, 110, 130, 138, 160, 180, 187 and 197 above).

Moreover, the scope of judicial review was limited to examining the lawfulness of the proposal to change the location, time or manner of conduct of a public event, and did not include any assessment of its \u201cnecessity\u201d and \u201cproportionality\u201d (see paragraphs 356 to 358 above).

There is a risk that such a widely framed power could be misused against organisers of, and participants in, public assemblies in breach of Article 10 and/or 11 of the Convention (see, for similar reasoning, Gillan and Quinton, cited above, \u00a7\u00a085). Indeed, the present case shows that the above powers are often used in an arbitrary and discriminatory way. It provides ample examples of situations where opposition groups, human rights defenders or gay rights activists were not allowed to assemble at a central location and were required to go to the outskirts of town on the ground that they might hinder traffic, interfere with the everyday life of citizens, or present a security risk, and were dispersed and arrested if they refused to comply, while progovernment public events were allowed to take place at the same location, traffic, everyday-life disturbances and security risks notwithstanding. The most telling example is the case of gay rights activists who proposed ten different locations in the town centre, all of which were rejected by the town authorities on various grounds, while an anti-gay public event was approved to take place at one of those same locations on the same day (see paragraphs 53 to 64 above). Another conspicuous example is the case of the supporters of the opposition \u201cStrategy-31\u201d movement who, between June 2009 and August 2012, lodged at least eighteen notifications of public events in the centre of Rostov-on-Don, only one of which was approved by the town authorities, while government supporters did not have any apparent difficulty in having their public events at the same locations approved by the town authorities (see paragraphs 121 to 205 above).",

It is not limited to public assemblies held with the intention of obstructing or impeding the administration of justice. It prohibits all assemblies, including those unrelated to any judicial proceedings. For example, the applicants were not allowed to hold a Gay Pride event in the town centre, on the ground that the location they chose was in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court building (see paragraph 56 above). It is significant that the event at issue was unrelated to any case being examined by the Constitutional Court; its purpose was to mark the anniversary of the start of the gay rights movement back in the 1960s and to condemn homophobia and discrimination against homosexuals.",

The Constitutional Court found that that provision was incompatible with the Russian Constitution in so far as it prevented a public event from being held in those cases where the entire time-limit for notification fell on a public holiday (see paragraphs 270 to 275 above). Indeed, the inflexible application of this provision makes it impossible to hold a public event other than a \u201cpicket\u201d during a number of days after the New Year and Christmas holidays in January each year.",

Participants are prohibited from using sound amplifying equipment, which makes it impossible to make speeches. The only reason to justify why during several days in January each year the only type of public event available to organisers should be a static and silent one appears to be the operation of the statutory time-limit for lodging notifications. The Court reiterates that while rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself (see Primov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 118).

It notes in this connection that Russian law does not establish any procedure for informing the organisers of the authorities\u2019 decision approving a public event or refusing such approval and proposing a change of the location, time or manner of conduct. As held by the Russian courts, the authorities have wide discretion to choose the means of communication with the organisers (see paragraph 18 above). It is not the Court\u2019s task to indicate the preferred ways of communicating with the organisers; the domestic authorities, which have the advantage of possessing direct knowledge of the situation, are better placed to assess the situation in the light of practical circumstances, such as the reliability or otherwise of the local postal service, the location of the parties, and the availability of technical equipment. However, given the very tight timeframe of the notification procedure, the Court considers that whatever the chosen method of communication, it should ensure that the organisers are informed of the authorities\u2019 decision reasonably far in advance of the planned event, in such a way as to guarantee the right to freedom of assembly which is practical and effective, not theoretical or illusory. Indeed, if the organisers are not informed in timely fashion of the authorities\u2019 approval or the proposal to change the location, time or manner of conduct of the planned event, the organisers may have insufficient time to announce to the participants the approved time and location of the event, and may even have to abandon it (see, as an example of such a situation, Primov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 146).",

Moreover, the dispersal and arrest of participants occurred within a very short time after the beginning of the assembly, showing the authorities\u2019 impatience to end the unlawful public event before the protesters had had sufficient time to express their position of protest and to draw the attention of the public to their concerns (see, for similar reasoning, Oya Ataman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041, and Sam\u00fct Karabulut v.

It reiterates in this connection that enforcement of rules governing public assemblies, although important, cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 150 and 151, cited in paragraph 412 above). The Court considers that the authorities could have attained their goals by allowing the applicants to complete their protest and perhaps imposing a reasonable fine on the spot or later on (see Novikova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0175; see also Taranenko v. Russia, no. 19554/05, \u00a7\u00a7 75 and 95, 15 May 2014 on the chilling effect that a disproportionately severe sanction may have on the sanctioned person and other persons taking part in protest actions).",

That being said, the Court has already found that unusually long security checks of participants that had resulted in delaying a rally amounted to an unjustified interference with the applicants\u2019 freedom of assembly (see Singartiyski and Others, cited above, \u00a7 42). Thus, applying security measures in the course of a public assembly is, on one hand, a part of the authorities\u2019 positive obligations to ensure the peaceful conduct of the assembly and the safety of all citizens, but, on the other hand, it also constitutes a restriction on the exercise of the right to freedom of assembly (see Frumkin v. Russia, no. 74568/12, \u00a7 102, 5\u00a0January 2016).",

This provision is formulated in general terms and gives no indication of the circumstances in which the police may use the power conferred on them. In particular, there is no requirement that the security measures in question be considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, and therefore no requirement for any assessment of the proportionality of the measure. In the Court\u2019s view, there is a risk of arbitrariness in the grant of such a broad discretion to the police (see, for similar reasoning, Singartiyski and Others, cited above, \u00a7 45; and, mutatis mutandis, Gillan and Quinton, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 80 and 85).",

The Court agrees with the applicants that the combination of the above measures resulted in creating a shielded enclosure where a small group of people were allowed to express their protest surrounded by the police and hidden from public view. The participants\u2019 ability to communicate the message which they sought to convey was thereby seriously undermined and the impact of the assembly was significantly muted.",

If the authorities had indeed had sufficiently serious and credible information about a security risk, that information would have required reinforced security measures during all public events held at the time. However, as submitted by the applicant and not contradicted by the Government, no security measures were taken by the police during other public events held at the same period of time, including at an official public event held at the same location only five days after the applicants\u2019 meeting (see paragraphs 175 and 385 above). These elements \u2013 the lack of evidence capable of substantiating the reality and seriousness of the alleged security risk, viewed in the light of the fact that security measures had been adopted solely during the applicants\u2019 opposition meeting, whereas no such measures had been taken during the official public events \u2013 lead the Court to the conclusion that, in adopting the exceptionally drastic security measures during the applicants\u2019 meeting, the domestic authorities acted in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner (see, for similar reasoning, Makhmudov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a069-73).",

That ground was not however relied on in the domestic proceedings or in the proceedings before the Court. As claimed by the applicants, and not contested by the Government, the venue in question was able to accommodate up to 800\u00a0people. It is clear from the photographs submitted by the applicants that the venue was far from crowded and there was enough space to accommodate more participants. Indeed, the only ground relied on to stop admission of new participants was the fact that the number of participants mentioned in the notification had been reached. Neither the Government nor the domestic courts relied on any legal provision allowing the authorities to stop admitting participants to a public event on that ground. The court is therefore not convinced that that measure was in accordance with the law.",

Furthermore, the list of exceptions to the right to liberty secured in Article 5 \u00a7 1 is an exhaustive one, and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty (see Giulia Manzoni v.

The Court considered that the issue to be addressed by it was not whether the amended 2008 supervisory-review procedure was compatible as such with the Convention, but whether the procedure, as applied in the circumstances of particular cases, resulted in a violation of the requirement of legal certainty (see Trapeznikov and Others v.
