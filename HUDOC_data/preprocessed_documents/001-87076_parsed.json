However, in the Government\u2019s view, such an approach created confusion. If the sum awarded by a court was a pensioner\u2019s \u201cpossession\u201d, it should not be affected by any subsequent increase in pension rates. Therefore, in Pravednaya the applicant would have had to return the money she had already received from the Pension Fund by virtue of the more recent changes in the legislation on State pensions.

The Court notes that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article\u00a06 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no.\u00a053431/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23 October 2003). The Court finds that this principle applies as well in the present case, having regard to the violations found (see. Poznakhirina v. , no. 25964/02, \u00a7\u00a033, 24\u00a0February 2005). The applicant was prevented from receiving money she had legitimately expected to receive under the judgment of 11 August 1999. In this connection, the Court notes that in accordance with the judgment of 11 August 1999, as upheld on 16 September 1999, the applicant was entitled to a pension calculated with an IPC of 0.7 until an increased IPC was introduced under the Russian pension legislation. The applicant did not provide any explanation as to her method of the calculation of the pecuniary damage. The Court therefore accepts the Government\u2019s calculation of the pension to which the applicant was entitled in accordance with the judgment of 11 August 1999 and awards the applicant 70 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage.",
