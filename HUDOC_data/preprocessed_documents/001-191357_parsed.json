He argued, in particular, that he had not been the instigator of the fight and it had been F.A. who had punched him first (see paragraphs 22 and 25 above). In order to prove his own version of the impugned events the applicant applied to have the trial court examined the video recording of the incident. In the Court\u2019s view, having regard to its probative value to support the applicant\u2019s line of defence, his application to have this evidence examined by the courts does not appear to have been vexatious or unreasonable. However, as alleged by the applicant and not disputed by the Government, his motion was denied. Furthermore, it is clear from the transcript of the appeal hearing that the applicant reiterated his motion before the appellate court but to no avail as the latter dismissed it as being unfounded (see paragraph 26 above).",

As it appears from the case-file, the first-instance court was silent as regards the video recording whereas the appellate court merely held that the applicant\u2019s motion was unfounded without providing any explanations to that end (see paragraphs 24 and 26 above). Furthermore, the Court finds it important to stress that the present case does not concern a situation where the evidence is withheld for public interest grounds and which requires counterbalancing procedural safeguards (compare Jasper cited above \u00a7\u00a7 54-56). In the case at hand the video recording was already in public domain (see paragraph 12\u00a0above) and there was nothing on the facts of the case which precluded the domestic courts to examine it at a court hearing.",

While the applicant does not argue that he had not been able to cross-examine the witnesses in question during the trial, the Court, nonetheless, cannot ignore the fact that those witnesses testified on behalf of the prosecution. Therefore, the video recording of the incident was a crucial piece of physical evidence in the circumstances of the case and its examination by the domestic courts could have shed light, in the Court\u2019s view, on the circumstances of the incident, including the manner in which the fight between the applicant and F.A. unfolded and whether the latter, as argued by the applicant throughout the whole trial, bore responsibility for the incident.",
