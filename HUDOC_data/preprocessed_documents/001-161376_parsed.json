Whereas the provision of four square metres remains the desirable standard of multiple-occupancy accommodation, the Court recalls that where the applicants have at their disposal less than three square metres of floor surface, the overcrowding must, in general, be considered to be so severe as to justify a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see Ananyev and others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 144-45, with further references).

The fact that he had to share overcrowded wards for more than ten months with a large number of sick and occasionally infected inmates with minimal distance separating their sleeping places is a further indication of degrading treatment exceeding the minimum threshold of severity under Article 3 of the Convention. The Court has previously found that lengthy detention of an ailing applicant in cramped conditions without a minimum level of privacy amounts to inhuman treatment (see Reshetnyak, cited above, \u00a7 97).",

Russia [GC], no.\u00a041418/04, \u00a7\u00a7 106 and 116, ECHR 2015, with further references). The Court further recalls that an interference with a prisoner\u2019s right to respect for his family life does not need to amount to an outright ban on family visits, but can consist in various other measures taken by the prison authorities. The Court has thus frequently found that limitations on frequency and duration of family visits, supervision over those visits and subjection of a detainee to special visiting arrangements constitute an interference with the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see Ferla v. Poland, no. 55470/00, \u00a7 38, 20 May 2008, and Van der Ven v.\u00a0the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2003II).",

Therefore, what is at stake in the present case is a further financial restriction making the exercise of the applicant\u2019s statutory right to a long-term family visit conditional on his ability to pay for it. The Court considers that, as this measure caused the applicant to reduce the duration of an authorised family visit, it amounted to an interference with his right to respect for his family life, which gives rise to a breach of Article 8 of the Convention unless it can be shown that it was \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, pursued one or more legitimate aims as defined in Article 8 \u00a7 2 and was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d to achieve those aims.",

The Ministry-approved Internal Regulations of Correctional Facilities allow for charging prisoners or their family members only for \u201cadditional services\u201d during family visits (see paragraph 20 above). It is also noteworthy that the director of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences pointed out to the head of the medical facility that the practice of charging inmates for using visiting rooms was contrary to the Code on the Execution of Sentences (see paragraph 13 above). The cost of providing the detainees with acceptable conditions for meeting their families was therefore to be met by the prison authorities rather than the detainees or their families.",

As there was no basis in Russian law for shifting the cost of basic services onto visiting family members, the restriction in question appears to have been an unauthorised initiative by the medical facility authorities. The Court also observes in this respect that the visiting fees were abolished shortly after the applicant\u2019s daughters\u2019 first visit, because the applicant was able to have another family visit several months later, this time free of charge (see paragraph 15 above).",
