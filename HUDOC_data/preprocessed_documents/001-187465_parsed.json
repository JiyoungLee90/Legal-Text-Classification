Croatia [GC], no. , \u00a7 104, 20 October 2016). In particular, when the personal space available to a detainee falls below 3\u00a0sq.\u00a0m of floor surface in multi-occupancy accommodation in prisons, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 arises. The burden of proof is on the respondent Government which could, however, rebut that presumption by demonstrating that there were factors capable of adequately compensating for the scarce allocation of personal space (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 126-128 and 137).",
