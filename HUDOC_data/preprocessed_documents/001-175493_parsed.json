The applicant claimed that he had successfully completed psychotherapy, which he considered as sufficient preparation for life outside of prison. He emphasised that he was willing to be treated, but that currently he was not receiving any therapy. Moreover, he reminded the court that his lawyer would be able to supply a flat and a job for him if he were released.

The latter had come to the conclusion that the applicant still suffered from a pronounced combined personality disorder with paranoid, schizoid, emotionally unstable and narcissistic elements. Dr B. responded to the generally positive tenor of Dr L.\u2019s opinion and found that the stabilisation process was rather a reaction to the \u201cenemy\u201d institution, namely the prison, in which the applicant was being held, and was not to be considered real or rendering the applicant capable of surviving the challenges of daily life outside prison. Moreover, at that time, Dr B. did not recommend further therapy for the applicant, who was not prepared for any self-reflection and was not ready to process the experiences and challenges of normal social interaction, and thus was still likely to present a danger to others. The director of Stein Prison also recommended the continuation of the applicant\u2019s detention, adding that his institution was not equipped to deal with the preparation of his release, which it considered to be a complex and risk-prone task. Only the Vienna-Mittersteig Prison was capable of preparing the applicant for his release. The applicant in any event refused to undergo any more therapy.",

The Regional Court further referred to the reasoning in previous review decisions to avoid repetition, in particular the one by the Court of Appeal of 26 July 2010 (see paragraph 19 above). It stressed that the applicant still refused to deal with his offences in a therapeutic setting, which in turn was a prerequisite for being granted privileges.

(see paragraph 17 above) had been wrong and the court should therefore rather rely on Dr L.\u2019s expert opinion (see paragraphs 13-16 above). As the applicant refused to be examined by any expert, the court held another hearing on 23\u00a0April 2012. On that occasion, the presiding judge reproached the applicant with the fact that he could not expect to be granted privileges if he did not collaborate with the experts and the authorities. The applicant replied that previously one of the experts had found that privileges were a prerequisite for his release, and that another expert had even come to the conclusion that he could already be released. He explained that he had refused to be examined by a psychiatrist because he was not suffering from a mental illness. The applicant repeated that his lawyer had offered him a small apartment and work in his law firm. He was not willing to live in an assisted-living facility or to follow psychotherapy after his eventual release, but would agree to work with a probation officer.",

Only a narrow interpretation of the exhaustive list of permissible grounds for deprivation of liberty is consistent with the aim of Article 5, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty (see, among many others, Winterwerp v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, 24 October 1979, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 33; and Shimovolos v.

An individual cannot be deprived of his liberty as being of \u201cunsound mind\u201d unless the following three minimum conditions are satisfied: firstly, he must reliably be shown to be of unsound mind, that is, a true mental disorder must be established before a competent authority on the basis of objective medical expertise; secondly, the mental disorder must be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement; thirdly, the validity of continued confinement depends upon the persistence of such a disorder (see Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7 39, and Stanev v.

Italy, 23\u00a0February 1984, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 75, and B v. Germany, no.\u00a061272/09, \u00a7 68, 19\u00a0April 2012).",

Moreover, when dealing with mentally ill offenders, the authorities are under an obligation to work towards the goal of preparing the person concerned for their release, for example by providing incentives for further therapy such as the transfer to an institution where they can actually receive the necessary treatment, or by granting certain privileges, if the situation so allows (compare and contrast Rangelov, \u00a7 98 in fine, cited above).",

In taking such a decision, it must consider whether such a transfer is necessary for the individual concerned in order to reach the purpose of the detention. In the applicant\u2019s case, it was clear from the domestic courts\u2019 review decisions that being prepared for his release was a prerequisite for them granting his requests for release. It appears that he had already received such preparation prior to 2008, when he was transferred to Stein Prison. However, it seems that this preparation had not been considered sufficient by the domestic authorities, as the applicant\u2019s detention continued. It was not contested that Vienna-Mittersteig Prison was the only institution where the applicant could adequately be prepared for his release (see paragraphs 14, 17 and 19 above).",

Later, in its decision of 7 December 2010, the Regional Court stated that the Vienna-Mittersteig Prison had not responded to a request to accept the applicant\u2019s transfer. It appears that the obvious necessity for the applicant\u2019s transfer had not been followed up thereafter. The courts mentioned it in their review proceedings, but did not consider that it was a prerequisite for his release, and in this context did not examine the question of whether the applicant was detained in an appropriate institution. In the course of the 2013 review proceedings, the applicant was still detained in Stein Prison.

For the same reasons as those set out above, the Court finds that the causal connection between the applicant\u2019s initial sentence and his continued detention was broken, which is why his detention following the review proceedings in question could not be justified under sub-paragraph (a) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention either.",

The Court finds that when a person has spent such a substantial amount of his lifetime in preventive detention, special diligence is required from the authorities when deciding on the continuation of his or her detention, as the longer the detention continues, the more remote the link to the initial conviction and the decision to place him or her in an institution for mentally ill offenders becomes.",

However, in the course of the 2011/12 review proceedings, when the law proscribed an expert opinion to be obtained, the applicant refused to be examined. It appears that domestic law does not provide an answer to the question whether this meant that in the following review period a new attempt had to be made to obtain an expert opinion. In the 2013 review proceedings, the Regional Court did not commission an expert, but based its decision to dismiss the applicant\u2019s application for release on \u2013 among other things \u2013 Dr B.\u2019s expert opinion of 2010, which was about three years old by that time.

The Court reiterates that Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention proclaims the right to a speedy judicial decision concerning the lawfulness of detention, and to an order for release if it proved unlawful (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7 68, ECHR\u00a02000\u2011III, and Kadirzhanov and Mamashev v. Russia, nos. 42351/13 and 47823/13, \u00a7\u00a0119, 17 July 2014). Whereas the Court has held above, that Article 5 \u00a7 4 is applicable in this case, it reiterates that Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention. However, where domestic law provides for an appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, for instance as concerns the speediness of the review in appeal proceedings. Accordingly, in order to determine whether the requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d has been complied with, it is necessary to effect an overall assessment where the proceedings have been conducted at more than one level of jurisdiction (see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a011364/03, \u00a7 106, 9 July 2009). At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to proceedings before an appellate court (see Lebedev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 96, 25 October 2007).",

What is taken into account is the diligence shown by the authorities, the delay attributable to the applicant, and any factors causing delay for which the State cannot be held responsible, such as the complexity of a case (see, mutatis mutandis, Jablonski\u00a0v.\u00a0Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7\u00a7 91-94, 21 December 2000). The Court must also examine whether any new relevant factors that have arisen in the interval between periodic reviews have been assessed, without unreasonable delay, by a court having jurisdiction to decide whether or not the detention has become \u201cunlawful\u201d in the light of these new factors (see Abdulkhakov v. Russia, no. 14743/11, \u00a7 215, 2\u00a0October 2012).",

The requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 as to what may be considered a \u201creasonable\u201d interval in the context of periodic judicial review vary from one domain to another, depending on the type of deprivation of liberty in question (see, for a summary of the Court\u2019s case\u2011law in the context of detention for the purposes set out in sub\u2011paragraphs (a), (c), (e) and (f) of Article 5 \u00a7 1, Abdulkhakov v.

It is noted in that context that under domestic law, it was a legal requirement to hold an oral hearing in the course of those review proceedings (see paragraph 39 above). The Regional Court then appointed an expert to draw up an opinion. However, the applicant refused to be examined by the expert. The Regional Court therefore held another hearing and finally dismissed the applicant\u2019s application for release on 23 April 2012. It is not evident from the documents at hand why the Regional Court did not decide more promptly on the applicant\u2019s application, given that it was clear that it would not have to wait for a psychiatric expert opinion, and also given that the applicant had lodged his application in September of the previous year. The Court of Appeal did not dismiss the applicant\u2019s appeal against that decision until 30 July 2012, more than four months later, giving barely any reasoning of its own, but referring largely to its decisions in previous review proceedings (see paragraph 26 above). There is therefore no indication from the documents at hand as to why the 2011/12 review period took almost eleven months.
