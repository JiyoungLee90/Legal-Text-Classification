The case originated in two applications (nos. 35365/12 and 69125/12) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Nikolay Ivanov Shahanov, and an Australian national, Mr Jock Palfreeman (“the applicants”), on 1 June and 3 October 2012 respectively.
Mr Shahanov was represented by Ms S. Stefanova and Mr M. Ekimdzhiev, lawyers practising in Plovdiv. Mr Palfreeman was represented by Mr K. Kanev, chairman of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, a non-governmental organisation based in Sofia. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms L. Gyurova and Mr V. Obretenov, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicants alleged, in particular, that disciplinary punishments imposed on them by the prison authorities in response to complaints that they had made in relation to prison officers had unjustifiably interfered with the exercise of their right to freedom of expression. Mr Shahanov also alleged that the prison authorities routinely opened and read his correspondence.
On 25 November 2013 the Government were given notice of the complaints concerning the interferences with the applicants’ right to freedom of expression and the complaint concerning the alleged monitoring of Mr Shahanov’s correspondence. The remainder of the two applications was declared inadmissible under Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
Mr Yonko Grozev, the judge elected in respect of Bulgaria, withdrew from sitting in the two cases. Accordingly, the President of the Section selected Ms Pavlina Panova as ad hoc judge (Article 26 § 4 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court).
Mr Shahanov, who was born in 1977, is serving a life sentence in Plovdiv Prison.
Mr Palfreeman, who was born in 1986, is serving a sentence of twenty years’ imprisonment in Sofia Prison.
In 2011, when serving his sentence in Plovdiv Prison, Mr Shahanov was sharing a cell with eight other inmates. On 24 October 2011 he made two complaints to the Minister of Justice: one written by him personally and one written on his behalf by his wife. In the complaints he stated, inter alia, that another inmate in his ward, X, was bragging that two prison officers, Y and Z, were relatives of his; was threatening and intimidating the other inmates and fomenting intrigues and tension among them; was often making unwarranted complaints to get special attention and treatment; and was planning to escape from prison with the help of his relatives. Mr Shahanov requested that steps be taken to move X to a prison where he did not have relatives.
An inquiry was opened pursuant to Mr Shahanov’s complaints, and written statements were taken from X, other inmates, Y, Z, and other prison officers.
In a letter of 28 November 2011, the head of the Chief Directorate for the Execution of Sentences informed the governor of Plovdiv Prison that the inquiry had not found familial relationships or improper contacts between X and any of the prison officers, or a risk for Mr Shahanov. The letter went on to say that the governor should advise all inmates that making defamatory statements about, or false allegations against, prison officers was a disciplinary offence under section 100(2)(7) of the Execution of Sentences and Pre-Trial Detention Act 2009 (see paragraph 27 below).
The next day, 29 November 2011, the governor of Plovdiv Prison ordered that Mr Shahanov be placed in solitary confinement for ten days for making defamatory statements and false allegations against prison officers, contrary to the above-mentioned provision.
On 30 November 2011 Mr Shahanov sought judicial review of the order.
The Plovdiv District Court heard Mr Shahanov’s claim on 2 December 2011 and, in a final decision of the same date (опр. oт 02.12.2011 г. по ч. н. д. № 8203/2011 г., РС-Пловдив), upheld the order. It held that it was lawful and that, in view of the results of the inquiry carried out pursuant to Mr Shahanov’s complaints and the evidence gathered in the proceedings before it, the prison governor had been correct to find that Mr Shahanov had made defamatory statements and false allegations against prison officers. The court went on to say that the punishment matched the seriousness of the offence.
Mr Shahanov asserted that his correspondence was routinely opened and read by the prison authorities. In support of his assertion, he submitted seven letters sent in 2012, six of which were addressed to his counsel, whose envelopes bore the stamp “checked” on their backs. For their part, the Government submitted a letter from the administration of Plovdiv Prison according to which Mr Shahanov’s correspondence was being controlled in the manner envisaged in the applicable regulations, which meant that the prison authorities only checked the physical content of the letters, not their text. All letters were sealed and opened by a prison officer in front of the prisoner. The stamp “checked” affixed on the back of an envelope only meant that the letter had been physically inspected for the presence of prohibited items.
On 23 May 2012 Mr Palfreeman was visited by two journalists. At the same time, a fellow inmate of Israeli nationality also had a visitor. After the visits, Mr Palfreeman learned that his visitors had been treated rudely, and that his fellow inmate’s visitor had had personal items stolen from lockers in the prison where he had left them during the visit.
The next day, 24 May 2012, with the help of another inmate who knew Bulgarian, Mr Palfreeman wrote the following complaint to the governor of Sofia Prison:
“On 23 May 2012, during the midday visit, personal items of visitors were stolen from the visitors’ lockers, which are only accessible to the guards. The stolen items are a mobile telephone case, MP3 headphones, a mobile telephone battery, and a sum of money. Also, the guards behaved very rudely and coarsely with the visitors, yelling at them and insulting them for no reason. Could you please carry out an inquiry into the conduct of that shift, and take measures to ensure that the guards work in a disciplined way and with respect towards inmates and others.”
Disciplinary proceedings were opened against Mr Palfreeman in relation to that complaint. On 11 June 2012 a hearing took place before the prison’s disciplinary commission.
In an order of 12 June 2012, the governor of Sofia Prison noted that an inquiry carried out pursuant to Mr Palfreeman’s complaint had shown that the two persons who had visited him had not left any items in the visitors’ lockers, and had not made any complaints about missing items on their way out of the prison. There was no evidence that they had been treated rudely by prison staff either. By making allegations to that effect, Mr Palfreeman had therefore acted contrary to section 100(2)(7) of the Execution of Sentences and Pre-Trial Detention Act 2009 (see paragraph 27 below). The nature and the gravity of the offence, Mr Palfreeman’s attitude towards his act, and his overall conduct and state of health militated in favour of punishing him with three months’ deprivation of the right to receive food parcels from outside prison.
Mr Palfreeman appealed to the head of the Chief Directorate for the Execution of Sentences and sought judicial review. He argued, inter alia, that his disciplinary punishment was in breach of section 90(5) of the 2009 Act (see paragraph 25 below) and this Court’s case-law, that deprivation of the right to receive food parcels was a serious sanction in view of the insufficient quantity of food provided by the prison, and that it was an attempt to cow him into not making complaints against the prison administration.
On 14 August 2012 the head of the Chief Directorate for the Execution of Sentences dismissed the appeal. Noting that the inquiry into Mr Palfreeman’s allegations had not confirmed any of them, he found that, by deliberately making false allegations, the applicant had committed the disciplinary offence under section 100(2)(7) of the 2009 Act. The sanction fully corresponded to the nature and the gravity of his act, his attitude towards it, and his previous conduct.
In a final decision of 19 July 2012 (опр. от 19.07.2012 г. по н. ч. д. № 13436/2012 г., СРС), the Sofia District Court held that it could not deal with Mr Palfreeman’s claim for judicial review, as only orders imposing solitary confinement were amenable to such review. All other types of disciplinary punishments were only subject to appeal before the head of the Chief Directorate for the Execution of Sentences (see paragraphs 30-32 below).
Article 45 of the Constitution of 1991 provides that the citizens have the right to make complaints, proposals and petitions to the authorities.
Article 39 § 1 of the Constitution provides that everyone is entitled to express an opinion and publicise it through words, whether written or oral, sounds or images, or in any other way. By Article 39 § 2, that right cannot be exercised to the detriment of the rights or reputation of others.
Article 41 § 1 of the Constitution provides that everyone has the right to impart information, but that the exercise of that right may not be directed against the rights or the good name of others.
Section 90(5) (at the relevant time; now, following an amendment that came into force on 1 January 2013, section 90(6)) of the Execution of Sentences and Pre-Trial Detention Act 2009 provided that prisoners could not bear disciplinary liability for making requests or complaints.
In April 2014 the head of the Chief Directorate for the Execution of Sentences relied on that provision to set aside an order imposing a disciplinary punishment on a prisoner for making a petition to the Minister of Justice. The prisoner then brought a claim for non-pecuniary damages under section 1(1) of the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act 1988 (see paragraphs 33 and 35 below) in relation to that. The claim was dismissed by the administrative courts on the basis that even though the order imposing the disciplinary punishment had been set aside as unlawful, the prisoner had failed to prove that he had suffered pain, medical problems or special humiliation as a result of it (see реш. № 114 от 31.12.2014 г. по адм. д. № 102/2014 г., АС-Ловеч, upheld by реш. № 428 от 14.01.2016 г. по адм. д. № 2026/2015 г., ВАС, III о.).
By section 100(2)(7) of the 2009 Act, as in force between June 2009 and the end of 2012, it was a disciplinary offence for a prisoner to make defamatory statements or false allegations against prison officers or other inmates.
In April 2012 the Government brought before Parliament a bill for the amendment of the 2009 Act. Paragraph 33 of the bill proposed to add, at the end of section 100(2)(7), wording making it a disciplinary offence for a prisoner to make threats of physical violence. When Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee considered the bill between its first and second reading, it proposed to delete the text concerning defamatory statements and false allegations, and only leave the text relating to physical violence and threats of such violence. At the second reading of the bill on 19 December 2012, Parliament adopted the amended proposal without any debate. The amendments were published in the State Gazette on 28 December 2012 and came into effect on 1 January 2013. Section 100(2)(7) now provides that it is a disciplinary offence to use physical violence against fellow inmates or prison officers, or make threats of such violence.
By section 101 of the 2009 Act, the disciplinary punishments that can be imposed on prisoners, then as now, are: (a) written reprimand; (b) extra duties in maintaining cleanliness and hygiene for up to seven days; (c) cancellation of a reward (such as extra visiting time or home leave) that has not been used; (d) prohibition to take part in collective events; (e) deprivation of the right to receive food parcels for up to three months; (f) deprivation of home leave for up to three months; (g) confinement to a disciplinary cell for an uninterrupted period of up to fourteen days; and (h) confinement to a disciplinary cell during work-free or education-free hours or work-free days or holidays, for a total period of up to fourteen days.
By section 110(1) of the 2009 Act, all orders whereby prison governors impose disciplinary punishments on prisoners are amenable to appeal before the head of the Chief Directorate for the Execution of Sentences. Appeals do not have automatic suspensive effect, but the head of the Directorate may stay the execution of the punishment (section 110(2)).
The courts have consistently held that, even though the Act does not contain a clause expressly excluding judicial review, neither the order imposing a disciplinary punishment nor the decision of the head of the Directorate to uphold that order are subject to such review (see, among other authorities, опр. № 2558 от 25.11.2010 г. по н. а. х. д. № 6300/2010 г., РС-Варна; опр. № 3744 от 20.08.2012 г. по адм. д. № 7633/2012 г., АС-София, upheld by опр. № 992 от 22.01.2013 г. по адм. д. № 12518/2012 г., ВАС, V о.; опр. № 342 от 21.01.2015 г. по адм. д. № 5247/2014 г., АС-София; and опр. № 3401 от 23.06.2015 г. по адм. д. № 5604/2015 г., АС-София).
By section 111(1) of the Act, orders imposing solitary confinement are subject to review by the territorially competent district court. An amendment to section 111(4) that came into force in the beginning of 2013 made it clear that claims for judicial review do not have automatic suspensive effect, a point which had previously been unclear. The court may however stay the execution of the punishment (section 111(4), as in force since 1 January 2013). The court’s decision is final (section 111(4), as worded before the end of 2012, and new section 111(5), in force since 1 January 2013).
Section 1(1) of the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act 1988 provides that the State is liable for damage suffered by individuals or legal persons as a result of unlawful decisions, acts or omissions by civil servants, committed in the course of or in connection with administrative action. By Article 204 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006, a claim relating to damage allegedly caused by an unlawful decision can only be made if that decision has been duly set aside. Article 204 § 4 of the Code provides that if the claim relates to an unlawful act or omission, its unlawfulness may be established, as a preliminary point, by the court hearing the claim of damages.
In two cases in 2011 and 2014, joint panels of the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation held that claims for damages by prisoners with respect to disciplinary punishments fell to be examined by the civil courts under the general law of tort rather than by the administrative courts under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act (see опр. № 96 от 02.12.2011 г. по адм. д. № 82/2011 г., ВКС и ВАС, см. петчл. с-в, and опр. № 1 от 08.01.2014 г. по ч. гр. д. № 39/2013 г., ВКС и ВАС, см. петчл. с-в). However, in a binding interpretative decision of 19 May 2015, the Plenaries of the Civil Chambers of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the First and Second Sections of the Supreme Administrative Court, sitting jointly, held, inter alia, that all claims for damages relating to actions, omissions or decisions of the prison authorities were under the jurisdiction of the administrative courts and fell to be examined under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act (see тълк. пост. № 2/2015 г. от 19.05.2015 г., ВКС, ГК, и ВАС, I и II К., тълк. д. № 2/2014 г., ВКС).
In many cases finally disposed of before or after that interpretative decision, the administrative courts examined claims for damages by prisoners in relation to disciplinary punishments under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act (see, among others, реш. № 114 от 31.12.2014 г. по адм. д. № 102/2014 г., АС-Ловеч, upheld by реш. № 428 от 14.01.2016 г. по адм. д. № 2026/2015 г., ВАС, III о.; реш. № 7245 от 29.05.2014 г. по адм. д. № 13900/2013 г., ВАС, III о.; and реш. № 5318 от 04.08.2014 г. по адм. д. № 2590/2013 г., АС-София-град, upheld by реш. № 13437 от 10.12.2015 г. по адм. д. № 13556/2014 г., ВАС, III о.).
Those courts have consistently held that such claims can only be allowed if the disciplinary punishment in relation to which damages are sought has already been set aside by the competent district court or by the Chief Directorate for the Execution of Sentences (see the decisions cited in the previous paragraph, as well as опр. № 17175 от 19.12.2013 г. по адм. д. № 16006/2013 г., ВАС, IV о.; реш. № 6165 от 09.05.2014 г. по адм. д. № 13064/2013 г., ВАС, III о.; опр. № 6454 от 02.06.2015 г. по адм. д. № 1953/2015 г., ВАС, I о.; and опр. № 3982 от 06.04.2016 г. по адм. д. № 3175/2016 г., ВАС, VIII о.).
The law relating to prisoners’ correspondence, as in force before and after a change which took place in February 2010, has been set out in the Court’s judgment in Harakchiev and Tolumov v. Bulgaria (nos. 15018/11 and 61199/12, §§ 153-56, 19 February 2013).
The European Prison Rules, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 11 January 2006 (see Recommendation Rec(2006)2 on the European Prison Rules) read, in so far as relevant:
“70.4  Prisoners shall not be punished because of having made a request or lodged a complaint.”
