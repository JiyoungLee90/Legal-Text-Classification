At the conclusion of its visit in May 2016, the Working Group on arbitrary detention stated that defenders continued to be detained under criminal or administrative charges as a way to impair the exercise of their basic human rights and fundamental freedoms and to silence them. Those practices constituted an abuse of authority and violated the rule of law that Azerbaijan had agreed to comply with. The Working Group also referred to the large number of cases of detainees who were exposed to violence, torture and illtreatment. When he visited detained defenders during his visit, the Special Rapporteur could attest to the vulnerability of their physical integrity owing to the continued reports of violence in the context of detention in the country.",

It is now equal to the minimum term of detention under the criminal code. The Human Rights Committee has held that such severity of punishment may amount to de facto criminal sanction (see CCPR/C/AZE/CO/4, para.\u00a020). Furthermore, in practice, administrative trials that result in such sentences are reportedly perfunctory, with defendants having limited access to independent counsel. Judges tend to decide on periods of detention based almost exclusively on police testimonies. The widespread nature of this type of criminalization could be seen in the documenting of at least 30 cases by civil society, in which the authorities used administrative law offences to jail human rights activists in 2016.",

As to the domestic court\u2019s decision of 24 July 2012 (see paragraph 101 above), the Court has held that a single case cited by the Government was insufficient to show the existence of settled domestic practice that would prove the effectiveness of a remedy.

Malta, nos.\u00a052160/13 and 52165/13, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, 12 January 2016). In the context of medical treatment, in order to be effective, a preventive remedy must, in particular, ensure a prompt and diligent handling of prisoners\u2019 complaints (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 214). The Court has previously expressed its concern as regards delays in the context of complaints about conditions of detention and, particularly, in respect of those concerning inadequate medical treatment, where irreparable damage may be caused over time (see Mikalauskas v. Malta, no. 4458/10, \u00a7 51, 23 July 2013). In the present case, as the Court has already noted (see paragraph 104 above), the remedy under the CAP referred to by the Government did not provide for specific time-limits and the Government did not submit sufficient information showing there was a settled domestic practice of examination of such complaints in a speedy and diligent manner in order to put an end to the treatment complained of rapidly. In the Court\u2019s view it would be contrary to the letter and spirit of Article 3 of the Convention to allow a person to languish in harsh conditions of detention awaiting the outcome of proceedings which are not bound by any time-limits in law or in practice and which may last for prolonged periods of time.",

Still, in such cases applicants must provide a detailed and consistent account of the facts complained of. Once a credible and reasonably detailed description of the allegedly degrading conditions of detention, constituting a prima facie case of ill-treatment, has been made, the burden of proof is shifted to the respondent Government, who alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. They are required, in particular, to collect and produce relevant documents and provide a detailed account of an applicant\u2019s conditions of detention.

Azerbaijan, no. 34445/04, \u00a7 52, 11 January 2007). Both Article 46 of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan and Article 3 of the Convention, which is directly applicable in the domestic legal system, prohibit inhuman and degrading treatment (ibid.). Furthermore, under the CAP, which replaced the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, an action may be brought before the courts to challenge actions of administrative organs (see Yunusova and Yunusov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09697). In particular, Articles 2 \u00a7 2 (7) and 34 \u00a7 1 of the CAP provide for the possibility to claim compensation for damage sustained as a result of unlawful actions of administrative organs. Therefore, relying on these provisions, the applicant could have lodged a lawsuit directly with the domestic courts, complaining of the alleged poor conditions of his transport to and detention in the court-house and claiming compensation for the alleged violations. However, the applicant has not attempted to do so. Moreover, he has not shown convincingly that such steps would be bound to be ineffective. Mere doubts about the effectiveness of a remedy are not sufficient to dispense with the requirement to make normal use of the available avenues for redress (see Kunqurova v. Azerbaijan (dec.), no.\u00a05117/03, 3 June 2005).",

The search and seizure order of 7 August 2014 was issued by the court following a request by the prosecution (see paragraphs 36-39 above). The court justified the search by merely referring in vague terms to the criminal investigation into \u201cbreaches of legislation discovered in the activities of a number of non-governmental organisations\u201d without asserting any specific facts related to the suspected crimes of abuse of power and forgery (see paragraph 39 above). It does not therefore appear from the court\u2019s succinct decision that it satisfied itself that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that the commission of these crimes had occurred and that the relevant evidence might be found in this regard at the premises to be searched (compare Buck v. Germany, no. 41604/98, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2005IV).",

Conversely, if the prescribed purpose was the main one, the restriction does not run counter to Article 18 even if it also pursues another purpose. Which purpose is predominant in a given case depends on all the circumstances.

The Court is also sensitive to any potential evidentiary difficulties encountered by a party.

Furthermore, the Court is struck by the arbitrary manner in which the search and seizure took place at the applicant\u2019s home and office. Notably, during the search at his office not only did the authorities seize documents related to the Association\u2019s activities, but they also took case files covered by lawyer-client confidentiality, in particular, those related to the applications pending before the Court, in disregard of legal professional privilege. In this connection, the Court reiterates that it has already concluded in the case of Annagi Hajibeyli (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 64-79) that the respondent State has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 34 of the Convention on account of the seizure from the office of the applicant in the present case of the entire case file relating to Mr Hajibeyli\u2019s pending case before the Court.",

The Court reiterates that the way in which national legislation enshrines the freedom of association and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned (see Tebieti M\u00fchafize Cemiyyeti and Israfilov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 37083/03, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2009). It goes without saying that, while the States may have legitimate reasons to monitor financial operations in accordance with international law with a view to preventing money laundering and terrorism financing, the ability of an association to receive and use funding in order to be able to promote and defend its cause constitutes an integral part of the right to freedom of association.",

Moreover, the Court cannot lose sight of the chilling effect of those measures on the civil society at large, whose members often act collectively within NGOs and who, for fear of prosecution, may be discouraged from continuing their work of promoting and defending human rights.",

The Court notes that it has already found similar violations in the cases of Ilgar Mammadov, Rasul Jafarov (both cited above), Mammadli v. Azerbaijan (no.\u00a047145/14, 19 April 2018) and Rashad Hasanov and Others v.\u00a0Azerbaijan (nos. 48653/13 and 3 others, 7 June 2018). In the latter cases the Court concluded that the actual purpose of the arrest and pre-trial detention was either to silence and punish the applicants for criticising the Government or for their active social and political engagement (see Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 143, and Rashad Hasanov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 125, respectively) or to silence and punish the applicants for their activities in the area of human rights or in the area of electoral monitoring (see Rasul Jafarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0162, and Mammadli, cited above, \u00a7 162, respectively). The Court notes with concern that the events under examination in all five of these cases cannot be considered as isolated incidents. The reasons for the above violations found are similar and interconnected. In fact, these judgments reflect a troubling pattern of arbitrary arrest and detention of government critics, civil society activists and human-rights defenders through retaliatory prosecutions and misuse of criminal law in defiance of the rule of law. This pattern of the use of arbitrary detention in retaliation for the exercise of the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and association has also been the subject of comment by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights (see paragraph\u00a0151 above) and other international human-rights organisations (see paragraphs 78-80 above).\u00a0\u00a0The Court accordingly finds that the actions of the State stemming from this pattern may give rise to further repetitive applications. Indeed, the Court cannot overlook in this regard the fact that a number of applications raising issues similar to those outlined above have either been communicated to the Azerbaijani Government or are currently pending before the Court.",

One of the fundamental components of European public order is the principle of the rule of law, and arbitrariness constitutes the negation of that principle (see Al-Dulimi and Montana Management Inc. v. Switzerland [GC], no. 5809/08, \u00a7 145, ECHR 2016). This is all the more so since the Statute of the Council of Europe, an organisation of which each of the States Parties to the Convention is a Member, refers in two places to the rule of law: first in the Preamble, where the signatory Governments affirm their devotion to this principle, and secondly in Article 3 which provides that \u201cevery Member of the Council of Europe must accept the principle of the rule of law ...\u201d (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 18).",

However, the Court considers that, having regard to the specific group of individuals affected by the above-mentioned pattern in breach of Article 18, the necessary general measures to be taken by the respondent State must focus, as a matter of priority, on the protection of critics of the government, civil society activists and human-rights defenders against arbitrary arrest and detention. The measures to be taken must ensure the eradication of retaliatory prosecutions and misuse of criminal law against this group of individuals and the nonrepetition of similar practices in the future.",
