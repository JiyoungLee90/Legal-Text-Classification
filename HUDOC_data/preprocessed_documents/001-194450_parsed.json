The court considered it established that the person in the photographs was the applicant, although he had his face partially covered. As a result, the court decided to convict him of disseminating propaganda in support of the PKK under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713. It further noted that the applicant had participated in the demonstration in question as a result of the call put out by the PKK. According to the court, although there was insufficient evidence to show that he was a member of the PKK, his participation in the demonstration showed that he had committed criminal offences on behalf of it, and therefore he should be convicted of membership of the PKK under Article\u00a0314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of Article 220 \u00a7 6 and Article\u00a0314 \u00a7 3 of the same Code. Lastly, the first-instance court noted that there was no evidence showing that the applicant had been involved in acts of violence during the demonstration of 26 October 2008, and considered that he should be acquitted of any charges relating to causing injury or damage.",

They noted that these provisions were accessible and foreseeable. They further argued that the interference in question had pursued the legitimate aims of protecting national security, territorial integrity, public safety and public order, as well as the prevention of crime. As regards the necessity of the interference, the Government contended that the applicant\u2019s criminal conviction had corresponded to a pressing social need and had been necessary in a democratic society in view of the conduct of the applicant during the demonstration of 26\u00a0October 2008, organised by the PKK. They argued that the applicant had chanted slogans in favour of the PKK, committed offences on behalf of that terrorist organisation and also been a member of the youth assembly of a subgroup of the PKK. The Government asserted that the PKK had been included on a list of terrorist organisations by a number of states and international organisations, such as the United States of America, the United Nations and NATO.",

He denied that he was the person identified as him by the domestic courts. In the alternative, he submitted that the demonstration of 26\u00a0October 2008 should be considered to be protected under Article 10 of the Convention without explicitly stating that he had participated in the demonstration in question. The Court recalls that the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible by the Court on 12\u00a0September 2013. It further notes that in his submissions dated 7 August 2018 the applicant contended that he had attended the demonstration of 26 October 2008 and exercised his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. In any case, the Court observes that the applicant\u2019s criminal conviction under Articles 220 \u00a7 6 and 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code was indisputably directed at activities falling within the scope of freedom of assembly, and that he was sanctioned for participating in the demonstration held on 26 October 2008. The Court considers that, in such circumstances, the applicant\u2019s conviction must be regarded as constituting an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to requiring him to acknowledge the acts of which he stood accused. In this respect, it should be borne in mind that the right not to incriminate oneself, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, is a generally recognised international standard which lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, M\u00fcd\u00fcr Duman v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 15450/03, \u00a7\u00a030, 6 October 2015; and also in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies, Y\u0131lmaz and K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkey, no.\u00a068514/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a039-41, 17 July 2008; and in the context of civil proceedings, Stojanovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 23160/09, \u00a7 39, 19 September 2013; and compare Kasparov and Others v. Russia, no. 21613/07, \u00a7\u00a7 72-73, 3 October 2013). Moreover, not accepting that a criminal conviction constituted an interference, on the grounds that an applicant denied any involvement in the acts at issue, would lock him in a vicious circle which would deprive him of the protection of the Convention (see M\u00fcd\u00fcr Duman, cited above, \u00a7 30). Lastly, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible. Thus, in the light of its decision of 12 September 2013, the Court must examine the case on the basis of the facts as established by the national courts. As a result, the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s criminal conviction for membership of the PKK as well as the imposition of a prison sentence upon him, constituted an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly as guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention. The Government\u2019s objection that the applicant\u2019s complaint is incompatible ratione materiae must therefore be dismissed.",

                                                "content": "46.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that it has already examined an almost identical grievance in the case of I\u015f\u0131k\u0131r\u0131k v. Turkey (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 55-70) and found a breach of Article 11 of the Convention. In that case, having examined the application of Article 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code alone and in connection with Article 220 \u00a7 6 of the same Code, the Court firstly found that when applied in connection with Article 220 \u00a7 6, the criteria for a conviction under Article 314 \u00a7 2 were extensively applied to the detriment of the applicant (ibid., \u00a7 66). It also observed that the array of acts that potentially constituted a basis for the application of a severe criminal sanction in the form of imprisonment, under Article\u00a0220 \u00a7 6 of the Criminal Code, were so vast that the wording of the provision, including its extensive interpretation by the domestic courts, did not afford a sufficient measure of protection against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities (ibid., \u00a7 67). The Court further observed that on account of Mr I\u015f\u0131k\u0131r\u0131k\u2019s conviction, for acts which fell within the scope of Article 11 of Convention, there remained no distinction between him, a peaceful demonstrator, and an individual who had committed offences within the structure of the PKK. For the Court, such an extensive interpretation of a legal norm could not be justified when it had the effect of equating mere exercise of fundamental freedoms with membership of an illegal organisation in the absence of any concrete evidence of such membership. It considered that the very essence of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and, thereby, the foundations of a democratic society, had been undermined when Mr I\u015f\u0131k\u0131r\u0131k had been held criminally liable under Articles 220 \u00a7 6 and 314 of the Criminal Code for the mere fact of attending a public meeting and expressing his views therein (ibid.,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a068). Noting that when demonstrators faced the charge of membership of an illegal armed organisation, they risked an additional sentence of between five and ten years in prison, the Court found that Article\u00a0220 \u00a7 6 of the Criminal Code would inevitably have a particularly chilling effect on those who were found criminally liable on reexercising their rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. In the Court\u2019s view, the provision in question would also have a great deal of potential to deter other members of the public from attending demonstrations and, more generally, from participating in open political debate (ibid., \u00a7 69). The Court as a result concluded that Article 220 \u00a7 6 of the Criminal Code had not been \u201cforeseeable\u201d in its application since it did not afford the applicant the legal protection against arbitrary interference with his right under Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 70).",

In the light of these circumstances, the Court finds that its considerations in the above-mentioned case of I\u015f\u0131k\u0131r\u0131k also apply in the present case and that there is nothing in the case file that would require it to reach a different conclusion from the one reached in that case.
