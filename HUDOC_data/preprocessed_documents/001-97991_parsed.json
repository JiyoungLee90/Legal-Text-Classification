However, the obligation to hold a hearing is not absolute. According to the Court's established case-law, in proceedings before a court of first and only instance the right to a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d in the sense of Article 6 \u00a7 1 entails an entitlement to an \u201coral hearing\u201d unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with such a hearing (see, for example, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v.\u00a0Sweden, 21 February 1990, \u00a7 64, Series A no. 171A; and Fredin v.\u00a0Sweden (no. 2), 23 February 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 21 to 22, Series A no. 283-A). However, the manner of application of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to proceedings before courts of appeal depends on the special features of the proceedings involved. In this respect, account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein (see Helmers v. , 29 October 1991, \u00a7 31, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0212A). Provided that a public hearing has been held at first instance, the absence of such a hearing before second or third instance courts may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Thus, leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article\u00a06, although the appellant was not given the opportunity to be heard in person by the appeal or cassation court (Helmers, cited above, \u00a7 36). The overarching principle of fairness embodied in Article 6 is, as always, the key consideration (see, mutatis mutandis, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v.\u00a0France\u00a0[GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR\u00a01999-II; and Sejdovic v.\u00a0Italy\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a056581/00, \u00a7\u00a090, ECHR 2006-...).",

It is not clear in the present case whether the report was expressly excluded from evidence by the domestic courts. However, even if the courts did refuse to consider the report, the Court recalls that questions related to the admissibility of evidence are primarily a matter for regulation under national law. The question for the Court is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair (see Bykov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a089).

In respect of such hearings, Moldovan Law stipulated that the decision whether an appeal to the Supreme Court was admissible was taken on the basis of the written submissions in the case without the parties being summoned (see paragraph 29 above). In the circumstances, the Court concludes that, having regard to the fact that the applicant had enjoyed an oral hearing at first instance (see paragraphs 8 to 10 and 14 to 15 above) and the fact that the impugned hearing was a leave-to-appeal hearing concerning an appeal on points of law only, the failure to summon the applicant to the hearing did not give rise to any violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

Emphasising the State's margin of appreciation in such matters, the Government argued that the domestic courts' finding that the impugned statements were value judgments which had a sufficient factual basis was reasonable. Further, the Government submitted that the case had to be considered within the wider context in which the statements were made and the longstanding dispute between S.N. and the applicant, which had arisen as a result of a professional disagreement but which had become a more personal disagreement with the passage of time. Finally, the Government emphasised that the article in question had been published as part of a topical political debate on questions of general interest concerning the history of , in particular regarding the content and quality of history textbooks and the assessment to be made of various historical events. The contributions made by S.N. and the applicant to the debate had provoked further contributions from others in the field. The Government contended that the applicant was a political figure well-known in the field: he had unsuccessfully stood for election to parliament in 1998 and 2001 and was from 2000 the president of the \u201cMouvement de Sauvegarde Nationale\u201d (\u201cNational Safeguard Movement\u201d). Accordingly, the opinions expressed in the context of the debate were of particular public interest. Referring to the importance of ensuring freedom of expression in the context of political debate on questions of general interest, the Government invited the Court to conclude that the applicant's complaint was inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded or, alternatively, that there had been no violation of Article\u00a08.",

In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private and family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private and family life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Odi\u00e8vre v.

The applicable principles are similar to those arising in cases involving the State's negative obligations: regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests, in this case, the applicant's right to protection of his reputation and the right of the newspaper and S.N. to freedom of expression.",

Although it must not overstep certain boundaries, in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others, its duty is nevertheless to impart \u2013 in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest. Not only does the press have the task of imparting information and ideas, the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d (see, inter alia, Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26\u00a0November 1991, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 216; Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.\u00a0Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, \u00a7 59, ECHR 1999-II; and Flux v.\u00a0Moldova (no.\u00a06), no. 22824/04, \u00a7 24, 29 July 2008). Accordingly, journalistic freedom covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Von Hannover v. , no. 59320/00, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2004VI). In this respect, it is clear from the Court's case-law that the right to freedom of expression is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d (see, inter alia, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, \u00a7\u00a049, Series\u00a0A no. 24; and Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 1999VIII). This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article\u00a010 \u00a7 2, which must, however, be construed strictly. The need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, for example, Lingens v.\u00a0, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 41, Series A no. 103; Nilsen and Johnsen, cited above, \u00a7 43; and Tammer v.

It concluded that there was no proof that any such collaboration had occurred and that, as a consequence, the article was defamatory (see paragraph 9 above). The court ordered that a retraction of certain phrases, including the phrase which indicated that the applicant had been sent for postgraduate studies for his special merit \u201cconfirming the confidence of the AUCP (b) \u2013 KGB\u201d, be published. Although the case was subsequently re-examined by the Centru District Court and appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, none of the subsequent court judgments made any findings as to whether the article should be read as implying that the applicant had collaborated with the KGB. The Court considers that the national tribunals are, in principle, better placed than an international court to assess the intention behind the impugned phrases in the article and, in particular, to judge how the general public of  would interpret, and react to, such phrases.

As such, rather than contributing to the debate, the allegation risked undermining its integrity and usefulness. The Court recalls that a person's status as a politician or other public figure does not remove the need for a sufficient factual basis for statements which damage his reputation, even where such statements are considered to be value judgments, and not statements of fact as in the present case (see Petrina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45 and 50). In this respect, the Court further recalls that, giving judgment on 30 April 2003, the Centru District Court emphasised that there was no proof that the applicant was an agent of the KGB (see paragraph 9 above). The subsequent judgments of the domestic courts did not find otherwise. The Court notes that there is no indication in the materials submitted by the parties that the applicant collaborated with the Soviet secret services. In the context of the proceedings before the Centru District Court, the defendants did not produce any material judged sufficient by that court to support the allegation and no witnesses testified that the applicant was involved in such activities. It is, in such a case, not appropriate to make reference to the margin for provocation or exaggeration permitted to newspapers generally where articles concern public figures. The present case concerned a distorted presentation of reality, for which no factual basis whatsoever had been shown by the author (see Petrina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a048 and 50). By implying that the applicant had collaborated with the KGB as though it were an established fact when it was mere speculation on the part of the author, the article overstepped the limits of acceptable comments.",

Taking into account the particular gravity of the allegation in the present case, the Court finds that the reasons advanced by the domestic tribunals to protect the newspaper and S.N.'s right to freedom of expression were insufficient to outweigh the applicant's right to respect for his reputation. There has accordingly been a violation of Article\u00a08 of the Convention.",

The Court has frequently stated that the extent of acceptable criticism and commentary is greater in respect of politicians or other public figures than in respect of private individuals (see Petrina v.\u00a0Romania, no. 78060/01, \u00a7 19, 14 October 2008, \u00a7 40). The applicant, as a participant in a public debate, should therefore be prepared for harsh, exaggerated and even unfair commentary on his past and present actions, not only in the form of so-called value judgments, but also as concerns presentation of facts. Furthermore, as an active participant in a public debate the applicant has had every opportunity to answer any insinuations which allegedly were directed at him.

In many cases in which the Court has had to balance the protection of private life against freedom of expression, it has always stressed the importance of the contribution made by articles in the press to a debate of general interest (see, among others, Tammer v.

However I disagree that they should be viewed as direct allegations of collaboration with the KGB. The KGB is mentioned twice in the article. However, nowhere is it directly alleged that the applicant collaborated with the KGB. The first statement simply implies the confidence that the AUCP (All union Communist party of Bolsheviks) and the KGB must have had in him and the second that they must have placed their faith in him. These statements do not by their wording assert that the applicant was, as a matter of fact, a KGB collaborator. At best they contain an innuendo that the applicant was well regarded by the KGB.",

It stated i.a.; \u201c... we regret the disparaging remarks and immoderate language ...\u201d. The majority has interpreted these words narrowly (see \u00a7\u00a7 62 and 67) as not referring to the contested statements, or at least not clearly enough. I disagree. Although the article does not retract specifically the remarks concerning the applicant's alleged associations with the KGB, the words \u201cdisparaging remarks\u201d are most naturally understood as including all disparaging remarks in the article, including those referring to the KGB.",

In such circumstances and particularly in the context of a political debate on matters of public interest, I do not accept that the mere suggestion that the applicant was well regarded by the KGB so increases the level of stigmatisation that it warrants sacrificing the fundamental right to press freedom for the sake of protecting his rights under Article 8.",
