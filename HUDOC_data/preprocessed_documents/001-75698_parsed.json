In any event, it had been established that Mr L.A. had died before the trial. As regards the reading of the statements of Mr Z.T. and Mr\u00a0I.Y., the court found they could not have been called at the trial because they did not have permanent places of abode and were vagrants. The subpoenas sent to the address indicated by them during the preliminary investigation had been returned with the notes that one of them was unknown at that address and the other had left that address and his current address was likewise unknown. In these circumstances, their statements had been properly read out, to which the applicant had agreed. The court further noted that the lower courts\u2019 findings of fact rested also on the applicant\u2019s statements made during the preliminary investigation and at the trial.",

On this point, the Court reiterates that the waiver of a right guaranteed by the Convention, insofar as permissible, must be established in an unequivocal manner (see BocosCuesta v. the , no. 54789/00, \u00a7 65, 10 November 2005). In the instant case, the Court notes that the applicant, who was apparently not well versed in the law, was not represented at his trial, when he consented to the reading of the statements (see paragraphs 15 and 19 above). It does not seem that he was cautioned or was aware of the consequences of this acquiescence (see paragraph 32 above).

As a rule, these rights entail an adequate and proper opportunity for the accused to challenge and question the witnesses against him, either when they make their statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Delta v. France, judgment of 19 December 1990, Series A no. 191A, p. 16, \u00a7 36; and, more recently, Mild and Virtanen v. , no. 39481/98 and 40227/98, \u00a7 42, 26 July 2005). In the event the impossibility to examine the witnesses or have them examined is due to the fact that they are missing, the authorities must make a reasonable effort to secure their presence (see Artner, p. 10, \u00a7\u00a021 in fine; Delta, p. 16, \u00a7 37, both cited above; and Rachdad v. France, no. 71846/01, \u00a7 25, 13 November 2003). Finally, the conviction must not rest solely, or in a decisive manner, on the depositions of a witness whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined either during the investigation or at trial (see Artner, p. 10, \u00a7 22; Delta, p. 16, \u00a7 37, both cited above; Isgr\u00f2 v. Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, Series A no.\u00a0194A, p. 13, \u00a7 35 in fine; Solakov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 47023/99, \u00a7 57 in fine, ECHR 2001X; and Rachdad, cited above, \u00a7 23 in fine).",

                                                "content": "44.\u00a0\u00a0The trial and the appellate courts in the case at hand based the applicant\u2019s conviction on the testimony of Mr Z.T., Mr L.A. and Mr S.V., as well as on the applicant\u2019s admissions. They did not rely on Mr I.Y.\u2019s depositions (see paragraphs 22 and 26 above). However, it was only Mr\u00a0Z.T. and Mr L.A. who had been direct eyewitnesses of the act alleged against the applicant and who could thus conclusively establish the authorship of the offence, Mr S.V.\u2019s testimony being only hearsay. It is true that the applicant also admitted to having beaten the victim and that the courts relied on that admission, but under Bulgarian law a conviction cannot rest solely on the admission of the accused (see paragraph 34 above). It is also unclear whether the applicant\u2019s avowal that he had beaten the victim amounted to an admission that he had caused his death (see paragraphs 12 and 16 above). Mr Z.T.\u2019s and Mr L.A.\u2019s statements appear to have been therefore decisive for the applicant\u2019s conviction. Mr L.A. could not be called at the trial, because he had died shortly after the opening of the preliminary investigation (see paragraph 7 above); the authorities cannot therefore be blamed for failing to ensure his presence. Mr Z.T., on the other hand, was not called at the trial or during the appeal proceedings because the courts held that it was impossible to subpoena him as he did not have a permanent place of abode (see paragraphs 19 and 25 above). However, it does not seem that any efforts were made to establish his whereabouts after it was found that he was not present at the address which he had provided during the preliminary investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Delta, p. 16, \u00a7\u00a037; and Rachdad, \u00a7 25, both cited above). While the Court is not unmindful of the difficulties encountered by the authorities in terms of resources, it does not consider that Mr Z.T.\u2019s tracking down for the purpose of calling him at the trial, in which the applicant stood accused of a very serious offence and was risking up to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 30 above), would have constituted an insuperable obstacle (see Artner, cited above, p. 10, \u00a7 21, where the Austrian police was instructed by the trial court to make every effort to find a missing witness; Berisha v. the  (dec.), no. 42965/98, 4 May 2000, where the Dutch authorities tried to call a witness residing in the Slovak Republic through the Slovak authorities; and Haas v. Germany (dec.), no. 73047/01, 17 November 2005, where the German authorities made considerable efforts to secure the attendance of a witness serving a prison sentence in Lebanon). By Article\u00a0157 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974, a witness could be brought for questioning by force even without being previously subpoenaed if he or she did not have a permanent place of abode, as in the case at hand (see paragraph 33 above). However, the authorities chose to eschew this. As a result, Mr Z.T. never appeared to testify before a court in the presence of the applicant. On the other hand, it does not appear from the materials in the case file \u2013 nor has it been argued by the Government, who were specifically asked about this \u2013 that the applicant had the opportunity to crossexamine him, or, for that matter, Mr L.A. \u2013 who had died before the applicant\u2019s arrest \u2013, at another time.",
