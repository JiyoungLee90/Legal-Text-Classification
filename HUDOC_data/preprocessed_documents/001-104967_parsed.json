The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require a departure from this case-law. In this regard, the Court has also already considered the circumstances regarding the restructuring of socially-owned companies, (see R. Ka\u010dapor and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 97 and 98, and Crni\u0161anin and Others v. , nos. 35835/05, 43548/05, 43569/05 and 36986/06, \u00a7\u00a7 101-104, 13 January 2009), and finds no reason not to apply the same approach to the same arguments in this particular context. In addition, the Court considers the present case, where the impugned claim is made in relation to the non-enforcement of a judgment rendered against a socially-owned company, to be clearly distinguishable from that of Lithgow and Others, to which the Government referred (see paragraph 69 above). However, the argument related to the applicants\u2019 participation in the redundancy programme remains to be examined separately.",

Furthermore, the Constitutional Court of Serbia, as the highest judicial authority in the State, established that mere participation in the redundancy programme could not be interpreted as giving up the rights arising from outstanding employment-related claims. That court, furthermore, found that persons in a factual situation significantly similar to that of the present applicants were entitled to enjoy rights arising from both the final judgments in their cases and the programme (see paragraph 65 above). The Government have not submitted any arguments to the contrary. Therefore, the Court concludes that the final judgments rendered in the applicants\u2019 favour continue to represent a claim within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, while the prolonged failure of the Serbian authorities to enforce those judgments cannot be seen as being in accordance with the domestic law.",

It finds no reason to depart from this approach in the present case since the debtor is comprised of State and socially-owned capital (see paragraph 62 above) and the period of non-enforcement has so far lasted between three years and eleven months and six years and seven months. The Serbian authorities have thus not taken the necessary measures to enforce the judgments in question and have not provided any convincing reasons for that failure. Accordingly, there has also been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
