However, despite the statutory wording, Polish women and girls face significant barriers when seeking these medical services in practice. Problems with effective access to legal abortion are reflected in governmental statistics on the execution of the Act: the official number of legal abortions carried out in  is very low. In 2009 there were only 538 procedures of legal abortion nationwide. In 510 of those cases the termination was caused by embryopathological factors; 27 procedures were conducted in order to protect the life and health of the pregnant woman, and only 1 abortion was carried out on grounds of the registered pregnancy having been caused by a criminal act. No comprehensive analysis has been presented to explain such a small number of abortions. The third party considers the data collected by the Government highly unreliable and doubts whether they reflect the real situation. The data should be seen against the background of police statistics to the effect that 1,816 cases of rape were reported in 2009. The low figures for lawful abortions in connection with the enforcement of the 1993 Act prove only that women find it less complicated to terminate pregnancies illegally than under the provisions of that statute.",

It has been acknowledged in the Court\u2019s case-law that the acceptance of termination of pregnancy should be left to decisions given by the democratically elected national authorities. This approach is based on the values underpinning the Convention, such as respect for individual freedom and dignity.

The legal conditions for a lawful abortion had existed in the present case and there had never been any dispute between the first applicant and the doctors whether the conditions for a legal abortion obtained.

Ireland [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0235 and 237). In the absence of such a common approach regarding the beginning of life, the examination of national legal solutions as applied to the circumstances of individual cases is of particular importance for the assessment of whether a fair balance between individual rights and the public interest has been maintained (see also, for such an approach, A, B and C v.\u00a0Ireland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0229-241).",

The Court has already found in the context of similar cases against Poland that once the State, acting within its limits of appreciation, adopts statutory regulations allowing abortion in some situations, it must not structure its legal framework in a way which would limit real possibilities to obtain an abortion. In particular, the State is under a positive obligation to create a procedural framework enabling a pregnant woman to effectively exercise her right of access to lawful abortion (Tysi\u0105c v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116124, R.R. v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0200). The legal framework devised for the purposes of the determination of the conditions for lawful abortion should be \u201cshaped in a coherent manner which allows the different legitimate interests involved to be taken into account adequately and in accordance with the obligations deriving from the Convention\u201d (A, B and C v.\u00a0 [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a0249). Whilst Article\u00a08 contains no explicit procedural requirements, it is important for the effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by that provision that the relevant decisionmaking process is fair and such as to afford due respect for the interests safeguarded by it. What has to be determined is whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, and notably the nature of the decisions to be taken, an individual has been involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide her or him with the requisite protection of their interests (see, mutatis mutandis, W. v. the United Kingdom, 8\u00a0July 1987, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a062 and\u00a064, Series A no.\u00a0121). The Court has already held that in the context of access to abortion the relevant procedure should guarantee to a pregnant woman at least the possibility to be heard in person and to have her views considered. The competent body or person should also issue written grounds for its decision (see Tysi\u0105c v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0117).",

It is of the view that legal guardianship cannot be considered to automatically confer on the parents of a minor the right to take decisions concerning the minor\u2019s reproductive choices, because proper regard must be had to the minor\u2019s personal autonomy in this sphere. This consideration applies also in a situation where abortion is envisaged as a possible option. However, it cannot be overlooked that the interests and life prospects of the mother of a pregnant minor girl are also involved in the decision whether to carry the pregnancy to term or not. Likewise, it can be reasonably expected that the emotional family bond makes it natural for the mother to feel deeply concerned by issues arising out of reproductive dilemmas and choices to be made by the daughter. Hence, the difference in the situation of a pregnant minor and that of her parents does not obviate the need for a procedure for the determination of access to a lawful abortion whereby both parties can be heard and their views fully and objectively considered, including, if necessary, the provision of a mechanism for counselling and reconciling conflicting views in favour of the best interest of the minor. It has not been shown that the legal setting in  allowed for the second applicant\u2019s concerns to be properly addressed in a way that would respect her views and attitudes and to balance them in a fair and respectful manner against the interests of her pregnant daughter in the determination of such access.",

The applicants tried to have the persons they believed to be guilty of criminal conduct towards them identified and punished. The authorities found that the persons concerned had no case to answer.

It has not been argued, let alone shown, that in the present case there were any exceptional circumstances of such a character as to justify public interest in the first applicant\u2019s health (compare and contrast, Editions Plon v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a058148/00, ECHR 2004IV, mutatis mutandis, where the Court held that a permanent ban on distribution of a book disclosing health information about a public person was not necessary in a democratic society). The Court fails to see how the disclosure of information about the first applicant\u2019s unwanted pregnancy and about the refusal to carry out an abortion could be justified by media interest in the case. In the Court\u2019s view it cannot be regarded as compatible either with the Convention standards as to the State\u2019s obligation to secure respect for one\u2019s private or family life, or with the obligations of the medical staff to respect patients\u2019 rights laid down by Polish law. It did not therefore pursue a legitimate aim. That of itself is sufficient to ground a breach of Article\u00a08 of the Convention.",

However, no provision of domestic law has been cited on the basis of which information about individual patients\u2019 health issues, even non-nominate information, could be disclosed to the general public by way of a press release.

It was therefore legitimate to try to establish with certainty whether the first applicant had had an opportunity to reach a free and wellinformed decision about having recourse to abortion. However, the essential purpose of the decision on the first applicant\u2019s placement was to separate her from her parents, in particular from the second applicant, and to prevent the abortion. The Court is of the view that by no stretch of the imagination can the detention be considered to have been ordered for educational supervision within the meaning of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (d) of the Convention if its essential purpose was to prevent a minor from having recourse to abortion. Furthermore, the Court is of the opinion that if the authorities were concerned that an abortion would be carried out against the first applicant\u2019s will, less drastic measures than locking up a 14year old girl in a situation of considerable vulnerability should have at least been considered by the courts.

Poland (no.\u00a027617/04, 26\u00a0May 2011). Neither the Convention generally nor Article 8 in particular confer a right to abortion. The issue was in this case \u2013 as it was in many other cases \u2013 one of regulatory frameworks and procedural mechanisms: in essence, how to enforce a \u201cright\u201d granted by domestic law in the face of opposition, direct or oblique, from public authorities. The issue should therefore have been examined under Article\u00a06. Invoking Article 8 in such cases not only distorts the true meaning of \u201cprivate life\u201d, but ignores the most fundamental of values underpinning the Convention, namely the value of life, of which the unborn child is the carrier. Calling the unborn child a foetus does not change the essential nature of what is at stake and of what an abortion entails.",

Such advice, however, should never have been allowed to degenerate, as happened in the instant case, into trickery, deceit and the emotional manipulation of a vulnerable person, which constitute an abuse of the dignity of the person. While the reluctance, indeed refusal, of some of the doctors to perform the abortion was understandable and was within their right to conscientious objection, the authorities\u2019 overall handling of the case was at best shambolic and at worst disgraceful. The violation of Article\u00a03 stems not from the simple fact that some people (including the priest) tried to persuade the first applicant not to have an abortion but because of the way they went about it, coupled with the publicity that was given by the authorities to the case, their disclosure of confidential information and their illegal arrest of the first applicant. Indeed, instead of being treated as a victim of rape and as person in need of help, she was treated as a criminal. Her parents fared only slightly better.",
