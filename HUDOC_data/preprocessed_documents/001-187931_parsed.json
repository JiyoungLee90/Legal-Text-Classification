A sudden change in their life would cause them more distress. Based on the conclusions of the expert report of 17 November 2015 (see paragraph 22 above), the court noted that the children felt uncomfortable in their mother\u2019s presence and refused to move in with her, preferring their father\u2019s presence. The court also noted that the first applicant had never been prevented from visiting them, but had chosen not to and had instead demanded that the children be returned to Bucharest. The court further observed that the first applicant had not sought enforcement of the custody order, limiting her request to the enforcement of the child-support allowance and costs.

In so doing, it is not for the Court to substitute itself for the competent domestic authorities in regulating the dispute between the individuals involved, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions that those authorities have taken in the exercise of their power of appreciation. The Court must examine whether the reasons purporting to justify any measures taken are relevant and sufficient and, regard being had to the State\u2019s margin of appreciation, whether a fair balance was struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community, including other concerned third parties (see Mihailova, cited above, \u00a7 83). In the balancing process, particular importance should be attached to the best interests of the child, which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parents (Sahin v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a030943/96, \u00a7 66, ECHR 2003VIII).

The authorities\u2019 duty to take measures to facilitate reunion is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with children who have lived for some time with the other parent may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures to be taken (see Nuutinen, cited above, \u00a7 128). The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and cooperation of all concerned is always an important ingredient. Whilst national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such cooperation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see Mihailova, cited above, \u00a7 82 in fine). As the Court has previously held, although coercive measures against the children are not desirable in this sensitive area, the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the children live (see Eberhard and M., cited above, \u00a7\u00a0130, and Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7 106). Even if it is possible that more severe sanctions would not have changed that parent\u2019s general stance, this did not exempt the domestic authorities from their obligation to take all appropriate steps to facilitate contact (see, mutatis mutandis, Kuppinger v.\u00a0Germany, no. 62198/11, \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 107, 15 January 2015).",

The right of a child to express his or her own views should not be interpreted as effectively giving an unconditional veto power to children without any other factors being considered and an examination being carried out to determine their best interests; such interests normally dictate that the child\u2019s ties with its family must be maintained, except in cases where this would harm the child\u2019s health and development (see Raw and Others v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a010131/11, \u00a7 94, 7 March 2013).",

It is also undisputed that the measures that were taken did not lead to effective reunion. The first applicant has been unable to live with the children since November 2013 (see paragraph 5 above) when their father took them away.

In the final decision of 24\u00a0April\u00a02018, the Bucharest County Court reaffirmed her right to have the children live with her and reiterated that the authorities had an obligation to urgently take all necessary legal measures to ensure that the children were returned to their mother\u2019s home (see paragraph 36 above).",

Be that as it may, the Court reiterates that the lack of cooperation between the parents does not dispense the authorities from taking all the measures which may contribute to maintaining or restoring the family ties (see Nicol\u00f2 Santilli v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a051930/10, \u00a7 73, 17 December 2013, with further references).",

More concretely, on two occasions the first applicant alerted the Bucharest child protection authority to her difficulties in reaching her children, but the authority was unable to act as R. had not been at home when its representatives had tried to visit (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above). There is no indication that the representatives went beyond simply trying to visit R. at his home, or that they put in place a mechanism of penalising him for his obstructive attitude. On this point, the Court acknowledges the first applicant\u2019s unrelenting efforts to have the custody orders enforced (see paragraph 31 above) and to protect her children from their father\u2019s influence, including by alerting the child protection authority and the prosecutor\u2019s office to his behaviour (see, for example, paragraphs 22, 24 and 33 above).",
