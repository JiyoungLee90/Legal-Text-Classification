The court ordered the commander of the military unit concerned to pay the applicant remuneration for his participation in the military operations between 24 March and 1 May 2000 and pecuniary benefits for his service in the North Caucasus Region.

Accordingly, in the Court\u2019s view, the judgment contained all information necessary to calculate the amount due to the applicant, and it has not been shown that the respondent authority had any discretion in this respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Bulgakova v. Russia, no. 69524/01, \u00a7 29, 18 January 2007). Furthermore, the enforcement proceedings were initiated, and as follows from the writ of execution, the bailiffs invited the respondent military unit to pay money to the applicant. Therefore, even if the indication of the precise amount was missing from the judgment, the proceedings at issue established a particular pecuniary obligation of the State vis-\u00e0-vis the applicant. The Court concludes that the judgment was sufficiently clear and specific to be enforceable (see, mutatis mutandis, Bulgakova v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 29-31). Accordingly, from the date of the judgment of 6 August 2001 the applicant had an established \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d to acquire a pecuniary asset. The Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant\u2019s claim for unpaid wages and benefits was sufficiently established to constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, insofar as relevant, Malinovskiy v. Russia, no. 41302/02, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, ECHR 2005 VII (extracts)). The Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s complaint cannot be rejected as incompatible ratione materiae.",

Russia, no.\u00a041842/04, \u00a7\u00a028, 8\u00a0November 2007). There is nothing in the present case to suggest that the applicant was at any time informed by the authorities that they had been unable to enforce the judgment for the reason that it had not contained an exact sum of the award. In the Court\u2019s view, in these circumstances the applicant could not be expected to ask for clarifications on his own motion. The Government\u2019s argument should accordingly be dismissed.",

Russia, no. 23405/03, \u00a7 23, 29 September 2005). Furthermore, it is incumbent on the State to organise its legal system in such a way that ensures co-ordination between various enforcement agencies and secures honouring of the State\u2019s judgment debts in good time (see Reynbakh v. Russia, cited above). In the present case, it is not disputed that the respondent military unit was aware of the contents of the judgment in 2001 (see \u00a7\u00a7 7-9 above). Accordingly, it has been under an obligation to execute the award. In addition, the Court notes that there is nothing in the present case to suggest that the applicant at any point received any instructions as regards the necessity to forward the writ of execution directly to the respondent military unit. Indeed, it follows from the case file that in 2002 he was advised of a possibility to lodge a request for a writ of execution with the . The applicant complied with this instruction and duly asked for the writ. The latter was subsequently transferred to the bailiffs\u2019 office, a competent state agency, which proceeded with the enforcement. There is nothing in the case to suggest that the writ was subsequently returned to the applicant, or that he was in any way notified of a change in the enforcement procedure. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s objection should be dismissed.",
