Section 64 of this Act prescribes the conditions under which a licence to serve alcoholic beverages may be revoked (see paragraphs 27-28 above), that is to say, where the sale of alcoholic beverages causes annoyance relating to public order, drunkenness or disturbance of the peace or where the conditions of the licence or the provisions of the 1977 Act, including the requirement of suitability of the licensee, are not complied with. The last condition allows the competent administrative authorities a certain discretion; decisions revoking licences of this kind must, however, be taken within the framework of the 1977 Act. In the instant case, the National Board of Health and Welfare, in giving its decision of 13 July 1983 as to the suitability of TTA, interpreted section 64 in conjunction with sections 40 and 70 of the Act, and arrived at the conclusion that the only possible action was the revocation of the licence (see paragraph 19 above).",

This was shown by the fact that distribution of alcoholic beverages is a State monopoly and by the licence system here at issue.

The Court agrees, however, with the Government\u2019s contention that there is no causal link between any of the alleged pecuniary damage and the violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) found in this judgment. The withdrawal of the licence admittedly had adverse effects on the goodwill and the value of the restaurant Le Cardinal (see paragraph 43 above). Nevertheless, the Court cannot speculate as to what the result of the proceedings might have been if the applicant company had been able to bring this question before a court. The increase in Mrs Flenman\u2019s taxable income, for its part, had no direct relationship with the revocation of the licence.",
