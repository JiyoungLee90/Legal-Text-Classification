That omission entailed an incorrect decision on the destiny of the physical evidence. The applicant\u2019s money had neither been an instrument of the crime \u2013 in smuggling cases only a hiding place could be such an instrument \u2013 nor had it been criminally acquired. Accordingly, neither paragraph 3 (1) nor paragraph 3 (4) of Article 81 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were applicable in the applicant\u2019s situation and the money should have been returned to the lawful owner pursuant to paragraph 3 (6) of that Article. Otherwise, the confiscation order amounted to a de facto second punishment for the same offence. Finally, the Ombudsman contested the applicability of the USSR Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of 3 February 1978. He pointed out that paragraph 7 expressly provided for application of the \u201ccurrent legislation\u201d. As the new Criminal Code did not provide for confiscation in cases of smuggling, paragraph 7 could not be applied.",

Contrary to the applicant\u2019s submission that Article 81 only permitted confiscation of criminally acquired assets, that provision did not contain qualification as to the lawful or unlawful origin of the instruments of the offence. As to whether the non-declared money should have been considered the instrument or the object of the offence of smuggling, the Court notes that at least since the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in the Petrenko case (see paragraph 23 above), the interpretation of the notion of an \u201cinstrument of the offence\u201d as comprising also the objects of the offence has been entrenched in the Russian law.

The general declaration requirement applicable to any individual crossing the State border prevents cash from entering or leaving the country undetected and the confiscation measure which the failure to declare cash to the customs authorities incurs is a part of that general regulatory scheme designed to combat those offences. The Court therefore considers that the confiscation measure conformed to the general interest of the community.",

Not only was it lawful to import foreign currency as such but also the sum which could be legally transferred or, as in the present case, physically carried across the Russian customs border, was not in principle restricted (see paragraph 19 above). This element distinguishes the instant case from the cases in which the confiscation measure applied either to goods whose importation was prohibited (see AGOSI, cited above, concerning a ban on import of gold coins; Bosphorus Hava Yollar\u0131 Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v.

The amount confiscated was undoubtedly substantial for the applicant, for it represented the entirety of the proceeds from the sale of his late mother\u2019s home in . On the other hand, the harm that the applicant might have caused to the authorities was minor: he had not avoided customs duties or any other levies or caused any other pecuniary damage to the State. Had the amount gone undetected, the Russian authorities would have only been deprived of the information that the money had entered . Thus, the confiscation measure was not intended as pecuniary compensation for damage \u2013 as the State had not suffered any loss as a result of the applicant\u2019s failure to declare the money \u2013 but was deterrent and punitive in its purpose (compare Bendenoun v. France, judgment of 24 February 1994, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0284, \u00a7\u00a047). However, in the instant case the applicant had already been punished for the smuggling offence with a term of imprisonment conditional on a period of probation. It has not been convincingly shown or indeed argued by the Government that that sanction alone was not sufficient to achieve the desired deterrent and punitive effect and prevent violations of the declaration requirement. In these circumstances, the imposition of a confiscation measure as an additional sanction was, in the Court\u2019s assessment, disproportionate, in that it imposed an \u201cindividual and excessive burden\u201d on the applicant.",

Furthermore, it did not establish any extra-judicial way of confiscation (vnesudebnyy poriadok konfiskatsiji) of money in Mr. Izmayilov\u2019s case.",

Thus, the two years\u2019 suspended sentence is not really disproportionate punishment even in combination with a confiscation of physical evidence. I do not agree with the interpretation of the AGOSI case given in \u00a7 35 of the present judgment. In the mentioned case the Court pointed out in general terms, as the Commission did in the past, that \u201cunder the general principles of law recognised in all Contracting States, smuggled goods may, as a rule, be the object of confiscation\u201d (AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 24 October 1986, Series A no. 108, \u00a7 53). In other words, a margin of appreciation of the States is recognised by the Court in this delicate matter, and it does not contravene Article 1 \u00a7 2 of the Protocol 1 to the Convention.",
