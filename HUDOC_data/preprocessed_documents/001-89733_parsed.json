As both supervisory review procedures were covered by the \u201cold\u201d Code of Civil Procedure, both were initiated by State officials who were not parties to the proceedings: in the first case, by the Moscow Prosecutor\u2019s Office and in the second, by the Vice-President of the Supreme Court. For both procedures no time-limit was set as regards the date for bringing an application for supervisory review. The only significant difference between these procedures concerned their outcome, which was favourable to the applicant in the first case and unfavourable in the second.",

It notes that the judgment of 16 April 2002 was final in the part which restored the validity of the favourable judgment of 28 March and the appeal decision of 14 May 2001. No ordinary appeal lay against this ruling. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment was set aside by a higher court, the Presidium of the Supreme Court of Russia. The fact that the ruling of the Supreme Court was subsequently quashed on a further application for supervisory review could not be said to have enhanced legal certainty in the applicant\u2019s case (see, mutatis mutandis, Volkova v. Russia, no. 48758/99, \u00a7 33, 5 April 2005). Further, the Government did not provide the Court with any arguments enabling it to establish any circumstances of a substantial and compelling character justifying the quashing of the final judgment of 16\u00a0April 2002. The fact that the Presidium disagreed with the assessment made by the Supreme Court was not, in itself, an exceptional circumstance warranting the quashing of a binding and enforceable judgment and the review of the applicant\u2019s claim.",
