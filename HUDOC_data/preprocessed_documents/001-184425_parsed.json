Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question of whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law (see Saadi v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, \u00a7 67, 29 January 2008). This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2002IV; and Kafkaris v.

A copy of that order has not been provided to the Court and it is therefore unable to examine its text. However, the information in the Court\u2019s possession allows it to conclude that that order, while authorising a psychiatric assessment, did not authorise the deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty. Firstly, Articles 208 and 209 of the CCP do not contain any provisions allowing a court to authorise deprivation of liberty for the purpose of conducting a psychiatric assessment (see paragraphs 41\u00a0and\u00a042 above; compare and contrast X v. Finland, no.\u00a034806/04, \u00a7 152, ECHR 2012 (extracts), and Petukhova v. Russia, no.\u00a028796/07, \u00a7 52, 2\u00a0May\u00a02013). Secondly, the Taurag\u0117 District Court in a letter sent to the applicant on 12\u00a0June 2014 informed her that the file of the case concerning compulsory treatment did not contain any order to take her for a psychiatric assessment against her will (see paragraph 22 above). Thirdly, the Government in their observations stated that no \u201cmechanism of coercion with regard to individuals who refused to undergo a psychiatric assessment ordered by a court\u201d was provided in domestic law (see paragraph 62 above).",

On the one hand, they submitted that the domestic law did not provide for the possibility to deprive someone of their liberty for the purpose of conducting a psychiatric assessment ordered under Articles 208 and 209 of the CCP. On the other hand, they also referred to the internal regulations of the National Forensic Psychiatry Centre which stated that individuals who refused to appear for a psychiatric assessment could be brought by the police (see paragraph\u00a062 above). The Court does not consider it necessary in the present case to examine whether such internal regulations could constitute an appropriate legal basis for deprivation of liberty (see also O.G. v.\u00a0Latvia (no. 2), no.\u00a069747/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-42, 30\u00a0June 2016). It suffices to point out that the Government provided an incomplete citation of those regulations, omitting the part which states that the bringing of a person for an assessment by the police must be \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d (see paragraph 43 above). In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court concludes that the deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty for the purpose of conducting a psychiatric assessment, which assessment had been ordered by a court under Articles 208 and 209 of the CCP, did not have a basis in domestic law.",

That being said, it considers that in the present case it is not necessary to examine whether all the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) (see the references in paragraph 83 above) were complied with, because in any event the domestic authorities failed to ensure that the proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s involuntary hospitalisation were devoid of arbitrariness, as required under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Indeed, her presence at the hearing was not mandatory under Lithuanian law (see paragraph\u00a050 above) and the psychiatrists who had assessed her mental condition recommended that she not be summoned (see paragraph\u00a019 above). It is, however, the Court\u2019s established case-law that in proceedings concerning compulsory confinement of individuals of unsound mind the individual concerned must be allowed to be heard either in person or, where necessary, through some form of representation (see Winterwerp, \u00a7\u00a060; Shtukaturov, \u00a7\u00a071; and Stanev, \u00a7 171, all cited above).

Her participation was therefore necessary not only to enable her to present her own case, but also to allow the judge to form a personal opinion about her mental capacity (see, mutatis mutandis, Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7 72; Mifobova, cited above, \u00a7 57; and A.N. v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a017280/08, \u00a7\u00a096, 31\u00a0May\u00a02016; see also the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers in paragraph 53 above).

The Court finds it particularly important to note that the applicant sent a letter to the Taurag\u0117 District Court, asking to be given an opportunity to attend the hearing in her case (see paragraph 23\u00a0above). However, she did not receive any response from that court. No reasons  medical or otherwise \u2013 for disregarding the applicant\u2019s wish to participate at the hearing were provided in the Taurag\u0117 District Court\u2019s decision (see paragraph\u00a028 above; see also Mifobova, cited above, \u00a7 62).

The Court finds this argument unconvincing. It firstly notes that the said other proceedings concerned the applicant\u2019s administrative liability for refusal to obey police officers\u2019 orders (see paragraph 20 above) and not the need to hospitalise her because of her mental condition. It is therefore not persuaded that the judge in question had been sufficiently familiar with the applicant\u2019s mental condition for the purpose of ordering her compulsory treatment. The Court also cannot accept that it would have been appropriate for the judge to base her decision concerning the applicant\u2019s hospitalisation on an opinion which she had formed in different proceedings. In any event, the Court underlines that the Taurag\u0117 District Court did not indicate in its decision that that was the reason why the applicant\u2019s wish to attend the hearing had been ignored (see paragraph\u00a028 above), and thus finds the Government\u2019s argument purely speculative. In such circumstances, the Court considers that no valid reasons were provided by the domestic court to justify the applicant\u2019s exclusion from the proceedings (see M. v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a02452/04, \u00a7\u00a060, 19\u00a0April 2012, and Anatoliy Rudenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0114).",

Likewise, in her appeal to the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court the applicant asked the court to order a fresh psychiatric assessment (see paragraph 29 above). The Court further notes that one of the experts who had conducted the psychiatric assessment of the applicant in April 2014 and who was examined by the Taurag\u0117 District Court could not definitively confirm that the applicant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the proceedings still warranted ordering compulsory treatment (see paragraph 26 above). However, the domestic courts in their decisions did not address the issue of the applicant\u2019s subsequent treatment at all and did not provide any reasons for dismissing the request for a fresh psychiatric assessment (see paragraphs\u00a028 and\u00a032 above). In such circumstances, the Court considers that the domestic courts in their decisions did not adequately demonstrate that at the time when the decision to hospitalise the applicant was adopted, her condition was such as to require compulsory treatment (see the references in paragraph 86 above; see also M.\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a080).",

In particular, neither the conclusions of the psychiatrists, nor the decisions of the courts directly addressed the question whether the applicant\u2019s mental condition presented a danger to herself or others, even though the analysis, and not a mere statement, of the \u201cparticular dangerousness\u201d and \u201cthe seriousness and nature of [her] mental disorder\u201d was explicitly required under Lithuanian law as well (see paragraphs\u00a046 and\u00a048 above). The Court is aware of the fact that, in the domestic proceedings in question, the applicant admitted to having sprayed tear gas at a teenager, and that she has also been held liable for administrative offences (see paragraphs 7 and 11 above). However, the domestic courts did not make any reference to those \u2013 or indeed any other \u2013 circumstances when deciding to commit the applicant to a psychiatric hospital (see, mutatis\u00a0mutandis, Gajcsi v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a034503/03, \u00a7\u00a021, 3 October 2006; Mihailovs v.

They essentially reiterated the conclusions of the psychiatric assessment, without providing any independent analysis of the necessity of the applicant\u2019s hospitalisation. The Court finds it especially disconcerting that the domestic courts did not in substance address any of the applicant\u2019s and her lawyer\u2019s arguments. In particular, the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court stated that \u201cthe arguments in [the applicant\u2019s] appeal confirm[ed] that she [could not] critically assess her disorder [and did] not understand the danger posed by her mental condition, nor the need for treatment\u201d (see paragraph 32 above). In the Court\u2019s view, such circular reasoning \u2013 according to which a person\u2019s reluctance to undergo psychiatric hospitalisation demonstrates his or her inability to appreciate his or her condition and thereby yields yet another reason for involuntary hospitalisation \u2013 is incompatible with the principle of effective protection of Convention rights (see Ples\u00f3 v. Hungary, no.\u00a041242/08, \u00a7\u00a067, 2\u00a0October\u00a02012).",
