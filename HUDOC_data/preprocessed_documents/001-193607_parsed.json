In particular it noted that in 2010 her company had generated a gross income of PLN\u00a0213,000; however, the expenses exceeded this sum by approximately PLN\u00a050,000. As regards the first four months of 2011 the applicant had declared a gross income of PLN 53,600 and expenses of PLN\u00a048,500; therefore she had generated a net income of over PLN 5,000. Moreover the applicant had declared that she had other financial obligations, amounting to PLN\u00a04,000 per month, which she had been paying on time. The court agreed that her financial situation had been difficult and that she had not initiated the current proceedings. However, the situation of a commercial activity which had been generating a very high income, and even higher costs, did not automatically justify a full exemption from court fees. Moreover, the applicant had declared a net income for the first four months of 2011. In an extensively reasoned decision the domestic court concluded that the applicant should be expected to pay one third of the fees due for lodging an appeal against the payment order.",

Poland, no.\u00a028249/95, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001VI; Jedamski and Jedamska v.

The Court considered in those cases, having regard to the principles established in its caselaw in respect of the right of access to a court, that the amount of the court fees assessed in the light of the circumstances of a given case, including the applicants\u2019 ability to pay them and the phase of the proceedings at which that restriction was imposed on them, were factors which were material in the determination of whether or not a person had enjoyed his right of access to a court.",

In particular they established that although the applicant\u2019s company had often been operating at loss, in the beginning of 2011, she had nevertheless declared a net income of PLN\u00a05,000. They concluded that it had been possible for her to pay the reduced fee of PLN 1,000, equivalent of EUR\u00a0250. Since the applicant failed to pay the fee her appeal against the payment order of 2 May 2011 was rejected and she was asked to pay further court fees for challenging the rejection (see paragraphs 14-17 above).",

However, it also considers that the authorities\u2019 assessment of the applicant\u2019s ability to pay the fee was based to a large extent on the net income declared by her for the first four months of 2011. The courts failed to attach sufficient importance to the fact that the applicant\u2019s financial situation had subsequently deteriorated \u2013 she had wound up her company\u2019s activity as it had been operating at a loss (see paragraph 10 above). The Court considers that the domestic authorities should have given more weight to the fact that she had no longer been generating any income and had other financial obligations which could have made even the payment of the reduced fee impossible.",

The applicant was not the party which initiated the proceedings in question; she was a defendant in summary proceedings initiated by a claimant who had set the value of the claim on which the amount of the fees depended. On 2 May 2011 the court issued a payment order against the applicant for a large sum of money based solely on the claimant\u2019s request and on evidence submitted by her (see paragraph 5 above). The applicant sought access to a court to challenge that payment order and to have her arguments examined by the court for the first time. The fee imposed on her prevented her from accessing a court at that initial stage and led to the payment order of 2 May 2011 becoming final and enforceable. In consequence, her arguments that the bill of exchange had been illegal and the claim against her unfounded were not examined by a court at all. It does not appear that the domestic authorities gave a meaningful consideration to those facts.",
