According to the Government, the applicant had been allowed to walk outside his cell for thirty minutes each day (see paragraph\u00a017 above). In this connection the Court notes that according to the relevant CPT standards, all the prisoners, without exception, must be able to spend a reasonable part of the day (8 hours or more) outside their cells, engaged in purposeful activity of a varied nature and must be allowed at least one hour of exercise in open air every day and preferably as part of a broader programme of out-of-cell activities (see Iacov Stanciu v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a035972/05, \u00a7 121, 24 July 2012). The Court considers that the fact that the applicant was allowed to walk outside his cell thirty minute per day was insufficient to compensate for the scarce allocation of personal space to him, and thus to rebut the strong presumption of a violation of Article\u00a03 of the Convention.",
