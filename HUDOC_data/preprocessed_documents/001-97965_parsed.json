Accordingly, the applicant is still entitled to enforcement of that judgment. The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85). The Court finds that this principle also applies in the present case, having regard to the violations found. It therefore considers that the Government must secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the judgment of 29 October 2004, namely the reinstatement of the applicant in her previous post and payment of compensation for pecuniary damage until her effective reinstatement.",

In general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention (see Shofman v.\u00a0Russia, no. 74826/01, \u00a7 53, 24 November 2005, with further references). By finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the present case, the Court has established the Government's obligation to take appropriate measures to remedy the applicant's individual situation, that is, to ensure compliance with the applicant's enforceable claim under the judgment of 29 October 2004 (compare with Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2005-...). Whether this involves reinstating the applicant in her previous job or in an equivalent job or, if this is not possible, granting her reasonable compensation for non-enforcement, or a combination of these and other measures, is a decision that falls to the respondent State (see Tarverdiyev v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 33343/03, \u00a7 66, 26 July 2007). The Court, however, emphasises that any measures adopted must be compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 202, ECHR 2004-II, with further references).",
