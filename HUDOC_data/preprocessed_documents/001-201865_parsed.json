Together with Article 3, it enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe (see, among many other authorities,\u00a0Andronicou and Constantinou v. Cyprus, 9 October 1997, \u00a7 171,\u00a0Reports of Judgments and Decisions\u00a01997VI; Solomou and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a036832/97, \u00a7 63, 24\u00a0June 2008; and Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, \u00a7 174, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). Having regard to the fundamental importance of the right to life, the Court must subject any possible interferences with Article\u00a02 of the Convention to the most careful and thorough scrutiny, taking into account not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27\u00a0September 1995, \u00a7 150, Series A no. 324; and Tek\u0131n and Arslan v.\u00a0Belgium, no. 37795/13, \u00a7 83, 5 September 2017). Persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 99, ECHR 2000VII). Consequently, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see, among other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999-V). The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of an individual in custody is particularly stringent where that individual dies (see Salman, cited above, \u00a7 99 and Tek\u0131n and Arslan, cited above, \u00a7 83).",

The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by\u00a0producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim (see Salman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0100;\u00a0Rivas v.

In the absence of such explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government (see, among other authorities, El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0152).
