The latter court, on an appeal lodged by the applicant in connection with another action brought by the same company whereby it had sought the removal from the register of the trade mark for watches \"Orient\", had delivered a judgment on 30 March 1989 in which it rejected briefly but expressly the submission based on the priority of \"Creacions Orient\".

The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision. It is moreover necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant may bring before the courts and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments. That is why the question whether a court has failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons, deriving from Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, can only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case.",

The question whether the Japanese company could assert its right to its trade name \"Orient Watch Co.

Balani M\u00e1laga\" was compatible with that trade name. It therefore required a specific and express reply. In the absence of such a reply, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Supreme Court simply neglected to deal with the submission based on the prior right to the mark \"Creacions Orient\" or whether it intended to dismiss it and, if that were its intention, what its reasons were for so deciding. Neither the applicant\u2019s request to have the list of articles covered by the entry in the industrial property register extended, nor the fact that the legal department of the industrial property register had stated the view in its report to the first-instance court that the submission should be dismissed, nor yet the fact that, according to the Government, the Supreme Court had already expressed the same opinion in a decision in proceedings involving the same parties in an identical context makes any difference to this finding.
