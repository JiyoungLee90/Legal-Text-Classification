He submitted that had not been present at the hearing of 10 December 2002 and had been therefore unable to make submissions or to comment on the submissions of the other party. The District Court had moreover refused to summon his counsel Ms V., who could have confirmed that he had had marks of beatings on his face. Given that he had been denied medical assistance and that the video recording of his questioning had been erased, Ms V.\u2019s testimony would have been the only opportunity for him to prove that he had been ill-treated.",

Article 1070 creates an exception to the general rule that all damage inflicted on a person must be compensated by the tortfeasor, contained in Article\u00a01064 of the same Code, by establishing that damage caused as part of the administration of justice could be compensated by the State in two categories of cases only (see paragraphs 36 and 37 above). Firstly, Article\u00a01070 contains an exhaustive list of situations where damage caused by unlawful judicial decisions is compensated for, irrespective of any fault on the part of the judge. Secondly, it provides that damage may also be recoverable in cases where the judge\u2019s fault has been established in criminal proceedings. The Constitutional Court defined a third category of cases where damage incurred through a violation by a court of the right to a fair trial by acts of a procedural nature could be compensated for even in the absence of a final criminal conviction of a judge, if the fault of the judge has been established in civil proceedings (see paragraph 39 above, see also, in respect of the third category of cases, Chernichkin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 39874/03, \u00a7\u00a7 28-30, 16\u00a0September 2010).

It pursued the legitimate aim of proper administration of justice.

It also permits judges to do their work in complete independence and free from fear that the exercise of their discretion and judgment may make them liable for damages.

Domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction found that Russian law did not impose any liability on the judge or on the State in the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case, and declared his claims inadmissible. However, if as a matter of law there was no basis for the claim, the hearing of evidence would have been an expensive and time-consuming process which would not have provided the applicant with any remedy at its conclusion. Such a hearing would have indeed served no purpose in a situation where, as in the present case, no liability for the alleged damage existed under domestic law. It is not for this Court to find that such liability should have been imposed on the judge or on the State in the applicant\u2019s case, since this would effectively involve substituting its own views for those of the national courts as to the proper interpretation and content of domestic law. There is therefore no reason to consider the inadmissibility decision based on the absence of a sustainable cause of action as offending the principle of access to court (see, mutatis mutandis, Z and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 97 and 101).",
