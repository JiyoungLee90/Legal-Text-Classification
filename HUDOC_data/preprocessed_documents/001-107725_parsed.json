Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in monitoring compliance with this rule, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, amongst other things, that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see \u0130lhan v.  [GC], no. 22277/93, \u00a7\u00a059, ECHR 2000VII). It should also be reiterated that an applicant must have made normal use of domestic remedies which are likely to be effective and sufficient and that, when a remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Riad and Idiab v.\u00a0Belgium, nos. 29787/03 and 29810/03, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2008...

If the land registry office fails to do so, the stake holders have the possibility to bring an action in the civil courts requesting the removal of the impugned annotation (see the Judgment of 18th Chamber of the Court of Cassation, on file no. 2005/5137 and decision no. 2005/7277, 11 July 2005). However, in the circumstances of the present case, even assuming that the applicants were successful in their action, this would not terminate the restriction in question given that the local construction plan of 24 October 1967 still foresees expropriation of the applicants\u2019 plot of land and designates the area as a school zone (see Ziya \u00c7evik v.
