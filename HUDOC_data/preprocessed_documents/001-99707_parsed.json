For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The investigation into serious allegations of ill-treatment must be thorough. This means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 103 et seq., Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII). They must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev v.\u00a0, no. 77617/01, \u00a7\u00a0107 et seq., 26 January 2006, and Assenov, cited above, \u00a7 102 et seq.). Further, the investigation must be expedient. The Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a0133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). It has also given consideration to the promptness in opening investigations, delays in taking statements and to the length of time taken for the initial inquiry (see Indelicato v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a031143/96, \u00a7 37, 18 October 2001).",

The presence of such injuries was indicative of a criminal assault occasioning actual bodily harm or at least the criminal offence of battery. Under Russian law, the applicant's criminal complaint, supported by that information on the elements of a criminal offence, was sufficient grounds for opening a criminal case (see paragraph 31 above). However, a criminal case has never been opened and the institution of criminal proceedings was refused on no fewer than seven occasions. In the absence of a criminal case the applicant could not be granted the procedural status of victim, which restricted his participation in the investigation and prevented him from exercising the rights attached to that procedural status, including the right to lodge applications or the right to put questions to the medical expert (see paragraph 32 above). It cannot therefore be said that the applicant's right to participate effectively in the investigation was secured (compare Denis Vasilyev v. Russia, no. 32704/04, \u00a7\u00a0126, 17 December 2009).",

The inquiry was passed between authorities and investigators who routinely attempted to discontinue the proceedings on various grounds. Over a period of three years, seven decisions refusing the institution of criminal proceedings were given, all of which \u2013 save for the last one \u2013 were set aside by supervising prosecutors or courts because the inquiry that had been carried out until then had been incomplete or deficient. The Court notes that the most fundamental investigative measures, such as inspecting the scene where the applicant alleged to have been beaten or arranging a confrontation between him and the police officers from Nerekhta district police station, were never carried out. These failures alone, for which no explanation has been provided to the Court, suffice to render the investigation ineffective.",
