He noted that at the time, G. had not yet been the applicant\u2019s counsel. However, well aware that the applicant had committed serious criminal offences, G. had advised him what to do. In particular, he had told the applicant that money was needed, which could possibly mean that G. had intended to bribe a police official. He had also informed him about the course of the criminal proceedings, which had become known to him as at the time he had been representing the applicant\u2019s accomplices, S. and M. When the police had tried to force the applicant\u2019s door, the applicant had summoned G., who had said that he could not come and offered to send another lawyer. He had then advised the applicant to try to avoid arrest and, if that was not possible, to destroy his telephone and the SIM card, and to remain silent when questioned. In the investigator\u2019s opinion, by giving such advice, G. had been trying to hide his connections with the applicant and his knowledge of the criminal offences committed by him. Given that at the material time G. had not been formally admitted as the applicant\u2019s counsel, he should be considered as having advised him in his capacity as a simple citizen. He should therefore be called as a witness in the criminal proceedings against the applicant.",

The investigator had not been informed about that agreement. G. had not been formally admitted as the applicant\u2019s counsel in the present criminal proceedings until 28 December 2003 when he had shown the investigator the relevant instruction by the Bar Association. The Regional Court found it relevant that during the conversations intercepted by the police, G. had advised the applicant to remain in hiding and to destroy the evidence. Moreover, having been present, as their counsel, at S.\u2019s and M.\u2019s questioning after their arrest, G. had informed the applicant about their statements to the investigator. When summoned by the applicant to assist him at the time of his arrest, he had refused to come and had offered to send another lawyer. That gave reasons to doubt that G. had been representing the applicant at the time in the present criminal proceedings. The investigator had subsequently removed G.\u00a0 as counsel for the applicant. G. had not, however, been called to testify against the applicant in breach of legal professional privilege. Given that the applicant\u2019s conversations with G. intercepted by the police contained information about the applicant\u2019s criminal activities, they were not subject to legal professional privilege and their transcripts were admissible as evidence.",

In cases arising from individual applications, the Court must as a rule focus its attention not on the law as such but on the manner in which it was applied to the applicant in the particular circumstances (see Goranova-Karaeneva, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

The Government\u2019s submissions that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention had been satisfactory were based on statements given by the prison officials several years after the events in question. The Court has repeatedly declined to accept the validity of similar statements on the grounds that they could not be viewed as sufficiently reliable, given the lapse of time involved and the absence of any supporting documentary evidence (see Belashev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a028617/03, \u00a7\u00a052, 13\u00a0November 2007; Sudarkov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 3130/03, \u00a7\u00a043, 10\u00a0July 2008; Kokoshkina v.

In contrast to the cases involving denial of access, the more lenient requirement of \u2018relevant and sufficient\u2019 reasons has been applied in situations raising the less serious issue of \u2018denial of choice\u2019.

Against the above background, the Court considers that the first step should be to assess whether it has been demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for overriding or obstructing the defendant\u2019s wish as to his or her choice of legal representation. Where no such reasons exist, the Court should proceed to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings. In making its assessment, the Court may have regard to a variety of factors, including the nature of the proceedings and the application of certain professional requirements (see Meftah and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45-48, and Martin, cited above, \u00a7 90); the circumstances surrounding the designation of counsel and the existence of opportunities for challenging this (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 90-97); the effectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance (see Croissant, cited above \u00a7 31, and Vitan, cited above \u00a7\u00a7 58-64); whether the accused\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination has been respected (see Martin, cited above, \u00a7 90); the accused\u2019s age (ibid., \u00a7 92); and the trial court\u2019s use of any statements given by the accused at the material time (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, \u00a7 31, Klimentyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 117-118; and Martin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a094-95). It is further mindful that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory (see, among many other authorities, Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 24, Series A no. 32; Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 38; Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 76; and Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 55) and that in determining Convention rights one must frequently look beyond appearances and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see, inter alia, Delcourt v. Belgium, 17 January 1970, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 11; De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, 22 May 1984, \u00a7\u00a048, Series A no. 77; Pavlenko, cited above, \u00a7 112; and Erkapi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. \u00a051198/08, \u00a7\u00a7 80-82, 25\u00a0April 2013). In cases where the accused had no legal representation, the Court also took into consideration the opportunity given to the accused to challenge the authenticity of evidence and to oppose its use (see Panovits, cited above, \u00a7 82), whether the accused is in custody (Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 60); whether such statements constituted a significant element on which the conviction was based and the strength of the other evidence in the case (Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 57; and Panovits cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 76 and 82).\u201d",

The only reason for removing G. was the investigator\u2019s finding that it would be useful to question him about the telephone conversations he had had with the applicant before he had been formally admitted as his counsel in the criminal proceedings. The Court notes in this connection that the domestic law does not provide for the removal of counsel in order to question him or her as a witness (see paragraph 79 above). The Advocates Act explicitly prohibits the questioning of an advocate about matters which have become known to him or her as a result of representing the client or as a result of an application for legal representation by a prospective client (see paragraph 82 above). As explained by the Constitutional Court, legal professional privilege covers all information which has become known to an advocate as a result of representing his or her client, including any information communicated by the client before the advocate had been formally admitted as counsel in criminal proceedings (see paragraph 83 above). It is also significant that the domestic law at the material time did not provide for an exception to the legal professional privilege in the case of its suspected abuse, for example in furtherance of criminal or fraudulent conduct. In any event, there is no evidence in the case file that disciplinary or criminal proceedings were opened against G. in connection with any abuses committed while representing the applicant.",

It attaches particular weight to the risk of impingement on the lawyer\u2019s right to professional secrecy, since it may have repercussions on the proper administration of justice. Strengthened protection of exchanges between lawyers and their clients is justified by the fact that lawyers are assigned a fundamental role in a democratic society, that of defending litigants. Yet lawyers cannot carry out this essential task if there is no guarantee that their exchanges with those they are defending will remain confidential. Indirectly but necessarily dependent thereupon is the right of everyone to a fair trial, including the right of accused persons not to incriminate themselves (see, in the context of Article 8, Michaud, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 117-18, with further references). It is true that legal professional privilege is not inviolable and may be overridden by other important considerations (see, by way of example, situations described in Michaud, cited above, \u00a7 123, and Versini-Campinchi and Crasnianski v. France, no.\u00a049176/11, \u00a7 78, 16\u00a0June 2016). \u00a0Exceptions to the legal professional privilege must be however strictly defined, be attended by adequate and sufficient guarantees against abuse and, most importantly, should not affect the client\u2019s defence rights (see, in the context of Article 8, VersiniCampinchi and Crasnianski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 79 and 80).",

It is noteworthy that during most of that period, G. was in any case unavailable to represent the applicant, being on annual leave. It is also important to note that legal aid counsel was appointed only after it had been proposed that the applicant retain another lawyer of his choosing and he had declined to do so. In so far as the applicant alleged that legal aid counsel had been ineffective, the Court notes that he has not substantiated any examples of the lawyer\u2019s manifest negligence. As soon as the applicant expressed a wish to be represented by another lawyer of his choosing, AM., his request was allowed and AM. was immediately admitted as his counsel. He represented the applicant throughout the remainder of the criminal proceedings against him. Lastly, the Court observes that G. was ultimately not questioned as a witness against the applicant.",

In my view, the present case should be differentiated from the Dragojevic case (see Dragojevic v.

Such circumstances were well-known to the national court and could be easily derived from the case file as the applicant was a member of the organised criminal gang, and he had already made an attempt to go into hiding and to destroy incriminating evidence.",
