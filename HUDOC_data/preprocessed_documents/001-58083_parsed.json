The Court of Cassation\u2019s registry could remedy this statutory shortcoming by informing appellants who did not wish to be represented by a member of the Conseil d\u2019Etat and Court of Cassation Bar of the date on which their appeal would be heard. It was not for convicted appellants to take steps to find out that date. Indeed, the legislature had been conscious of the perverse effects of this legal vacuum, because the new Article 585-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure now laid down a one-month time-limit (see paragraph 13 above).",

Not imposing a time-limit on unrepresented appellants for filing pleadings gave an advantage to appellants who were not legal practitioners and who consequently were given more time than members of the Conseil d\u2019Etat and Court of Cassation Bar to prepare their case. However, even though unrepresented appellants had more time, they should not remain inactive.

Furthermore, he had been assisted by counsel who, though not a member of the Conseil d\u2019Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, could not legitimately plead his ignorance of current practice in order to complain that the procedure was unfair. He should have taken advice from colleagues who specialised in Court of Cassation cases and taken one of the following steps: asked the Court of Cassation\u2019s registry when the Court of Appeal had forwarded the case file, that being when the ten-day period laid down in Article 604 of the Code of Criminal Procedure began to run; informed the reporting judge of his client\u2019s intention to file a pleading and applied to that judge for the case not to be listed for imminent hearing; or found out when the appeal was to be heard. Neither the applicant nor his lawyer had made use of the means available to them for ensuring that they actually enjoyed the rights protected by Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6). In their neglect, identical to that which the Court had found in respect of Mr Melin (see the Melin v.  judgment of 22 June 1993, Series A no. 261-A), they had betrayed a distinct lack of interest in the outcome of the proceedings.",
