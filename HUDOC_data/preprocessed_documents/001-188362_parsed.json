In this context, the position of children under Article 34 deserves careful consideration, as they must generally rely on other persons to present their claims and represent their interests, and may not be of an age or capacity to authorise any steps to be taken on their behalf in any real sense. A restrictive or technical approach in this area is therefore to be avoided and the key consideration in such cases is that any serious issues concerning respect for a child\u2019s rights should be examined (see Hromadka and Hromadkova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 22909/10, \u00a7\u00a0118, 11 December 2014, with further references).",

The Court has found in previous cases that in the event of a conflict over a minor\u2019s interests between a natural parent and a person appointed by the authorities to act as the child\u2019s guardian, there is a danger that some of those interests will never be brought to the Court\u2019s attention and that the minor will be deprived of effective protection of his rights under the Convention. Consequently, even where the parent has been deprived of parental rights, his or her standing as the natural parent suffices to afford him or her the necessary power to apply to the Court on the child\u2019s behalf too, in order to protect his or her interests (see Scozzari and Giunta v.\u00a0Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7 138, ECHR 2000VIII, where the mother who had been deprived of parental rights acted on behalf of her children who had been placed under the guardianship of a foster family; P.,\u00a0C. and S. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 56547/00, 11\u00a0December 2001, where the natural parents acted on behalf of their daughter who had been adopted by another family; and Siebert, cited above, where the natural father who had never had parental rights in respect of his daughter born out of wedlock acted on her behalf even though she was under the guardianship of her aunt).",

It is not clear from the case file whether the first applicant is still entitled to act on X\u2019s behalf in Russia since her grandmother has been appointed her guardian in Uzbekistan and since he has been deprived of parental authority by an Uzbek court, given that those decisions have never been officially recognised in Russia. Be that as it may, the decisive factor is that there is a conflict between a natural parent and a State-appointed guardian over a minor\u2019s interests, as in the cases cited in paragraph 56 above. Consequently, even though the first applicant was deprived of parental authority, his standing as the natural father suffices to afford him the necessary power to apply to the Court on his daughter\u2019s behalf, in order to protect her interests which otherwise risk not being brought to the Court\u2019s attention (see, for similar reasoning, Scozzari and Giunta, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0138).",

It followed from the transcript that X\u2019s replies had been monosyllabic and it was therefore impossible to be sure that they had been given freely and after a thorough reflection. In the first applicant\u2019s opinion, the domestic courts should therefore have treated X\u2019s statements with caution and appointed an expert psychologist to establish her psychological state during the questioning and whether she had been subjected to psychological influence. Moreover, the domestic courts had disregarded many facts relevant for establishing X\u2019s best interests, such as (i) the fact that before her mother\u2019s death X had always lived with her parents, first in Russia and then in the USA, and had been attached to her father; (ii) the fact that her father was able to provide her with better education and, most importantly, better medical care, which was necessary in view of her increased risk of cancer due to hereditary factors; and (iii) the fact that X\u2019s grandparents had prevented any contact between her and her father and her paternal family, thereby destroying her family ties.

It would be going too far to say that domestic courts are always required to involve a psychological expert in disputes involving children, but this issue depends on the specific circumstances of each case, having due regard to the age and maturity of the child concerned (see Sommerfeld, cited above, \u00a7 71). There is no evidence in the case file that the first applicant ever asked for a psychological expert examination of X. She was thirteen years old when she was heard by an Uzbek court on the question of her return to her father and was assisted by a specialist from the childcare authorities. In such circumstances, the domestic courts could reasonably consider that her statements reflected her true wishes.

That choice inevitably affected the length of the proceedings, making it necessary to adapt the hearing schedule to enable the parties to travel from Uzbekistan and the USA to Moscow where the hearings were held and, most importantly, to send international requests for assistance to the Uzbek authorities to help establish relevant facts, in particular to take a statement from X.

This initial period turned out to be crucial for his relationship with his daughter. Indeed, already in October 2009, that is almost a year before the first applicant\u2019s application to a Russian court, X started to say that she preferred to remain living with her grandparents (see paragraph 15 above). The Court is therefore not convinced that the alleged delays in the domestic proceedings resulted in the de facto determination of the case, as X\u2019s opinion had apparently already been formed by the time those proceedings began. It was the first applicant\u2019s passivity during the crucial initial period of separation that seemed to influence the outcome of the case by weakening the bond between the applicants and by making X used to living with her grandparents and unwilling to change that arrangement.",
