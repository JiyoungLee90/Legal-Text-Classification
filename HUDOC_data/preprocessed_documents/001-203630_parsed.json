The court also dismissed the applicant\u2019s request, arguing that the change of residence to Romania did not justify a change in the attribution of parental authority.

The court found that at the time when the children had been taken to Romania, their habitual residence had been in France and the parents had exercised parental authority jointly. Under French law, that meant that the children\u2019s residence could only be changed if both parents agreed or, in the absence of such agreement, if a court authorised the move. On the facts of the case, the court found that the applicant had taken the children to Romania without the father\u2019s consent and before the French courts had had an opportunity to determine by means of a final decision her request to take the children to Romania. The County Court examined both the decision of 2\u00a0September 2016 by the Bobigny tribunal de grande instance (see paragraph\u00a07 above) and the decision of 21 November 2017 by the Paris Court of Appeal (see paragraph 17 above).",

The court examined the evidence adduced by the applicant concerning the incident of 2 December 2016 (see paragraph\u00a010 above). However, based on that evidence and on the witness testimonies available to it, the court considered that it had not been established that X had been in any way violent, abusive or neglectful towards the children, either while they had been living together or after the parents\u2019 separation. It thus concluded that his behaviour would not put them at \u201cgrave risk\u201d for the purpose of Article 13 of the Hague Convention. The court further considered that, in any case, a risk to the children\u2019s physical or psychological integrity would not lead the court to reject the request for return. In the court\u2019s view, such a risk would simply require it to seek international cooperation to ensure the children\u2019s protection by the French authorities after their return (Article 60 (e) of the Brussels II bis Regulation \u2013 see paragraph 41 below).",

The same philosophy is inherent in the Hague Convention, which associates this interest with restoration of the status quo by means of a decision ordering the child\u2019s immediate return to his or her country of habitual residence in the event of unlawful abduction, while taking account of the fact that non-return may sometimes prove justified for objective reasons that correspond to the child\u2019s interests, thus explaining the existence of exceptions, specifically in the event of a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation (Article\u00a013, first paragraph, (b)). The Court further notes that the European Union subscribes to the same philosophy, in the framework of a system involving only European Union member States and based on a principle of mutual trust. The Brussels II bis Regulation, whose rules on child abduction supplement those already laid down in the Hague Convention, likewise refers in its Preamble to the best interests of the child (see paragraph\u00a041 above), while Article 24 \u00a7 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights emphasises that in all actions relating to children the child\u2019s best interests must be a primary consideration (see X v.

The Court is satisfied that the County Court identified the children\u2019s best interests and considered them when deciding not to give significance for the purpose of the Hague Convention to the children\u2019s integration in their new environment. In this respect, the Court cannot but note that throughout their stay in Romania, the children maintained contact with France and the French culture, which remained present even in their new environment. In particular, they continued their education in French (see paragraph 15 above) and, according to the applicant, visited France twice since their relocation to Romania: first with their father and then with the applicant (see paragraph 24 above). The Court also notes that the applicant\u2019s stay in Romania was only intended to be temporary (see paragraph 13 above). For these reasons, the Court is prepared to accept that in addition to being integrated in their new environment in Romania, the children continued to remain linked to France; this fact would facilitate their return to their habitual environment in that country. The Court is thus satisfied that the County Court\u2019s decision in this respect, albeit brief, convincingly established the children\u2019s best interest in this respect.",
