According to the Norwegian courts\u2019 findings in the proceedings referred to below, the business was a fraudulent pyramid scheme by which Cosmesin purchased from a producer in Denmark freeze-dried concentrates of lactic acid bacteria at 100 Norwegian kroner (NOK) per bag (containing 0.5\u00a0grams), resold them to Geneve at NOK 240 per bag, which again sold them at the price of NOK 330 per bag to cultivators whom it had recruited, and after 15 weeks bought the cultivated products back at the price of NOK\u00a0625. The number of producers increased from 4 at the end of 1985 to 3,205 at the end of January 1987. Payments were made to a company in London.

In his opinion, it should have been possible for the police to interview Mr D.R. between 7 November 1990 and 8 July 1991, while he was detained in Spain. At all times during the investigations the applicant was available for inquiries by the police. Rather, as pointed out by the City Court, the delay was caused by the changes of police investigators in the case. However, this factor was only one of three mitigating circumstances taken into account. The sentence imposed was only a little lower than the average sentence for the kind of offences in question, which could be explained by the factors referred to by the City Court other than the length. Thus, as his sentence had not been sufficiently reduced, it could not be said that he had obtained adequate redress for the violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention occasioned by the excessive duration of the proceedings in his case.",

Considering, inter alia, the length of the proceedings as a mitigating circumstance, the court fixed the sentence at no more than 2 years\u2019 imprisonment. It was clear from the court\u2019s reasoning that the length of the proceedings was a decisive factor in the leniency of the sentence. Thus the mitigation on grounds of length was measurable and could not be viewed as an unverifiable declaration of good intent. Given the level of sentences imposed in comparable cases, one could reasonably assume that in the applicant\u2019s case the mitigating circumstances represented a reduction in sentence of at least 2 years\u2019 imprisonment. At least one year\u2019s reduction was attributable to the length of the proceedings alone, the City Court having attached less importance to the other two mitigating factors. Thus, bearing in mind the aggravating circumstances in the case, the reduction in sentence must be deemed substantial. The applicant was thus afforded adequate redress by the competent national authorities and could not claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, of a violation of his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

In this regard the Court notes that the City Court, after having apprised itself of all the evidence before it, observed that the lateness of the investigation was not so much caused by Mr D.R.\u2019s sojourn abroad as by a change of investigators in the case (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above).",

The Court is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s argument that the length factor had been of minor or negligible importance in the sentencing. The City Court held expressly that it attached a \u201cnot insignificant\u201d weight to this third factor and little weight to a second factor regarding the uncritical attitude of banks in giving loans. The age mitigating factor did not apply to all the defendants, yet they all received comparable sentences according to their respective responsibilities. Thus, the time/delay element stood out as being the primary mitigating factor. Although the City Court\u2019s reasoning could have been more precise, the Court is satisfied, given the particulars on comparable sentencing practices submitted by the parties, that the reduction in sentence on account of the length factor was measurable in the present case, and had a decisive impact on the applicant\u2019s sentence.",
