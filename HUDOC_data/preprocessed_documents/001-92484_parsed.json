This was because, despite the length of their absence, they had always intended to return and had retained sufficient continuing links with the property. Moreover, in the case of Mente\u015f and Others v.

It follows that from then on, at the latest, the applicants, who now all appear to be residents of , clearly had no intention of returning to live in the flat. They thus cut the family\u2019s connection to the property. Accordingly, the Court finds that by the time the applicants lodged their case with the Court, that property could no longer be considered to have been their \u201chome\u201d for the purposes of Article 8.
