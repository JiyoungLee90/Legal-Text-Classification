These developments coincided in time with a reform of the system of appeals in Russian criminal proceedings in which an appeal instance was added at the regional level and two levels of cassation proceedings replaced two levels of supervisory review. As regards the former system, it had been the Court\u2019s constant position that a decision taken by a second-instance court at the regional level in the criminal cassation proceedings was the \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In the new system, the time-limits for lodging cassation appeals were longer, but the Court recently expressed the opinion that such time-limits could still be reconciled with the Convention requirements on an effective remedy (see Kashlan v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 60189/15, \u00a7 27, 19 April 2016). It was therefore not unreasonable for the applicant to attempt a remedy which had been previously considered to result in the final decision in the domestic proceedings and which had not been found by the Court to be ineffective. The Court accordingly finds that the application was not belated and rejects the Government\u2019s objection.",
