That right of access is not absolute and it is subject to limitations, which, however, must not restrict or reduce a person\u2019s access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired (see Na\u00eft-Liman v. Switzerland [GC], no. 51357/07, \u00a7\u00a7 112-14, 15\u00a0March 2018, and Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, \u00a7\u00a7 229-30, ECHR 2012). Article 6 of the Convention does not compel the Contracting States to set up courts of appeal or of cassation. However, where such courts do exist, the guarantees of Article 6 must be complied with, for instance in that it guarantees to litigants an effective right of access to the courts for the determination of their civil rights and obligations (see Zubac v. Croatia [GC], no. 40160/12, \u00a7 80, 5 April 2018). Furthermore, it is not for this Court to deal with alleged errors of law or fact committed by the national courts unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a022251/08, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2015). On the other hand, the risk of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State, and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see, for instance, \u0160imecki v. Croatia, no. 15253/10, \u00a7 46, 30 April 2014).",
