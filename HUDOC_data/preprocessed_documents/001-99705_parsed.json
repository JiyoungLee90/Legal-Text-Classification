In cases concerning the conditions of an applicant's transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked change in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court's view, a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d which brought the entire period complained of within the Court's competence (see Vlasov v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 78146/01, 14 February 2006, and Moiseyev v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004).",

It does not appear that there was any material change in the conditions of his detention in the Kopeysk IVS at any given moment in that period. Since the allegation of severe overcrowding remained the main characteristic of conditions with regard to all the cells of the IVS, the Court does not consider that minor differences between the cells, if they existed, would be sufficient to allow it to distinguish between the conditions of the applicant's detention in different cells or for his detention to be separated into several periods depending on the cell in which he had been kept (see, for similar reasoning, Nazarov, \u00a7\u00a078, and also Guliyev, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a031-33, and Benediktov, \u00a7\u00a031, all cited above).

The Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances or the victim's behaviour (see Balogh v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a047940/99, \u00a7\u00a044, 20 July 2004, and Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV). The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must, for a violation to be found, go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention, the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092-94, ECHR 2000-XI).",

Russia, no. 22/03, \u00a7\u00a055, 9 April 2009).",

The Government did not dispute this allegation, referring to the fact that the official records relating to the cell population had been destroyed after the time-limit for their storage had expired. The Court has frequently found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the lack of personal space afforded to detainees (see, among other authorities, Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, \u00a7\u00a7 97 et seq., ECHR 2002VI; Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0104 et seq., ECHR 2005-X; Labzov v.

Shower facilities were non-existent and the outdoor exercise was of extremely limited duration because of the excessive number of inmates. The absence of such basic facilities as running water and a lavatory pan was apparently the consequence of an outdated design project of the Kopeysk IVS and the Court notes with satisfaction that it was taken out of service. However, at the material time the applicant had to endure conditions of detention which must have caused him considerable mental and physical suffering, diminishing his human dignity. In addition, the Court notes that the applicant appears to have contracted tuberculosis during his detention. The conditions of the applicant's detention thus amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article\u00a03 of the Convention, even in the absence of any positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant on the part of any domestic authority.",
