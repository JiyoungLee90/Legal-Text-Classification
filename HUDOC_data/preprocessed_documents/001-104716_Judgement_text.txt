The case originated in an application (no. 61773/08) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Greek national, Mr Gerasimos Bouliaris (“the applicant”), on 18 November 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr G. Georgas, a lawyer practising in Nafplio. The Greek Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent’s delegates, Mrs G. Papadaki, Advisor at the State Legal Council and Mrs M. Germani, Legal Assistant at the State Legal Council.
On 4 May 2010 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. In accordance with Protocol No. 14, the application was allocated to a Committee of three Judges.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Korinthia.
On 28 July 2000 he was involved in a car accident. On 20 November 2001 criminal proceedings were brought against him for manslaughter and bodily harm caused by a negligent act.
On 15 November 2005 the Korinthos First Instance Criminal Court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to a suspended prison sentence of sixteen months (judgment no. 3625/2005). The same day, the applicant lodged an appeal.
By judgment dated 29 January 2008 the Korinthos Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to a suspended prison sentence of thirteen months (judgment no. 129/2008).
On 25 February, 2008, the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. He challenged the reasoning of the appellate decision and alleged that his rights under Articles 6 §§ 2 and 3 (e) of the Convention had been violated.
