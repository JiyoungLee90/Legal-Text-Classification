The central argument underpinning the reasoning in that judgment lay in the consideration that \"by recommending that an accused\u2019s appeal be allowed or dismissed, the official of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department becomes objectively speaking his ally or his opponent\" (Borgers judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 214-B, pp. 31-32, para. 26).",

In a statement of principle, it is the right to adversarial proceedings which becomes the keystone of the judgment in its finding of a double breach of Article 6 (art. 6).",

As Judges G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc, Matscher and Pettiti judiciously remark in their dissenting opinion, it should also be pointed out - but as a subsidiary observation, as far as I am concerned - that in the aforementioned Borgers judgment the Court based its finding of a breach of Article 6 (art. 6) on the combination of two things: the fact that it was impossible for the accused to reply to the submissions of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department before the end of the hearing and the presence of that department\u2019s representative at the Court of Cassation\u2019s deliberations.
