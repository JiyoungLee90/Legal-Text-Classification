Minister van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit, C-461/03, judgment of 6 December 2005, ECR I-10513, \u00a7\u00a019) is raised before it, to comply with its obligation to bring the matter before the CJEU, unless it has established that the question raised is irrelevant or that the EU law provision in question has already been interpreted by the CJEU (acte \u00e9clair\u00e9) or that the correct application of EU law is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt (acte clair). The CJEU has also held that the existence of such a possibility must be assessed in the light of the specific characteristics of EU law, the particular difficulties to which its interpretation gives rise and the risk of divergences in judicial decisions within the EU (see Srl Cilfit and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v. Ministry of Health, 283/81, judgment of 6 October 1982, ECR 3415, \u00a7\u00a021, and X v.

He submitted that, in any event, a national court or tribunal could refer a matter to the CJEU of its own motion \u2013 it was therefore not a party\u2019s request but the substantial need for the CJEU\u2019s interpretation that triggered the duty incumbent on a court of last instance to make a reference for a preliminary ruling.

The task of interpreting and applying the provisions of EU law falls firstly to the CJEU, in the context of a request for a preliminary ruling, and secondly to the domestic courts in their capacity as courts of the Union, that is to say, when they give effect to a provision of EU law as interpreted by the CJEU (see Avoti\u0146\u0161 v. Latvia [GC], no.\u00a017502/07, \u00a7 100, ECHR\u00a02016). It is therefore primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, if necessary in conformity with EU law, the Court\u2019s role being confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such adjudication are compatible with the Convention (see Ullens de Schooten and Rezabek v. Belgium, nos. 3989/07 and 38353/07, \u00a7 54, 20 September 2011).

The Government argued that, although the applicant had initially requested that a reference for a preliminary ruling be addressed to the CJEU, by that time he had already withdrawn that request (see paragraph 46 above).

For the Court, the actual disbursement of the applicant\u2019s adjusted pension constituted a question inherently linked to the subject matter of the dispute started in 2006. It further observes that the issues raised by the application of section 80(1) of the 1997 Pensions Act were examined by the domestic courts as part of one and the same proceedings. Therefore, the separate treatment of those issues for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention would be artificial and unjustified.",

For the Court, the amount to be taken into account is rather the difference between the pension as initially fixed on 1 September 2006 and as eventually established on 5 November 2011, that is, a monthly difference of approximately EUR 16. Leaving aside the interim payments disbursed to the applicant, that difference could have added up to a total of approximately EUR 1,300 during that period. Furthermore, the proceedings also concerned the question whether or not the adjusted pension should be paid for the period between 1\u00a0May 2004 and 19 March 2005. In this regard, an amount of more than EUR\u00a02,000 (approximately 10.5 times the monthly difference between the applicant\u2019s initial pension of approximately EUR\u00a0250 and the eventually established amount of approximately EUR\u00a0465) was also arguably at stake.",

This does not exempt a domestic court from its Convention duty to give proper reasons. The K\u00faria did not put forward any reasoning to explain its interpretative stance. In this connection, an element of consideration, although not necessarily a decisive one, is that the K\u00faria did not base its interpretation on any case-law from the CJEU (see, mutatis mutandis, Dhahbi v. Italy, no.\u00a017120/09, \u00a7 33, 8 April 2014, and, conversely, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u00a0Divagsa v. Spain, no. 20631/92, Commission decision of 12 May 1993, Decisions and Reports 74, p. 280). Nor does it appear that the K\u00faria assessed the obvious nature of the adopted interpretation in the light of the specific characteristics of EU law, as required by the Cilfit case-law (see paragraphs 39 and 40 of the present judgment). Indeed, the Court is unable to identify any argument in the K\u00faria\u2019s judgment as to why it considered the interpretation it had adopted so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt, even in the light of the specific characteristics of EU law (see Ullens de Schooten and Rezabek v. Belgium, nos. 3989/07 and\u00a038353/07, \u00a7 62 in fine, 20 September 2011).",

                        "content": "5.\u00a0\u00a0Such lack of reasoning is all the more apparent when it is considered together with the fact that the K\u00faria completely ignored the applicant\u2019s argument concerning an alleged violation of Article 234 of the EC Treaty (see paragraphs 23 and 24 of the present judgment). Although Article 6 does not go so far as to require a detailed answer to every submission put forward, it does require judgments of tribunals adequately to state the reasons on which they are based (see, mutatis mutandis, Stichting\u00a0Mothers of Srebrenica and Others v.\u00a0the Netherlands (dec.), no.\u00a065542/12, \u00a7\u00a7 173-174, 11 June 2013, where the Court found even succinct reasons concerning a request for a preliminary ruling sufficient because, in the light of other findings, the reference to the CJEU would have been redundant). In the present case, where the correct interpretation of the relevant EU law was not a redundant question but the crux of the review proceedings before the K\u00faria, the applicant\u2019s reference to Article 234 of the EC Treaty would have warranted at least adequate reasoning as to the grounds underpinning the K\u00faria\u2019s judgment, in so far as it appears to contain an implicit application of the acte clair doctrine. It is of relevance in this respect that Article 94(6) of the Regulation was never subject to a preliminary ruling of the CJEU. There thus existed no wellestablished case-law concerning its correct interpretation (see paragraph 42 in fine of the present judgment, and contrast Krikorian v. France (dec.), no. 6459/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02325, 98 and 99, 26 November 2013).",

The Government have failed to provide any examples of Constitutional Court practice, let alone established case-law, showing that that court had, at the relevant time and in application of the relevant EU-law criteria, dealt with issues related to the domestic courts\u2019 failure to provide adequate reasoning for non-referrals to the CJEU.",
