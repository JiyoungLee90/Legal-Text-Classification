Namely, the complaints raised in the cited case, like those in the present application, concerned the allegedly inadequate disinfection of cells, poor conditions in the exercise yard and limited possibilities for outdoor walks, poor ventilation and dampness in the cells, as well as inconveniences inherent in the refurbishment of the prison premises. No violation of Article\u00a03 of the Convention was found in the Yarovenko case (cited above, \u00a7 120). The applicant in the present case has not provided any weighty evidence that could lead the Court to reach a different conclusion. While it appears from the case-file materials that the Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights did establish certain deficiencies in the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention in Kherson Prison no. 61 (see paragraph 12 above), there is no indication that they were serious enough to raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention.",

The Convention does not prohibit the imposition of a life sentence on those convicted of especially serious crimes, such as murder. Yet to be compatible with Article 3 such a sentence must be reducible de jure and de facto, meaning that there must be both a prospect of release for the prisoner and a possibility of review. The basis of such review must extend to assessing whether there are legitimate penological grounds for the continuing incarceration of the prisoner. These grounds include punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation. The balance between them is not necessarily static and may shift in the course of a sentence, so that the primary justification for detention at the outset may not be so after a lengthy period of service of sentence. The importance of the ground of rehabilitation is underlined, since it is here that the emphasis of European penal policy now lies, as reflected in the practice of the Contracting States, in the relevant standards adopted by the Council of Europe, and in the relevant international materials (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059-81).",

As recently stated by the Court, in the context of Article 8 of the Convention, \u2018emphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration has become a mandatory factor that the member States need to take into account in designing their penal policies\u2019 (Khoroshenko v. Russia [GC], no. 41418/04, \u00a7\u00a0121, ECHR 2015; see also the cases referred to in Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102). Similar considerations apply under Article 3, given that respect for human dignity requires prison authorities to strive towards a life sentenced prisoner\u2019s rehabilitation (see Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103-104). It follows that the requisite review must take account of the progress that the prisoner has made towards rehabilitation, assessing whether such progress has been so significant that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0113116). A review limited to compassionate grounds is therefore insufficient (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0127).",

Therefore prisoners who receive a whole life sentence are entitled to know from the outset what they must do in order to be considered for release and under what conditions. This includes when a review of sentence will take place or may be sought (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 122). In this respect the Court has noted clear support in the relevant comparative and international materials for a review taking place no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of sentence, with periodic reviews thereafter (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 68, 118, 119 and 120).

However, according to the information provided by the head of the Clemency Department during a media briefing on 6 July 2016, by June 2016 more than seventy life prisoners had already served the required minimum of twenty years in prison and forty of them had requested presidential clemency, but their requests had been rejected (see paragraph 91 above). Such a drastic discrepancy in the authorities\u2019 interpretation of the twenty-year \u201cwaiting\u201d period is another indication for the Court of the lack of sufficient clarity and certainty in the applicable criteria and conditions for a life-sentence review under the presidential clemency procedure.",

One of them \u2013 that the minimum period of imprisonment in the event that presidential clemency was granted would be thirty-eight years and nine months \u2013 is concordant with the interpretation of the legal provision in question by the authors of the Scientific and Practical Commentary on the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences of Ukraine (see paragraph 84 above).

No such information is made public in Ukraine, except for the general outline of the criteria relevant for the examination of requests for clemency (see paragraph 86 above), to demonstrate how, if at all, those criteria are applied in practice by the President of Ukraine.

Life prisoners are to be provided with an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves. As to the extent of any obligations incumbent on States in this regard, the Court considers that even though States are not responsible for achieving the rehabilitation of life prisoners, they nevertheless have a duty to make it possible for such prisoners to rehabilitate themselves. Were it otherwise, a life prisoner could in effect be denied the possibility of rehabilitation, with the consequence that the review required for a life sentence to be reducible, in which a life prisoner\u2019s progress towards rehabilitation is to be assessed, might never be genuinely capable of leading to the commutation, remission or termination of the life sentence or to the conditional release of the prisoner. The obligation to offer a possibility of rehabilitation is to be seen as an obligation of means, not one of result. However, it entails a positive obligation to secure prison regimes to life prisoners which are compatible with the aim of rehabilitation and enable such prisoners to make progress towards their rehabilitation. In this context the Court has previously held that such an obligation exists in situations where it is the prison regime or the conditions of detention which obstruct rehabilitation (see Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104, with further references).",

In this respect, the Hutchinson judgment represented \u201ca peak in a growing trend towards downgrading the role of the Court before certain domestic jurisdictions, with the serious risk that the Convention is applied with double standards\u201d.Six months after the delivery of judgement in Murray, which reflected the Court\u2019s hands-on approach on the issue of the review mechanism, it was difficult to explain the hands-off approach in Hutchinson.. The suspicion of double standards in the Court\u2019s practice is compounded by Matio\u0161aitis and Others v. Lithuania, in which the Court has performed a more thorough control of the Lithuanian review mechanism, as compared with the control of the British review mechanism in Hutchinson.",

This alternative is logically untenable. The requirement of provision of reasons only makes sense if they can be tested by an independent authority. Asking the governmental or administrative authority to provide reasons regarding the penological needs for continued incarceration, but depriving the detained person of the benefit of the supervision of these reasons by a court, means little, if anything at all, in terms of restricting arbitrariness on the part of the Government or the authorities.",

This possibility of extension owes in particular to the fact that the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d is a broad one and is not susceptible to exhaustive definition, but covers the moral and physical integrity of the person and thus embraces multiple aspects of the person\u2019s physical and social identity (see, as one of the most recent authorities, Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, 25 September 2018; but note also Abu Zubaydah v. Lithuania, no. 464454/11, \u00a7 664, 31 May 2018, and Al Nashiri v. Romania, no. 33234/12, \u00a7 697, 31 May 2018, which, although adopted earlier, became final subsequently to Denisov (on 8\u00a0October 2018) and in which the interpretation of the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d as covering the moral and physical integrity of the person is hedged with the caveat \u201cdepending on the circumstances\u201d). In Melnik the Court found violations of Articles 3 and 13, but, referring to Nuray \u015een v.\u00a0Turkey\u00a0(no. 2), no. 25354/94, 30 March 2004 and Skubenko v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a041152/98, 6 April 2004, held, already in its preliminary considerations, that it was \u201cnot appropriate to take [also the matter of the State\u2019s alleged interference with the applicant\u2019s right to correspond from prison] up separately at this stage\u201d, notwithstanding that this complaint under Article 8 was not an \u201celaboration\u201d of that under Article 3 (paragraph 63). No less meaningful for such a resolution was the fact that the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 8 was lodged after the communication to the respondent Government of his several initial and later also additional complaints under Articles 3 and 13. In these particular circumstances of that case any claim that the complaint under Article 8 was left unexamined owing specifically to its legal link with Article 3 would be shaky. In addition to that, when considering that Article 8 may extend to situations of deprivation of liberty and afford protection in relation to conditions during detention (which is a \u201cnatural\u201d domain of Article 3), the Court referred to Raninen v. Finland, 16 December 1997, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII; curiously enough, in the latter case the Court, despite the general acknowledgment of the possibility of the legal interrelatedness of the complaints under Articles 3 and 8, found no violation of Article 3 (but it found violations of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2), and then held that no separate issue arose under Article 8, because the \u201capplicant based [this] complaint ... on the same facts as that under Article 3\u201d and had not shown that there were no \u201csufficient elements enabling it to find that the treatment complained of entailed such adverse effects on [the applicant\u2019s] physical or moral integrity as to constitute an interference with [his] right to respect for private life as guaranteed by Article 8\u201d (paragraph 64).",

Complaints under Article 3 and Article 8 can be interrelated, but, as a rule, they cannot overlap on the sole basis of the legal link between the subject matter of Article 3 and that of Article 8. Even if exceptions are not inconceivable in theory, the conclusive criterion allowing for a resolution that Article 3 and Article 8 complaints are interrelated, fully or in part, is the one already mentioned in paragraph15 above \u2013 the particular circumstances of the case. This criterion points, first and foremost, to the shared factual background of the concurring complaints. Only when the complaints under Articles 3 and 8 do share some factual background can an auxiliary criterion of legal links between the two Articles be brought in to allow for determining that the non-isolatedness of the provisions of these Articles may be sufficient for the Court to resolve that the complaint falls under such requirements of the Convention, which, in view of the particular circumstances of the case, may be seen as overlapping to some significant extent, and this absolves the Court from examining the same factual situation from the standpoint of all the Articles invoked.",

In the Court\u2019s case-law such complaints were always treated as not overlapping and were examined separately (provided that they were not inadmissible on Convention-warranted grounds). The fact that the Court had already examined the complaints under Article 3 did not prevent it from addressing those under Article 8, let alone induce it to declare that owing to that examination it was absolved from another one, properly requested by an individual, who exercised his or her right under Article 34.

Again in Poltoratskiy v. Ukraine, no. 38812/97, ECHR 2003V, it did not see itself as precluded from examining the applicant\u2019s complaint as regards the restrictions on family visits in prison and finding a violation of Article 8, even though it had already found a violation of Article 3 on account of the conditions of detention (as well as other violations of Article 3); going even further, the Court also examined the complaint under Article 9 (and found a violation of that Article). In Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, 22\u00a0December 2008, the Court found inter alia, both a violation of Article 3 on account of the lack of proper medical assistance in the remand prison and a violation of Article 8 on account of the searches of the applicant\u2019s premises. In Visloguzov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a032362/02, 20 May 2010, it found violations of Article 3 on account both of the physical conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention and of the lack of appropriate medical assistance for the applicant in detention, but also a violation of Article 8 on account of the seizure and retention by the prison officials of the letter from the Court.

In Nazarenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 39483/98, 29 April 2003 and Dankevich v.

For example, in Varnas v. Lithuania, no. 42615/06, 9 July 2013 the applicant complained of his inability to receive conjugal visits from his wife during his pre-trial detention (arguing, inter alia, that his entitlement in that respect had been more restricted than that of a convicted person serving a prison sentence); in Costel Gaciu v. Romania, no. 39633/10, \u00a7 50, 23 June 2015 the applicant complained of the refusal of his requests for conjugal visits for the sole reason that he was not a convicted prisoner (under domestic law a person being held in pre-trial detention was not entitled to conjugal visits, in contrast with a person already convicted, who had such a right). The Court considered that since it had found a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8, it was unnecessary to consider whether there had been a violation of Article 8 alone. This setting aside of an Article\u00a08 complaint, however, represented a very different approach from that used in the present case, where such a complaint has been left unexamined from any angle. Interestingly enough, the applicants in the above-mentioned cases did not invoke Articles 8 or 14 themselves: Mr\u00a0Varnas relied on Article 3, and Mr Gaciu on Articles 3 and 7. It was the Court which proprio motu requalified their complaints as falling under Articles 8 and 14, based on the consideration that the essence of their grievances appeared \u201cto be the allegedly unjustified difference in treatment as concerns conjugal visits between himself, a person in pre-trial detention, and a convicted prisoner serving a prison sentence\u201d (see Varnas, \u00a7 92, and Costel Gaciu, \u00a7 43). From this perspective, it is not so evident that the Court should have declared at all that it set aside the complaints under Article 8 taken alone, because such complaints were not specifically identified by either the applicants or the Court itself.",

For instance, in \u00d6calan v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 2), nos. 24069/03 and 3 others, 18 March 2014, no violation of Article\u00a08 was found as regards the alleged restrictions on visits by and the applicant\u2019s communication with his family members, but a violation of Article\u00a03 was found on account of the lack of possibility that the applicant, a lifer, could be released on parole. More generally, the violations of Article\u00a03 being found on account of the irreducibility of a life sentence were not a justification for the failure also to examine other complaints under Article 8. The latter were not set aside; see for example, Harakchiev and Tolumov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, nos. 15018/11 and 61199/12, ECHR 2014 (extracts), where one of the applicants complained that his correspondence with his lawyers was being routinely opened and read by the prison authorities and that some letters had not been dispatched to his lawyers; this complaint was examined, but rejected for being \u201cpartly out of time and partly manifestly ill-founded\u201d (paragraph 277).",

As already mentioned more than once, this formula was not first introduced in the case which gave the template its name. Even before it the Court\u2019s case-law sometimes resorted to the explanation that the examination of the \u201cmain legal questions\u201d absolved the Court from the need to examine certain other questions. Several authorities, in which that idea had materialised, were referred to in a motley list of judgments set out in paragraph 156 of Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu, in particular: Kamil Uzun v. Turkey, no. 37410, 10\u00a0May 2007; Women On Waves and Others v.\u00a0Portugal, no. 31276/05, 3\u00a0February 2009; Velcea and Maz\u0103re v.\u00a0Romania, no. 64301/01, 1\u00a0December 2009; Villa v.

In order to substantiate the setting aside of Article 8 (and some other) complaints, the Court used the above-discussed tried-and-tested device \u2013 the \u201cno separate issue\u201d formula, which it apparently considered to be more appropriate than the \u201cmain legal questions\u201d formula, which would amount to a blank declaration that it would not consider certain complaints because there was simply no need. And rightly so. In that case a violation of Article 3 was found on the grounds that the living conditions in a social care home, to which the applicant was exposed, amounted to degrading treatment. The Court, however, held that neither those conditions nor the restrictive guardianship regime, which had effectively barred the applicant from taking part in community life and developing relations with persons of his choosing, raised an issue under Article 8 which would have been separate from that already examined under Article 3, as well as Articles 5, 6 and 13 (paragraphs 212, 213 and 252).

Article 8 complaints, which have originated from other facts than those complained of under Article 3, were rejected not as raising no separate issue, but as raising no issue at all. There is abundant case-law to that effect. A typical example would be Iustin Robertino Micu v. Romania, no. 41040/11, 13 January 2015. The applicant was suffering from an illness. While being under the control of the police, whom he had informed of his condition, he was nevertheless refused medical treatment (as well as food and drink). On that account the Court found a violation of Article 3 (it also found violations of Articles 5 \u00a7 1 and 13). The applicant\u2019s other complaints, including one under Article 8, were rejected as manifestly ill-founded, using the habitual formula that these complaints \u201cdo not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols\u201d.",

It is limited to a reference to two judgments, namely Nikolova and Velichkova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 7888/03, 20 December 2007, and Timus and Tarus v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 70077/11, 15 October 2013. Nikolova and Velichkova states: \u201c[h]aving regard to the grounds on which [the Court] has found a dual violation of Article 2 ..., [it] considers that no separate issue arises under Article 3\u201d (paragraph 78). But, curiously enough, paragraph 58 of Timus and Tarus, referred to in paragraph 156 of Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu, does not contain the formula \u201cno separate issue\u201d: it states that the Court, in view of its findings (that is, the finding of a violation of Article 2 under both its substantive and procedural limbs), \u201cdoes not consider it necessary to also examine the case under Article 3\u201d. Perhaps this should explain the caveat \u201cmutatis mutandis\u201d, contained in the reference (although \u201cmutatis mutandis\u201d precedes the reference to Nikolova and Velichkova, not that to Timus and Tarus). Notwithstanding that caveat (or maybe even reinforced by it), the references to Nikolova and Velichkova and Timus and Tarus, as well as the \u201cno separate issue\u201d conclusion in Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu, signify that even in the latter case the formula \u201cno separate issue\u201d was understood as synonymous to the formula \u201cnot necessary to examine\u201d. They both pointed to the fact that (i) the questions raised in the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3, taken alone or in conjunction with Article 13, but set aside by the Court, had indeed already been examined by it, fully or in part, from the standpoint of Article 2; (ii) the consideration that the complaints already examined under Article 2 were in essence the same as those lodged under Article 3 owed to the fact that they shared, at least in part, the same factual background; (iii) the separate examination of the same set of facts from one more standpoint therefore was redundant.",

In Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m as many as four complaints, namely the ones under Articles 6, 7 and 13 and Article\u00a02 of Protocol no. 1, were left unexamined in view of the finding of a violation of Article 10. In Mehmet Hatip Dicle the Court found a violation of Article 10, which, in its opinion, raised the \u201cmain legal question\u201d, and then declared that it would not address the complaints under Articles 7, 14\u00a0and 18. Finally, in Varnava and Others the Grand Chamber, having found continuing violations of Articles 2, 3 and 5 (as regards the latter, not on all counts, as invoked by the applicants), resolved not to examine the complaints under Articles 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13 and 14.",

This issue was definitely not involved in Kamil Uzun, where the \u201cmain legal question\u201d was the one raised under Article 3; not in Women On Waves and Others, Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, or Mehmet Hatip Dicle, where it was raised under Article 10; and not in The Arge\u015f College of Legal Advisers (Article 11); and not in Villa v. Italy (Article 2 of Protocol no. 4). In most of the cases referred to in paragraph 156 of Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu, that is to say, in all of them, except Velcea and Maz\u0103re and Varnava and Others, the complaints under Article 2 were not the ones which the Court assessed as raising the \u201cmain legal questions\u201d. In fact, in Kamil Uzun, Villa, The Arge\u015f College of Legal Advisers, Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Mehmet Hatip Dicle Article 2 was not at all invoked by the applicants. In Women on Waves and Others the complaint under Article 2 was set aside by the Court on the grounds that the \u201cmain legal question\u201d was the one raised in the complaint under Article 10. As already mentioned, Article 2 was involved only in two of the cited cases: Velcea and Maz\u0103re and Varnava and Others, but even in these two cases the differences with Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu were outstanding. In Velcea and Maz\u0103re the legal question, which the Court assessed as \u201cmain\u201d, was indeed the one examined under Article 2, but the legal question which was left unexamined concerned only Article 5, and not Articles 8 or 14. The difference is even more striking with Varnava and Others, where the legal issue raised in the complaint under Article 2 also was among those assessed by the Court as one of the \u201cmain\u201d ones, but the complaint under Article 3 was also examined as separate from that under Article 2, that is to say, the finding of a violation of Article 2 was not seen as sufficient for resolving that the complaint under Article 3 (or, for that matter, Article 5) could be set aside as not raising a legal question which was in any sense less than \u201cmain\u201d or as raising \u201cno separate issue\u201d (cf.\u00a0paragraph 49 above). Without going into further detail, it is evident that the list of judgments in paragraph 156 of Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu obscures rather than clarifies the law proceeding from the precedents referred to and ostensibly relied upon.",

Irrespective of the issues examined or left unexamined in these cases, they all, save Varnava and Others alone, refer to Kamil Uzun. Perhaps this could explain why, prior to being consolidated in Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu, the \u201cmain legal questions\u201d formula was called, in the Court\u2019s argot \u201cUzun formula\u201d. Only in Velcea and Maz\u0103re and Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m there are references to judgments other than Kamil Uzun, and these not always involved the same Articles as the cases in which those judgments were relied upon. What is more, these judgments, in their turn, refer to Kamil Uzun and sometimes to other cases, which, again in their turn, most often referred to Kamil Uzun, but sometimes introduced the \u201cmain legal questions\u201d formula without any reference to previous judgments. A yet deeper investigation would show that in some instances the use of the \u201cmain legal questions\u201d formula was substantiated with the reference to judgments, where that formula was not used. Perhaps the earliest judgment (or at least one of the earliest) referred to at the far end of this multi-storey passage from judgment to judgment (sometimes with a change of wording), which resulted in what has now become the C\u00e2mpeanu formula, was Sadak and Others v. Turkey (no. 1), nos. 29900/96 and 3 others, ECHR 2001VIII, where the Court left unexamined the complaints under Articles 10, 11 and 14 (as well as some of the complaints under Article 6), on the grounds that it had already examined most of the complaints under Article 6; there the Court agreed with the European Commission of Human Rights, which had held before, that the \u201cmain legal questions\u201d were raised in the latter.",

That would be understandable, given that the legal questions already examined and those set aside were interrelated by their shared factual background. The notion of the \u201cmain legal questions\u201d, which is central to the formula in question, unequivocally presupposes that the remaining legal questions are in one way or another subsumed by the legal questions already examined. For a legal question can indisputably only be \u201cmain\u201d to something, which is comparable to it, and that something cannot be anything other than a legal question itself, which, in its turn, is \u201csecondary\u201d (\u201csupplementary\u201d, \u201cauxiliary\u201d etc.); and it can be \u201csecondary\u201d only by virtue of the fact that it is \u201cderived\u201d from, or subsumed (fully or partly) by, the \u201cmain\u201d question.

For instance, in Trosin v.

I would not go so far as to suggest that there was (let alone still is) a structural (systemic) problem in Ukraine as regards family visits in prison, but the domestic legal framework as described and assessed in Trosin (although it had undergone some amendments, mentioned in, inter alia, paragraph 99 of the present judgment), does not seem, at least at a first glance, to be on an extremely friendly footing with the general principles pertaining to prisoners\u2019 visiting rights and the Court\u2019s approach in the relevant cases, as summarised in, say, Khoroshenko v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no.\u00a041418/04, ECHR 2015 (or at least was not on such a footing at the material time).

Two applicants, a married couple, one of whom is a lifer, complained of their inability to have long-term visits in prison. They complained under Articles 8, 12 and 13, but on the factual side the gist of their grievances, basically, was the same: the rejection of their requests to be allowed long-term visits. Most notably, the applicant in detention does not complain of the conditions of detention or the irreducibility of his life sentence. The legal question raised in the Bigun couple\u2019s complaint cannot be legitimately dismissed as something \u201cminor\u201d, \u201ctrivial\u201d, \u201cinsignificant\u201d or \u201cnonessential\u201d etc., let alone \u201csubordinate\u201d or \u201cauxiliary\u201d, because \u2013 contrary to the Article 8 complaint in the instant case \u2013 it stands in proud isolation and has no \u201cmain\u201d counterpart.

To wit, his (hypothetical) new application may be (as is the usual thing to do) joined to the one already communicated under Article 8; then, if a violation of Article 3 is found (many would say that this might be a predictable outcome in the post-Vinter era), and given that the \u201cmain legal question\u201d, namely the one relating to Article 3, has already been examined, his (and his wife\u2019s) complaint under Article\u00a08 regarding family visits may be assessed by the Court as undeserving of examination, that is to say, something \u201cminor\u201d, \u201ctrivial\u201d, \u201cinsignificant\u201d, \u201cnonessential\u201d, you name it.

If, however, the Bigun couple\u2019s future solitary Article 8 application (like that of Mr Trosin) is examined on the merits (which, I believe, would be fair, provided that the complaint is not inadmissible on Convention-warranted grounds), one can reasonably and legitimately ask why those applicants who complain of a plurality of infringements of their unrelated rights are discriminated against as compared with those who allege only one infringement?

Three months after the delivery of that judgment, it is not yet final, as a request for the case\u2019s referral to the Grand Chamber is pending before the competent panel. Whatever may be the outcome of that case, I have a pressing moral obligation to refer to and commend the most elegant partly dissenting opinion of my distinguished colleague Pere Pastor Vilanova, whose arguments I find to be all-resistant. His approach is very much like mine \u2013 or, to put it more correctly, mine is very much like his. It appears that I follow in the footsteps of at least one like-minded judge. On this occasion I should not fail to mention also Judge Bo\u0161njak, who in the instant case has dissented on the same point as myself. If more judges share our approach, this should give us hope that the C\u00e2mpeanu formula may not stay there forever. Perhaps all courts of the world (not excluding this Court, for \u2013 I repeat myself \u2013 who does not err?) have resorted, at times, to practices which later proved to be legally unsustainable. It is in the interests of capital-J Justice that they (again, not excluding this Court) acknowledge their stumbles sooner rather than later \u2013 and abandon them.",

In this respect, I share all the crucial arguments advanced by Judge K\u016bris in his separate opinion. Above all, I believe that the issue of restrictions on spousal visits is factually and legally separate from the questions of (a)\u00a0adequacy of medical care in prison and of (b) irreducibility of life sentence. Furthermore, I consider it impossible to characterise the issue of such restrictions as being of \u201csecondary legal importance\u201d as compared with the \u201cmain legal questions\u201d pertaining to Article 3 of the Convention. A\u00a0separate examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint regarding restrictions on spousal visits is particularly necessary in the light of the existing case-law abundantly cited in Judge K\u016bris\u2019s separate opinion. The latter convincingly cites a number of cases, including recent Grand Chamber cases, where the Court, alongside issues regarding the applicants\u2019 ill-treatment while serving their prison sentences, addressed the question of visit restrictions.",

Although the judgment in that case is not yet final, my colleague\u2019s separate opinion convincingly argues that failure to address complaints raised by applicants under the guise of regarding them as secondary has no support in the Convention and its interpretation and may be considered as tantamount to a denial of justice. In the present case, one can reasonably assume that the applicant retains a genuine interest in the examination of his Article\u00a08 complaint, which for him may be of fundamental importance.
