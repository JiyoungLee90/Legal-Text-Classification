Croatia (dec.), no. 20862/02, ECHR 2002-VII). It further refers to its judgment in the Pavi\u0107 case, where it held that as of 29 December 2005 a request for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time under sections 27 and 28 of the Courts Act has become an effective domestic remedy in respect of the length of court proceedings in Croatia (see Pavi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 21846/08, \u00a7 36, 28 January 2010). It follows that in the period between 15 March 2002 and 28 December 2005 the applicants could have lodged a constitutional complaint to complain about the length of proceedings in their part before the first- and the second-instance court, and in the period between 29 December 2005 and 17 February 2006 (the date when the second-instance decision was served on the applicants\u2019 representative) to lodge a request for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time However, they did not do so. It follows that in so far as the applicants\u2019 complaint concerns the proceedings in their part before the ordinary courts it is inadmissible under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and must be rejected pursuant to Article\u00a035 \u00a7 4 thereof. In view of this conclusion it is not necessary to examine the Government\u2019s further inadmissibility objection based on non-compliance with the six-month rule.",
