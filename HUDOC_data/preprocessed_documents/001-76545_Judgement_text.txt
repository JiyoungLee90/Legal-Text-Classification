In substance, he also complained about the lack of an effective domestic remedy in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings (Article 13 of the Convention).
On 11 June 2004 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

On 27 November 2001 the request was forwarded to the Austrian authorities by the Slovenian Ministry of Justice (Ministrstvo za pravosodje). On 11 April 2002 the Ministry forwarded the minutes of the hearing it had received from  to the Ptuj District Court and on 22 April 2002 the applicant was requested to provide a translation of the minutes within 15 days. On 7 June 2002 the applicant submitted the translation, stating that he had received it from the court’s translator only on 28 May 2002.
