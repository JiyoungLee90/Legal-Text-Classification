Meanwhile, the applicant and his parents had been pressured by the Kazakh security services to convince his brother to return to Kazakhstan and collaborate with them. Shortly thereafter, in 2005, the Kazakh authorities had opened a criminal case against the applicant on suspicion of computer fraud. Later that year, due to the Kazakh authorities\u2019 pressure and his Russian ethnic origin, the applicant had decided to move to Russia. In 2006, the Kazakh authorities had pardoned the applicant and his criminal record had been expunged. The applicant stressed that throughout his time living in Russia he had been a law-abiding person, had been in full compliance with immigration regulations and had a wife and child who were Russian nationals. He pointed out that he was an ethnic Russian, that he did not speak Kazakh, had no family in that country, and that he had neither a place to live in Kazakhstan nor the financial means to move there with his wife and infant son.",

He stressed that the FSB had failed to produce a single item of evidence to substantiate their allegations about the threat the applicant posed for national security. Referring to the case of Liu v. Russia (no. 42086/05, 6\u00a0December 2007), he pointed out that the authorities had to provide evidence proving the applicant was a threat to national security, given that the sanction against him, the five-year exclusion, would lead to the disruption of his family life. The court examined and dismissed the request, stating that as the matter was within the FSB\u2019s exclusive competence it fell outside the scope of judicial review. From the documents submitted to the Court, it is unclear whether the FSB presented the Regional Court with any evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s case, other than its letter to the applicant of 13 August 2009 (see paragraph 10 above) and copies of the relevant legal provisions governing the activities of the FSB and the applicable immigration regulations.",

Where children are involved, their best interests must be taken into account and national decision-making bodies have a duty to assess evidence in respect of the practicality, feasibility and proportionality of any removal of a non-national parent in order to give effective protection and sufficient weight to the best interests of the children directly affected by it (see Jeunesse v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands [GC], no. 12738/10, \u00a7 109, 3 October 2014).",

Mindful of its subsidiary role and the wide margin of appreciation open to States in matters of national security, the Court accepts that it is for each State, as the guardian of its people\u2019s safety, to make its own assessment on the basis of the facts known to it. Significant weight must, therefore, attach to the judgment of the domestic authorities, and especially of the national courts, which are better placed to assess the evidence relating to the existence of a national security threat (see Liu (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7 85).",

Therefore, the Court must examine whether the domestic proceedings were attended by sufficient procedural guarantees. It reiterates in this connection that even where national security is at stake, the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measures affecting fundamental human rights must be subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent body competent to review the reasons for the decision and relevant evidence, if need be with appropriate procedural limitations on the use of classified information (see, mutatis mutandis, Regner v. the Czech Republic [GC], no.\u00a035289/11, \u00a7\u00a7 151 and 161, ECHR 2017 (extracts)). The individual must be able to challenge the executive\u2019s assertion that national security is at stake. Failing such safeguards, the police or other State authorities would be able to encroach arbitrarily on rights protected by the Convention (see Nolan and K. v.\u00a0Russia, no. 2512/04, \u00a7 71, 12 February 2009, and Al-Nashif, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 123-24).",

They thus failed to examine a critical aspect of the case, namely whether the FSB had been able to demonstrate the existence of specific facts serving as a basis for its assessment that the applicant presented a national security risk (see, by contrast, Regner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0154). Those elements lead the Court to conclude that the national courts confined themselves to a purely formal examination of the decision concerning the applicant\u2019s exclusion from Russia (see, for similar reasoning, Liu (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 89, and Kamenov v. Russia, no.\u00a017570/15, \u00a7 36, 7 March 2017).
