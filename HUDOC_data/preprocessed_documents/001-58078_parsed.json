The main purpose of provisional transfer is to ensure that the consolidation area is rationally cultivated during the interim period. The land transferred becomes the property of the transferees subject to a condition subsequent: ownership of it reverts to the original owner if the allocation is not confirmed in the final consolidation scheme (Eigentum unter aufl\u00f6sender Bedingung, section\u00a022 (2)).

Indeed, they used this possibility and filed an appeal in October 1983 against the original consolidation scheme. The thrust of their complaints was rejected by the Upper Austria Board on the ground, inter alia, that the parcels allotted to the applicants were of approximately the same value as their former holdings and that, on the whole, the agricultural performances under the new situation were at least as good as under the old one. It is to be noted that the Board only accepted that the configuration of a relatively small plot (2.2ha) should be re-examined by the District Authority with a view to making it more functional (see paragraph 9 above).",

It further held that, all in all, the consolidation measures had led to an increase in productivity which compensated for certain small disadvantages (see paragraph 14 above).",

Concerning the length of the consolidation proceedings, the Court notes that the facts in issue are clearly distinguishable from those in the cases of Erkner and Hofauer and Poiss (cited above at paragraph 38). Whereas in those cases the consolidation scheme had not yet been finally adopted at the time of the Court\u2019s ruling - the provisional transfer of parcels having lasted for an extensive period of time -, in the present case a first consolidation scheme was published only three years after the provisional transfer was effected (see paragraph 8 above). Following an appeal by Mr\u00a0and Mrs Pr\u00f6tsch, a final scheme - including some improvement in respect of the applicants - came into force three years later (see paragraph 13 above). The status of provisional transfer was therefore maintained for a total of six years, well below the periods endured by the applicants in the above-mentioned cases (between sixteen and twenty-four years). In these circumstances, having regard to the statutory aim of the provisional transfer, a period of six years cannot be considered, in itself, to be unreasonably long.",
