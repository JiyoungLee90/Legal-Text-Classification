The assignment was given last spring following a tendering competition and, according to the information provided, most of the work on the assignment is being performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019  office. [Mr A] has been entrusted with the task of providing advice in connection with the assignment and will thus be one of the people who will provide the services in question. In this context he has also had some direct contact with a representative of ABG Sundal Collier. According to the submitted documents, the fee for the assignment will be approximately NOK 300,000. The assignment has not yet been completed. The company seeking listing will ultimately be liable for payment to PricewaterhouseCoopers.",

The company refers, among other things, to the information that PricewaterhouseCoopers has obtained approximately six per cent of the commissions carried out for ABG Sundal Collier during the last three years. A commission concerning a stock market introduction is very prestigious and is currently a rare occurrence. It is obvious that PricewaterhouseCoopers has considerable interest in obtaining this type and other kinds of assignments from ABG Sundal Collier, a main actor in this market. As a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers, [Mr A.] has a direct financial interest in the company\u2019s income and future income potential. What is decisive is how this matter would appear to the public. The counter-action in the case concerns a considerable compensation claim against Sundal Collier & Co ASA. According to the information available, there is currently no activity in this company, and it is obvious that, for the purposes of the impartiality issue, this company ought to be identified with ABG Sundal Collier, which has continued the daughter company\u2019s activity. There is clearly too close a connection between [Mr A.] and the respondent for [Mr A.] to serve as a judge in the case. A further disqualifying circumstance is that [Mr E.] of ABG Sundal Collier is a central witness in the case with regard to the question whether [the applicant company\u2019s] representative during a meeting with Sundal Collier & Co ASA, attended by [Mr E.], made statements which could provide a basis for demanding confiscation of assets. It is untenable for [Mr A.] to assess whether the witness statement from a person with whom he has a relationship of continuous professional cooperation is valid.",

This did not mean that the High Court would have to give a separate judgment on the former issues. However, as was apparent from its decision of 17 November 2003, the High Court had already on 23 October 2003 entertained serious doubts as to the need to continue the proceedings by hearing the parties on the causation issues. The decision to disjoin the proceedings made sense only because, as early as 23 October 2003, the High Court had taken the prima facie view, as it indeed decided on 17 November 2003, that it would not wish to hear the parties on the causation issue since the counter-claim would fail on its merits.",

Thus it could not be seriously denied that the High Court\u2019s decision to disjoin the proceedings, which de facto implied a prima facie assessment of the case, might well and was actually likely to have been influenced by lay member A.\u2019s participation in the first six days of the proceedings.",

The loose connection between Mr A. and Sundal Collier was also illustrated by the fact that he had not thought of raising the impartiality issue until four and a half days into the hearing.

The existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention must be determined according to a subjective test, that is, on the basis of the personal conviction of a particular judge in a given case, and also according to an objective test, that is by ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see Wettstein v.\u00a0Switzerland, no. 33958/96, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2000-XII; P\u00e9tur Th\u00f3r Sigur\u00f0sson v.

Accordingly, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the party concerned is important but not decisive.
