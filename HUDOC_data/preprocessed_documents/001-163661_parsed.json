The court also noted that although prisoners\u2019 human rights and fundamental freedoms could only be restricted by laws and not by legal acts of a lower order, the desire to grow a beard could not be considered as such a right or freedom. Therefore, unless it was related to other rights, such as, for example, religious freedom, the growing of a beard could be restricted by internal prison rules. Lastly, the Supreme Administrative Court considered that a prohibition on growing beards could be justified by the prison authorities\u2019 need to swiftly identify prisoners, and thus it was necessary and proportionate.",

Relying on Costello-Roberts v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (25 March 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 247C), they contended that not every act or measure which may be said to affect adversely the physical or moral integrity of a person necessarily gives rise to an interference with private life. The Government noted that the Court, in Tig v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 8165/03, 24 May 2005), refrained from establishing whether a prohibition on having a beard would in itself constitute an interference with the right to respect for someone\u2019s private life. That same question was examined by the Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania in the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraph 12 above), and that court held that the mere wish to grow a beard could not be considered an element of human dignity that is protected by law. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s desire to grow a beard had not been motivated by reasons of religious expression, nor had he had a long and established history of wearing a beard. The Government also submitted that in the domestic proceedings the applicant had not argued that the prohibition on growing a beard had interfered with his private life, but had only focused on health-related reasons. Accordingly, the Government considered that the applicant\u2019s physical and moral integrity had not suffered to such a degree as to fall within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention.",

The severity of a violation should be assessed taking account of both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Gagliano Giorgi v. Italy, no.\u00a023563/07, \u00a7 55, ECHR\u00a02012 (extracts), and the cases cited therein).",

As to the latter aim, the Court observes that the Government did not explain how it was related to any of the \u201clegitimate aims\u201d expressly mentioned in Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. As to the prevention of disorder and crime, the Government did not clearly identify how allowing the applicant (or other prisoners) to grow a beard could lead to disorder and crime \u2013 for instance, they never mentioned situations where there had been attempts by prisoners to commit offences that could have been helped in some way by the presence of facial hair. Nor did the Government argue that the prohibition on beards was aimed at ensuring respect for social norms and standards among prisoners (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, S.A.S. v. France, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0121122, where the Government invoked the need to ensure \u201crespect for the minimum requirements of living together\u201d).

In the present case, the Court has expressed its reservations as to the existence of a legitimate aim pursued by the impugned restriction on the applicant\u2019s Article 8 rights (see paragraph 54 above). It also takes note of the conclusion of the Parliamentary Ombudsperson, in a case similar to the applicant\u2019s and which was delivered around the same time as the applicant\u2019s complaints were examined by the domestic courts, that such a prohibition could not be justified by hygiene requirements or by the need to identify prisoners (see paragraph 19 above). The Court further considers that the Government did not demonstrate that the absolute prohibition on growing a beard, irrespective of its hygienic, esthetic or other characteristics, and not allowing for any exceptions (see paragraph 56 above), was proportionate. Lastly, it observes that in the applicant\u2019s case the prohibition on beards did not seem to affect other types of facial hair, such as moustaches or sideburns, thereby raising concerns of arbitrariness.",

I am not persuaded that the Court should adhere to this method of proceeding.

Secondly, it is difficult to establish general legal principles which may be relevant in other similar cases.
