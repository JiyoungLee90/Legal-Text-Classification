This right includes the right to compensation in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage and the restoration of labour, pension, housing and other rights. The damage must be compensated for in full, irrespective of the fault of the investigator, prosecutor or court (paragraph 1). Paragraph 2 confers the \u201cright to rehabilitation\u201d on defendants who have been acquitted, against whom charges have been dropped, in respect of whom proceedings have been discontinued or whose convictions have been quashed in their entirety or in part. However, no right to compensation arises where the prosecution is terminated on \u201cnonrehabilitative\u201d grounds, such as in the case of an amnesty or where the prosecution has become time-barred (Article 133 paragraph 4). Paragraph 3 provides that \u201cany individual who has been unlawfully subjected to preventive measures in criminal proceedings shall have the right to rehabilitation\u201d. In a judgment acquitting an individual a court has to mention explicitly that he has the right to \u201crehabilitation\u201d (Article 134). A claim for compensation of pecuniary damage is to be lodged with the same authority which issued the decision to acquit or the decision to terminate the criminal prosecution (Article 135 \u00a7 2), whereas any claims for monetary compensation of non-pecuniary damage are to be lodged with civil courts and examined under the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (Article 136 \u00a7 2).",

Furthermore, the award of compensation was subject to the fulfilment of specific conditions not required under Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03, specifically the applicant\u2019s acquittal or the discontinuation of the proceedings.
