On 16 February 1987 the applicant church applied to the government seeking to recover possession of the unused land.

On 20 April 1993 it applied to the first-instance administrative court. A hearing took place on 3 August 1993. By a judgment of 17 August 1993, deposited at the registry on the same date, the court stated that it did not have jurisdiction to \u201crecognise the existence of a possible right to restitution of unused land\u201d, as the administrative courts could only examine legitimate interests. It found that the General Grand Council alone was entitled to rule on what was to be done with the said property. Noting finally that the new land-use plan had changed the designated use of the unused land, it declared the expropriation order of 7\u00a0March 1985 void in so far as it had lapsed in respect of that particular property, but pointed out that declaring it void did not create a right to reconveyance.",

The appeal hearing, initially fixed for 13\u00a0January 1994, was adjourned to 24 May 1994 because the judge of administrative appeals was unable to attend. He allowed the appeal in a judgment of 26 May 1994, which was deposited at the registry on the same date. The judge found that the State had acquired ownership of the plots of land in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law, on payment of compensation for expropriation, and that no legislative provision obliged the government to return that property. Accordingly, he concluded that the applicant church\u2019s request of 20 April 1993 was inadmissible, since the government\u2019s behaviour could not be described as an implied refusal. Finally, he stated that, in declaring the expropriation order partially void \u2013 an order which, moreover, had never been contested \u2013 the first-instance administrative court had exceeded its jurisdiction, which only permitted it, where appropriate, to declare unlawful the government\u2019s alleged implied refusal.",
