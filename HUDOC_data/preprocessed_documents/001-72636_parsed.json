In paragraph 38 of that judgment the Government argued, as in this case, that the purpose of the gynaecological examination of female detainees was to avoid false accusations of sexual violence being directed against the security forces. However they further drew attention to what they referred to as the recommendations set out in the report of the European Committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (CPT) following its visit to Turkey between 27th February and 3rd March 1999 (CPT/INF (2000) 17). They claimed that in its report thereon the CPT emphasized that forensic medical examination of detainees by a doctor was a significant safeguard against sexual violence. They sought to connect this to the practice of sending female detainees for gynaecological examination in order to protect the police against false allegations of sexual assault. I can find in that report no reference to any recommendations such as that contended for by the Government in Y.F. v. Turkey. The only similar reference I could find was at paragraph 19. The report deals there with the medical examination of persons in custody. It welcomes the provision that detainees should be medically examined at the beginning and end of police custody. This reference in the CPT report appears under the heading of \u201cAction to combat torture and ill-treatment\u201d. Nowhere in this report have I found any recommendation made concerning the gynaecological examination of female detainees. In this case however, the Government have relied only upon the narrow ground that such examinations were for the purpose of avoiding false accusations of sexual harassment against the police.",

                        "content": "13.\u00a0\u00a0In Y.F. v. Turkey, the Court actually found a violation of Article 3 but upon the ground that the examination was not done in accordance with law. The reference in paragraph 43 to the Court\u2019s acceptance of the Government\u2019s submission that the medical examination of detainees by a forensic doctor can prove to be a significant safeguard against false accusations of sexual molestation or ill-treatment must therefore be regarded as obiter dictum. Even were it not to be so regarded, the acceptance of this principle is very far removed from acceptance that female detainees may as a matter of course be sent for such examination as occurred here or in Y.F. v. Turkey. It is undoubtedly the case that such examination may have the effect of helping to prevent or answer false allegations or even sexual assault or molestation. It is nonetheless important to reflect upon the vulnerability of any female detainee in such a situation. In custody, brought to a hospital, it is easy to imagine how even the strongest person\u2019s will might be overborne and consent formally given to that which is entirely repugnant to her. This is in fact what happened in Y.F. v. Turkey (see paragraph 34) where the Court held that a person in such a vulnerable situation could not have been expected to resist submitting to such an examination. That the authorities should have such power over a vulnerable detainee cannot be consistent with acceptable standards on the treatment of prisoners nor with the European Convention on Human Rights. Such examination may also result in the revelation of a woman\u2019s sexual history or, at the very least, information about her sexual status which is a matter of the most intimate nature. This indeed was the stated intention of the authorities in this case. Such information in the hands of detaining authorities seems entirely inappropriate. In this regard, I note that the CPT report cited above at paragraph 19 expresses serious misgivings that under the legal provisions they studied, a copy of the medical report following medical examination would be kept at the detention centre.",

No such safeguards exist here. Indeed the manner in which the applicant was brought to the hospital and confronted with such an examination was for all practical purposes the same as in Y.F. v. Turkey. The fact that the applicant herein did in fact have the strength of character to refuse an examination does not in my view lend this procedure any legitimacy whatever.",
