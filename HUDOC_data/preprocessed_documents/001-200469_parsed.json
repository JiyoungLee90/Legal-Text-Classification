However, during that period the applicants remained active. More specifically, they requested access to the case file, sought to obtain victim status and complained of the ineffectiveness of the investigation (see paragraphs 120-121 and 175-177 above).",

The Court stresses that a proper response by the authorities in investigating serious allegations of use of lethal force by agents of the State in compliance with the Article 2 of the Convention standards is essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion or tolerance of unlawful acts (see, among other authorities,\u00a0Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, \u00a7\u00a0108, 4 May 2001, and Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a055721/07, \u00a7 167, ECHR 2011).",
