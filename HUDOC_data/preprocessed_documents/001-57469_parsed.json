However, the Government were and are here proceeding from a supposition that does not correspond to the particular facts, namely that the closure had actually taken place because - which was not the case - the applicant had not paid the fine proposed by way of settlement; above all, the Government\u2019s point went and goes to the merits and not to Article 26 (art. 26) (see paragraph 52 below). Where a  prays in aid the obligation to exhaust remedies, a rule essentially intended to \"protect its national legal order\", it is for the State to prove that there exist available remedies which have not been utilised by those concerned (see the above-mentioned De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment, pp. 31 and 33, par. 55 and 60).

This remedy, added the Government, \"was the most radical because it allowed\" the applicant to claim the retroactive invalidation of \"the legislation creating the offence\"; the judgments delivered by the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat on 5 July 1973 and 31 May 1978 were said to have demonstrated the remedy\u2019s effectiveness (see paragraph 20 above).

The Government themselves pointed this out, but it seemed possible to them to rely on these provisions \"by analogy\" in the case of a fine paid by way of settlement; however, they added that to their knowledge no one had as yet ever tried to do so. The Court does not have to rule on the correctness of a submission which at first view is debatable for the reason that the remedy in question is regarded under Belgian law as being extraordinary; the Court confines itself to finding that the Government have not produced the proof they were obliged to adduce (see paragraph 26 above).",

The source of the 1945/1971 Act is a Legislative Decree published during the Second World War, in the middle of a time of shortages, rationing and the \"black market\". Through a series of drastic measures, this Legislative Decree set on foot \"the repression of offences against rules relating to the country\u2019s supplies\". The return to conditions of plenty has enabled its severity to be relaxed and its title to be changed, but even the existing text still carries the imprint of its origin. The wording employed bears witness to this. Thus, paragraphs 1 and 2 of section 11, the basis of the contested decisions by the  procureur du Roi, utilise terms such as \"offender\" and \"offence\". In addition, anyone who contravenes a Decree passed in pursuance of Part I of the Act, as for instance the Decree of 9 August 1974, is liable to the penalties listed in section 9, that is to say imprisonment, fine, forfeitures, court ordered closure of premises and publicising of the judgment. The offer of settlement made on 30 September 1974 was in effect a substitute for at least certain of those penalties. Had the applicant rejected the offer, the accompanying decision of provisional closure would have come into operation, if need be until \"the date on which judgment [was] passed on the offence\" (section 11 par. 2); he would have risked imprisonment and a fine if he had disregarded the closure decision (sections 9 par. 5 (b) and 11 par. 2 read in conjunction).",

In his decision of 30 September, the  procureur du Roi also mentioned an \"offence\" (\"een inbreuk\"); although he judged it unnecessary to request imprisonment as punishment for the offence (\"dat geen hoofdgevangenisstraf dient gevorderd te worden ter beteugeling van gezegd misdrijf\"), the procureur du Roi stressed its \"gravity\" (\"de ernst\").

In an area concerning the public order (ordre public) of the member States of the Council of Europe, any measure or decision alleged to be in breach of Article 6 (art. 6) calls for particularly careful review (see, for Article 5 (art. 5), the above-mentioned De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment, p. 36, par. 65). The Court is not unaware of the firmness with which the Belgian courts have condemned, on the basis of Article 8 of the Constitution and Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, failure to respect the \"right to a court\" in private legal relationships (see, for example, the Brussels Civil Court, 23. 11. 1967, Journal des Tribunaux 1967, p. 741; compare the Court of Cassation, 1. 6. 1966, with the final submissions of Advocate General Mahaux, Pasicrisie 1966, pp. 1249-1250 and 1251-1252). At least the same degree of vigilance would appear indispensable when someone formerly \"charged with a criminal offence\" challenges a settlement that has barred criminal proceedings. Absence of constraint is at all events one of the conditions to be satisfied; this much is dictated by an international instrument founded on freedom and the rule of law (see the above-mentioned Golder judgment, pp. 16-17, par. 34).

Whilst section 2 par. 5 of the 1945/1971 Act allows an appeal, having suspensive effect, against closure decisions issued by the Minister of Economic Affairs to be made to the judge in chambers at the Court of First Instance with jurisdiction in criminal matters, no right of appeal against closure decisions emanating from the procureur du Roi is granted by the Act (see paragraph 13 above).",

The finding of a breach of the requirements of paragraph 1 dispenses the Court from also examining the case in the light of paragraphs 2 and 3, a course which might have been incumbent on it in different circumstances (see the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, pp. 37-39, par. 89-91).",

In its report of 5 October 1978, the Commission expressed the opinion - contrary to the argument which Mr. Deweer advanced \"to supplement his submissions\" and which was contested by the respondent State - that there had been no violation of this Article (P1-1) since \"the closure order was not enforced\".",

However, the collection of this sum, having been effected in conditions incompatible with Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, was unlawful (see paragraph 54 above). Accordingly, it proves superfluous to determine whether the collection offended against Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) as well; resolving this issue is devoid of interest for the decision in the particular case.",
