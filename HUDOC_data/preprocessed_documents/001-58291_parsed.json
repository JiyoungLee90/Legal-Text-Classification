Both the administrative procedure and the court proceedings, which by their very nature were compulsory, involved, in their entirety, a determination of the applicants\u2019 civil rights. When the decision to expropriate had been taken the applicants\u2019 property rights had been interfered with and made uncertain, as the applicants were in fact prevented from using their land and disposing of it. That uncertainty lasted until the compensation had been determined and paid. Only when both the administrative procedure and the court proceedings had been brought to an end could the applicants\u2019 property rights be said to have been determined within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. Accordingly, and since both the administrative procedure and the court proceedings concerned the same civil rights, the concept of \u201creasonable time\u201d must be applied at both levels.

On the other hand, the establishment of the high probability deriving from probable cause in criminal matters does create an assumption that the initial cause of the (criminal) trial is to be found in the defendant\u2019s actions, not in the act of the State accusing him of having committed an offence.

If the argument here is that this was a complex legal and factual issue authorising the court to take a long time to decide it, then the answer is clearly that, since the initiative and the timing were all in the State\u2019s hands, it could have prepared in advance for such an eventuality.

However, it would perhaps be useful to explore the real procedural effect of such a praesumptio juris et de jure. The effect of irrebuttable presumptions is very similar to the effect of fictions. There were numerous jurisprudential debates \u2013 with contributions by writers such as Jeremy Bentham, as common law used to be full of all kinds of fictions and presumptions \u2013 as to the real effect of presumptions and fictions upon a particular legal subject matter. But the clear effect of an irrebuttable presumption, such as the Greek presumption of counterbalancing benefit, is simply to block litigation over the issue the presumption addresses.",

This is only logical, since the intent of irrebuttable presumptions is in effect to prevent litigation over (particularly sensitive) issues.",

If the case comes before the European Court of Human Rights without the amount of damage being clearly established, we are then faced with a situation in which the applicant\u2019s claim to a particular amount of compensation should by then have been specifically refuted by the State Party. By that stage at the latest the refutation by the State Party ought to have been fully detailed and persuasive since it was the State\u2019s own legislature which precluded litigation over that issue before the State Party\u2019s courts.",

I am not convinced that that should be so in every case, i.e., I am not suggesting that this be adopted as a clear rule of evidence. But in this particular case it cannot be said that the damage resulting from the application of the objectionable presumption amounts only to the equivalent of the value determined by application of the presumption of offsetting benefit (1,500 sq. m), because the issue could not have been tried before the case came here in the first place. The reversal of the burden of proof and the risk of non-persuasion, at least in this particular situation, would seem to me to be the only logical answer to the fact that litigation over this aspect of the case was precluded in the Greek courts.",
