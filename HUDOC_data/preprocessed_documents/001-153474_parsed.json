The trial judge refused to allow Dr Davies to give evidence concerning the conclusions he had reached from watching the interview tapes. The trial judge reasoned that, once the interview tapes were excluded from evidence, they were excluded from evidence for all purposes. The trial judge did, however, hear evidence from Dr Davies as to his concern that the applicant\u2019s low I.Q. would place him in considerable difficulty if he were to give evidence in his defence.

He is entitled not to give evidence, to remain silent and to make the prosecution prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Two matters arise from his not giving evidence. The first is that you try this case according to the evidence. You will appreciate that the defendant has not given evidence at this trial to undermine, contradict or explain the evidence put before you by the prosecution. The second matter, as you heard him being told when I addressed Mr McGrory [counsel for the applicant], is that the law is that you may draw such inferences as appear proper from his failure to give evidence. It is for you to decide whether it is proper to hold the defendant\u2019s failure to give evidence against him when deciding whether he is guilty. On the basis of the evidence of Dr Davies, Mr McGrory invites you not to hold it against the defendant that he has not given evidence before you. Dr Davies\u2019s contradicted evidence is that the defendant has an IQ of 62 and therefore is a person of very limited intellectual ability who should be regarded as mentally handicapped. He has the ability of a six year-old to understand spoken English. Dr Davies said that mentally handicapped people find giving evidence very challenging and his ability to provide a coherent and consistent account and to understand the implications of his replies is limited. Dr Davies said that he seems to have difficulty in functioning as an average person and has difficulty in maintaining relationships, keeping a job and performing everyday tasks such as looking after money.",

It has not been suggested that he is unable to remember what happened that night, indeed, Dr Davies did not ask him to recall the events of that night, so you do not know from what Dr Davies has said to what extent the defendant can explain what he did or where he went, indeed, when he was charged with Mr Williamson\u2019s death he replied, \u2018I didn\u2019t go near him\u2019, not, \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about it\u2019, or, \u2018I didn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u2019 You have to consider along with many other questions you have to consider whether the answer he gave is not merely a denial of guilt, which it plainly is, but whether it implies that he knows something about the circumstances of Mr Williamson\u2019s death.",

I say that because Mr McGrory said in his closing remarks to you, \u2018What chance would a man like that have in proceedings like this?\u2019 I must tell you that the defence were well aware that had the defendant given evidence the court would have ensured he was treated fairly and given every chance to put his case and in particular that questions were simply phrased and put in such a way that they did not suggest the answer to him. It is not enough that a person would find it difficult to give evidence to excuse them from giving evidence. Many people have to give evidence and find it difficult - even children as young as six. Fortunately, we do not have that very often but it does happen sometimes. Every effort is made to simplify the proceedings and the form of questions to ensure that people like that can give evidence. If you think that because of the evidence of Dr Davies you should not hold it against the defendant that he has not given evidence do not hold it against him, but if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence he relies on, that is, the evidence of Dr\u00a0Davies, presents no adequate explanation for his absence from the witness box then you may hold his failure to give evidence against him.",

The Court of Appeal noted that there was competing expert evidence in the case. On the one hand, there was the evidence of Dr Kennedy, a consultant psychiatrist, whose opinion was that the applicant \u201cshould be capable of following proceedings and actively contributing to them\u201d if account were taken of his need to have material simply phrased and if he was allowed adequate consultation with others to ascertain his understanding and clarify matters where necessary.

He did not know whether even where the procedures were simplified and the questions simply phrased, the applicant could give a coherent account of events.

By contrast, in , it was left to the judge in each case to decide whether to direct the jury in this manner, depending on the strength of the prosecution case. The Court of Appeal considered that, in the applicant\u2019s case, the absence of such a direction to the jury reflected the trial judge\u2019s view that this was not a case where the evidence was so weak as to require such a direction. The substantial body of evidence against the applicant supported that view. The trial was not, therefore, unfair. The Court of Appeal nonetheless recommended that the specimen direction in Northern Ireland should be amended to follow the approach taken in England and Wales, by adding a direction that the jury should not draw an adverse inference unless they consider that the prosecution case is such that it clearly calls for an answer.",

The fact that a trial judge leaves a jury with the option of drawing an adverse inference from an accused\u2019s failure to give evidence, either during police interview or, as in the instant case, during his trial, cannot in itself be considered incompatible with the requirements of a fair trial (Beckles v. the United Kingdom, no. 44652/98, \u00a7\u00a057, 8 October 2002 and Tabbakh v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a040945/09, \u00a729, 21 February 2012).",

The Court of Appeal accepted that the videotapes were in fact admissible to demonstrate how the applicant expressed himself and to demonstrate that he was suggestible. However, it concluded that, since the portion of the videotape on which the applicant wished to rely did not touch on suggestibility, the omission of the evidence would not have had any material effect on the trial judge\u2019s decision (see paragraph 24 above). This part of the applicant\u2019s argument is therefore weak. In any event, as this Court has frequently reiterated, while Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7\u00a7 94-95, ECHR 2006IX).",

The deceased was last seen alive with the applicant and his co-accused making their way to a park area beside the Blackwater River where the body was found on a pathway along the banks of the river the following morning. He had been beaten and had suffered a number of knife wounds (see paragraph 9 above). A police search of the applicant\u2019s home found a knife with blood on it inside a plastic bag and clothes that were heavily stained with blood. One of the items of the bloody clothing had the applicant\u2019s name tag on it (see paragraph 10 above). The Court considers that this was a situation which clearly called for an explanation from the applicant and that logically his conviction could not have been based solely or mainly on his refusal to testify.",

The trial judge preferred the evidence of Dr\u00a0Kennedy, whose opinion was that the applicant could give evidence with certain safeguards in place which the trial judge considered that he himself could ensure (see paragraphs 16-18 above). Moreover, the Court observes that the trial judge allowed Dr\u00a0Davies to give evidence to the jury as to the applicant\u2019s intellectual capacity and the effects that this might have on his ability to give evidence on his own behalf (see Tabbakh v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 40945/09, \u00a729, 21 February 2012 where the applicant also had the opportunity to call an expert witness to give evidence as to the nature of his mental illness and the potential impact it would have were he to give evidence). The Court sees no reason to depart from the conclusions of the Court of Appeal, which found that there was nothing unreasonable about the manner in which the trial judge preferred the evidence of one expert over that of another (contrast with the finding arrived at in relation to expert medical evidence in Mantovanelli v. France, 18 March 1997, Reports 1997-II, \u00a7369).",

Furthermore, the judge instructed the jury that they could only draw adverse inferences from the applicant\u2019s silence if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence relied upon by the applicant to justify his silence presented no adequate explanation for his absence from the witness box (see paragraph 20 above).",

Given that the applicant had difficulties in understanding the proceedings and the situation and in expressing himself, the value of his personal testimony would, in any event, have been extremely limited. The other evidence gathered was sufficient for the conviction. Furthermore, I note that the limitation in question was coupled with another important restriction on the guarantees of a fair criminal trial, as the verdict of the jury in Northern Ireland is not reasoned. In this context, it is very difficult to reconstruct the way the facts were established in the present case at first instance and in particular to assess the weight attributed to the silence of the accused. It was not explained by the jury, either to the applicant or to his lawyers, to what extent his decision to remain silent had impacted the outcome of the case before the domestic court.",

I may also accept that in the instant case the limitation imposed was counterbalanced by a set of fair trial guarantees existing in the legal system in Northern Ireland. This is a very important element for the assessment of the case.",

The approach adopted by the Court in respect of the right to silence entails certain difficulties and paradoxes. According to the established case-law of the Court, adverse inferences may be drawn from the silence of the accused if the situation clearly calls for an explanation from him. On the other hand, under this case-law the accused\u2019s silence cannot be the sole or decisive basis for a conviction.",

At the same time, the applicant\u2019s conviction could not have been based solely or mainly on a refusal to testify (ibid.). This statement unequivocally suggests that the decision to remain silent should not have been the factor which tipped the balance against the applicant.",

The explanations of the accused are simultaneously seen as necessary, as the situation calls for an explanation, and unnecessary, as there is other strong evidence on which to base his conviction. If in a specific case there is sufficient evidence to decide a case without drawing any inferences from the accused\u2019s silence, then there is no need to resort to any adverse inferences from his silence in deciding the case. From the viewpoint of the protection of various public interests, limitations on the right to silence might only have an added value if there are difficulties with establishing the facts, especially if the evidence produced is insufficient for the guilt of the accused to be ascertained whereas there is a serious risk that an offence may go unpunished. In other words, inferences from the silence of the accused may appear necessary only if, in some types of cases, they may tip the balance in the process of establishing the facts. I agree, however, that drawing inferences from the silence of the accused in order to tip the balance against him is very problematic from the viewpoint of fair trial standards.",
