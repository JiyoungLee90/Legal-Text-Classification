In connection with habeas corpus decisions, under section\u00a0137 of the Criminal Code the magistrate did not need to hear the Attorney-General. However, since this was an adversarial procedure where the prosecution was led by the police, the magistrate was expected to hear the police as parties to the case in observance of the principle audi alteram partem and the principle of equality of arms.

Moreover, there was no instance of an arrested person being released on being brought before a magistrate on the ground that the magistrate had decided that the arrest was unlawful. Additional arguments could be drawn a contrario from sections\u00a0353 (see paragraphs\u00a019-21 above) and 397(5) of the Criminal Code. The latter provision provided that the court could also order the arrest of an accused person who was not already in custody.

The reason why certain bail applications were communicated to the Attorney-General was to ensure that the principles of audi alteram partem and equality of arms were respected.

If the Attorney-General did not reply within the time-limit \nset by the magistrate, the latter could give a ruling on the bail application without hearing the Attorney-General\u2019s views, which were not in any event binding.

Bulgaria judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, p. 3187, \u00a7 146). It is essentially the object of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03, which forms a whole with paragraph\u00a01\u00a0(c), to require provisional release once detention ceases to be reasonable. The fact that an arrested person had access to a judicial authority is not sufficient to constitute compliance with the opening part of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03. This provision enjoins the judicial officer before whom the arrested person appears to review the circumstances militating for or against detention, to decide by reference to legal criteria whether there are reasons to justify detention, and to order release if there are no such reasons (see the De\u00a0Jong, Baljet and Van\u00a0den\u00a0Brink v. the Netherlands judgment of 22\u00a0May\u00a01984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a077, pp. 21-24, \u00a7\u00a7 44, 47 and 51).

It might even defeat the purpose of the safeguard under Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 which is to protect the individual from arbitrary detention by ensuring that the act of deprivation of liberty is subject to independent judicial scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, the Kurt v.

The review required under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03, being intended to establish whether the deprivation of the individual\u2019s liberty is justified, must be sufficiently wide to encompass the various circumstances militating for or against detention (see paragraph 41 above).

However, compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 cannot be ensured by making an Article 5 \u00a7 4 remedy available. The review must be automatic (see paragraph 43 above).

Moreover, from what the Court can deduce from the domestic cases cited before it, the absence of a reasonable suspicion or of reasons militating in favour of the applicant\u2019s continued detention would not necessarily have rendered the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention unlawful under Maltese law (see paragraphs\u00a017, 20 and 21 above).
