They also argued that, in proceedings C, the applicant had contributed to the protraction of the proceedings, in particular by not duly establishing his capacity as representative (see paragraph 11 above) and by requesting belatedly the supplementation of the order of 2 October 1996 (see paragraph 13 above).

For the Court, this duration alone raises concerns, even in a complex case and account being taken of the delays caused by the applicant through his belated appeal against the order of 2 October 1996 or by the incertitude as to his capacity as representative. Consequently, the necessity to suspend the principal cases pending proceedings C cannot as such exculpate the authorities for the entire protraction of proceedings A and B. Accordingly, the period to be taken into consideration lasted some twelve years for two levels of jurisdiction in both cases.
