The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is generally impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see, for example, Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 46; Series A no. 103, Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), 23\u00a0May\u00a01991, \u00a7 63, Series A no. 204,). The classification of a statement as a fact or a value judgment is a matter which, in the first place, falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard v.  [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR 2004XI). However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it may be excessive (see Jerusalem v. Austria, no.\u00a026958/95, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2001-II).",

Concerning the first one, namely, that in company G. the employees\u2019 rights had been trampled by the inhuman conduct of the management, the Court considers that the applicant was assessing company G.\u2019s behaviour in general, and his declaration amounted to a value judgment. As to the second issue \u2013 namely that, according to the applicant, company G. considered him and his colleagues as criminals \u2013 the Court sees no reason to depart from the domestic courts\u2019 finding that this statement was essentially factual. For the Court, such utterances were, at least in part, susceptible of proof.",

The Court draws attention to the fact that in December 2003 the plaintiff was found guilty of defamation for having alleged that the applicant had been supporting criminals; his employment was terminated illegally and, moreover, he had difficulty entering the company\u2019s premises, even on trade union business (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). Furthermore, it was not disputed between the parties that numerous labour proceedings instituted against company G. were pending at the material time.",

The Court observes in that connection that \u2013 given the number of employees concerned \u2013 the dispute at issue was a debate on matters of public interest, where there is little scope for restrictions (see Wingrove v. the United Kingdom, 25 November 1996 Reports 1996-V, \u00a7 58; and Ceylan v.

In principle, it should be possible to make true declarations in public irrespective of their tone or negative consequences for those who are concerned by them.",

Moreover, the Court observes that the applicant made the impugned statements in a debate on matters of public interest, namely in the course of a collective labour dispute. The Court is aware of the fact that, given what is at stake, the tone of such disputes is often heated. It is of the view that these debates, since they concern the core interests of employees, require a high level of protection under Article\u00a010 (see, for example, Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a088).",

In sum, it can be concluded that the correct balance was not struck between the need to protect the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression and the need to protect the plaintiff\u2019s rights and reputation.",
