Storm clouds had been gathering since before the beginning of the period to which the indictment related and the applicant had known or ought to have known where things were headed. Thus, this matter should have been discussed at ministerial meetings as prescribed by Article 17 of the Constitution which should be interpreted according to its words (see paragraph 42 below). The prosecution objected to the applicant\u2019s argument that a constitutional custom had developed to the effect that only matters under Article 16 of the Constitution should be discussed in ministerial meetings under Article 17, and even if such custom existed, it could not override a clear provision of the Constitution. Furthermore, a breach against Article 17 had substantive consequences since, if cabinet meetings were not convened on urgent problems, the opportunity to respond clearly would be lessened. It had been apparent that important government matters had not been discussed by the cabinet and the knowledge that the defendant had demonstrably possessed had not been reported to the ministers. The applicant\u2019s violation according to count 2 of the indictment was a conduct offence and punishable irrespective of the consequences or risks attributable to the conduct.",

He had not been questioned or invited to respond to the accusations, neither before Parliament\u2019s resolution nor before the prosecutor issued her indictment. He also challenged the impartiality of the prosecutor due to her involvement in Parliament\u2019s preparation of the decision to indict him, during which she had been repeatedly consulted by the PRC and had allegedly expressed her opinion on his potential responsibility under the Ministerial Accountability Act. The applicant further maintained that his chance of preparing a proper defence was compromised as the counts of the indictment were undefined and only described in general terms his alleged criminal conduct and the criminal provisions under which that conduct was subsumed were unclear and discretionary. Also the rules governing the impeachment proceedings and the penal provisions of the Ministerial Accountability Act and other invoked legislation were, in his view, so unclear that due process could not be ensured.

Moreover, the applicant\u2019s defence counsel had not asked that the applicant be heard during the investigative stage, although such an opportunity was provided by section 16(2) of the Court of Impeachment Act and the prosecutor had invited him, by a letter of 9 December 2010, to make comments or request further information to be collected. With respect to the applicant\u2019s challenge against her impartiality, the prosecutor objected to the assertion that she had expressed an opinion on the applicant\u2019s potential criminal liability. She further claimed that the counts of the indictment were not unclear or worded in general terms, pointing out that further specifications in regard to several counts were found in the explanatory memorandum accompanying Parliament\u2019s resolution and that, additionally, count 2 of the indictment provided explanatory examples of events that had given reason to discuss the imminent financial crisis at ministerial meetings. The prosecutor also disagreed with the applicant\u2019s contention that the applicable procedural or criminal provisions were unclear. As for the alleged unequal treatment by Parliament when deciding to charge the applicant but not the other ministers, she stated that the majority of its members, bound only by their own conviction, had found that the facts of the case up until that point were likely to lead to a conviction of the applicant but not the others.",

Parliament\u2019s handling of the matter had been in compliance with relevant legislation and its resolution to commence impeachment proceedings had not prevented the appointed prosecutor from investigating the case further and gathering new evidence. Indeed, the prosecutor had continued the investigation of the case before issuing the indictment against the applicant. Moreover, judgment in a criminal case should be based on evidence presented in court, including the testimonies of witnesses. If there were insufficient support for the charges against the defendant, he would be acquitted of the charges, a more favourable outcome for him than a dismissal, which could lead to possible shortcomings being remedied and a new indictment being issued.",

As for certain negligence imputed to him by the prosecution, the court considered that it related to actions that were not among his duties. However, by nine votes to six, the majority consisting of five professional judges and four lay judges, the Court of Impeachment found the applicant guilty in respect of count 2. The court considered it established that major danger had been threatening the Icelandic commercial banks and the State Treasury as early as February 2008 and that the applicant had to have been aware of that danger. However, basing itself on the minutes of 52 ministerial meetings held between 1 February and 6\u00a0October 2008 and the testimony of the applicant and the witnesses, in particular five ministers who had held a seat in the government in 2008, the court found that this matter had not been discussed during the meetings, apart from the last four meetings, on 30 September and on 3, 5 and 6\u00a0October.

When comparing these two kinds of responsibility it must be concluded that only serious wrongs on the part of the minister committed in office would lead to his punishment.

As stated above, it must also be considered a fact in the resolution of the case that various issues that were up for discussion in the consultative group on financial stability and contingency planning, and which there was due reason to discuss in the cabinet, were not dealt with at those meetings. That was all the more urgent as the defendant did not convey important information which he possessed about the affairs of the banks to the Minister for Business Affairs, to whom they pertained. Last but not least it is proven that those two aforesaid documents that were forwarded to foreign authorities [a declaration of 16 May 2008 signed by the defendant, the ministers of foreign affairs and finance and the board of governors of the Central Bank of Iceland to the central banks of Sweden, Denmark and Norway on the completion of currency swap agreements and a letter of 20 August 2008 by the Ministry of Business Affairs to the UK Treasury providing answers to certain questions posed by the latter] and contained, on the one hand, obligations, and, on the other, promises, in the name of the government, were not discussed at its meetings.",

For this reason it had been very important to discuss the danger facing the banking system within a small group, in full confidentiality. Although those views may have been fully justified, especially while the difficulties of the banks were still known by few, it is to no avail for the defendant to allege that for this reason he was unable to give an account of the issues in question at cabinet meetings. The framework of those meetings is not least designed so that ministers and supreme holders of executive power can consult one another and discuss important issues confidentially and behind closed doors, with the ministers having a compelling duty ... not to disclose points raised there concerning such confidential matters.",

If such a policy had been formulated and then implemented in an organised manner, including action by the Central Bank of Iceland and the Financial Supervisory Authority, it may be argued that it would have been possible to lessen the harm caused by the collapse of the banks in the beginning of October 2008. It is also likely that the authorities would then have been better prepared for taking a position towards the request of Glitnir Bank hf. for financial assistance at the end of September 2008, so that the problems of that bank might have been resolved in a more deliberate manner than was the case.",

Referring, inter alia, to the case of Ninn-Hansen v.

Any shortcomings in this regard could only have been beneficial for him. Moreover, it had been open to the prosecution to hear the applicant but, since Parliament had already decided to prosecute, such a hearing would have been of little value for the investigation. Also, while the SIC had not conducted a criminal investigation, the evidence obtained by it from witnesses had been sufficient to assess whether they should be called to testify before the Court of Impeachment. The judgment in the case should anyway be based on evidence presented in court, and the applicant had been heard by the Court of Impeachment on two occasions, of which the second one occurred after he had heard the statements of all the witnesses.

The Court does not consider that this fact in itself is sufficient to raise an issue under Article 6. It must be borne in mind that the charges brought by Parliament are examined and adjudicated upon by a court of law. Furthermore, in the present case, the conduct of which the applicant eventually was found guilty was his failure to hold ministerial meetings on \u201cimportant government matters\u201d, as required by Article 17 of the Constitution in conjunction with section\u00a08(c) of the Ministerial Accountability Act. The negligence imputed to him thus concerned an objective legal obligation.

Furthermore, having regard to the text of the legal provisions in question, the Court agrees with the Court of Impeachment that they \u201cwere worded in such a way that they could be interpreted on the basis of objective criteria and were clear enough to enable a proper defence\u201d (see paragraph 29 above).",

The Court cannot find any indication that the procedural rules applicable in the case were applied incorrectly or generally to the disadvantage of the applicant. As regards the issue of defence counsel, the applicant engaged a lawyer to defend him on 28\u00a0September 2010, on the day of Parliament\u2019s vote on impeachment, and the Court of Impeachment appointed that lawyer as his defence counsel on 30\u00a0November 2010, following a request submitted to the court two weeks earlier. It has not been shown that another request for appointment of defence counsel had been made by the applicant. In this context, it is important to note that the applicant was not interrogated or detained during the pre-trial investigation (cf., among other authorities, Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7 51-55, 27 November 2008; and Ibrahim and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 255-256, 13 October 2009). Furthermore, the appointment occurred almost half a year before the applicant\u2019s indictment and about 15\u00a0months before the main hearing. The applicant\u2019s right to effective legal assistance was therefore respected. The Court further finds that the claim that the prosecutor had been given undue time to gather evidence is unsubstantiated. Overall, there is nothing to indicate that the rules of procedure were applied in a manner that prejudiced the fairness of the applicant\u2019s trial.",

It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards the accused as guilty. The principle of the presumption of innocence may be infringed not only by a judge or court but also by other public authorities and representatives of the State, including prosecutors (see, among other authorities, Allenet de Ribemont v.

The Court notes that the PRC was an ad hoc committee established by Parliament and composed of nine of its members. Among its tasks was to assess whether there were grounds for impeachment proceedings, thereby assisting Parliament, which held the prosecuting authority. The PRC heard two prosecutors, including Ms Fri\u00f0j\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, then deputy state prosecutor. Her involvement at this early stage thus formed part of the prosecuting authority\u2019s pre-trial investigation, the later stages of which she was subsequently designated to conduct. An intrinsic element of a pre-trial investigation is to establish whether there are sufficient grounds for prosecution, the absence of such grounds normally leading to a discontinuation of the investigation. A prosecutor\u2019s opinion on the existence of grounds for prosecution, or even the likelihood of a conviction, does not therefore, as such, violate the suspect\u2019s right to be presumed innocent. It is further important to note in the present case that Ms\u00a0Fri\u00f0j\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir\u2019s advice and opinions were not given in statements to the public.

It is of importance that section\u00a03 of the Court of Impeachment Act stipulates that a Member of Parliament or an employee of the Government offices is not eligible to hold a seat on the court. Although political sympathies may still play a part in the process of appointment of lay judges to the Court of Impeachment, the Court does not consider that this alone raises legitimate doubts as to their independence and impartiality.

In order to support its finding in this respect, the court held that the lack of ministerial meetings had contributed to a political policy to address the problems not having been formulated and that, if such a policy had been formulated and followed, it could be argued that the damage caused by the collapse of the banks could have been reduced. The applicant contended that these conclusions had been purely speculative and not supported by the evidence in the case. What is more, they had not been pleaded by the prosecution, as they had neither been presented in the indictment nor been argued before the court.

It is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused\u2019s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused\u2019s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows from these principles that an offence must be clearly defined in the law, be it national or international. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision \u2013 and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it and with informed legal advice \u2013 what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial interpretation is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article\u00a07 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see Vasiliauskas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 35343/05, \u00a7 153-155, ECHR 2015, with further references).",

The domestic court also cited constitutional doctrine according to which the references to \u201cimportant government measures\u201d in Article 16 of the Constitution and \u201cimportant government matters\u201d in Article 17 undoubtedly did not have the same meaning. The Court further observes that, according to the Court of Impeachment, it was of primary importance that matters concerning the interests of the State and the general population be discussed at meetings of the cabinet, this being the forum which the ministers should, according to the Constitution, utilise for political consultation between them on the highest governance of the State and policy-making for important State matters. Furthermore, the Court notes that the Court of Impeachment held that the Prime Minister, whose task it is to head the government and preside ministerial meetings, had a duty to ensure that important government matters of which he was aware were discussed and addressed at such meetings, as provided for in Article 17 of the Constitution.",

In this respect, the Court notes that the Court of Impeachment examined the history of the two articles in depth and found that their different wording \u2013 \u201cimportant government measures\u201d in Article 16(2) and \u201cimportant government matters\u201d in Article 17 \u2013 unequivocally supported a literal interpretation of the latter, to the effect that the Prime Minister had a duty to ensure that important government matters were discussed and addressed in ministerial meetings. The court considered that, whether or not the practice had been to raise such matters at the meetings or in other fora, that custom had not absolved the Prime Minister from his duty under Article\u00a017. Moreover, having concluded that the danger facing the welfare of the State had been of gigantic and unprecedented proportions and that this was clearly an \u201cimportant government matter\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a017, it further found that the sensitivity of the financial market situation did not excuse a failure to raise the issues in question at ministerial meetings, as these meetings were designed to enable discussions among ministers in full confidentiality. Contrary to the applicant\u2019s assertions, the court, taking into account the evidence presented in the case, found that the issues had not been discussed at ministerial meetings between February and the end of September 2008 (see paragraphs 36-39 above).",

The scope of the competence of ministerial meetings encompasses new legislative proposals and important State matters. In other words, no new legislative proposals can be made nor any important State matters decided without prior discussion at a ministerial meeting. Secondly, the first sentence regulates an important aspect of the mode of operation of the executive branch by enshrining the principle of cabinet collegiality. All ministers should take part in the discussion of new legislative proposals and important State matters (and as result in the decisions which follow). Important State matters should be decided neither by the Prime Minister acting alone nor by another minister acting alone, nor should they be referred to the Head of State in the Council without a prior discussion at a ministerial meeting. This latter aspect was especially important before the 1944 constitutional reform, when the head of Icelandic State was the King of Denmark. At that time the \u201cKing in the Council of State\u201d could take measures out of Iceland after consultation and meeting with one minister (see the dissenting opinion of the Court of Impeachment judges \u00c1stri\u00f0ur Grimsd\u00f3ttir, Benedikt Bogason, Fannar J\u00f3nasson, Gar\u00f0ar G\u00edslason and Linda R\u00f3s Michaelsd\u00f3ttir). The obligation on the Prime Minister is to ensure that decisions concerning important State matters are not taken without prior discussion at ministerial meetings and without the participation of all the ministers.",

Moreover, there may be different explanations of the difference in wording between Article 16 (where the term important government measures is used) and the Article 17 (with the term important State matters). What is submitted to the President of the Republic is certain draft measures, whereas ministers under article 17 discuss matters. The discussion may lead to the subsequent submission of certain draft measures to the President or to the decision not to make such proposals, at least at a certain time. The latter situation may occur in particular if measures belonging to the scope of powers of a single minister may suffice.",

The lack of sufficient reaction from the authorities was rightly seen by the Icelandic public as a serious dysfunction of the State. At the same time, Article 17 of the Constitution does not establish any obligation on the Prime Minister to call a ministerial meeting in order to discuss an important State matter whenever such an important State matter arises. The applicant - even in the context of the required special knowledge of the Constitution and privileged access to legal advice - could not foresee that he could face criminal liability for the failure to call a ministerial meeting in order to discuss an important State matter.",
