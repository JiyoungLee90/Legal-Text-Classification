It is true that the domestic courts had regard above all to the child\u2019s interest when granting the request for the withdrawal of the applicant\u2019s access rights (see paragraph 13 above). However, the Court notes that when deciding on the applicant\u2019s suitability to contribute to his son\u2019s development, the domestic authorities added to their consideration the factor \u2013 for that matter, evidently the decisive one \u2013 of the applicant\u2019s religious conviction and its possible effects on the child. In particular, the  based its ruling on the expert opinion stating that the applicant\u2019s \u201cirrational worldview made him incapable of bringing up his child\u201d. Furthermore, the  held against the applicant that during his contacts with the child, he had intended to transfer his religious convictions to him (see paragraph 14 above). It does not appear that other points of fact or law were considered in depth. In this connection, the Court has already held that a distinction based essentially on a difference in religion alone is not acceptable (see Hoffmann, cited above, \u00a7 36).",

It would add that the rights to respect for family life and religious freedom as enshrined in Articles 8 and 9 of the Convention, together with the right to respect for parents\u2019 philosophical and religious convictions in education, as provided in Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, convey on parents the right to communicate and promote their religious convictions in the bringing up of their children. The Court adds in this context that this would be an uncontested right in the case of two married parents sharing the same religious ideas or worldview and promoting them to their child, even in an insistent or overbearing manner, unless this exposes the latter to dangerous practices or to physical or psychological harm, and it sees no reason why the position of a separated or divorced parent who does not have custody of his or her child should be different per se.",
