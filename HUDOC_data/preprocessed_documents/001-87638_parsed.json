It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must, whilst paying due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a public interest requirement justifying a departure from the rule in Article 5, and must set them out in their decisions on the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the well-documented facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (see, for example, Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7 152, ECHR 2000-IV; Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 110).",

In this respect, the domestic courts referred to the severity of the penalty to which the applicant was liable. Given that the applicant was found in possession of firearms and ammunition, the Court accepts that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the serious offence with which he had been charged and which could warrant his detention (see Kusyk v. , no.\u00a07347/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a036-37, 24\u00a0October 2006).

Bulgaria (no. 39270/98, \u00a7 82, 8 April 2004), there is no cause to consider that there is a \u201ccertain period\u201d within which pre-trial detention may be regarded as acceptable. Even a relatively short period of detention \u2013 the period in Belchev was four months and fourteen days \u2013 must be justified by the authorities and may, where appropriate, be found to breach Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 if there is no satisfactory justification.",

Indeed, this provision proclaims not only the right to \u201ctrial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial\u201d but also lays down that \u201crelease may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial\u201d (see, among other authorities, Kaszczyniec v. Poland, no. 59526/00, \u00a7 57, 22 May 2007). The authorities are under an obligation to conduct such a review and it must be clear from the reasoning of their decision that the review has taken place (see J.G. v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a036258/97, \u00a7\u00a7 55-56, 6\u00a0April 2004). However, in the present case, the domestic courts did not consider at all the possibility of applying other non-custodial preventive measures, which were expressly envisaged by Article\u00a0152 \u00a7\u00a01 of the CCP. Such an omission by the domestic courts is yet another indication of their disregard for the requirements of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see Patsuria, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 75-76, and Dolgova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a011886/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a047, 48 and 50, 2 March 2006).",

Turkey, no. 20869/92, \u00a7 66, ECHR 2000-VIII). The very essence of Article 5 \u00a7 3 is the right to remain free pending a criminal trial, so that the presumption of innocence is given practical and useful effect rather than being theoretical and illusory. Liberty is the rule and detention the exception. That is the message which the Court should be giving States in the efforts they pursue, by various means, to limit pre-trial detention, which is a problematic issue in all criminaljustice systems in Europe.",
