The domestic courts examined his arguments on the merits and provided reasons for their decisions (see paragraphs 21-22, 24 and 26 above). The fact that the applicant was unsuccessful at each step does not alter the fact that he had an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence and oppose its use (see\u00a0Schenk v.

However, this element is not the determining factor in the Court\u2019s assessment of the fairness of the proceedings taken as a whole (see Khan, cited above, \u00a7 37). The Court reiterates that the relevance of the existence of evidence other than evidence which is contested will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. In the present circumstances, where the substance of the recordings provided accurate and reliable evidence (see paragraph 47 above), the need for supporting evidence was correspondingly weaker (see Prade, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040).",
