The court found that the Ministry had issued a formal response to the applicants\u2019 registration request on 18 February 2004, although the applicants did not receive it at that time owing to an unintentional mistake in the recipient\u2019s address. The court further dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim that the Ministry had failed to comply with the ten-day time-limit laid down by the Old State Registration Act. The court noted that, in the meantime, on 9 January 2004 a new Law on State Registration and the State Register of Legal Entities (\u201cthe New State Registration Act\u201d) had entered into force and superseded the Old State Registration Act. In accordance with the New State Registration Act, the time-limit for the Ministry\u2019s formal response to a registration request was extended to 40\u00a0working days after the receipt of the request. The court reasoned that, since the Old State Registration Act was no longer in force, the time-limits set by it no longer applied, and that a new time-limit of 40 days had been applicable since 9 January 2004, the date of entry into force of the New State Registration Act. Accordingly, the court ruled that the Ministry had responded within the statutory time-limit and that the applicants could reapply for state registration after rectifying the deficiencies found by the Ministry in their registration documents.",

In particular, the law did not provide for an automatic registration of a legal entity or any other legal consequences in the event the Ministry failed to take any action in a timely manner, thus effectively defeating the very object of the procedural deadlines. Without such safeguards, the Ministry was able arbitrarily to prolong the whole registration procedure for an indefinite period of time. Accordingly, the law did not afford the applicants sufficient legal protection against the arbitrary actions of the Ministry of Justice (ibid, \u00a7 66).",
