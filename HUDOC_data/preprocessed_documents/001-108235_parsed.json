In particular, in the cases of Baranowski and Khudoyorov the applicants continued to remain in detention due to the fact that a bill of indictment had been lodged with the court competent to try their cases.

However, paragraph 3 of Article 138 provides that during the pre-trial proceedings the running of the detention period is suspended on the date when the prosecutor transmits the criminal case to the court. The rule contained in that paragraph was relied on to justify the continued detention of a person once the criminal case was transmitted to the court for examination on the merits even if the pre-trial detention period authorised by a court had already expired, as happened in the applicant\u2019s case.",

It further contradicted Article 141 (10) of the CCP which required the administration of a detention facility immediately to release a person kept in detention without a relevant court decision or if the detention period fixed by a court decision had expired. The Court does not find the wording of Article\u00a0138 \u00a7 3 to be sufficiently precise to provide for a clear, foreseeable and unequivocal exception to these rules. It therefore considers that Article\u00a0138 \u00a7 3 of the CCP failed to satisfy the principle of legal certainty.",

While this requirement is not explicitly stipulated in Article 5 \u00a7 1, it can be inferred from Article 5 read as a whole, in particular the wording in paragraph 1\u00a0(c) and paragraph 3 (see Baranowski, cited above, \u00a7 57). In the present case, the applicant stayed in detention without a court decision for nineteen days, which is shorter than the period in the case of Baranowski (almost four months) but, in the Court\u2019s opinion, sufficiently long to raise an issue of lawfulness under Article 5 \u00a7 1.",

It is true that Article 292 of the CCP requires the judge, who has taken over a case, to adopt a decision on detention within fifteen days (see paragraph 39 above). However, firstly, this time-limit starts to run from the date on which the judge decides to take over the case and not from the date on which the case is received at the court. No time-limit, however, is prescribed for a judge to decide on taking over the case after receiving it at the court (see paragraph 38 above). Secondly, there are no safeguards against the failure by a judge, like in the present case, to comply with the fifteen-day time-limit (see paragraphs\u00a016 and 19 above). The Court notes that no explanation was provided for this, even if only short, delay. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that under Article\u00a0138\u00a0\u00a7 3 of the CCP an individual may be kept in detention without a court decision for a significantly longer period than the fifteen-day time-limit prescribed by Article 292 of the CCP or even the nineteen days of the present case.",

This Article places the judge or the judicial officer under the obligation of hearing himself the individual brought before him (see Schiesser v. , 4\u00a0December 1979, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 34). Furthermore, it does not provide for any possible exceptions from the requirement that a person be brought promptly before a judge or other judicial officer after his or her arrest or detention. To conclude otherwise would run counter to the plain meaning of this provision (see Ladent v. , no. 11036/03, \u00a7 75, 18 March 2008).",

The Court observes in this respect that the mere possibility of a court issuing an arrest warrant in absentia in a situation where a person flees from justice does not conflict with the provisions of the Convention (see Garabayev v. , no. 38411/02, \u00a7 101, 7 June 2007). However, after the applicant was arrested by the police on 13 April 2007 and subsequently detained on the basis of the above-mentioned order, he was never brought before a judge or a judicial officer for the purposes of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3. The Court also notes that the practice of not bringing a person in hiding before a judge following his arrest was found to be in violation of the guarantees of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention by the Court of Cassation in its decision of 26 December 2008 (see paragraph 45 above).",
