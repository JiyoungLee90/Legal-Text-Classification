The relevant paragraph (number 24) refers to five previous decisions, namely Hadrabov\u00e1 v.\u00a0the Czech Republic (dec.), no.\u00a042165/02, 25\u00a0September 2007; Benjocki and Others v.\u00a0Serbia (dec.), nos.\u00a05958/07, 6561/07, 8093/07 and 9162/07, 15\u00a0December 2009; Baucal-\u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 and \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia (dec.), no.\u00a038540/07, 2\u00a0July 2013; Gorgadze v.\u00a0Georgia (dec.), no.\u00a057990/10, 2\u00a0September 2014; and Ausad Valimised Mt\u00fc v.\u00a0Estonia (dec.), no.\u00a040631/14, 27\u00a0September 2016; it also refers to Tsonev v.\u00a0Bulgaria (dec.), no. 44885/10, \u00a7 26, 8 December 2015. It is true that our case has similarities to Tsonev. The problem, in my humble opinion, is that the Tsonev decision, like the case before us, departed, with no particular justification, from the Court\u2019s consistent case-law. In reality, all of the cases cited in Tsonev (\u00a7 26) \u2013 but also in the five other decisions mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph \u2013 concern disclosures made personally by the applicants, with or without their lawyers being present. The case-law in force until now has required (some reasons are to be found below) substantiated evidence of personal and wilful responsibility on the part of the applicant in disclosing the friendly-settlement proposal to third parties (see Hadrabov\u00e1 and Others v. the Czech Republic (dec.); Miro\u013cubovs and Others v. Latvia, \u00a7 66, no. 798/05, 15\u00a0December 2009; Gorgadze v.\u00a0Georgia, \u00a7 19; Mandil v. France;\u00a0and Ausad Valimised Mtu v. Estonia (dec.), \u00a7\u00a019, no. 40631/14, 27 September 2016). In our case, however, and I would emphasise this point, the disclosure was made exclusively by the lawyer, and there is no reason to suppose that this revelation enjoyed the applicants\u2019 tacit support. Moreover, they have been imprisoned since 2015 (paragraph 5).",

The principal (the applicant) must expressly authorise a lawyer to represent him or her before the European Court of Human Rights \u201cconcerning [the] application lodged under Article 34 of the Convention\u201d. For his or her part, the lawyer must agree \u201cto represent the applicant in the proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights concerning the application lodged under Article 34 of the Convention\u201d. It is this bilateral agreement, to be strictly construed, which henceforth authorises the lawyer to act on the applicant\u2019s behalf. The signatures which are to be found in the respective applications prove that the applicants did indeed confer this task on their lawyer. However, the lawyer\u2019s powers are not unlimited. They are restricted to the contentious proceedings being conducted before our Court. Thus, as a general rule, the applicant takes responsibility for all of the procedural acts carried out by his or her representative: submission of the application and the subsequent observations, the lawyer\u2019s reception of the observations from the respondent Contracting Party, etc. In our case, the public statements made by the applicants\u2019 lawyer to the TASS State news agency cannot in any way be equated with a procedural act. On the contrary, they amount to a demonstration of free speech by the lawyer, committed outside the strict framework of the authority form and in the exercise of his freedom of expression. The applicants are not bound by his actions. The opposing party is free to take action against him if they consider that damage has been caused or to decline any friendly negotiation.",

In my view, that possibility is illusory here. In such a scenario, it would be for the applicants (who, I would repeat, are in prison), to prove to the domestic courts that they had had a strong probability of winning the cases brought by them before the Court against the Russian State. This is mere speculation, especially as they would be unable, in view of its confidential nature, to use the friendly-settlement proposal. Moreover, the dismissal of their applications, final as it is, ends any hope of a finding of a violation of the Convention. Lastly, I find it difficult to imagine that the Russian courts will at some future point admit, even indirectly, that there was fault of the part of the State, given that the applicants have not to date obtained satisfaction through the domestic remedies.",

A combined reading of Article\u00a039 \u00a7 2 and Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b) implies that the rejection of an application for disclosure of the friendly-settlement negotiations requires evidence of an abuse of process (see Miro\u013cubovs and Others, \u00a7\u00a062).

It is therefore clearly a question of preventing abusive conduct. One cannot but note that the respondent State has not alleged any form of pressure. In their written observations, they merely condemn the breach of the confidentiality rule. With regard to our Chamber, I fail to see what difference this disclosure would have made to the decision on the merits had the case been declared admissible.",

As a form of procedural \u201csanction\u201d, it should be applied in a restrained manner, as our Court has indicated to the highest national courts (see P\u00e9rez de Rada Cavanilles v.\u00a0Spain, 28\u00a0October 1998, \u00a7 49, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII; Miragall Escolano and Others v.

Greece, \u00a7 27, no.\u00a066294/01, 28 August 2004). Indeed, I consider that the precepts of a fair trial should also be binding on the Court. The latter\u2019s authority and prestige also depend on it applying to itself the rules that it lays down for the domestic courts.

Indeed, where the Court (through the Registry) proposes a friendly settlement, it is because it deduces that a violation has probably occurred. In weighing up a procedural requirement (confidentiality of the friendly-settlement proposal) and recognition of the violation of a right from which no derogation is possible (Article 3), the balance ought, in my opinion, to tip towards the latter. As a sanction for the lawyer\u2019s negligence, the Court could then perhaps refrain from holding that the respondent State is to pay the fees of the applicants\u2019 representative. In this way respect for human rights and compliance with the procedural rules could be reconciled.",
