It noted that this term followed a number of other defamatory passages of which the highly negative wording (\u201cand one cannot but find it outrageous\u201d) proved the deliberately strong connotation of the word \u201cconnivance\u201d. According to the court, the use of that word clearly and directly suggested that, on account of their good relations with the Djibouti public prosecutor, judges M. and L.L had been collaborating with that official of a foreign country in investigating the case in a partial and unfair manner, in breach of the basic principles of law and of judicial office. The court found that the defamatory nature of those views was exacerbated by the subsequent indication in the article that the lawyers had asked the Minister of Justice to initiate an investigation by the General Inspectorate of Judicial Services, thus implying that they had a serious basis on which to substantiate such an accusation.",

As regards the shortcomings in the judicial investigation, the court noted that it was still in progress and that the judgment of 21 June 2000 had expressed disapproval with the refusal by the judges concerned to proceed with the re-enactment requested by the civil party and had acted thereon by ordering the case to be withdrawn from them. It took the view, however, that it could not be inferred that all the criticisms made in open court about the handling of the judicial investigation should be regarded as founded. As regards the retention of the cassette, the court noted that no offer of evidence had been seriously made in order to establish any professional misconduct or dishonest conduct on the part of the investigating judges. Lastly, as to the term \u201cconnivance\u201d, the court stressed that a possible convergence of opinion between participants in the judicial process, without its precise extent having been determined, did not in any way prove the existence of a culpable complicity with the aim of distorting the investigation procedure.

The Court has held that the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see Wettstein, cited above, \u00a7 43). As regards the type of proof required, the Court has, for example, sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or ill will for personal reasons (see De Cubber v.

Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports 1996-III).",

Moreover, the Rouen Court of Appeal, in its judgment of 16\u00a0July 2008, itself pointed out that the Church of Scientology case, in which judge M. was suspected of being responsible for the disappearance of evidence, had been referred to the Investigation Division of the Paris Court of Appeal, upon an application by the applicant, two days before the publication of the offending article in which that fact had been mentioned. The Court thus finds that there was clear opposition between the applicant and judge M. both in the case for which she had received the support of judge J. M. and in that where J. M. was sitting as a judge of the Court of Cassation. It is also noteworthy that J.M.\u2019s support had been expressed in an official context, at the general meeting of the judges of the Paris tribunal de grande instance, and that it was quite general in nature.",

The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10. The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts.

However, in view of the margin of appreciation left to Contracting States by Article 10 of the Convention, a criminal measure as a response to defamation cannot, as such, be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued (see Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2004II). Secondly, the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant, 4,000 euros, does not appear excessive; the same is true of the 7,500 euros in damages that he was ordered to pay to the civil parties, jointly with his two co-defendants. In those circumstances, and having regard to the content of the impugned comments, the Court considers that the measures imposed on the applicant were not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",

The aim of the second action was to draw the attention of the general public to failings in the judicial investigation concerning this well-known case. I do not believe that one can find fault with a lawyer who has procedural remedies by which to make good any shortcomings in judicial proceedings, whether he uses them (as in the present case) or not, for having prompted a public debate, as those two paths lead in different directions. In addition, any disciplinary sanctions imposed on a judge will not necessarily be known to the public, even though clear failings could be seen in the judge\u2019s work in the present case. In any event, a lawyer\u2019s mission is, in the very interest of the judicial system, to use his best endeavours to ensure that the judicial investigation is conducted objectively and impartially.

The possibility of freely expressing his opinion is an indispensable condition for a lawyer to be able to fulfil his principal professional duty, the defence of his client\u2019s interests. Indeed, the lawyer\u2019s speech \u2013 arguments and persuasions, whether oral or written \u2013 is his main resource. As my honourable colleague, Judge Casadevall, has written on this subject: \u201cSpeech! The sole weapon (together with the pen or the keyboard) \u2013 and a very simple but nevertheless formidable one \u2013 at the lawyer\u2019s disposal when ... he is defending a party to proceedings\u201d.",

But it would not be rational to leave the possibility of criticism only to \u201coutside\u201d observers, for a wall of silence imposed on professionals in relation to a trial that is important for public opinion would discredit the court in the public eye more than the criticisms emanating from those professionals. It is precisely the lawyers who appear in the case before the court, and who have the requisite qualification to see the faults and defects in the proceedings, that the public count upon to receive information. To turn court proceedings into a closed forum where one should not \u201cair one\u2019s dirty washing\u201d would, in my opinion, affect the image of the judicial system more than explicit criticism, provided, of course, that it does not become offensive or purely speculative.
