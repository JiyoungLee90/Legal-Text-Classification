The cell was humid, badly heated during the winter and deprived of ventilation during the summer. Given that in the cell there was neither running water, nor toilet facilities, the applicant had had to use a bucket to relieve himself. He was allowed to leave his cell three times a day, during meal times, for about forty-five minutes each time, in order to slop out, eat, wash himself and re-fill his water bottle from the tap. The prison was infested with cockroaches and rats, and he was only allowed to shower once a fortnight. The food was insufficient in quantity and of poor quality. During visits, he was separated from his family and lawyers by a grill and the meetings always took place in the presence of prison staff. His correspondence was routinely read by prison staff as he was obliged to transmit his letters to the outside world in open envelopes. The envelopes carrying correspondence with his lawyer bore a stamp showing that they had been checked.",

On the basis of an order of the prison governor of 19 February 2009, he did not take part in collective activities with other inmates, even those in his own category. In addition, the Government submitted that owing to lack of physical space in the prison, it was impossible to organise collective sport activities, or gather inmates for the purposes of reading, listening to music, playing board games or using the computer.

According to the applicant, its floor was partially made of bare cement and there was no sports equipment there. According to the Government, there was a climbing wall, a bench and a fixed-height bar. Both parties submitted that each time the applicant left the high-security wing of the prison, he was handcuffed and the handcuffs were shackled to a belt.

The Court held that there had been no violation of Article 3. It follows that the ninth applicant\u2019s related complaint concerning the period until 2 September 2010, the date of the delivery of the judgment in the case of Iorgov (no. 2) (cited above), must be rejected under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 2 (b) and 4 of the Convention as being substantially the same as a matter that has already been examined by the Court.

Also, the automatic segregation of life prisoners from the rest of the prison population and from each other, in particular where no comprehensive out-of-cell activities or in-cell stimuli are available, may in itself raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Savi\u010ds v. Latvia, no. 17892/03, \u00a7 139, 27 November 2012), and the isolation should be justified by particular security reasons (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7 204, with further references to soft-law instruments; see also Radev, cited above, \u00a7 42).",

It has already held (see Harakchiev and\u00a0Toloumov, cited above, \u00a7 208) that it appears that this situation was to a great extent a result of the automatic application of the legal provisions regulating the applicants\u2019 prison regime. The Government have not referred to any participation of the applicants in meaningful reasonable activities or educational courses, apart from indicating that in the case of Mr Shahanov (the tenth applicant) he had the possibility of attending two weekly activities lasting between an hour and an hour and a half, which the Court does not consider, on their own, sufficient. In addition, unlike in respect of the other applicants who made this complaint, the Government stated that Mr Mitev (the seventh applicant) had been in almost permanent contact with other inmates (see paragraph 24 above). In the absence of more specific details and material submitted to show the intensity of such contact, and in view of the fact that Mr Mitev has been serving his sentence under the most restrictive \u201cspecial regime\u201d with all the related restrictions stemming from the relevant legal framework described in the relevant Court\u2019s case-law and confirmed by the Government in their related observations in the present case, the Court is not persuaded that the Government\u2019s submissions are sufficient to prove otherwise.",

That said, since the Government have not raised either in their written observations, or on their own initiative following the adoption of these legal changes, an objection to the admissibility of the present applications on the basis of failure of the applicants to exhaust domestic remedies, the Court cannot pronounce proprio motu on this issue (see N.C. v.
