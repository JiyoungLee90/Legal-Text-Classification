The offence carried a thirty-year prison sentence. During the first-instance criminal proceedings, three certified sworn-in experts were appointed. A psychologist, J.R., and a psychiatrist, V.R., were asked to assess the accountability of the defendant and the probability that he had committed the criminal offences of which he had been accused. An expert in forensic medicine, J.B., was asked to prepare a report and testify, among other things, about the time of death of the victims, which was an important element in the accusation against the applicant\u2019s client. In his written and oral submissions the applicant continuously protested his client\u2019s innocence, pointing to what in his view was unreliable expert evidence, and requesting the exclusion of all evidence obtained by alleged violations of his client\u2019s human rights.

In his written and oral submissions before the Ljubljana Higher Court, the applicant strongly criticised the work of the experts, public prosecutor and the court and used a number of expressions which the Higher Court found amounted to contempt of court (see paragraph 19 below).",

The duty of the courts in general and the court deciding on the merits of the case is to direct proceedings in such a manner so as to ensure the proper conduct of the parties and above all the fairness of the trial \u2013 rather than to examine in a subsequent trial the appropriateness of the party\u2019s statements in the courtroom However, this does not entail that the defence counsel\u2019s freedom of expression in criminal proceedings should be unlimited. Due to the fact that a defence counsel takes part in judicial proceedings and that his right to freedom of expression is intended for the protection of the rights of others, it is limited to a greater extent than the right to freedom of expression of any other individual in a public space may be limited. A defence counsel is namely limited by the fact that he participates in proceedings that are [formalised] and as such conducted in a rational manner, as well as by his professional ethics. A defence counsel may express strong and sharp criticism, however his argumentation in protecting the interests of his clients must remain within the range of reasonable argumentation, and there is no room for insults charged with emotion. It is understandable that in cases of defending a defendant charged with a grave criminal offence for which a severe penalty is prescribed, the tolerance threshold which may be allowed by the courts may be higher than in other cases, however, the defence counsel may not cross the outer boundaries of this tolerance. If he does cross them, it is proper that the court protects other values, i.e. confidence in the judiciary and the good reputation and authority of the judiciary, which ensures that the public respects the courts and has confidence that the courts are able to perform the role they have in a state governed by the rule of law. Protecting the authority of the judiciary includes the notion that the courts are the proper forum for the settlement of legal disputes and for the determination of a person\u2019s guilt or innocence regarding a criminal charge, whereby it is important that the public at large have respect for and confidence in the courts\u2019 capacity to fulfil that function. The above-mentioned is a constitutionally admissible reason to limit the defence counsel\u2019s right to freedom of expression. The Constitutional Court has already [emphasised] in Decision No. U-I-145/03 that the institution of a punishment for insulting submissions is not the primary way to ensure the good reputation and authority of the judiciary, it is, however, an additional (and subordinate) tool which ensures the protection of the good reputation of the courts in situations in which confidence in the work of the judiciary is undermined by degrading criticism and [generalised], and from the viewpoint of the protection of rights in an individual case, unnecessary attacks on the work of the courts.",

The complainant used the expressions mentioned in the first paragraph of the reasoning of this decision while defending a defendant who was charged with murder, for which the prescribed sentence is thirty years of imprisonment. The expressions entailed criticism of the expert witnesses who provided expert opinions in the criminal proceedings as permanently sworn-in experts. On the basis of [section] 248 of the Criminal Procedure Act, expert witnesses are engaged when the determination or assessment of a material fact call for the findings and opinion of a specialist possessing the necessary expertise for the task. The Constitutional Court in Decision No. U-I-132/95, dated 8 January 1998 (Official Gazette RS, No. 11/98 and OdlUS VII,1), [emphasised] that expert testimony is not only evidence, that is, a source for learning of relevant facts, but that an expert witness is an assistant to the court in exercising its function. The requirement that expert witnesses must be impartial follows from this, as otherwise parties to criminal proceedings would not be in an equal position. In view of the position that expert witnesses have as assistants to the courts in exercising their function, their authority must be protected in the same manner as the authority of the judiciary. This is a constitutionally admissible aim for which it was admissible to limit the complainant\u2019s right to freedom of expression. Therefore, the Constitutional Court cannot accept the complainant\u2019s view that a situation in which he directs insulting expressions towards the court is different than a situation in which such expressions are directed towards expert witness.",

The courts\u2019 assessment that the complainant expressed contemptuous criticism towards the expert witnesses is supported by reasons and is not unsound. The complainant did not merely express sharp criticism of the expert opinions, but his insulting remarks entailed personal disparagement of the expert witnesses as experts. The expressed contemptuous criticism is beyond the reasonable argumentation by which the defence counsel could justify his motion that new expert witnesses be called. Therefore, it cannot be accepted that such criticism could be justified for the purpose of exercising the defendant\u2019s right to a defence as determined in Article 29 of the Constitution. Contemptuous criticism of an expert witness as a person who has been called to provide an expert opinion could even threaten a fair trial in criminal proceedings. The Constitutional Court has already [emphasised] in Decision No. U-I-145/03 that it is of exceptional importance that parties to proceedings [realise] that insulting sharp speech before the court does not prove that the defence counsel has provided quality representation. The quality defence provided by a defence counsel can also not be based on expressing contemptuous criticism which shows contempt for expert witnesses, instead, the defence must be directed towards a criticism of their opinions provided in the individual proceedings, and supported by arguments and reason. Therefore, it cannot be expected from the courts that they should, within the boundaries of tolerance, also allow insults for which the courts reasonably assessed that they showed contempt for the expert witnesses in their capacity as expert assistants to the court. Therefore, the interference with the complainant\u2019s right to freedom of expression which the court made by punishing the defence counsel for the expressed insults with a fine, is not disproportional.",

In Decision No. 145/03, the Constitutional Court already [emphasised] that the possibility of independent criminal protection is not an appropriate substitute and cannot serve the purpose for which the legislature enacted the possibility that insulting submissions be punished. The Constitutional Court reiterates that the protection which the legislature defined in the first paragraph of [section] 78 of the Criminal Procedure Act is not intended to protect individual expert witnesses but to protect the good reputation and authority of the judiciary as a whole.

Judge C.R., who voted against, wrote an extensive dissenting opinion. He argued that the applicant\u2019s conduct had been judged too harshly by the majority, who had not approached the case correctly. In particular, the Constitutional Court had supported the finding of no violation by the fact that the impugned statements had been given during court proceedings, although \u2012 in his view \u2012 this should have weighed in favour of the applicant. Furthermore, proper attention had not been given in the reasoning to the nature of the proceedings, which had been criminal not civil, the target, which had been the experts and not the court, and the seriousness of the criminal offence the client had been risking \u2013 an offence carrying a potential thirty-year prison sentence. In this connection, the dissenting judge argued that the Constitutional Court should have taken account of the principles arising in Kyprianou v. Cyprus ([GC], no. 73797/01, ECHR 2005-XIII), especially those relating to the role of defence lawyers in criminal trials. He pointed out that a public prosecutor could not be fined for contempt of court and that less invasive measures were available to the court which were applicable to both defence lawyers and public prosecutors. In his opinion, such measures might constitute interruption of the speech in question, a formal warning, and the informing of the appropriate professional association or body. Lastly, he pointed to the danger that the decision in the present case might have a discouraging effect on other defence lawyers, particularly given that the penalising of expressions such as \u201cprofessional weakness\u201d had been considered justified by the Constitutional Court.",

As regards expert J.R., the applicant stated that he had \u201cdirected all his intellectual abilities at defending his unprofessional opinion\u201d. The applicant further referred to the objections made by the defence, which had allegedly been ignored by J.R., and stated that he, \u201cas a layman, [could not] consider such conduct to be anything else than a reflection of possible narcissism on the part of the expert himself\u201d. Regarding the criticism of expert V.R., the applicant referred to the examination of this expert during the trial, to the statements he had given and which, in the applicant\u2019s view, showed that V.R. had been using methods which had not been within his competence, and had claimed to have been using a particular test \u201cwithout ever seeing the original ... in his life\u201d. The applicant also argued that V.R. had not shown \u201cthe slightest scientific doubt but had focused all his energy on defending his own infallibility\u201d. As to expert J.B., the applicant stressed that his comments had related to J.B.\u2019s assessment of the time of death \u2013 the air temperature at the time of the victims\u2019 death had been an important, but disregarded, factor. In the applicant\u2019s opinion, the assessment of the time of death had been done carelessly by J.B., who had kept changing his mind on the issue. The applicant pointed out that the time of death had been a crucial element in the trial and could have led to an acquittal if assessed properly. He concluded that \u201csuch expert opinions [were] a catastrophe for the Slovenian judiciary and very dangerous for its citizens\u201d.",

The Supreme Court noted that the courts were under obligation to protect their authority and the dignity of the participants in the proceedings. While section 78 of the Criminal Procedure Act provided for disciplinary sanctions, it could not be interpreted as allowing sanctioning of every inappropriate expression. Instead, the courts were called to take into account all the circumstances and decide whether, on balance, the insult had been such as to require a disciplinary sanction. The Supreme Court stressed that the courts had to show particular restraint and caution in deciding on a disciplinary sanction against a defence counsel, because in such cases not only was his or her right to freedom of expression at stake but also his or her role in defending the accused person in criminal proceedings. It noted that a defence counsel might, therefore, be critical of the State prosecutor and other participants in the proceedings, including the court, but even this rule did not apply in absolute terms. If a defence counsel conducted his defence in criminal proceedings by insulting or humiliating other participants, by accusing them of personal dishonesty or bias or of lacking the essential professional capacities, personal qualities or similar, or if he or she was also insulting to the court, his or her conduct was deemed unacceptable and therefore had to be subject to a sanction by a fine pursuant to section 78 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The Supreme Court concurred with the Higher Court that the case at hand involved insulting value judgments and expressions of contempt and disrespect for other participants in the proceedings and the court. The Supreme Court referred to the applicant\u2019s statements and examined their semantic meanings and upheld the view that he \u201chad expressed contempt for the court experts, not only regarding their professional abilities but also by attributing to them negative personal characteristics, thereby expressing insulting value judgments\u201d. The Supreme Court also pointed out that the applicant had had the right to challenge the correctness of the court\u2019s procedural decisions, but should have done so in a legally acceptable manner. The Supreme Court also found that the Higher Court had provided reasonable grounds for the amount of the fine imposed.",

He argued that his criticism had been essentially directed against the experts and the public prosecutor and not against the court. Although the participants in question might have preferred not to hear his opinion, he had had to express it for the benefit of the defendant. In the applicant\u2019s view, the court had to take into account the importance of freedom of expression in the process of a criminal trial, which was one of the most important mechanisms of State repression. He also argued that he had expressed acceptable criticism which, though presented in a slightly illustrative manner, had not been insulting to the experts but instead had challenged the credibility of their opinions. He argued that he had expressed the impugned opinions with the aim of providing the best possible defence to his client and that his punishment had not been necessary in a democratic society. Relying on Nikula (cited above), he argued that the critical comments had been directed solely at the unprofessional and inappropriate work of the experts and had not insulted the court in any way.",

The Court further reiterates that where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement (see Veraart v. the Netherlands, no. 10807/04, \u00a7\u00a055, 30 November 2006). In this connection, it is important for the defendant to be afforded a realistic chance to prove that there was a sufficient factual basis for his allegations (see, among other authorities, Morice, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0155, with further references).",

In particular, despite the regrettable lack of prudence in the applicant\u2019s expressions, it cannot be denied that the impugned remarks had basis in the facts he had put forward with a view to challenging the credibility of the experts and the non-disclosure of the lie-detector test results (see paragraphs 6 to 11 above).

In particular, we argued that \u201c[t]he insulting nature of ...

This, however, is clearly a false translation. The statement, in Slovenian, reads \u201c(neosmi\u0161ljeno) nakladanje\u201d. While \u201cneosmi\u0161ljeno\u201d can be translated as senseless (meaningless, nonsense), \u201cnakladanje\u201d in Slovenian is far from value-neutral \u201ctalking\u201d in standard English. It is a slang word with a clearly derogatory and contemptuous connotation. The proper translation of this slang word would be, for example, \u201cdrivel\u201d and in the given case this word is aggravated in combination with the word \u201cneosmi\u0161ljeno\u201d \u2013 which in the cited decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Slovenia is translated (by the Constitutional Court itself) as \u201cmeaningless drivel\u201d. Thus, the applicant, who asserts before this Court that he was fined for the value-neutral and standard-language word \u201ctalking\u201d, whereas in fact it was (at best) \u201cdrivel\u201d, has mislead the Court by knowingly submitting a false statement of fact. No one in Slovenia with at least an average knowledge of English would, in good faith, translate \u201cnakladanje\u201d as \u201ctalking\u201d. The same is true for another derogatory and abusive slang word used by the applicant in the domestic court proceedings \u2013 \u201c\u0161lamparija\u201d (from German \u201cSchlamperei\u201d), which, however, he translated in his application to the European Court by the neutral and formal legal term \u201cnegligence\u201d (in Slovenian: malomarnost). Equally, another phrase from the first set of contempt proceedings, namely the \u201cexpert\u2019s mental construct\u201d, is again an inaccurate and misleading translation of the phrase used by the applicant: (izveden\u010devi) \u201cumotvori\u201d. This too is a slang expression, detached from its literal meaning (\u201cumotvor\u201d \u2013 product of mind; in its original meaning, perceived nowadays as already archaic in Slovenia, has not just a neutral, but a strong positive connotation). However, in the given context the expression in Slovenian slang is used \u2013 in complete contrast to its original positive connotation \u2013 when one wishes to state that something was particularly stupid. As such, it is not merely \u201ccaustic\u201d but entails personal and contemptuous disparagement that flatly dismisses the author\u2019s intellectual ability \u2013 e.g. if a scientific paper, a lawyer\u2019s appeal, a judgment or an expert\u2019s report were denounced as an \u201cumotvor\u201d. The Constitutional Court translated \u201cizveden\u010devi umotvori\u201d as the expert\u2019s piece of art (lacking any equivalent phrase in English, this translation comes closest to the cynical and, in the circumstances, contemptuous nature of the statement), not as the nearly value-neutral and standard language \u201cmental construct\u201d, which merely implies a lack of a proper factual basis for the findings.",

It is, in my view, regrettable that the present judgment simply cuts and pastes the translations submitted by the applicant himself, without examining whether the translation provided by him is accurate, or whether he tried to downplay the harshness and personally abusive character of his statements. Equally regrettably, the judgment \u2013 although it otherwise extensively cuts and pastes the decision of the Slovenian Constitutional Court (originally translated into English by the Constitutional Court itself) \u2013 does not accept the translation of the Slovenian Constitutional Court as regards the decisive disputed statements. Rather, it prefers to accept the applicant\u2019s own translation. While it is appalling that the Government failed to object to the applicant\u2019s false translations, I do not think this precludes the Court from checking the accuracy of the translations. After all, in standard cases, where applications are filed in the applicant\u2019s native language, it is the Court that provides translations. Thus (argumentum a maiori ad minus), if an applicant (as was exceptionally done in this case for certain apparent reasons) himself translates parts of an impugned decision of the domestic courts, the accuracy of such translations should not be left entirely out of the ambit of the Court\u2019s scrutiny.",

These contemptuous and unsubstantiated attacks on the authority of the judiciary directly challenge the legitimacy of the legal system as a whole, and as such can never be said to have a \u201csufficiently close connection to the facts of the case\u201d. Instead of engaging in such unsubstantiated criticism of the judiciary, a lawyer should actively help to maintain the legitimacy of the justice system and due respect for the judiciary (see, for example, Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611/96, \u00a7\u00a045, ECHR 2002II), and should strive to be a model for clients in showing respect for the role of the courts in the legal system. This case can be contrasted with the recent judgment in Peruzzi v. Italy (39294/09, 30\u00a0June 2015), where a lawyer was prosecuted (and fined approximately 15,000\u00a0euros) for stating that a judge had \u201cwilfully made mistakes, by malicious intent, serious misconduct or negligence.\u201d With regard to both the content and the language and phrases used by the lawyer in the above case, these statements were far less extreme and contemptuous than those made by the applicant in the present case. Yet this Court found no violation of Article\u00a010 of the Convention in Peruzzi.",

On the contrary, the present case concerns exactly that: a contemptuous negation of the expert\u2019s intellect, professional and other qualities, and general level of expertise. It could not actually be more obvious in the plain language used: \u201cprofessional weakness of the expert witnesses\u201d, as well as \u201cquackery\u201d (that is, faking the status of a medical doctor, pretending to have experience or knowledge, especially in the field of medicine!), combined with \u201cmeaningless drivel\u201d, \u201cpiece of art\u201d, \u201cstone-age methods\u201d, psychological methods that he clearly does not understand, and certain negative character qualities (narcissistic, dilettantish). Nevertheless, this crucial difference between the present case and Nikula, and the aspect that is strongly emphasised in Nikula as a necessary part of the test, was utterly ignored. I anticipate that one might argue that a comment such as \u201cquackery\u201d was directed against the work of the expert, not against the expert (\u201ca quack\u201d). But in reality, this Court \u2013 which itself stresses that it is not just the wording but the context that should be assessed \u2013 should easily recognise that the question of whether the statement is intended to degrade someone as a person or merely challenge the product of his or her work (a quack or quackery?) cannot depend on such technical distinction in the wording.",

It has been universally accepted by bar associations themselves that courteous, respectful, and civil behaviour forms part of the lawyers\u2019 code of conduct and that such behaviour is not incompatible with the concept of zealous and firm representation. If the expert\u2019s report is wrong, this can be stated \u2013 and the client\u2019s interests duly protected \u2013 with adequate respect for the legal process and without contemptuous, vulgar, and degrading personal attacks and disparagements. As both the appellate court and the concurring opinion of Constitutional Court judge Zobec convincingly stated, there are thousands of ways in which the expert could have delivered the same message, with no less effectiveness as regards the protection of his client\u2019s interests, but with a sufficient degree of respect for the integrity of the judicial process and without contemptuous attacks on the expert witness. As countless of cases of fine advocacy demonstrate on a daily basis, it is possible to \u201ctear apart mercilessly\u201d, \u201cruthlessly\u201d, and \u201caggressively\u201d the expert\u2019s report with a firm and devastatingly sharp analysis and argument, but at the same time without outbursts of personal attacks against the expert as a person. Sharp, uncompromising, and even destructive criticism can be expressed \u2013 actually much more effectively \u2013 in a dignified manner. This makes this case significantly different from, for example, Nikula, Morice, or Kyprianou v. Cyprus ([GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7\u00a0118, ECHR 2005XIII), where it was not the degrading and contemptuous language or personal disparagement of other participants in the legal process that triggered the courts\u2019 reaction, but to a far greater extent the merits of the statements themselves.",

Specifically, the Rules of Professional Conduct require zealous representation of a client\u2019s case, and also impose certain limitations on the manner of such representation. Lawyers, while being expected to fiercely represent their client\u2019s interests, also have duties to the court, the adversarial parties, and third parties. It has been accepted by bar associations themselves that staunch advocacy and zealous, fierce, and vigorous pursuit of a client\u2019s case does not legitimise and is no excuse for unprofessional, discourteous, or uncivil behaviour toward any person involved in the legal process. See, for example, Article 1 of the IBA International Principles on Conduct for the Legal Profession and Article 43 of the CCBE Code of Conduct for European Lawyers, which reads: \u201cA lawyer shall while maintaining due respect and courtesy towards the court defend the interests of the client honourably and fearlessly...\u201d. The Commentary annexed to the Code explains as follows: \u201cThis provision reflects the necessary balance between respect for the court and for the law on the one hand and the pursuit of the client\u2019s best interest on the other.\u201d There are hence additional elements that have to be placed on the balance when lawyers\u2019 freedom of speech in a courtroom is being assessed.",

Thus, the circumstances that (1) the impugned statements were made by a lawyer representing his client, (2) that they were made in the course of judicial proceedings, and (3) that they were directed against the judiciary and the court-appointed experts, as assistants to the judge, do not solely mitigate the lawyer\u2019s responsibility, as the majority opinion seems to suggest. Equally, they aggravate it. Thus a proper balance must be found \u2013 as was duly examined by the national Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court.",

It is legitimate to expect that lawyers, through their own behaviour in the courtroom, will maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. It is precisely for these reasons that the independently adopted rules of conduct favour civil and courteous behaviour over contemptuous insults, the use of vulgar or slang language, swearwords and derogatory attacks on the persons involved in the legal process. As was observed: \u201c[T]he justice system cannot function effectively when the professionals charged with administering it cannot even be polite to one another. Stress and frustration drive down productivity and make the process more time-consuming and expensive. Many of the best people get driven away from the field. The profession and the system itself lose esteem in the public\u2019s eyes.\u201d Lawyers must play their part in ensuring that their clients\u2019 cases can be decided according to the law. Driving proceedings away from reasonable discourse based on rational legal arguments, and towards the irrational emotional sphere, would be disastrous for the sound administration of justice \u2013 disastrous not merely from the viewpoint of expediency, but from the viewpoint of the goal that the system that is most suited to producing adequate results on the merits should be maintained. Hence, when client\u2019s interests can equally effectively be pursued in a manner that does not jeopardise the above goals, such an approach should be chosen.",

With regard to behaviour such as that demonstrated by the applicant in the present case, however, the situation is actually simpler. There is in fact no conflict between the expected level of professionalism, civility, dignity, and courtesy by a lawyer in the courtroom on the one hand, and the protection of the client\u2019s best interests on the other. Adjudication is \u2013 and should remain \u2013 a rational process, which should give rise to adequate results on the merits. Throwing outbursts of frustration and emotion into the arena, fostering hostility between professionals (the court, lawyers, court-appointed experts), blurring the legally relevant facts and legal arguments, and replacing them with the harassment or intimidation of other participants in proceedings not only renders the sound administration of justice more difficult, but also does a disservice to the client\u2019s interests. As stated above, it is perfectly possible to \u201cmercilessly tear apart\u201d an expert\u2019s opinion through staunch and firm analysis and legal argumentation, without personally and contemptuously attacking the personality of experts. Replacing the former with the latter cannot serve the client\u2019s interests well. Even adding the latter to the former does not serve the client\u2019s interests, since it merely results in a distraction and drifting away from what is relevant. It also creates \u2013 as always where emotional outbursts and insults are offered instead of rational (counter-) arguments \u2013 a situation wherein the impression is formed that there are actually no rational counter-arguments at all. The presentation of such arguments in a professional and firm manner is more effective than abusive or disruptive behaviour. In adjudication based on rational legal discourse, personal attacks, harassment and contemptuous statements against (expert) witnesses do not benefit the client. Unless, of course, they produce the effect of intimidating (expert) witnesses (that is, tampering) in the courtroom. If the (expert) witness yields under such intimidation, this can certainly affect the outcome of the proceedings. But this is deemed to be a perversion of the course of justice.",

What matters, however, is how the lawyer\u2019s choice of statements, language, tactics, and overall behaviour in a courtroom affects the search for a proper balance when it comes to the inherent conflict between zealously protecting the client\u2019s best interests, on the one hand, and the need to maintain the authority and integrity of the legal system, on the other. There is a need to strike a balance between remaining professional, courteous, and civil and the zealous exercise of the lawyer\u2019s role.

Living in Slovenia, I have sadly witnessed this trend. Professional, respectful, civil, and courteous advocacy is increasingly being perceived as a sign of weakness and frowned upon in public opinion and in an influential part of the media. Likewise, cheap showmanship, along with contemptuous, derogatory, and unsubstantiated attacks on the dignity, authority, and integrity of the judiciary and all those involved in the process of law is increasingly being perceived as a synonym for the zealous, firm, and vigorous exercise of the lawyer\u2019s true role. The courts \u2013 national and supranational \u2013 should fulfil their role in trying to avert such trends.
