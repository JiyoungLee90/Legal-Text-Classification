For example, in the corruption-ridden case of the \u201cTown Charity Fund for Health Care Support\u201d, charges had been brought against only one member of the town legislature, Mr K[.], but shortly thereafter he was acquitted. And the mayor's close circle, headed by Mr A[.] in person, was spared responsibility. In gratitude for support the town hall started supplying the prosecutor's offices with 'gifts' in the form of foreign-made cars and furniture. As to the regional prosecutor Mr B[.], the town hall allocated to him under a 49-year lease agreement (!) a plot of land in the courtyard of the block of flats where he lives (allegedly for development).\u201d",

In line with the provisions of Article\u00a010\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention, in his article the applicant had discussed issues of public interest concerning the interaction of political groups in the region and criticised the actions of the regional prosecutor.

They confined their analysis to the importance of the protection of the public prosecutor's interests without giving any consideration to the Convention standard which requires very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on debates on questions of public interest initiated by members of the press (see, among other authorities, Godlevskiy v. Russia, no. 14888/03, \u00a7\u00a041, 23\u00a0October 2008).

When rejecting the applicant's argument, the domestic authorities did not examine the question whether the excerpt could be considered a value judgment. Nor did they specify what objective evidence could be used to prove whether the impugned excerpt was true or false. The Court notes in this respect that the assessment of whether a certain statement constitutes a value judgment or a statement of fact might in many cases be difficult. However, under the Court's case-law even a value judgment must be based on sufficient facts in order to constitute a fair comment under Article\u00a010 (see, for example, Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v.

The Court notes that the truthfulness of all the premises on which the applicant had based his allegation was confirmed in the domestic proceedings. Criminal proceedings were indeed brought against certain members of the regional government, the member of the town legislature K. B. did receive a plot of land under the conditions indicated by the applicant, and the  town hall did put at the disposal of the prosecutor's offices a Hyundai car, six tables and nine filing cabinets (see paragraph 11).
