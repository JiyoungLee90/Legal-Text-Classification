He complained that he had not had an effective opportunity to challenge the seizure order in a hearing before the Vukovar County Court and that the seizure of his property had been disproportionate and thus contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The applicant further stressed that it was unclear for which amount of the alleged pecuniary gain the seizure order had been made given that the Vukovar County Court had only referred to one count of the indictment, alleging that he had obtained pecuniary gain in the amount of HRK\u00a01,800,857, whereas it had ignored the other count of the indictment according to which he had obtained a pecuniary gain in the amount of HRK\u00a06,169,977.35. The applicant, therefore, assuming that the overall amount of the pecuniary gain for which the seizure order had been made corresponded to the sum of the two amounts noted (approximately EUR\u00a01,060,000), submitted a detailed estimate value of each item of the restrained property based on the information from a publicly available Internet portal on the market values of real properties in Croatia. According to this estimate, the total value of the seized property corresponded to some EUR\u00a09,887,084. The applicant thus contended that there was a gross disproportionality between the alleged pecuniary gain obtained by the commission of the offences referred to in the indictment and the value of the seized property, which imposed on him an excessive individual burden.",

Specifically, the investigation case file had only contained information concerning the difference between the purchase and accounting value of the property with regard to the purchase contracts of 1997, namely fifteen years before the request for seizure of the property had been made. It had therefore not been possible to assess the value of the real property on the basis of such estimates. In any case, however, any such possible estimate concerned only a limited number of items of the real property, whereas the remainder of the property in respect of which the seizure order had been made had remained without any relevant estimate of its value.",

The applicant therefore considered that, without any such assessment being made by the competent authorities, their decision on the seizure of his property had been disproportionate and contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01. This had therefore endangered his business activities as the restrained real property had been the only valuable property which he owned that allowed him to pursue his business activities. In particular, the applicant explained that his business activities were associated with agriculture and that it was therefore of paramount importance for him to be able to dispose freely of the real property (in particular the plots of land) so as to be able, for instance, to take loans by providing mortgages on that property.",

According to this information the total value of the applicant\u2019s restrained property was estimated at some EUR 9,887,084, whereas he was indicted in the criminal proceedings for having procured an unlawful pecuniary gain in the total amount of some EUR 1,060,000, thus nine times less than the purported value of his seized property (see paragraph\u00a027 above).",
