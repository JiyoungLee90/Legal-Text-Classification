On the contrary, it noted that some reasonable delay could have been caused due to the general complexity of the restitution process and the difficulties encountered by the authorities in the particular case (see paragraph 26 above). Accordingly, the Court cannot conclude that any loss of profit for the applicant during the whole period between 2000 and 2014 was the direct and proximate result of the violation of her rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

Moreover, the applicant complains of the impossibility to undertake what is in essence an economic activity, and the Court has already referred, in the context of claims regarding lost profit, to the inherent uncertainty of such activities (see, for example, Basarba OOD v.\u00a0Bulgaria (just satisfaction), no. 77660/01, \u00a7 26, 20 January 2011).
