However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Selmouni v.

It is satisfied that no such treaty exists between Russia and . At the same time, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court of Russia of 7 June 2002 cited above (paragraph 40), it is cognisant that the Russian legal system does not exclude enforcement of the judgments adopted by the courts of the State with which Russia has no pertinent agreement and authorizes the courts of general jurisdiction to consider other relevant factors when examining the case. Seeing that the cited decision was already in force at the time the applicant obtained a judgment of the South African court in his favour, the Court cannot accept the applicant's argument that lack of a relevant agreement between two States automatically rendered the most obvious legal remedy in his case ineffective and his potential attempts to take advantage of it superfluous. It considers that, especially in view of the fact that the applicant had explored several other avenues of action to attain his goal, no objective circumstance existed that would have made it impossible for him to file a request with a national court for enforcement of the judgment.",
