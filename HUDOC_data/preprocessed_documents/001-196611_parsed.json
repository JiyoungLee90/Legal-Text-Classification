If left uncorrected, the use of a declaratory ruling in the applicants\u2019 case would have interfered with the established interpretation of the scope of such actions, as well as with the purpose of arbitration proceedings and the public\u2019s trust in them. Moreover, as the instrument of 12 April 2002 had stemmed from arbitration proceedings and constituted a final and enforceable title for the person benefiting from it, enabling the applicants to challenge it by way of a\u00a0general action in court would have unjustifiably interfered with the other parties\u2019 rights stemming from the principles of\u00a0legal certainty and res judicata.
