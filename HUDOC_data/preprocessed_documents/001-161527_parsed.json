It notes, in this regard, cases which have been brought before the Court concerning gender identity revealing the intimate importance that one gives to it (see, among many other authorities, Grant v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a032570/03, ECHR 2006VII; L. v.

Accordingly, any interference with an artist\u2019s right to such expression must be examined with particular care (see Vereinigung Bildender K\u00fcnstler v.\u00a0Austria, no. 68354/01, \u00a7 33, 25 January 2007, and Alves da Silva v.\u00a0Portugal, no. 41665/07, \u00a7 27, 20 October 2009; see also, mutatis mutandis, Tu\u015falp v.
