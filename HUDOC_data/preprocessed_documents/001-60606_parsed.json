In considering whether a particular form of treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3 (see, for example, the Raninen v. Finland judgment of 16 December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 1997-VIII, pp. 2821-22, \u00a7 55).

Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that a broad construction of the text of the reservation as it applies to Article 97 of the CCP could result in certain findings that extensions of detention on remand beyond the time-limits set out in Sections 4-7 of Article 97 of the CCP are lawful: in cases where the defendant and his or her advocate cannot examine the case-file before the expiry of the maximum custody period, where the defendant and his or her advocate request further investigations or when a court remits a case for further investigations when the custody period has expired.",

In this connection, it is necessary to determine whether \u201cdetention on remand\u201d includes the time spent in custody after the criminal case has been transferred to the trial court.",

This difference is reflected in the law of 13 June 2001 which limited to six months the maximum length of court proceedings in criminal cases. However, in paragraph 110 of its judgment, the Court, with reference to its case-law, considered that detention on remand encompasses the whole pre-trial detention period, from the day when the individual is taken into custody until the trial court's verdict. After all, for a detainee locked up in an overcrowded prison cell, it makes little difference whether his or her detention is considered to be pending the investigation or pending the trial, or whether it was effected before or after the Convention came into force in respect of the respondent State. This difference could, however, be of importance for the Court, if the Court were to accept that a State's margin of appreciation is relevant to the determination of the reasonableness of custody periods.",

This part of the applicant's detention cannot be imputed to the respondent State because it pre-dated the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Russia (incompatible ratione temporis).",

One should not forget that the delay in passing verdict and, consequently, the applicant's prolonged stay in custody, was partly attributable to the applicant's challenges to judges and his requests that the proceedings be conducted by a different court, as well as to the replacement of advocates and their failure to appear, which facts the Court implicitly accepts at paragraph 130 of its judgment. This delay totalled one year and three months. It would not, of course, justify the procedural delays caused by the courts themselves, but nonetheless creates a different picture of the applicant's detention pending trial.",

It is true, however, that the applicant's arguments are reinforced by the fact that this verdict was not final, given the further investigation and new verdict given on 31\u00a0March\u00a02000.",
