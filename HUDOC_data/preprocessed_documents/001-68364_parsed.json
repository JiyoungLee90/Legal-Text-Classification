However, the legislature fixed an unreasonably low basic rent and allowed only strictly regulated increases, correlated with the inflation rate.

The decrease in the inflation rate, although a generally positive sign of economic stability, has resulted in the stagnation of rent at low levels.",

The pace of transition to a reasonable level of rent was faster than at present, if only because municipalities, themselves owning residential buildings, had a strong interest in securing genuine increases in rent.

However, these issues concern the degree of the State\u2019s interference, and not its nature. All the measures taken, whose aim was to subject the applicant\u2019s house to continued tenancy and not to take it away from her permanently, could not be considered a formal or even de facto expropriation but constituted a means of State control of the use of her property.

However, having regard to the relevant indicators as supplied by the parties, the Court considers that it did not result in the applicant\u2019s situation being materially improved. According to the Government, in the period immediately preceding the repeal of section 9(3), i.e. October 2002, the maximum rent for similar flats in her town was PLN\u00a04.61 per 1 square metre, whereas the amount actually available to the applicant throughout and at the end of 2004 reached PLN 5.15 (see paragraphs 67-69 above). That amount (approximately 1.27 euros), which was within the applicable rent rates (PLN 5.00-PLN 6.00) in most other towns in the country, represented merely some mere 10% increase in the previous indicative rent, which, as clearly established above, was totally insufficient to cover basic maintenance costs (see paragraphs 108 and 177-178 above).
