The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until at least July 2010, the \u201cMRT\u201d was only able to continue to exist, and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region, because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Ivan\u0163oc and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116-20; Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0121-22; and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110).

While in his initial application the applicant referred to his detention based on the \u201cMRT\u201d prosecutor\u2019s decision as the one constituting a breach of Article 5 of the Convention, he also noted that he had not and could not be brought before a \u201ccourt\u201d even though he had noted in the facts of the case his conviction by an \u201cMRT\u201d court. He thus clearly did not consider the \u201cMRT\u201d courts as lawful tribunals. Moreover, he added in his Article 6 complaint that the \u201cMRT\u201d courts were unconstitutional and had not been created by law. The Court, being the master of characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case, considers that the part of the complaint under Article 6 concerning the unlawfulness of the \u201cMRT\u201d courts is to be examined under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. It thus finds that, read together, the complaints under Articles 5 and 6 made in the initial application included the lawfulness of his detention after a decision of an \u201cMRT\u201d prosecutor and after his conviction by an \u201cMRT\u201d court.
