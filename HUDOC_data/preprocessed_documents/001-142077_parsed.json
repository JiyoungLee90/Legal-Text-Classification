Notwithstanding the fact that the settlement proposal was made to the applicant by reference to section 25, as the proceedings to which the applicant was a party continued before the Supreme and the Constitutional Court after 31\u00a0March 2007, the above provision did not give a remedy to the applicant\u2019s case (see, mutatis mutandis, Robert Lesjak v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 33946/03, \u00a7\u00a7 47-53, 21 July 2009 and Toma\u017ei\u010d v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 38350/02, 13 December 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45). The Court finds that the Government have not submitted any convincing arguments which would require the Court to distinguish the present case from the above mentioned cases and not take into account the proceedings before the Supreme and the Constitutional Court. It recalls in this respect that according to its established case-law, any proceedings that could influence the outcome of proceedings before the lower courts fall within the scope of Article 6 (see, for example, Tri\u010dkovi\u0107 v.
