[GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000IV). However, to fall under Article 3 of the Convention, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a7 100-01, ECHR 2001-VIII). When a person is held in detention, the State must ensure that he is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Vala\u0161inas, cited above, \u00a7 102, and Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2000XI). When assessing conditions of detention, one must consider their cumulative effects as well as the applicant\u2019s specific allegations (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2001II).

The Court considers it extraordinary that in December 2007, that is almost five and a half years after the applicant\u2019s detention in that facility had come to an end, the officials were able to recollect the exact number of inmates who had been detained together with the applicant and indicate five cell numbers where he had been held during the relevant period of time. The Court observes that the Government did not refer to any source of information on the basis of which they had made the assertion on the average numbers of inmates in the cells and did not submit any documents on the basis of which that assertion could be verified. The Court observes that it was open to the Government to submit copies of registration logs showing names of inmates detained together with the applicant in the relevant period. However, no such documents were presented. The directors\u2019 and warders\u2019 certificates issued in December 2007 are therefore of little evidential value for the Court. Finally, the Court notes that the Government did not refute the fact that the applicant\u2019s cellmates who had given their statements in support of his allegations concerning the detention condition had been held together with the applicant during the relevant period of time.",

By contrast, in other cases where the overcrowding was not so severe as to raise in itself an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court has noted other aspects of the physical conditions of detention as being relevant to its assessment of compliance with that provision. Such elements included, in particular, the opportunity to use the toilet in private, availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, and compliance with basic sanitary requirements. Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue \u2013 measuring in the range of three to four square metres per inmate \u2013 the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting or other factors (see, for example, Trepashkin v. Russia, no.\u00a036898/03, \u00a7 94, 19 July 2007, and Peers, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 70-72). The Court will thus examine other elements complained of.",

France, no. 35683/97, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2001I, and Padalov v. Bulgaria, no. 54784/00, \u00a7\u00a7 54 and 55, 10 August 2006). The Government considered that the applicant\u2019s case was not of the kind where mandatory legal representation was warranted. They, furthermore, argued that the applicant was capable of arranging his own legal representation in the appeal hearing, as he did in the first instance proceedings; otherwise he should have drawn the court\u2019s attention to any difficulty encountered by him in doing so. The Court, however, does not share the Government\u2019s opinion that mandatory representation was not called for in this case. It notes that Article 51 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that legal representation is mandatory unless expressly waived by the suspect or the accused, with the exception of certain categories of cases where this right cannot be waived at all (see paragraph 39 above). In the present case, the applicant was represented in the firstinstance proceedings by privately retained lawyers. While he apparently did not make similar arrangements for the appeal proceedings, there is no indication that he intended to refuse legal assistance either. The Court notes in this respect that any waiver would have to be filed in writing and entered in the official records (Article 52 \u00a7 1 of the Code). No implicit waiver would therefore follow from the fact that the counsel who represented the applicant in the first-instance proceedings was absent in the appeal hearing.",

Russia, no. 15435/03, 24 June 2008, \u00a7\u00a035; see also, a contrario, Marcello Viola v. , no. 45106/04, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2006... (extracts), and Golubev, cited above). The respondent Government\u2019s argument that the participation of a defence lawyer was not mandatory under either of the grounds in Article 51 of the CCP is not relevant in such cases, because Article 52 of the CCP provides that although a suspect or accused may refuse legal assistance at any stage of the criminal proceedings, such a waiver may only be accepted if filed in writing on the accused or the suspect\u2019s own initiative. Even accepting the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant did not submit any petition, either for the appointment of a lawyer or for refusal of legal assistance (this is contradicted by the applicant, see paragraph 73), it is useful to remind ourselves of the Court\u2019s conclusions in another similar Russian case: \u201cthe ultimate guardian of the fairness of the proceedings was the judge, who, when confronted with the lawyers\u2019 failure to appear, was required under domestic law to appoint counsel for an accused who was incapable of defending himself due to a physical impairment\u201d (see Timergaliyev v. Russia, no. 40631/02, \u00a7 59, 14 October 2008). I am satisfied that the requirements of a fair hearing were secured in the Golubev case. On the contrary, nothing in the present case file indicates that the presiding judge\u2019s attitude was aimed at securing a fair hearing for the applicant. In the circumstances as described in paragraphs 13-14 of the judgment, the lack of real contact with the applicant, combined with other facts mentioned above, reduced Mr Grigoryevskikh\u2019s on-screen appearance at the appeal hearing to a mere formality.",
