It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases. The Court has recognised that disputes concerning benefits under social-security schemes are generally rather technical, often involving numerous figures, and their outcome usually depends on written opinions given by medical doctors. Many such disputes may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. Moreover, it is understandable that in this sphere national authorities should have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy. Systematically holding hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social-security cases (see Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, \u00a7\u00a058, Series A no. 263; Salomonsson v. Sweden, no. 38978/97, \u00a7 38, 12\u00a0November 2002; D\u00f6ry v.

This court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim finding that the applicant had gone for treatment abroad without having obtained a decision of the Fund and a medical report concerning the necessity of treatment abroad, which the court found to be in contravention of section 30 of the Health Insurance Act. It further found that, under the applicable domestic law, the expert medical report from the clinic (namely, the report of 12 July 1994) had been a proposal for referral for treatment abroad, which in the court\u2019s view did not confer a right on the applicant to be treated abroad.
