A further oral preparation, scheduled for 16 December 1996, was cancelled due to the illness of the applicants' and Boket's counsel. In February 1997, the applicants and Boket asked the court to rule on the alleged breach of contract in a partial judgment. An oral preparation was held on 7 April 1998.

It noted that 2 million SEK of the bank loan had been pledged by the company at the time when the loan contract had been concluded through the deposit of that amount on a blocked bank account. It found that, in the absence of any other clauses or agreements with regard to the bank loan or the pledge, this measure showed that the amount, like any other pledge, was only available for withdrawal if so approved by the bank. Consequently, the bank had not breached the loan contract by its initial refusal to pay the amount in question. Moreover, on account of the difficulties related to the company's fuel production, the bank had had good reasons to be cautious and not make available the disputed amount earlier than July 1993, the date originally projected. The bank could not therefore be held liable for negligence towards the company.",
