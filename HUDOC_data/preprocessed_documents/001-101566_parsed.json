Moreover, in a letter of 22 April 2010 the Government requested the Court to declare the application inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in the light of the principles affirmed by the Grand Chamber (see Demopoulos and Others, Chrysostomi, Lordos and Lordou Anastasiou, Kanari-Eliadou and Others, Sotirou and Moushoutta, Stylas, Charalambou Onofriou and Others and Chrisostomi v.

They argued that the applicants should address their claims to the Immovable Property Commission (the \u201cIPC\u201d) instituted by the \u201cTRNC\u201d Law 67/2005. They reiterated their position on the issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies in the present case and in other similar cases on 8 and 22 June 2010.
