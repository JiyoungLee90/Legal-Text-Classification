Based on Article 90 of the Constitution and Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention, the tribunal also gave its own interpretation of Articles 10 and 11.

It emphasised that, without such freedom, there was no democracy.

It referred back to the legal reasoning used in its judgment of 15 September 2004 and invoked the  case-law on the dissolution of political parties, in particular the cases concerning the United Communist Party of Turkey and the Freedom and Democracy Party (\u00d6ZDEP). It further observed that the official language of the  was Turkish and that, according to Article 66 of the Constitution, any individual attached to the Republic by citizenship was Turkish. In its view, the fact of learning a language other than the official language did not constitute an action or conduct in breach of the law, but such conduct was proof of an attachment to the State of Turkey. Whilst agreeing that the official language was Turkish and that there could not be any other official language, it found that there should not be any particular impediment to the learning of other languages. Referring to its previous reasoning, based on Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention, the tribunal found that there were two main grounds for the dissolution of a union, an association or a political party, namely \u201can imminent threat\u201d and \u201cthe criterion of violence\u201d. It observed that the union whose dissolution was sought defended in its constitution the principle of education in one\u2019s own mother tongue and the development of culture. It emphasised that, even supposing that the wording in question was illegal, the content and weight of the terms did not constitute an imminent threat or an incitement to violence and their inclusion in the union\u2019s constitution did not jeopardise territorial, national or State unity or the existing borders of the Republic of Turkey. It found, on the contrary, that the decision not to dissolve the union would have the effect of calming the social tension, disorder and antagonism that were prevalent in society, and of restoring social peace.",

In its reasoning the court indicated that Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention provided for statutory limitations to the exercise of the freedoms of expression, assembly and association and that they notably stipulated that such restrictions had to be necessary in a democratic society. It was therefore the court\u2019s task to verify whether the restrictions imposed by domestic law on fundamental rights and freedoms were consistent with Turkey\u2019s international commitments. The court took the view that the union\u2019s call for education in a mother tongue other than Turkish was in breach of Articles 3 and 42 of the Constitution and that it ran counter to the acceptance of a unitary State and to the existing legal system. In the court\u2019s opinion, the right to form a union could thus be limited and such restrictions were necessary in a democratic society. The combined divisions of the Court of Cassation concluded that the defence of education in a mother tongue other than Turkish could not rely on Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.",

It notes that nothing in the impugned Article of E\u011fitim-Sen\u2019s constitution can be regarded as a call to violence, uprising or any other form of rejection of democratic principles, this being an essential factor to be taken into consideration (see Freedom and Democracy Party (\u00d6ZDEP) v.

At that time, the question of receiving education in one\u2019s mother tongue was being debated publicly and in political parties and was tabled for debate in Parliament (see paragraphs\u00a011 and 30-31 above).",

In this connection it should be pointed out that Law no. 4771, enacted on 3 August 2002 and amending Law no. 2923 on foreign-language education and the learning of various languages and dialects by Turkish citizens, paved the way for the opening of private schools to teach \u201clanguages and dialects [other than Turkish] traditionally used by Turkish citizens in their daily lives\u201d. The Court observes that this willingness on the part of the legislature to open private courses for the teaching of languages and dialects other than Turkish contrasts with the position of the national authorities in finding that Article 2 (b) of E\u011fitim-Sen\u2019s constitution breached Articles 3 and 42 of the Constitution.",

In the Court\u2019s view, such an objective, with the aim of developing the culture of nationals having a mother tongue other than Turkish by providing education in that mother tongue, is not in itself incompatible with national security and does not represent a threat to public order. Even supposing that the competent national authorities could have taken the view that education in one\u2019s own mother tongue favoured the culture of a minority, the Court observes that, as it has previously found, the existence of minorities and different cultures in a country is a historical fact that a democratic society must tolerate, or even protect and support, in accordance with the principles of international law (see Tourkiki Enosi Xanthis and Others v.

Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d (see, among many other authorities, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 24; Jersild v.\u00a0Denmark, 23 September 1994, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 298; and Yazar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 46). As set forth in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.

Neither was the Article capable of fostering violence by instilling a deep-seated and irrational hatred against certain individuals (contrast S\u00fcrek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062). As to the argument of the domestic courts based on an alleged risk to the integrity of national territory (see paragraph 24 above), the Court notes that E\u011fitim-Sen\u2019s programme defends the principle of education in the mother tongue, other than the Turkish language, of individuals making up Turkish society. However, the Court observes that since the Government did not refer to any concrete acts by E\u011fitim-Sen that might suggest a hidden agenda, no doubts can be cast on the genuineness of its programme (see Freedom and Democracy Party (\u00d6ZDEP), cited above, \u00a7 42).
