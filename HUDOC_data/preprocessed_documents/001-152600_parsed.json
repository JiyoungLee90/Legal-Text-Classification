He had run a business in his home country and had bought goods from his business partner, also an ethnic Uyghur, in China. In August 2009 the business partner had been arrested and since he had been in the possession of a receipt from the applicant, they had both been indicted on suspicion of financially supporting the Uyghur disturbances in China. In September 2009 the applicant had been arrested by the Kyrgyz police. His health had deteriorated while he was in custody and, after his release, he had been hospitalised because of his kidney problems. The doctors had informed him that he needed to have blood dialysis but that there was a two-year waiting list. After having been pressured by the authorities, the doctors had informed the applicant that he would not receive any blood dialysis. Moreover, his family had informed him that the police had come to his house looking for him several times after he had left the country.

He had been questioned by the police twice. The first time, in September 2009, the police had asked him whether he financially supported the Uyghur disturbances in China and they had beaten him all over his body, including on the kidneys. When he had lost consciousness, the police had become scared and had released him. During the second questioning, the police had confiscated his passport and imposed a travel ban on him. He had later been summoned to court but had not attended. Instead, he had decided to leave the country and had paid a smuggler to help him. After arriving in Sweden, he had been in contact via telephone and internet with friends and family in Kyrgyzstan, who had informed him that the Kyrgyz authorities had been to his house looking for him and that he had received further summonses. In relation to his illness, he claimed that the Chinese would keep searching for him and that he would therefore not receive any treatment in his home country. He also submitted an extract from his Kyrgyz medical record which he had received when he was released from hospital in November 2009 and which he had brought with him to Sweden.",

It further observed that he had not submitted any written evidence in support of his alleged need for protection for which reason his credibility was decisive for the outcome. However, the court considered that the applicant\u2019s submissions were far-fetched, lacking in detail and that they contained contradictory information. For instance, as concerned the applicant\u2019s submissions that the Chinese authorities suspected him of sponsoring the Uyghur disturbances in China, the court found this improbable since the applicant had had a clear business relationship with the person in China over several years. Moreover, he had submitted contradictory information as to when he had been refused medical treatment and how many times he had been summoned to court. Therefore, the court concluded that the applicant\u2019s submissions were not credible and that he had failed to substantiate that he would be at risk of persecution upon return.",

Without the dialysis, he would die within a couple of weeks and, apart from regular treatment, the only other solution was a kidney transplant. His state of health was consequently extremely serious. Moreover, the court observed that it was clear that blood dialysis was available in Kyrgyzstan while, according to the applicant, kidney transplants were not carried out. According to the applicant\u2019s own submissions, in the spring of 2009 he had been placed on a waiting list for dialysis and the waiting time had been two to three years. After having been arrested in September 2009, his name had allegedly been removed from the waiting list and he had been refused treatment. However, the court noted that, according to the extract from the applicant\u2019s medical records, he had been hospitalised in Kyrgyzstan because of his kidney disease in April 2009 and again from 27 October to 5 November 2009, on the second occasion with the diagnosis of chronic terminal kidney failure. Since, according to the most recent Swedish medical certificate, a person with such a diagnosis would die within a couple of weeks without blood dialysis, the court concluded that the applicant had received medical care both before and after being arrested by the police. He had thus failed to substantiate that he would not receive adequate treatment within a reasonable time upon return to Kyrgyzstan.",

Moreover, in an article dated 7 August 2014, by 24.kg news agency ( - downloaded on 7\u00a0October 2014), the number of patients with renal insufficiency increased every year and dialysis equipment broke down due to overuse.

The Ministry also stated that, in 2013, 350 persons in the country had received blood dialysis whereas during the first six months of 2014, the number had reached 450. The article further noted that patients complained about the lack of access to the single waiting list for free blood dialysis, whereas the Ministry of Health Care claimed that the list was available to be consulted by all patients. In addition, the article observed that treatment was available in private centres where one dialysis session cost about 4-5,000 soms (approximately EUR 59-73).",

For instance, the supplementary interview with the Migration Board was the only opportunity given to tell his story in detail, since the first interview had served to register his asylum application and briefly state his reasons for leaving his country. Moreover, in its reasoning, the Migration Court seemed to have concluded that he did receive blood dialysis in Kyrgyzstan in November 2009. However, this conclusion was wrong. His medical records from the hospital in Kyrgyzstan showed that he had received medical care but not blood dialysis. Here, he referred to an attached medical certificate, dated 3 July 2012 and issued by his treating physician, a specialist in kidney diseases at Karolinska University Hospital. The medical certificate stated that the medical records from Kyrgyzstan did not show that he had received blood dialysis. What these records showed was that in April 2009 he had been diagnosed with high blood pressure and kidney infection (chronic glomerulonephritis) which caused a successive decrease in kidney function until they stopped functioning completely and dialysis would be needed. References in the medical records to \u201cfiltration\u201d most probably referred to a measure of the applicant\u2019s own kidney function as this measurement decreased from April to November 2009, indicating a progression of the illness. However, the \u201cfiltration\u201d level in November 2009 (13.99 ml/min) was, according to the certificate, still above the level where dialysis would be commenced in Sweden. Furthermore, when the applicant had first come to the hospital in Sweden, he had had no physical preparation for receiving blood dialysis (for example an AV-fistula). The certificate finally stated that, at the present time, the applicant\u2019s disease had progressed to the point where he no longer had any kidney function and thus needed blood dialysis to survive.",

It further appears from a recent article from a Kyrgyz news agency (see above paragraph 29), that there are now 65 dialysis machines in the country although not all seem to be working properly. The article further notes that dialysis treatment is available in private centres at a cost. From this, the Court can conclude that free dialysis is available at public hospitals in Kyrgyzstan and that there are also private centres where patients can receive dialysis, albeit at a certain cost. Consequently, the Court finds it established that the applicant would be able to receive dialysis treatment in his home country.",

To support his claim, he has submitted a letter from his father to the Kyrgyz authorities in which they are asked to provide the applicant with dialysis treatment, as well as the reply from the authorities, dated February 2014, in which they state that they cannot provide the requested treatment due to the long waiting time and lack of dialysis equipment (see above paragraphs 22-23).",

It would rather appear to be the latter, since the Court observes that the applicant claimed before the migration authorities that he had been put on the waiting list in April 2009, at a time when he was not yet in need of dialysis, but that he had been removed in September 2009 after his arrest. Moreover, according to a certificate by the Kyrgyz Ministry of Health, dated 9 July 2012, and submitted by the applicant to the Migration Board, he had been on the national waiting list for blood dialysis since 27\u00a0October 2009, which was also confirmed by a certificate, dated 23\u00a0December 2011, from the hospital where the applicant had been treated (see above paragraph 20). In the Court\u2019s view, this indicates that persons may be put on the waiting list before they are in actual need of dialysis (as was the applicant\u2019s situation in April and October 2009) and thus that it should still be possible to be granted priority on the list and be given treatment if there is an urgent need for immediate dialysis due to the progression of the illness. The fact that the applicant claims that he was not given dialysis while in Kyrgyzstan appears natural to the Court in view of the medical certificate by the Swedish physician stating that he would not have been given dialysis in Sweden either, as the illness was not sufficiently advanced (see above paragraph 34).",

In this respect, the Court observes that the letter from the applicant\u2019s father to the Kyrgyz Ministry of Health, dated February 2014 (see above paragraph 22), does not mention the waiting list at all but only states that the applicant is being treated in Sweden and the family would like him to come back and be treated in Kyrgyzstan. Likewise, the reply from the Ministry (see above paragraph 23) does not mention the waiting list, or the applicant\u2019s placement on it, but is rather a request to the Swedish authorities to continue treating the applicant, than a reply to the applicant\u2019s father. Thus, this last exchange of letters does not alter the Court\u2019s conclusion that the applicant is on the national waiting list and has been for the last five years. It follows from this that the Court is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s submission that he would be refused treatment in Kyrgyzstan upon return, since he has been on the waiting list for almost twice the waiting time indicated by him.",

In this respect, the Court notes that the applicant has his parents and siblings in Kyrgyzstan, with whom he remains in contact and who are actively assisting him, as is shown by the letter the applicant\u2019s father wrote to the authorities. It should thus be possible for the applicant to use this option as well, at least as a temporary measure if he had to wait for access to the free public dialysis treatment or, possibly, until he could have a kidney transplant as such procedures have been carried out in Kyrgyzstan since 2012 and consequently would also be an option for the applicant.",

Moreover, it attaches significant weight to the Government\u2019s statement that the Migration Board will encourage and assist the applicant in making the necessary preparations in order to ensure that his dialysis treatment is not interrupted and he has access to the medical care he needs upon return to his home country. The Court further sees no reason to doubt the Government\u2019s assertion that the Migration Board would make every effort to see to it that the applicant would not have to pause his dialysis if expelled and that he would have access to the medical care he needs upon return to Kyrgyzstan. While the Court would stress that it is the applicant\u2019s responsibility to cooperate with the authorities and primarily for him to take the necessary steps to ensure the continuation of his treatment in his home country, it considers that in the very special circumstances of the present case, where the applicant would die within a few weeks if the dialysis treatment were interrupted, the domestic authorities\u2019 readiness to assist the applicant and take other measures to ensure that the removal can be executed without jeopardising his life upon return is particularly relevant to the Court\u2019s overall assessment.",

Where a rigorous examination reveals substantial grounds for believing that expulsion will expose the person to a real risk of suffering inhuman or degrading treatment, removal would engage the removing State\u2019s responsibility under Article 3 of the Convention.\u201d (see \u00a7 5 of the joint dissenting opinion of Judges Tulkens, Bonello and Spielmann in N. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 26565/05, 27\u00a0May 2008); see also in this respect the partly concurring joint opinion of Judges Tulkens, Jo\u010dien\u0117, Popovi\u0107, Karaka\u015f, Raimondi and Pinto de Albuquerque in Yoh-Ekale Mwanje v. Belgium, no. 10486/10, 20 December 2011). The same reasoning is implicit in the judgment of the Fourth Section of the Court in the case of Aswat v. the United Kingdom, no. 17299/12, 16\u00a0April 2013 (see in particular \u00a7\u00a7 49 to 52) \u2013 although the case concerned the extradition of a suspected terrorist to the United States of America, the applicant\u2019s enduring mental disorder (paranoid schizophrenia) coupled with the uncertainty as to the conditions of detention and the medical services that would be made available to him in the requesting State, led to a unanimous finding of a violation of Article 3.",

Of course haemodialysis is carried out in that country (and probably even the less effective peritoneal dialysis, but there seems to be no information on that); the applicant had also received some form of treatment there before he had left for Sweden. The question, however, is whether the applicant can now have access to haemodialysis immediately upon his arrival there. The Court, in coming to its conclusion, has regrettably glossed over with hypotheses and conjectures the hard evidence provided by the letter of 17 February 2014 from the Kyrgyz Ministry of Health in reply to the applicant\u2019s father request (see paragraph\u00a054), and also ignored the certificate of 29 December 2011 issued by the Chief Physician at the Kidney Medical Clinic of Karolinska University Hospital (paragraph 18) to the effect that it \u201cwould be completely unreasonable to expel [the applicant] without ensuring that dialysis would be available to him upon return to his home country\u201d (paragraph 18). Instead the Court relies mainly on general (and unsubstantiated) assumptions (paragraphs 53 and 54) that the applicant has \u201cmoved up\u201d the list of those waiting for haemodialysis since he was first placed on it. The Court also argues, or seems to argue, that since there are also \u201cprivate centres\u201d in Kyrgyzstan which offer haemodialysis and the applicant has family in his country of origin (even though the applicant has clearly stated that his family there would not be able to provide any help \u2013 paragraph 36 \u2013 a statement which the respondent Government have not really challenged) the \u201cPretty threshold\u201d has not been reached.",

What does the expression \u201cevery effort\u201d imply in a situation like the one at hand? Does it mean that if the Migration Board does its very best (even with the full cooperation of the applicant) but is ultimately unsuccessful in securing uninterrupted haemodialysis, the expulsion can go ahead without there being any breach of Article 3? In Tarakhel v. Switzerland [GC], no. 29217/12, 4\u00a0November 2014, the Court found that there would be a violation of Article\u00a03 if the applicants were removed to another State party to the Convention without the Swiss authorities having first obtained certain guarantees from that other State. I fail to see why such a condition was not inserted into the operative part of the judgment in the instant case, particularly when the country to which the present applicant is to be removed is not a party to the Convention (there is nothing in the case file to suggest that if diplomatic or other assurances were sought from the authorities of Kyrgyzstan and obtained, these would be worthless \u2013 see, by converse implication, \u00a7\u00a7 147 and 148 of Saadi v. Italy, [GC] no. 37201/06, 28 February 2008). Conditions have been inserted without difficulty in other judgments against Sweden, such as W.H. v. Sweden, no. 49341/10, 27\u00a0March 2014, and A.A.M. v. Sweden no. 68519/10, 3 April 2014, although the conditional finding in both cases was one of no violation, and the factual context was different from the one at hand.",
