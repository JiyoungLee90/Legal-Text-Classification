Both the  and, later, the Appellate Court, when refusing the applicant\u2019s motion for exemption from the court fees, found that he had failed to provide that information (see paragraphs 13 and 15 of the judgment). In my opinion, the parties have an obligation to cooperate faithfully with the courts and should accept the consequences to provide such cooperation. Had the applicant submitted all the requested documents and had the domestic courts, on assessing those documents, refused exemption from the fees, the compatibility of such a refusal with the Convention standards could have been challenged before our Court. Only then could an argument alleging arbitrariness in the domestic courts\u2019 disregard of the legal relations governing his marriage have been raised in a valid manner.
