Such interference with the right of property must pursue, on the facts as well as in principle, a \u201clegitimate aim\u201d in the \u201cgeneral interest\u201d. There must also be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In other words, the Court must determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest and the interest of the individuals concerned. In determining whether a fair balance exists, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation (see Urb\u00e1rska Obec Tren\u010dianske Biskupice, cited above, \u00a7 139, with further references).",

Its purpose was to lay down the conditions under which the gardeners were entitled to use the land and the amount of rent payable in cases where those issues were not governed by an earlier agreement or regulation. The interference therefore undoubtedly contributed to the legal certainty of those involved. It was limited in duration pending the outcome of proceedings concerning the consolidation of ownership which the gardeners could and actually did commence under the Allotments Act. The Court finds that, in these circumstances, the interference pursued a\u00a0\u201clegitimate aim\u201d in the \u201cgeneral interest\u201d, and that the only point at issue is whether or not a fair balance was struck between the demands of the general interest and the interests of the applicants.",

It discerned no elements of general interest sufficiently strong to justify such a low level of rent bearing no relation to the actual value of the land.
