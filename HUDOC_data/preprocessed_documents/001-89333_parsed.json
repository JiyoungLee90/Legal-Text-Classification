Ibragim Tsurov had actively cooperated with the federal forces so that they had not had any reasons to apprehend him. The fact that the perpetrators had been wearing camouflage uniforms and carrying firearms did not prove that they were State servicemen, because members of illegal armed groups had also had such items. Ibragim Tsurov could have been kidnapped, pursuant to the traditions of feud, by the persons from whom he had demanded ransom. Furthermore, the Government suggested that in reality there had been no crime at all, since Ibragim Tsurov had probably staged his own kidnapping to escape either criminal prosecution or feudal vengeance. The Government also doubted the authenticity of the letter of the Ministry of the Interior of the  dated 26 July 2004. They noted that the registration number of the letter was illegible and its date had been corrected. The Government concluded that the letter could not serve as a proof of Ibragim Tsurov\u2019s arrest by the police. They also pointed out that Mr A.S., Mr D.S. and Mr S.N. had not shown any resistance to the armed men who had apprehended Ibragim Tsurov because they had had reasons to believe that those men were State agents carrying out a lawful arrest operation. Mr A.S., Mr D.S. and Mr S.N. had not immediately reported the incident to the authorities because they were not close friends of Ibragim Tsurov and were not worried about him. Ibragim Tsurov had been issued with the special pass long before the institution of the criminal proceedings against him. In sum, the Government insisted that no State agents were implicated in Ibragim Tsurov\u2019s disappearance.",

The city prosecutor\u2019s office instituted the investigation in case no.\u00a040086 on 18 June 2003, that is, almost two months after Ibragim Tsurov\u2019s abduction.

The Court further observes that three days after the institution of the investigation in case no. 40086 the very same city prosecutor\u2019s office opened another investigation into Ibragim Tsurov\u2019s abduction in case no.\u00a040089 (see paragraphs 36 and 38 above).

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III, p. 1020, \u00a7 64).",
