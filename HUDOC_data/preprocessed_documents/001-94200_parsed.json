On 21 July, I expressed my concern at the events that have taken place and stressed that it was vital that all parties keep in mind the purpose of the UN buffer zone as well as their responsibility to ensure that that area was not violated. I also urged the Turkish-Cypriot authorities to release without delay all those who had been detained. On 24 July, the President of the Security Council announced that he had conveyed to the representatives of all the parties, on behalf of the members of the Council, the Council's deep concern at the tense situation created by the incidents of 19 July. He also stressed the need strictly to respect the UN buffer zone and appealed for the immediate release of all persons still detained. He asked all concerned to show maximum restraint and to take urgent steps that would bring about a relaxation of tension and contribute to the creation of an atmosphere favourable to the negotiations.\u201d",

Moreover, a serious traumatic episode such as the wound suffered by the applicant is not consistent with a minor physical confrontation between him and the police. There is nothing to show that the applicant had offered any resistance to the police or obstructed them in any way, let alone to an extent that could have justified inflicting such an injury to his head. It follows that the respondent State's agents have used excessive force against the applicant, which had not been rendered strictly necessary by the state of heightened tension surrounding the demonstration of 19 July 1989 and/or by the applicant's own behaviour.",

The Court therefore concluded that when, as in the Foka case, an act of the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities was in compliance with laws in force within the territory of northern , it should in principle be regarded as having a legal basis in domestic law for the purposes of the Convention. It does not see any reason to depart, in the instant case, from that finding, which is not in any way inconsistent with the view adopted by the international community regarding the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d or the fact that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus remains the sole legitimate government of Cyprus (see Cyprus v.

In the Court's view, the intervention of the Turkish and/or Turkish-Cypriot forces was not due to the political nature of the demonstration but was provoked by its violent character and by the violation of the \u201cTRNC\u201d borders by some of the demonstrators (see Protopapa, cited above, \u00a7 110).",
