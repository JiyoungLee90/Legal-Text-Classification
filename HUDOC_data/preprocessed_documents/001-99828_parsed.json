R.J.'s death was thus no longer an obstacle for bringing a paternity claim against him. However, the claim had been brought after the expiry of the five-year time-limit. The reason why the claim had been brought late was that the applicant and her mother had been mistaken about the legal character of the child support decision but this mistake was not of a kind that would have justified a derogation from the five-year time-limit.

The purpose of the Paternity Act was to guarantee equality in law between children, irrespective of descent, and for this reason it was retroactive. The limitation of retroactivity to five years only concerned those cases where paternity was to be established by a court decision. According to the preparatory works of the Paternity Act, the requirement of legal certainty required rapid elimination of uncertainty about possible claims to be made against putative fathers. The restriction concerning the death of the man was justified on the grounds that it was no longer possible to obtain sufficient evidence of the man's paternity if he were deceased. The child welfare supervisor could only initiate paternity proceedings in respect of a child who had been born before the entry into force of the Paternity Act if the child was under fifteen years of age and the mother or the legal guardian had expressed the wish for such proceedings to be initiated.",

A person has a vital interest, protected by the Convention, in receiving the information necessary to uncover the truth about an important aspect of his or her personal identity and eliminate any uncertainty in this respect (see Mikuli\u0107 v.

This study revealed that there was no uniform approach in this field. Unlike proceedings by fathers for the establishment or denial of paternity (see Shofman v. , cited above, \u00a7\u00a037), a significant number of States did not set a limitation period for children to bring an action aiming to have paternity established.

Only a small number of legal systems seemed to have produced solutions to the problem which arises when the relevant circumstances become known only after the expiry of the time-limit, for instance, by providing for the possibility of bringing an action after the time-limit has expired if there was a material or moral impossibility of lodging it within that period or if there were good reasons for the delay.",

They do not, however, make any allowance for children in the applicant's situation: her father had not acknowledged her. When the statutory five-year-period started she was eight years old and when it finished she was thirteen years old. The child welfare supervisor was not entitled to exercise the child's right of action without a separate authorisation from the mother. When she reached the age that she could have taken action without her mother's consent, the limitation period had already elapsed.",

The main problem therefore is the absolute nature of the time-limit rather than its dies a quo as such. In view of the fact that in the present case the biological father had already died, judicial proceedings before the national courts were the only avenue by which the applicant could have legally established the legal status of her biological father. As a result of this rigid time-limit, as upheld by the Supreme Court, the applicant was deprived of the possibility of obtaining a judicial determination that R.J. was her father. She was deprived of this right even though she was in a situation where she had not had any realistic opportunity to go to court during the limitation period due to her age (see, mutatis mutandis, Phinikaridou v. Cyprus, cited above, \u00a7 62; and Turnal\u0131 v. , no. 4914/03, \u00a7 44, 7 April 2009).",

The Court, however, does not consider that such a radical restriction of the applicant's right to institute proceedings for the judicial determination of paternity was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In particular, it has not been shown how the general interest in protecting legal certainty of family relationships or the interest of the father and his family outweighed the applicant's right to have an opportunity to seek judicial determination of paternity. This is even more so in the present case as the identity of the applicant's biological father had been known since her birth, he had paid child support to her and the biological father's relatives did not oppose the confirmation of paternity. In this connection the Court reiterates that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 24, Series A no. 32).",
