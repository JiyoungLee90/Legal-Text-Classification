It follows from the independence of the legal profession from the State that the conduct of the defence is essentially a matter between the defendant and his counsel, whether counsel be appointed under a legal-aid scheme or be privately financed (see Cuscani v. the United Kingdom, no. 32771/96, \u00a7 39, 24\u00a0September 2002). The competent national authorities are required under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) to intervene only if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or sufficiently brought to their attention in some other way (see Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, \u00a7 65, Series A no. 168, and Daud v. Portugal, 21 April 1998, \u00a7 38, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II).
