This was further corroborated by the statements made at the hearings in the domestic proceedings by the representative of the ABA, who clearly stated that the first applicant had not been admitted to the ABA because of his stance on the functioning of the ABA (see paragraphs 16 and 19 above). The Court also cannot overlook the fact that the domestic courts themselves confirmed that the applicants were challenging before them the motives behind the Presidium\u2019s decisions dismissing their admission to the ABA (see paragraphs 17 and 24 above).",

In this regard the Court reiterates that a norm cannot be regarded as a \u201claw\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct; he or she must be able \u2013 if need be with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty.

Article 11 of the Law empowered the Presidium to deal with matters related to admission to the ABA (see paragraph 38 above). As can be seen from the wording of the above-mentioned provisions of the Law, the only condition for admission to the ABA of lawyers holding a special permit (such as the applicants) is that the Presidium should have examined \u2013 while dealing with their admission \u2013 their compliance with the requirements in respect of candidates for admission to practice as legal counsel, as stipulated in Article 8 (I) and (II) of the Law.",

France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7 135, ECHR 2015, and Radobuljac v. Croatia, no. 51000/11, \u00a7 61, 28 June 2016). In addition, professional associations of lawyers play a fundamental role in ensuring the protection of human rights and must therefore be able to act independently, and that respect towards professional colleagues and self-regulation of the legal profession are paramount. Bar Associations perform a self-regulation function and to do so effectively they may require full information about persons wishing to enter the legal profession (see Jankauskas v. Lithuania (no. 2), no. 50446/09, \u00a7 78, 27 June 2017). The Court cannot, however, accept the Government\u2019s and the domestic courts\u2019 argument, which would deprive lawyers of any effective protection in respect of the Presidium\u2019s possible interference with their freedom of expression by refusing to grant them access to the legal profession on grounds not envisaged by the relevant domestic legislation. The Court considers it necessary to draw the Government\u2019s attention to Recommendation R (2000) 21 of the Council of Europe\u2019s Committee of Ministers to member States on the freedom of exercise of the profession of lawyer, which clearly stated that lawyers should enjoy freedom of expression and that decisions concerning access to the profession should be subject to review by an independent and impartial judicial authority (see paragraph 39 above).",

Rule 60 \u00a7 2 provides that applicants must submit itemised particulars of all claims, together with any relevant supporting documents, within the time-limit fixed for the submission of the applicant\u2019s observations on the merits unless the president of the Chamber directs otherwise. The Court\u2019s Practice Direction on just satisfaction warns applicants that compliance with the formal and substantive requirements deriving from the Convention and the Rules of Court is a condition for the award of just satisfaction. In the present case, the applicants point to the causal link which, in their view, exists between their loss of earnings over a long period and the refusal to admit them to the ABA. However, the Court observes that, leaving aside the crucial question of the existence or not of a causal link, the applicants did not submit the necessary documentary evidence to the Court in support of their claim relating to loss of earnings and the quantum claimed. While the Court recognises that it may, in the circumstances of a case like this, be difficult to calculate loss of earnings precisely, a general reference to the average monthly income of legal counsel in Azerbaijan, without any indication of the amount of income previously earned by the applicants or of the income nevertheless earned by them during the relevant period of time, is clearly not a sufficient basis for the Court to assess pecuniary damage.",
