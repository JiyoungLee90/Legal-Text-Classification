The motion was lodged against the applicant and T.H., who acted as opposing parties (nasprotna udele\u017eenca). Company P relied on, inter alia, section 276 (2) of the Companies Act (see paragraph 24 below) and grounded the motion on the allegedly unacceptable personal qualities of the applicant and\u00a0T.H., referring in particular to the incident that had occurred during a supervisory board meeting on 13 May 2014 (see paragraph 9 above). It requested the court to proceed to a decision without delay, without notifying the opposing parties of the proceedings and without holding a hearing. In particular, company P argued as follows: the applicant\u2019s and T.H.\u2019s conduct was unacceptable and therefore they should have not continued with their four-year mandate; there were well-founded reasons for depriving them of their membership; their membership should be terminated immediately and they should be replaced by provisional members so as to ensure lawful functioning of the supervisory board and company A; though company P had enough shares to request the management board to convene a general meeting of shareholders this was impossible due to the uncertainty as to who was the company manager; company A was undergoing reconstruction and there were deadlines to be met in this connection; calling a general meeting would thus not ensure a sufficiently prompt response to the situation; and so the court\u2019s intervention was necessary.",

Referring to company P\u2019s submissions and the case file in the proceedings concerning nullity of the resolution of 13 May 2014 (see paragraph 10 above) the court established that one member of the supervisory board had not been voluntarily present at the session of the supervisory board on 13 May 2014 (see paragraph 9 above) because of the conduct of the two remaining members of the supervisory board. In particular, it established that the applicant had clearly allowed T.H.\u2019s conduct, had agreed with it, and had fully cooperated with her. The court explained that the law required that the supervisory board\u2019s members act diligently and responsibly, and that this was particularly important in the present case, where company A was undergoing a process of \u201cpreventive restructuring\u201d. It found that the conduct of two of the supervisory board members was harmful to company A\u2019s functioning and that they should therefore not continue in their function until the end of their four-year term. It considered the case to be of an urgent nature, because company A was at risk, and the supervisory board with the applicant and T.H. as members was not in a position to perform its function until the first general meeting of company A. The decision also contained notice that an appeal was allowed against it within eight days of the notice of the decision. The court noted that the decision was effective immediately, and that any appeal would not stay its execution.",

Thus, in such proceedings, the court was obliged to establish that there were well-founded reasons and explain its finding.",

Moreover, in some cases, national law, while not necessarily recognising that an individual has a subjective right, does confer the right to a lawful procedure for examination of his or her claim, involving matters such as ruling whether a decision was arbitrary or ultra vires, or whether there were procedural irregularities. This is the case regarding certain decisions where the authorities have a purely discretionary power to grant or refuse an advantage or privilege, with the law conferring on the person concerned the right to apply to the courts, which may set the decision aside if they find it unlawful. In such a case Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7 1 of the Convention is applicable, on condition that the advantage or privilege, once granted, gives rise to a civil right (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0105, and the case-law cited therein).",

The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s reliance on Ferrazzini (cited in paragraph 29 above), but does not consider that any meaningful parallel could be drawn between that case, which concerned the applicability of Article 6 to tax disputes, and the present one. In the absence of any other relevant argument on the part of the Government, the Court cannot consider the mere domestic legal qualification of the impugned proceedings as non-litigious proceedings (see paragraphs 24 and 29 above) to mean that they did not involve a determination of the applicant\u2019s civil right within the meaning of Article 6 (see Ferrazzini, cited above, \u00a7 24; see also \u0160akanovi\u010d v.\u00a0Slovenia, no.\u00a032989/02, \u00a7\u00a7 14 and 26, 13 December 2007, and \u0160orgi\u0107 v. Serbia, no. 34973/06, \u00a7\u00a7 48 and 74, 3 November 2011, in which the Court found Article 6 applicable to non-litigious proceedings, namely inheritance proceedings). The Court notes that the applicant was dismissed because, following a request from a main shareholder, the Ljubljana District Court had determined that there were good reasons for such a course of action, establishing, inter alia, that his conduct was harmful to company A\u2019s functioning (see paragraph 12 above). Under the domestic legislation (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above) the applicant, who was the opposing party in the proceedings, should have been in principle able to participate in the proceedings, including being able to comment on the allegations made against him as well as to lodge an appeal and have such an appeal determined by the second-instance court (see paragraph 12 above). This is in the Court\u2019s view sufficient for it to conclude that the present case concerned a determination of the applicant\u2019s \u201cright\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see Regner, cited above, \u00a7 105).",

They also submitted that the Ljubljana District Court considered it to be sufficient for the adversarial principle to be applied by means of appeal. They were of the view that the proceedings in question could be compared to those concerning interim measures. The restriction on the right of access to court was only of a temporary nature.",

It did so without ever giving the applicant an opportunity to comment on company P\u2019s submissions (see, mutatis mutandis, APEH \u00dcld\u00f6z\u00f6tteinek Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge and Others v. Hungary, no. 32367/96, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2000X). Having regard to the domestic law submitted to it (see paragraphs 24 to 26 above), the Court cannot discern any proper legal basis on which the domestic court had decided to dispense with the adversarial principle in the present case. It understands that not notifying the applicant and not giving him an opportunity to participate in the proceedings might have been calculated to save time and expedite the proceedings. As its case-law bears out, the Court attaches great importance to that objective, which does not, however, justify disregarding such a fundamental principle as the right to adversarial proceedings and the principle of equality of arms. In fact, Article 6 \u00a7 1 is intended above all to secure the interests of the parties and those of the proper administration of justice (see Nider\u00f6st-Huber v. Switzerland, 18 February 1997, \u00a7 30, Reports of Judgments and Decisions\u00a01997I).",

The Constitutional Court likewise rejected his constitutional appeal without entering into the merits of his constitutional complaint (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). Accordingly, the shortcoming found to exist in respect of the procedure before the Ljubljana District Court was not capable of being remedied at a later stage (see, mutatis mutandis, Feldbrugge v. the Netherlands, 29 May 1986, \u00a7 46, Series A no. 99, and, by contrast, Schuler-Zgraggen v.\u00a0Switzerland, 24\u00a0June 1993, \u00a7 52, Series A no. 263).",
