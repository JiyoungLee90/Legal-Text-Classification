In this respect, the court noted that the writ of execution had gained legal force on 6 May 2010 when the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal. Thus, the court held, only a short time had passed since the matter had been finally resolved. It further observed that the Enforcement Authority had not resorted to any other measures in order to convince the applicant to reveal the location of the property, such as imposing a conditional fine. Whilst recognising that the applicant so far had been reluctant to give any information about the location of the sawmill, the court found that it could not be ruled out that a less severe coercive measure would alter his attitude.

Moreover, it was not necessary to impose a fine initially. Having regard to the size of the debts, the value of the hidden property and the fact that the applicant had maintained his refusal to reveal its location, the Court of Appeal found that there were extraordinary reasons to detain the applicant and that detention was proportionate to the aim pursued.

Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system.

Moreover, the injunction explicitly stated that, according to Chapter 4, section 14, of the Enforcement Code, the applicant was dutybound to give the required information, failing which the Authority intended to request the District Court to detain him. It is thus clear to the Court that the applicant was detained for the purpose of securing the fulfilment of the obligation prescribed by law, namely, to tell the Enforcement Authority where he had hidden the sawmill. The circumstances of the case do not reveal that this measure was of punitive or other character. Here, it finds it worth emphasising that the preliminary investigation initiated against the applicant, and later discontinued, concerned the criminal act of hiding the sawmill and did not relate to the applicant\u2019s refusal to disclose its location.",

However, the underlying object and purpose of the obligation can be found in the decision to attach and sell the applicant\u2019s property in order to recover his quite substantial tax debt to the State and thereby secure the payment of taxes. In this context the Court underlines that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention concedes wide powers to the State \u201cto enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties\u201d (see also Gasus Dosier- und F\u00f6rdertechnik GmbH v. the Netherlands, 23\u00a0February 1995, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 306B). Thus, it is clear to the Court that measures of that kind, taken in order to facilitate the enforcement of tax debts and secure tax revenue to the State, are in the general interest and of significant importance, especially when, like in the present case, the debtor has sufficient assets to cover the debt but does not want to use them to pay.",

However, he has submitted no medical certificates or other evidence to substantiate this claim, nor is there any evidence that he complained thereof to the prison authorities. Thus, on the basis of the case-file, the Court does not find the applicant to have been particularly vulnerable or otherwise unfit to be detained. As to the particular circumstances leading to the detention, the Court first observes that the applicant acknowledged that he had hidden the sawmill and that he underlined that he had done so by himself and that his wife and other family members did not know its whereabouts. Moreover, the Enforcement Authority visited the applicant\u2019s home to look for the sawmill and found that it was missing. It further questioned both the applicant and his wife without result, having informed the applicant of his obligation to cooperate. It had also served the injunction upon him, which made it clear that the Authority intended to take further action against him if he failed to cooperate, by requesting the District Court to detain him.

In the Court\u2019s view, ordering the applicant to comply with his obligation to cooperate with the Enforcement Authority by imposing a conditional fine would in these circumstances have served no purpose, in particular as, during the questioning on 7 May 2010, he had stated that he took full responsibility for his actions and that he refused to cooperate with the Enforcement Authority, knowing that the refusal might lead to him being detained.",

However, it must be taken into account that the applicant would have been released earlier, and immediately, if he had fulfilled the obligation incumbent on him. Moreover, the lawfulness and reasonableness of his continued detention was reviewed every other week by the District Court, where the applicant was heard in person and the applicant could, and did, appeal against its decision to the appellate courts. Furthermore, according to the relevant provision in domestic law, the detention could have continued up to three months if the District Court had not found that it was no longer justified to keep the applicant detained, in its decision of 9 August 2010.",

Moreover, he had expressly stated that he alone was responsible for removing the property and that no one in his family knew of its whereabouts. Still, his wife had also been questioned on 7 May 2010 but had said that she did not know where the sawmill was. In these circumstances, the Court cannot discern any reason for the Enforcement Authority to repeat the questioning, in particular as the applicant was heard before the District Court every other week when his detention was reviewed and he thus had the possibility to give the required information on these occasions or, for that matter, at any moment during his detention. As concerns an obligation on the Enforcement Authority to search for the property, the Court observes that the applicant had told the Authority, during questioning on 7 May 2010, that he had driven some distance with it and that he was not sure if he could retrieve it if he wanted to. With so little information, it is difficult to imagine that the Enforcement Authority would have been able to carry out any useful or effective search for the property.",

He apprised the court of the fact that he had recently been treated for prostate cancer and that he was not permitted to take his normal medication for panic attacks. Somewhat disconcertingly, the district court did not address the applicant\u2019s medical condition.
