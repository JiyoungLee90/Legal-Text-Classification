Furthermore, the use of force in the context of an arrest, even if it entails injury, may fall outside Article\u00a03, particularly in circumstances resulting from the applicant's own conduct (see Berli\u0144ski v. , nos.\u00a027715/95 and 30209/96, \u00a7 64, 20 June 2002). In this connection, the Court notes that the timing of the injuries and the intensity of the applicant's resistance to arrest is a matter of dispute between the parties. According to the applicant, he only ran away and was ill-treated during arrest, in the car and at the police station. According to the Government, the applicant ran away, shot a police officer with his tear-gas pistol and then fought the police officer during arrest; all of the applicant's injuries were obtained in fighting the police officer.",

In convicting the applicant for resisting arrest on 23 March 2005, the R\u00e2\u015fcani District Court only found him guilty of firing at the police officer from a tear-gas pistol (see paragraph 10 above). The applicant was not found guilty of fighting and/or injuring the arresting police officer, despite the presence of bruises and scratches on the palms, elbows and knees of that officer. Moreover, in the domestic proceedings concerning the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant, none of the witnesses was able to confirm the police's version that the applicant had fought the chasing police officer after being arrested. Later, in the criminal proceedings against the applicant, in acquitting the applicant, the R\u00e2\u015fcani District Court expressed doubt even in respect of the fact that it had been the applicant who had fired his pistol (see paragraph\u00a016 above). Accordingly, the Court considers that it was not provided with sufficient evidence to conclude that the intensity of the applicant's resistance was such as to warrant the use of such force by the arresting police officer and to cause the applicant injuries going beyond those unavoidable in the process of his arrest and wrestling to the ground. The Court is particularly concerned by the nature of one of the injuries on the applicant's body, namely the perforated eardrum. The Court cannot fail to observe that a similar injury was found to be characteristic of ill-treatment in the majority of cases against Moldova in which a breach of Article\u00a03 was found and that in all those cases the injury appeared to be consistent with allegations that the applicants had been slapped on the ears (see Corsacov v. Moldova, no. 18944/02, \u00a7 61, 4 April 2006; Pruneanu\u00a0v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 6888/03, \u00a7 53, 16 January 2007; Colibaba v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 29089/06, \u00a7 18, 23 October 2007; Breabin v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a012544/08, \u00a7 11, 7 April 2009; and Gurgurov v. Moldova, no.\u00a07045/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a023 and 41, 16 June 2009). It is regrettable that the domestic authorities did not attempt to give an explanation as to the cause of that injury on the applicant's body and as to whether such an injury was compatible with any techniques used by the Moldovan police in arresting and restraining recalcitrant individuals.",

Such an examination would have been appropriate, particularly bearing in mind that the applicant had allegedly been in a fight with a police officer. This would not only ensure that the person is fit to be questioned in police custody but would also enable the respondent Government to discharge their burden of providing a plausible explanation for those injuries. In this connection, the Court notes that a medical examination, together with the right of access to a lawyer and the right to inform a third party of the detention, constitute fundamental safeguards against the ill-treatment of detained persons which should apply from the very outset of deprivation of liberty (see the 2nd General Report of the European Committee for Prevention of Torture, CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1 - Rev. 2006, \u00a7\u00a036) (see T\u00fcrkan v. , no. 33086/04, \u00a7 42, 18 September 2008).",

In contrast, the Court notes that one of the police officers was able to undergo a forensic examination immediately after requesting one (see paragraph 11 above). Moreover, the authorities appear to have accepted without reservation the version of the facts presented by the arresting police officers. They did not check whether it was theoretically possible for the arresting police officer to continue the chase and arrest the applicant after being shot at by a tear-gas pistol. They also too readily accepted the police's allegations that the applicant had fought the chasing police officer after being arrested, despite the lack of testimonies to such effect from any of the witnesses questioned.
