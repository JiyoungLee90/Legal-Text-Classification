Having examined the main aspects of the new remedy, the Court found that the Turkish Parliament had entrusted the Constitutional Court with powers that enabled it to furnish, in principle, direct and speedy redress for violations of the rights and freedoms protected by the Convention, in respect of all decisions that had become final after 23\u00a0September 2012, and held that this was a remedy to be used (see Hasan Uzun v. Turkey (dec.), no. 10755/13, \u00a7\u00a7 68-71, 30 April 2013). The Court notes that unlike in the case of Hasan Uzun, at the time that the applicant was deported to Kazakhstan on 19 March 2012, the \u201cindividual application\u201d remedy before the Constitutional Court had not been introduced. The applicant could not, therefore, have sought that remedy before asking the Court, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, to suspend his deportation to Kazakhstan on 19 March 2012. He was also not required to make use of that remedy after its entry into force on 23 September 2012, as argued by the Government, given that in the context of the deportation of foreign nationals, only a judicial review that operates as a bar to removal could be regarded as an effective remedy (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a030471/08, \u00a7 58, 22 September 2009, and the cases cited therein).

However, expulsion by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In such a case Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see Saadi v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7\u00a7 124-125, ECHR 2008; F.G. v.\u00a0Sweden [GC], no.\u00a043611/11, \u00a7 111, ECHR 2016; and J.K. and Others v.

Moreover, the Turkish authorities knew that the applicant was of interest to the Kazakhstan authorities.\u00a0\u00a0The Court further observes that as can be seen from the information and materials publicly available to the administrative authorities at the relevant time there were then numerous allegations of ill-treatment by the law-enforcement officials in Kazakhstan; the instances of ill-treatment had not occurred in \u201cisolated or infrequent instances\u201d; and law-enforcement officials \u201ctargeted members of Islamic groups in their efforts to combat terrorism\u201d in that country (see paragraphs 33-41 above).

Therefore, they were under an obligation to address the applicant\u2019s arguments and to carefully assess the risk of ill-treatment if the applicant was to be removed to Kazakhstan, in order to dispel any doubts about possible illtreatment (see F.G. cited above, \u00a7\u00a0127, and Babajanov, cited above, \u00a7 45).",

The Court notes that it paid special attention in the aforementioned cases to the findings of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cthe CPT\u201d), members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and of the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants regarding the problem of overcrowding and the lack of outdoor exercise at the centre following visits there in June\u00a02009, May\u00a02012 and June 2012 respectively (see Yarashonen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a025, 28 and 30). The Court observes that the Government have not presented any evidence capable of justifying a departure from those conclusions. The Court is therefore led to conclude that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention at the Kumkap\u0131 Foreigners\u2019 Removal Centre \u2013 coupled with the possible anxiety caused by uncertainty as to when the detention would end \u2013 are sufficient to conclude that the conditions of his detention caused the applicant distress which exceeded the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and attained the threshold of degrading treatment proscribed by Article 3 (ibid., \u00a7 80).",
