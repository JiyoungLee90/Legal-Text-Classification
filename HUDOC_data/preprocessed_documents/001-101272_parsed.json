They pointed out the difficulties involved, namely the search for competent experts willing to prepare not only the report but also to appear at a hearing. In this context they also submitted that it was reasonable for the court not to take coercive measures against experts who ask not to be summoned to a hearing, because such measures would make it even more difficult to find experts in the future. Moreover, numerous questions of the parties made addendums to the reports necessary; the resulting delay could not be attributed to the court. The\u00a0Government pointed out that it must be seen as proper conduct of the proceedings that the court only ordered the first expert opinion after the applicant had withdrawn her action against two of the defendants and all medical records were on file. They also maintained that the cancellation of a hearing because payment of additional court fees could not be confirmed could not be objected to. As to the applicant\u2019s conduct, the Government submitted that she contributed to the length of the proceedings with her late submission of medical records at the beginning of the proceedings, her delayed payment of additional court fees, her objections to experts, her claim extensions and several requests for an extension of time limits. \nWhile the Government conceded that the proceedings were of some importance to the applicant, they also pointed out that the surgery had not been medically indicated and that the applicant was still in a financially secure situation.",

The Court sees no reason why the Regional Court did not at the very beginning order the parties to submit all medical records and issue an evidence order already before the first oral hearing as is possible under domestic law (see Relevant domestic law above), but instead waited more than one year. The Court also observes that the whole process of obtaining expert reports and supplements to these reports could have been cut short if the expert had been summoned to the first hearing to give an oral expert report or, at least, if he had been summoned to explain his written report at the earliest possible hearing. In\u00a0this context the domestic courts should verify that only experts who are available for an oral hearing are appointed and should also make use, if necessary, of coercive measures as provided for by domestic law.",

However, it also observes that they dealt with the applicant\u2019s pecuniary damage claim which the domestic courts have so far not even addressed; the Court hence does not discern any causal link between the claim extensions and the length of the proceedings. The same is true for the alleged late payment of additional court fees following a claim extension. The Court does not see any reason why an oral hearing dealing with the basis of the cause of action and not the pecuniary damage claim should be cancelled for this reason. As far as the applicant\u2019s requests for extensions of time limits and her objections experts are concerned the Court finds that any delay arising therefrom is negligible.

In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers that the applicant has not established that the costs and expenses claimed for the proceedings before the domestic courts were incurred in order to seek prevention or rectification of the specific violation caused by the excessive length of the proceedings. In particular, the Court finds that the evidence submitted for extra lawyers\u2019 fees allegedly incurred specifically because of the length of proceedings is not sufficiently substantiated. The German fee schedule for lawyers does not provide for an extra fee because of the length of the proceedings; an agreement providing for a extra remuneration in this regard was not submitted. However, seeing that in length of proceedings cases the protracted examination of a case beyond a \u201creasonable time\u201d involves an increase in the applicants\u2019 costs (see, among other authorities, S\u00fcrmeli v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, \u00a7 148, ECHR 2006VII), it finds it reasonable to award EUR\u00a0500 under this head. This amount also covers the EUR\u00a0360 claimed by the applicant for additional legal advice because of the length of the proceedings. The Court further considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 2,296.99 covering lawyer\u2019s fees and the applicant\u2019s own expenses for the proceedings before the Court.",
