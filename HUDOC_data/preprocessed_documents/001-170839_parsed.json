The applicants, together with other journalists, were reporting from the Parliament gallery, which was situated above the plenary hall (\u201cthe chamber\u201d) where members of parliament (MPs) were seated. The debate on the approval of the State budget attracted considerable public and media attention, owing to the conflict between opposition and ruling party MPs as to whether or not statutory procedure had been complied with. During the proceedings, opposition MPs approached the President of Parliament (\u201cthe Speaker\u201d) and started creating noise by, inter alia, slapping his table. Soon thereafter, Parliament security officers entered the chamber. They pulled the Speaker out of the chamber and started forcibly removing the opposition MPs. At the same time, other security officers (four officers, according to the Government) entered the gallery and started removing the applicants and other journalists. The Government stated that the security officers had informed those in the gallery that they had to leave for security reasons. The applicants denied that the reasons for their removal had been explained to them. Whereas some journalists complied with those orders, the applicants refused to leave, as the situation in the chamber was escalating and they felt that the public had the right to be kept informed as to what was going on. However, the security officers forcibly removed the applicants from the gallery.",

Accordingly, they had not and could not have contributed to the disturbance in the chamber.

It notes that Article 16 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution guarantees the freedom to obtain and impart information (see paragraph 16 above). The freedom of the press to report on parliamentary proceedings is further specified in the Rules of Procedure of the Parliament (see paragraph 23 above). The above is sufficient for the Court to conclude that the domestic law recognises the right of accredited journalists to report from the Parliament. Reporting from the Parliament gallery was necessary for the applicants as accredited journalists to exercise their profession and to inform the public about its work. The Constitutional Court, which decided the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint, seems to have had the same approach. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the right to report from the Parliament gallery, which fell within the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression, is a \u201ccivil right\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see similarly Shapovalov v.

Other disputed issues of fact concerned the applicants\u2019 (in)ability to follow the incident in the parliamentary chamber and the security risk that had required, as established by the Constitutional Court, their removal. In the latter context, they referred to the dissenting opinion of Judge N.G.D. of the Constitutional Court, in which the above elements had been pointed out (see paragraph 15 above). The applicants further argued that an oral and public hearing had been required not only for the purpose of establishing the relevant facts, but also given the \u201cexceptional public interest\u201d in the case.

Although the applicants\u2019 removal from the gallery had amounted to interference with their freedom of expression, it had been in compliance with the Convention. The measure had been based on section 43 of the Parliament Act, which had entitled the Speaker to order Parliament security officers to restore order so that discussion could continue. The intervention had aimed to ensure public safety, prevent further disturbance and, in particular, to protect the journalists. It had not been applied with the aim of preventing them from reporting on the parliamentary proceedings. It had been necessary given the ongoing disturbance, which had culminated in objects being thrown in the chamber and in the direction of the gallery, as part of the chamber. The assessment of the security risks made within the State\u2019s margin of discretion had required that the gallery be vacated to avoid any threat to the journalists\u2019 physical integrity. The applicants had refused to comply with the orders of the security officers to leave the gallery. Their removal had been carried out as a last resort after other less restrictive measures had been exhausted. The unforeseeable and rapid developments had required a prompt reaction by the Parliament security service. Notwithstanding that the applicants had neither contributed to nor participated in the incidents in the Parliament chamber, the extraordinary and chaotic events surrounding the debate in Parliament had necessitated the impugned intervention of the Parliament security service.

It reiterates that the \u201cwatch-dog\u201d role of the media assumes particular importance in such contexts, since their presence is a guarantee that the authorities can be held to account for their conduct vis-\u00e0-vis the demonstrators and the public at large when it comes to the policing of large gatherings, including the methods used to control or disperse protesters or to preserve public order.

The Constitutional Court further established that on that occasion a small group of people, including the applicants, \u201chad actively and passively resisted\u201d and that as a result, a security officer sustained an injury to his leg (see paragraph 14 above). That conclusion overlapped with the findings of the DCPS (see paragraph 10 above). The applicants contested those findings (see paragraphs 6 and 13 above). The Court notes that neither the DCPS nor the Constitutional Court made any findings of fact that a security officer engaged in the impugned operation had sustained an injury to his chest, as alleged by the Government (see paragraph 6 above). Furthermore, no information was provided as to the nature of the leg injury. It also appears that the applicants\u2019 behaviour, as established by the domestic authorities, did not lead to any proceedings with a view to establishing the relevant circumstances and attributing any guilt in this respect. Nonetheless, the Court considers it noteworthy that the applicants\u2019 removal from the gallery was not a consequence of their refusal to comply with the orders of the parliamentary security service or their resistance, but was a result of the risk assessment made by that same service that the applicants\u2019 further presence in the gallery posed a threat to their lives and physical integrity. In this connection, the Constitutional Court found that \u201cthe Parliament security service considered that, in order to protect the integrity and lives of the journalists in the gallery, the latter should be moved to a safer place where they would not be in danger\u201d.",

It was not presented with any evidence that the disturbance in the chamber had been violent and that anyone, in the chamber or elsewhere, had sustained an injury as a result of that disturbance. The only relevant element on which the Constitutional Court based its finding that the applicants had not been safe was that \u201cobjects were thrown in the chamber \u2013 some in the direction of the gallery\u201d. However, the Court notes that no further explanation was provided as to the type and number of objects thrown and whether any of them had reached the gallery, which as noted above, was situated above the chamber. The Court observes that the DCPS made no reference in its letter to objects being thrown in the chamber (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). The Court further refers to its finding above (see paragraph 43 above) that the applicants were deprived of the opportunity to challenge in an oral hearing the facts on which the Constitutional Court had based its decision about the security risks for the applicants (see Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, \u00a7 161, ECHR 2016; Kar\u00e1csony and Others, cited above, \u00a7 133; and Lombardi Vallauri v. Italy, no. 39128/05, \u00a7 46, 20 October 2009).",

The Court recalls that in its judgment the Constitutional Court found that the journalists \u201cwere able to follow the live broadcast of the debate from other premises [the press centre, in a hall adjacent to the gallery]\u201d and that the \u201cplenary debate of the Parliament of 24 December 2012 was public and it was entirely broadcast live on national television and streamed on the Parliament website (see paragraph 14 above). When the debate was over, the video material was made available to the public on that website.\u201d Although the Court does not have a basis to call into question these factual findings, they do not, as such, adequately convey in the Court\u2019s view whether the applicants had been effectively able to view the ongoing foreseeable removal of opposition MPs by the Parliamentary security service which, as referred to above (see paragraph 75 above), was an issue of legitimate public concern. Furthermore, the applicants\u2019 removal entailed immediate adverse effects that instantaneously prevented them from obtaining first-hand and direct knowledge based on their personal experience of the events unfolding in the chamber, and thus the unlimited context in which the authorities were handling them (see conversely, ibid, cited above, \u00a7 101). Those were important elements in the exercise of the applicants\u2019 journalistic functions, which the public should not have been deprived of in the circumstances of the present case.",
