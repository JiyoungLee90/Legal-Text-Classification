France (no. 53929/00, 1 June 2004), concerning de facto management of public funds, to the purely objective procedure of examining accounts rendered by public accountants. They pointed out that the internal rules of procedure followed by the public finance courts when auditing accounts were distinct from those followed in cases of de facto management of public funds, having regard to the difference in nature and subject of those two types of procedure. In the Government\u2019s submission, the position of a public accountant was not comparable to that of a tortfeasor; nor did he incur liability on the basis of obligations comparable to contractual obligations under the civil law. They observed in that connection that judicial audits of accounts were merely intended to check that the accounts rendered were in order.",

Firstly, his only obligation on a judicial audit of his accounts was to produce proof of the entries in the accounts submitted to the audit office for examination and, secondly, it remained entirely uncertain, after judgment was delivered, that he would be surcharged in respect of the deficit disclosed. On the latter point the Government pointed out that, where applicable, the judgment was limited to noting the expenditure paid by the accountant \u2013 or the outstanding sums due and not collected by him \u2013 without proper or adequate reasons and requesting him, not to repay the amounts in question, but to put the accounts in order. Making good the deficit recorded in the judgment from the accountant\u2019s own assets was only one method of putting the accounts in order. The accountant\u2019s financial position was not determined until a later stage, and then not by the public finance courts but by the Minister of Finance, who had a statutory power to discharge accountants in respect of their accounts or grant them remission, on a non-contentious application, in respect of the deficit in the event of force majeure or if there had been no negligence, after assessing any professional failings on the part of the accountant in the exercise of his duties and his ability to contribute to settling the amounts in question. If the Minister decided in the accountant\u2019s favour, this amounted to regularisation of the accounts to the extent that the accountant had been discharged of liability or granted remission of the deficit. The Government argued on that basis that it was only at that stage, and not when the accounts were being objectively assessed by the public finance courts, that a civil obligation of the accountant could be regarded as being in issue.",

He referred in that connection to the case-law of the Convention institutions (in particular the opinion of the European Commission of Human Rights in Muyldermans v.

In the observations he submitted at the admissibility stage he had also contended that, in accordance with the judgment in Pellegrin, cited above, Article 6 \u00a7 1 was applicable to his case because, as a civil servant in the State education service appointed as a school\u2019s accountant, his employment had not entailed participating in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and the performance of duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public bodies.",

The case involved a civil servant in the employ of the State education service who had been appointed by the Director of Education as accountant of a school and was responsible, in that capacity, for the accounts of a secondary school and of those of a centre attached to it that had no separate legal personality. Neither the nature of the duties carried out by the applicant, nor the responsibilities attached to them, support the view that he participated \u201cin the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public authorities\u201d, unless these concepts are to be construed broadly.

They pointed out, however, \u201cas a preliminary point\u201d, that, as the applicant had neither requested that the appeal be heard in public nor sought leave to address the Court of Audit before it ruled on his appeal, he was \u201cnot justified in complaining of the lack of an oral hearing on the appeal before the Court of Audit\u201d. Furthermore, the lack of a public hearing on an appeal against a judicial audit of accounts was not, in any event, they argued, contrary to the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 given the \u201cobjective\u201d and highly technical nature of judicial audits of public accounts (in connection with this point, the Government referred to the following authorities: Schuler-Zgraggen v.

Verification of the voluminous accounts submitted annually by public accountants, and of the existence and validity of the supporting documents produced for every sum spent or unrecovered, was far better dealt with in writing than orally. Moreover, the Government added, compliance with the adversarial character of proceedings was also guaranteed, at first instance, by the aforementioned \u201cdouble judgment\u201d rule, which protected the rights of the defence in particular. They went on to point out that, generally speaking, the public finance courts did not rule on charges brought against an accountant by a public body, but themselves identified, where applicable, operations that might engage the accountant\u2019s liability. They did not reach their decision until the end of adversarial and written proceedings, which placed the parties in a wholly identical position since judgments and interim rulings were served on them in accordance with the same formal requirements and gave them the same opportunity to reply; the public body concerned did not take part in hearings when these were not public either. In short, in the instant case the applicant had not suffered any disadvantage in the presentation of his case before the public finance courts compared with the school of which he was the accountant.",

He did not play any part in instigating the proceedings, formulating the complaints or determining the scope of the court\u2019s intervention. His role was not in any way comparable to that of an investigating judge: he did not prepare the appeal for examination by the court, this being the task of the Government Commissioner attached to the regional audit office; nor, being bound by the terms of the investigation, did he have the task of making enquiries designed to identify whether an irregularity had been committed and, if so, by whom. Whilst he was invested with powers under Articles R. 141-2 and R. 141-3 of the Financial Judicature Code, these powers were only exceptionally used on appeal, since the file was complete at that stage.

He argued on that basis that  had already taken note of the need to hold public hearings and respect the principle of adversarial process before that court in cases involving de facto management of public funds or the imposition of a fine.

His task was to ensure that accounts were duly produced by the accountants and \u201csatisfy the court regarding his conception of the application of the law\u201d, and he formulated his written submissions on the basis of the reports communicated to him (Article R.112-8 of the Financial Judicature Code provided that reports relating to a surcharge had to be sent to Principal State Counsel). Once he gave an opinion he became, objectively speaking, an \u201cally\u201d or \u201copponent\u201d within the meaning of the judgment in Borgers v. Belgium (30 October 1991, Series A no. 214-B).

His role extended beyond that, since in addition he \u201cformulated complaints\u201d.

The second of those directions described him as a \u201csilent witness\u201d. They stated that Decree no. 2005-1586 incorporating the new procedure had been published in the Official Gazette on 20 December 2005, adding in particular Article R. 731-7 to the Administrative Courts Code, according to which \u201cthe Government Commissioner shall be present at deliberations[;] he shall not participate in them\u201d. It was thus \u201conly exceptionally and on request, [that the Government Commissioner could] be required, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, and as one of the members of the section on the basis of whose report the dispute was examined, having last studied the file, to reply to any question of a technical nature that might arise\u201d; in addition to providing that technical assistance, the Government Commissioner\u2019s presence at the deliberations had the advantage of allowing him better to understand the reasons for which the bench concurred with his point of view or, on the contrary, dissented from it. The knowledge thus acquired of the court\u2019s reasoning would enable him, in subsequent submissions, to give a faithful account of the case-law or, if the bench had not convinced him, to prepare in future a new line of case-law and thus contribute to ensuring the consistency, continuity and if necessary the development of the case-law, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, which would first and foremost benefit all litigants. They reiterated that, as understood by the Court, the \u201cdoctrine of appearances\u201d was not based exclusively on the concerns that a litigant might have as to the impartiality of a court: such concerns had to be based on objective factors for there to be a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1. For the reasons stated above, such objective factors were not made out on the basis of the mere presence of the Government Commissioner at the deliberations.",

Nevertheless, it is clear from the facts of the case, the arguments submitted by the parties and the reasons given in the Court\u2019s judgment, together with the operative provisions, that the Kress judgment uses these terms as synonyms, and that the mere presence of the Government Commissioner at the deliberations, be it \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cpassive\u201d, is deemed to be a violation. Paragraphs 84 and 85, for example, are particularly enlightening in this respect: examining the Government\u2019s argument that the \u201cpresence\u201d of the Government Commissioner was justified by the fact that, having been the last person to have seen and studied the file, he would be in a position during the deliberations to answer any question which might be put to him about the case, the Court replied that the benefit for the trial bench of this purely technical assistance was to be weighed against the higher interest of the litigant, who had to have a guarantee that the Government Commissioner would not be able, through his \u201cpresence\u201d at the deliberations, to influence their outcome, and found that that guarantee was not afforded by the French system.",

The Court specified, however, that \u201c[i]n so doing, [it would] have regard, for guidance, to the categories of activities and posts listed by the European Commission in its communication of 18 March 1988 and by the Court of Justice of the European Communities\u201d (ibid.), in the context of an interpretation of Article 48 of the EEC Treaty on the freedom of movement for workers within the Community. That provision entails \u201cthe abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work\u201d (Article 48 \u00a7 2) and includes, among other things, the right \u2013 subject to certain limitations \u2013 \u201cto accept offers of employment actually made\u201d (Article 48 \u00a7 3). Since Article 48 \u00a7 4 specifies that these provisions are not applicable \u201cto employment in the public service\u201d, the Court of Justice of the European Communities has held that this derogation applies only to jobs which meet the above criterion, that is to say those that involve direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public authorities (see Pellegrin, \u00a7\u00a7 37-41, to which \u00a7 66 cross-refers).",

It should be observed, moreover, mutatis mutandis, that on retirement employees break the special bond between themselves and the authorities, and then \u2013 as acknowledged in Pellegrin \u2013 find themselves in a \u201csituation exactly comparable to that of employees under private law in that the special relationship of trust and loyalty binding them to the State has ceased to exist\u201d (\u00a7 67, in fine).",

Although the surcharge, which was the subject of the dispute in this case, related to the functions entrusted to the applicant as a public accountant, it was not intended to bear any relation to his career as such and was, clearly, totally unrelated to his recruitment or termination of his service.

Thus, for example, in the former case a policeman or police officer who is in litigation with the authority employing him on grounds of the insalubrious condition of his official residence could not, on account of his status, rely on Article 6 \u00a7 1 to claim a right of access to a tribunal.

He criticises, in turn, the presence of \u201cState Counsel\u201d at the Court of Audit hearing to which he himself did not have access, the presence of \u201cState Counsel\u201d at the deliberations (but the judgment dismisses that argument as being factually unsubstantiated, see paragraph 47), the disclosure of the reporting judge\u2019s report to State Counsel and not, inter alia, to the accountant (which is described in paragraph 48 as \u201cproblematic\u201d), and lastly the presence of the reporting judge at the deliberations. On the last point paragraph 49 of the judgment describes his presence as \u201cas such, legitimate and justified\u201d but goes on to find it problematic merely on account of the fact that the reporting judge, before participating in the deliberations, has expressed his point of view on the merits orally before \u201cState Counsel\u201d. In sum, the conclusion is reached in paragraph 50 of the judgment that it is the position of \u201cState Counsel\u201d in the proceedings which creates an imbalance detrimental to public accountants and thus gives rise to a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1. Without going into the terminological imprecisions (Principal State Counsel, State Counsel), we consider the judgment to be flawed on account of the difficulty for the respondent State to abide by it, as required by Article 46 of the Convention. This likely difficulty in execution is coupled, as far as public accountants are concerned, with legal uncertainty in the future. We accept that, in the light of the case-law (even if we do not approve of it), this procedure for appealing against a judgment of a regional audit office levying a surcharge against a public accountant is perhaps not compatible on every point with Article 6 \u00a7 1. However, it would have been infinitely better, in the reasoning and the operative provisions of the judgment, to set out the various sub-complaints and indicate which were founded and which were not.",

We are among those who disapprove of the part of the judgment in Kress relating to the \u201cGovernment Commissioner\u2019s participation in the ... deliberations\u201d (point 2 of the operative provisions of Kress). Since that judgment was delivered, the semantic argument between participation (which implies the possibility of \u201ctaking part\u201d in the deliberations, that is, addressing the court) and the mere presence (which prohibits participation in them) has been the subject of a large number of articles and commentaries by legal authors which we regret we are unable to cite here despite their importance. Beyond the question of semantics, however \u2013 there are, moreover, a number of internal inconsistencies in Kress, both in the French version and between the French and English versions, but there is no point in going back over them here \u2013 the main basis of that judgment, descended from Borgers, cited above, is the \u201cdoctrine\u201d of appearances. In other words, a litigant or lawyer who is not present at the deliberations and does not therefore know what happens there may imagine that the Commissioner, who is present, thus has \u201cif only to outward appearances, an additional opportunity to bolster his submissions in private, without fear of contradiction\u201d.",

Article R. 731-7, added to the Administrative Courts Code by the decree, provides: \u201cThe Government Commissioner shall be present at deliberations. He shall not participate in them.\u201d Nothing could be clearer. Even the most suspicious litigant will be sure that, in his case, the Commissioner will be present at deliberations but will not have the right to participate in them and will therefore not have \u201can additional opportunity to bolster his submissions in private\u201d. Reference to this new provision could have been made in the \u201cLaw\u201d part of the Martinie judgment, as was done in Odi\u00e8vre v. France, for example, with regard to the Law of 22 January 2002. By refusing to do so, the Court gives the impression of being deaf to the dialogue between judges and entrenched in a general, abstract and dogmatic position, which is a pity.",

This wound is both unjust and gratuitous for we are unable to discern in this inflexible position any progress towards genuine fairness of proceedings, still less towards the defence of human rights to which our Court contributes so effectively in general.",
