Poland (no.1), (no. 39655/05, 16 December 2008), the Court noted that the applicant prisoner had obtained compensation for the interference with his correspondence and had thus obtained adequate redress. However, in that case, the question concerned not the effectiveness of the remedy under the relevant provisions of the Civil Code but the separate issue of whether the applicant could still be considered a victim. The Court did not pronounce on the issue of exhaustion. As to the decision of the Warsaw Court of Appeal of 28 June 2007 invoked by the Government, the Court observes that it was delivered after the date of introduction of the application, and on that account cannot be held against the applicant.",
