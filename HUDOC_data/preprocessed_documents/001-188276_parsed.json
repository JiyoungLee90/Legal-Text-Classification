The status of a \u201cspecial witness\u201d therefore allowed the authorities to proceed with an investigation in order to decide whether there had been criminal activity and whether the relevant acts had been committed by a particular person, even in the absence of sufficient evidence to officially recognise anyone as a suspect. The Government pointed out that the Recommendations adopted by the Prosecutor General emphasised the exceptional nature of the status of a \u201cspecial witness\u201d and provided examples of cases in which it should be applied (see paragraph 29 above).",

For that reason, the authorities had carried out various investigative measures, including multiple witness examinations, in order to collect evidence. As one of the allegedly unlawful transfers made by the applicant\u2019s wife had been a payment to company A., headed by the applicant, the Government argued that it had been \u201creasonable and unavoidable\u201d to call him as a witness, as he could have explained the relationship between companies \u00a0A. and\u00a0M. and the circumstances related to that transaction.",

Therefore, in order to determine whether there has been such interference in the present case, the Court has to examine whether the status of a \u201cspecial witness\u201d, which was granted to the applicant\u2019s wife, is sufficiently similar to the status of a suspect, to the extent that the criminal proceedings could be said to have been \u201cagainst\u201d her.",

Pursuant to the Recommendations adopted by the Prosecutor General, that status is considered to be between that of a socalled \u201cordinary\u201d witness, who has no procedural interest in the outcome of the case, and that of a suspect (see paragraph 29 above). Certain rights which are typically reserved for suspects \u2013 such as the right to a lawyer and the exemption from liability for refusing to testify or giving false testimony\u00a0\u2013\u00a0are applicable to \u201cspecial witnesses\u201d (see paragraph 27 above). Furthermore, in their observations, the Government stated that \u201cin practice\u201d the testimonial privilege granted to the family members and close relatives of suspects or accused was also granted to the family members and close relatives of \u201cspecial witnesses\u201d, one of the reasons for that being the need \u201cto protect individuals from compelling them to testify against their relatives\u201d (see paragraph 49 above). It is therefore evident from these facts that, under the Lithuanian law, the status of a \u201cspecial witness\u201d is close to the status of a suspect in several important aspects.",

More importantly, the Court has previously held that testimony obtained under compulsion which appears on its face to be of a non-incriminating nature, such as exculpatory remarks or mere information on questions of fact, may be deployed in criminal proceedings in support of the prosecution case, for example to contradict or cast doubt upon statements of the accused or evidence given by him or her during the trial, or to otherwise undermine his or her credibility (see Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a050541/08 and 3 others, \u00a7 268, 13 September 2016).

In accordance with Lithuanian law, the family members and close relatives of a suspect or an accused, such as parents, children, spouses and former spouses, are exempt from the obligation to testify in criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 19-21 above). Furthermore, as held by the highest Lithuanian courts, the testimonial privilege of family members and close relatives extends to any proceedings which may lead to a punishment that could be considered \u201ccriminal\u201d because of its nature and severity (see paragraph 24 above), and officials questioning such family members and close relatives have a duty to inform them about their right to refuse to testify, irrespective of whether such a duty is explicitly provided for in the law (see paragraph 25 above).

In the Court\u2019s view, in the present case, it is not called to assess whether the status of a \u201cspecial witness\u201d as such is compatible with the Convention, or what specific rights a person holding that status should have (see the relevant general principles in paragraphs 59 and 60 above). It observes, however, that none of the domestic legal instruments relating to the status of \u201cspecial witnesses\u201d addressed the question of the testimonial privilege of family members and close relatives. In addition, neither the explanatory report to the draft amendment of the CCP nor the Recommendations adopted by the Prosecutor General provided any arguments as to why, notwithstanding the similarities between the status of a \u201cspecial witness\u201d and that of a suspect, that privilege should remain limited to the family members and close relatives of suspects (see paragraphs\u00a027-29 above). In such circumstances, the Court considers that the domestic authorities in the applicant\u2019s case should have provided relevant and sufficient reasons for refusing to grant the testimonial privilege to the applicant, who was a family member of a \u201cspecial witness\u201d.",

However, neither the senior prosecutor nor the Klaip\u0117da District Court addressed in substance the applicant\u2019s arguments or took note of his particular circumstances \u2013 they merely referred to the text of the above-mentioned provision and found that the family members or close relatives of \u201cspecial witnesses\u201d were not mentioned there (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above). Those authorities did not make any attempt to explain the reasoning behind the testimonial privilege being refused to persons in the applicant\u2019s situation, in particular in the light of the prohibition to compel anyone to testify against his or her family members or close relatives enshrined in the Constitution (see paragraphs 18 and 22-24 above), and the Klaip\u0117da District Court dismissed his request to refer the matter to the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 14 above).",

The Court will uphold claims for costs and expenses only in so far as they are related to the violations it has found, and will reject them in so far as they relate to complaints that have not led to the finding of a violation, or to complaints declared inadmissible. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 605 covering costs for the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
