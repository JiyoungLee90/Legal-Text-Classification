According to the documents drafted by the security forces, the applicant was taken out of hospital after his doctors had authorised his discharge and was taken back again by the gendarmerie on the same day, when his medical conditioned worsened (see paragraph 8 above). The applicant did not challenge the veracity of these documents before the national authorities or the Court. On 20\u00a0March 2007 one of the applicant\u2019s representatives told the trial court that the applicant had been subjected to ill-treatment while being questioned by the gendarmerie (see paragraph 19 above), but she failed to give a detailed account of the alleged ill-treatment.
