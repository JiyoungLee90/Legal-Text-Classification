.  The case originated in two applications (nos. 68385/10 and 71378/10) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Ukrainian nationals, Mr Gennadiy Lukyanovych Sukhanov and Mr Viktor Prokofiyovych Ilchenko (“the applicants”), on 1 and 9 November 2010 respectively.
.  The first applicant was represented by Ms N. Tselovalnichenko, a lawyer practising in the city of Lugansk, Ukraine. The second applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr A. Kristenko, a lawyer practising in the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, most recently Ms Nataly Sevostianova, of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine.
.  The applicants alleged, in particular, that they had not been paid social benefits in the amount claimed by them.
.  On 25 August 2011 the applications were communicated to the Government.
.  Both applicants were born in 1938 and live in the city of Lugansk and in the town of Zhovti Vody, Ukraine, respectively.
.  Both applicants have the special status of “a child of war” (see paragraph 17 below). From 1 January 2006 they were entitled to a special supplement to their pensions in the amount of 30% of the minimum pension in accordance with section 6 of the Children of War Social Protection Act (Закон України “Про соціальний захист дітей війни”).
.  In May 2008 the first applicant instituted court proceedings against the Artemovskyy District Department of the Pension Fund of Ukraine and the Lugansk Regional Main Department of the State Treasury of Ukraine, asking them to recalculate his pension for 2006-08, to determine the amount of and to pay him the outstanding indexed debt, and to pay his pension in the recalculated amount in the future. The first applicant also claimed compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, and legal expenses.
.  On 22 July 2008 the Lugansk Regional Administrative Court held that in 2006 section 6 of the Children of War Social Protection Act had been suspended by the State Budget Act 2006. In return the State Budget Act had empowered the Cabinet of Ministers to set up a mechanism for a pension increase. However, because in 2006 no such mechanism had been set up, the first applicant’s claims relating to 2006 had to be rejected.
.  The court further found that in 2007 section 6 had again been suspended, and in 2008 it had been modified by the State Budget Acts for the relevant years. However, this modification was found to be unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court on 9 July 2007 and 22 May 2008. The court consequently held that the State Pension Fund should recalculate the first applicant’s pension for the periods between 9 July and 31 December 2007 and as of 22 May 2008.
.  On 19 December 2008 the Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeal upheld that decision.
.  On 28 July 2010 the Higher Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law.
.  In December 2009 the second applicant instituted proceedings in the Zhovtovodsky Town Court against the Pension Fund, asking for recalculation of his pension from January 2006.
.  On 2 March 2010 the court found in part for the second applicant. It held that the second applicant was entitled to the supplement from the date of the decision of the Constitutional Court (9 July 2007) and not from 1 January 2006. The court further held that the Pension Fund should recalculate the second applicant’s pension for the periods between 9 July and 31 December 2007 and between 22 May 2008 and 2 March 2010.
.  On 10 August 2010 the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld this decision. The decision of the Court of Appeal was final.
.  On 14 February 2011 the second applicant instituted a second set of proceedings in the Zhovtovodsky Town Court claiming payment of the above-mentioned supplement to his pension starting from 3 March 2010.
.  On 17 May 2011 the court found for the second applicant and held that the Pension Fund should recalculate the applicant’s pension from 3 March 2010. On 14 October 2011 the Dnipropetrovsk Administrative Court of Appeal upheld this decision.
.  According to section 6 of the Children of War Social Protection Act, in force since 1 January 2006, children of war (persons who on 2 September 1945 were no more than 18 years of age) are entitled to receive pensions or other social benefits with a supplement of 30% of the minimum pension. Part 2 of section 3 of the Act provides that the social guarantees foreseen by the Act cannot be limited or annulled by other legal acts.
.  Between 1 April 2006 and 22 May 2008 the minimum pension was increased from 350 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) (at the material time around 55 euros (EUR)) to UAH 481 (at the material time around EUR 68).
.  By virtue of the State Budget Act 2006, section 6 of the Children of War Social Protection Act was suspended. On 19 January 2006 the relevant provisions of the State Budget Act 2006 were modified (the amendments entered into force on 2 April 2006). According to these amendments, the supplement was to be introduced gradually, in accordance with a decision by the Cabinet of Ministers. However, no such decision was taken in 2006.
.  By the State Budget Acts of 2007 and 2008, section 6 of the Act was suspended and modified, respectively. On 9 July 2007 and 22 May 2008 the Constitutional Court found it to be unconstitutional (see Kolesnik and others v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 57116/10 and foll., § 46, 26 June 2014) .
.  On 1 May 2009 the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine issued a note containing a general analysis of the administrative courts’ practice in cases concerning the social protection of children of war, war veterans and victims of the Nazi persecutions.
.  The court noted that:
“An analysis of the courts’ practice shows that disputes are mainly caused by shortcomings in the legislative regulation of social protection; in particular, since legal acts of equal force exist on the matter, it is difficult to establish which provision has higher legal force and should thus be applied in the dispute in question.
The main legal acts in question include the Constitution of Ukraine, the Children of War Social Protection Act, the War Veterans Status and Social Protection Guarantees Act [...].
The State Budget Acts for 2006-2008 introduced changes to those legal acts, suspending some provisions and reducing some payments.
On 9 July 2007 and 22 May 2008 some changes introduced by the State Budget Acts were found to be unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine.”
.  The Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine further noted that the national courts had not always correctly decided which legal act should be applied. In respect of the pension supplement under section 6 of the Children of War Social Protection Act it noted that in 2006 this provision had been suspended by the State Budget Act 2006. The State Budget Act 2006 provided that the supplement in question had to be determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, but since no such decision had been taken “the children of war benefits under section 6 of the Children of War Social Protection Act had not been implemented in 2006”.
.  As for the 2007-2008 payments, the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine noted that the relevant provisions of the State Budget Acts for 2007-2008 had been found to be unconstitutional. However, since Constitutional Court decisions could not be applied retrospectively the pension supplements were to be awarded only for the periods between 9 July 2007 and 31 December 2007 and between 22 May 2008 and 31 December 2008.
.  In a letter of 14 August 2009 sent to the heads of the administrative courts of appeal the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine reiterated its position.
