The situations where deprivation of life may be justified are exhaustive and must be narrowly interpreted. The use of force which may result in the deprivation of life must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a), (b) and (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims. In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 146-50, Series A no. 324; Andronicou and Constantinou v.

The Government also referred to the witness statements of a certain serviceman, L., to the effect that on 11 September 2000 at about 6 p.m. two armoured personnel carriers with obscured registration numbers had passed through a check-point on the road leading from Goyskoye to Urus-Martan (see paragraph 23 above). The Court, unlike the Government, does not consider that the alleged discrepancy between the time of the murder indicated by the eye-witnesses and the time the armoured personnel carriers passed through the check-point indicated by serviceman L. casts doubt on the reliability of the submissions of the eyewitnesses that the alleged perpetrators had moved around in armoured personnel carriers. The Court notes in this respect that the Government did not indicate the dates on which the statements had been obtained by the investigating authorities. It is not unlikely that if witnesses had been questioned after a considerable lapse of time they would have had difficulties in recalling the exact timing of the events in question.

In a situation where a group of armed men was able to move freely in heavy military vehicles, and to open heavy fire in broad daylight within a territory which was under the control of the federal forces, and, in particular, in the close proximity of a federal military unit, the Court cannot but reach the conclusion that those men were State agents.

The investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see O\u011fur, cited above, \u00a7\u00a088). In particular, there is an implicit requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition (see Ya\u015fa v. , 2 September 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 102-04, Reports 1998-VI, and Mahmut Kaya v.

However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the next of kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see Shanaghan v. the , no. 37715/97, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, 4\u00a0May 2001).",

It is unclear, in particular, whether, and if so how often, the investigation was suspended and resumed during the period in question and which, if any, investigative measures were taken, apart from the inspection of the scene of the incident which, in the Government\u2019s submission, was carried out on 12 September 2000 (see paragraph 17 above), and the granting of the status of victim to Mr Lecha Khazhmuradov\u2019s brother (see paragraph 16 above) on the same date.",

It therefore remains unclear whether these investigative measures were taken promptly, or with delay. Furthermore, the Government did not indicate whether any investigative steps other than those mentioned above had been taken to resolve the crime.

Even if the Court is prepared to accept the Government\u2019s argument that such a significant delay in taking one of the most essential steps, which should have afforded minimum procedural guarantees to the applicant, could be explained by the applicant\u2019s failure to adduce the required documents, it notes that even after that date the applicant does not appear to have been duly informed of the course of the investigation. In this respect, the Court notes the applicant\u2019s argument that she was never informed of the conduct of the investigation after April 2004, an argument which the Government did not contest or produce any documents to refute, and which supports the supposition that the investigation has remained suspended since March 2004. The Court also observes that, despite her efforts, the applicant was never given access to the file of the investigation. In such circumstances, the Court considers that she was excluded from the criminal proceedings and that the authorities clearly and blatantly failed to ensure that the investigation received the required level of public scrutiny, or to safeguard the legitimate interests of the next of kin of the victim in the proceedings (see O\u011fur, cited above, \u00a7\u00a092).",
