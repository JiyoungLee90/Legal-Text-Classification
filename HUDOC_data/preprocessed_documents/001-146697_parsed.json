Russia, no. 46282/07, 31\u00a0October\u00a02013). There is no indication in the present case that the domestic courts in any way verified whether the applicant had indeed attempted or planned to intimidate witnesses or to obstruct the course of justice in any other way. The allegation that the applicant may influence witnesses and other persons was not supported by any proof or, at least, reference to the names of such persons and the manner in which the applicant could influence them. It was not specified whether S. and D. remained at liberty, or whether the applicant had other accomplices and who they were.

Moreover, a mere reference of the court when extending the applicant\u2019s detention to the need to carry out investigative measures is not as such a relevant consideration justifying the continued detention (see Segeda v.

The Court has dealt with similar situations in the past and found such practice to be incompatible with the lawfulness requirement enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) (see Kharchenko v.
