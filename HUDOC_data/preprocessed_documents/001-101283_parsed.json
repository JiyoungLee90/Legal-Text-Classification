Furthermore, the Babushkinskiy District Court had refused to examine the applicant's complaint about detention and the City Court had likewise disregarded his request for release submitted at the hearing of 20\u00a0April\u00a02009.

Yet the practice continued, in breach of the applicable Russian legislation, of keeping in custody foreign nationals whose detention on remand had not been extended. The ombudsman opined that the problem lay in the domestic authorities' inconsistent practice in applying the relevant legislation, and had persisted even after the Constitutional Court's Ruling no.\u00a0101-O and the Supreme Court's Ruling\u00a0no.\u00a022 (see Relevant Domestic Law below).

Preventive measures may be applied to a suspect or a person charged with an offence where it is probable that the person in question might abscond, continue to engage in criminal activities, threaten witnesses or hinder the investigation (Article 97). When deciding on the necessity to apply a preventive measure, it is necessary to take into account the gravity of the charges and the various personal details of the person concerned (Article 99). Placement in custody is a preventive measure applied on the basis of a court decision to a person suspected of or charged with a crime punishable with at least two years' imprisonment where it is impossible to apply a more lenient preventive measure (Article 108 \u00a7 1). A request for placement in custody should be lodged by a prosecutor (or an investigator or inquirer with a prosecutor's prior approval) (Article 108 \u00a7 3). The request should be examined by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level (Article 108 \u00a7 4). A judge's decision on placement in custody may be challenged before an appeal court within three days (Article\u00a0108 \u00a7 11). The period of detention pending investigation of a crime cannot exceed two months (Article 109 \u00a7 1) but may be extended up to six months by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level, further to a request lodged by a prosecutor (or an investigator or inquirer with a prosecutor's prior approval) (Article 109 \u00a7 2). Further extensions up to twelve months may be granted at the request of an investigator, with the approval of a prosecutor of the Russian Federation, only if the person is charged with a serious or particularly serious criminal offence or offences (Article 109 \u00a7 3).",

The Plenary reiterated that any party to criminal proceedings or other person whose rights and freedoms were affected by actions or the inaction of the investigating or prosecuting authorities in criminal proceedings could invoke Article 125 of the CCrP to challenge a refusal to institute criminal proceedings or a decision to terminate them. The Plenary stated that whilst the bulk of decisions amenable to judicial review under Article 125 also included decisions to institute criminal proceedings, refusals to admit a defence counsel or to grant victim status, a person could not rely on Article\u00a0125 to challenge a court's decision to apply bail or house arrest or to remand a person in custody. It was further stressed that in declaring a\u00a0specific action or inaction of a law enforcement authority unlawful or unjustified, a judge was not entitled to annul the impugned decision or to oblige the official responsible to annul it but could only request him or her to rectify the indicated shortcomings. Should the authority concerned fail to comply with the court's instructions, an interested party could complain to a court about the authority's inaction and the latter body could issue a special decision [\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435], drawing the authority's attention to the situation. Lastly, the decision stated that a prosecutor's decision to place a person under house arrest or to remand him or her in custody with a view to extradition could be appealed against to a court under Article 125 of the CCrP.",

The judicial authorisation of placement in custody in that situation was to be carried out in accordance with Article 108 of the CCrP and following a prosecutor's petition to place that person in custody. In deciding to remand a person in custody a court was to examine if there existed factual and legal grounds for applying the preventive measure. If the extradition request was accompanied by a detention order of a foreign court, a prosecutor was entitled to remand the person in custody without a Russian court's authorisation (Article 466 \u00a7 2 of the CCrP) for a period not exceeding two months, and the prosecutor's decision could be challenged in the courts under Article 125 of the CCrP. In extending a person's detention with a view to extradition a court was to apply Article 109 of the CCrP.",

In this connection the Court reiterates that, according to its constant practice, an application for supervisory review is not a remedy to be used for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Berdzenishvili v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 31697/03, 29 January 2004; Shulepov v.

In any event, the Government failed to demonstrate how an appeal against that decision could have provided the applicant with a possibility to obtain judicial review of his detention or secured him adequate redress in respect of the alleged breach of Article 5.

Given that the applicant spent more than twenty months in custody, new issues affecting the lawfulness of his detention might have arisen during that period. In particular, the applicant sought to argue before the courts that his detention had ceased to be lawful after the expiry of the time-limits set in Article 109 of the CCrP.

Referring to its findings to the effect that the applicant had no effective remedies to exhaust (see, in particular, paragraphs 174-177 above), the Court observes that the detention orders of 7 August and 16 September 2008 were, indeed, issued more than six months prior to the applicant's application to the Court, that is 15 May 2009. At the same time it notes that the gist of his submissions under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 is not the initial decisions to place him in custody but the alleged unlawfulness of his ensuing continued detention (see paragraph 154 above). Hence, the issue before the Court is not whether those initial detention orders were lawful, but whether the applicant's detention as of 13\u00a0November 2008 and onwards was \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that is whether it had legal basis in the domestic law and \u201cwas carried out in accordance with a\u00a0procedure prescribed by law\u201d (see Mooren, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 76 and 82, and Eminbeyli v. , no. 42443/02, \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 46, 26 February 2009).",

In this respect the Court is, moreover, perplexed by the fact that, whilst both sets of proceedings concerned the issue of the applicant's detention pending extradition, the first detention order referred to Article\u00a0108 of the CCrP, regulating detention of suspects and accused persons pending criminal proceedings against them, and the second, to Article 466 \u00a7 1, specifically concerning persons detained pending extradition. Even assuming that the Nagatinskiy District Court applied Article 108 of the CCrP, as construed by the Constitutional Court's decision of 4 April 2006 (see paragraph 78 above), it remains not entirely clear why the subsequent detention order contained no reference to the provisions of Chapter 13 of the CCrP and was based solely on Article 466 \u00a7 1.",
