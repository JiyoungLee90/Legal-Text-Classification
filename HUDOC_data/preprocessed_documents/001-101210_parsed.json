It established that the applicants' residence had been 40 km away from their place of work, that they had carried out their working duties for one week at a time without interruption, and that during that time they had been separated from their families.

In those cases, the courts had established that the claimants had carried out their working duties for one week at a time without interruption; that during that time they had been separated from their families; that they had received the same salary as if they had worked full-time; and that the employer had no special rules regarding the payment of employment-related benefits for wardens. In their decisions, the courts had referred, inter alia, to the Rules and the Decree. As to the latter, the \u0160tip Court of Appeal had established that in May 2000 the  had declared it unconstitutional since it concerned issues that could be regulated only by law (U.br.29/2000 of 17 May 2000).

In the present case, the first-instance court also applied this jurisprudence by having relied on a previous court decision (see paragraph 11 above). It was the Court of Appeal which departed, as conceded by the Government, from the previous case-law established before several years regarding identical claims submitted by the applicants and Mr G.P. (see paragraph 16 above). In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it appears that no other similar case has been brought before the domestic courts since the present one (see, a contrario, Atanasovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a036815/03, \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 37, 14 January 2010).",

France, no. 20153/04, \u00a7 74, 18 December 2008). As to whether the Court of Appeal's approach was wrong, the Court reiterates that it has a limited role regarding the interpretation and application of the domestic law, which is primarily within the jurisdiction of the domestic courts (see, mutatis mutandis, Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I).
