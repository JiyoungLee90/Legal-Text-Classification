Given that G.S. was the boyfriend of her friend S. and the three of them had frequently spent time together, the applicant had not thought that he would do anything to her and had turned back towards the wall. Then G.S. had held her in his arms. The applicant had pulled herself away but G.S. had moved closer to her and had started groping her body. Despite her attempts to obstruct his actions, first by pretending to be asleep and then by pushing his hands away from her body, he had not stopped but instead had carried on sexually touching her. He had then pulled down her underwear, had climbed on top of her, had separated with one of his legs her legs which she had been clutching together and had penetrated her. The intercourse had been interrupted by the applicant, who had felt pain. G.S. had tried to resume it but the applicant had refused, following which G.S. had joined his girlfriend on the floor.

The Court\u2019s task in the instant case is therefore to examine whether the proceedings as a whole had such significant flaws as to amount to a breach of the respondent State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 3 (see, similarly, \u00c7elik v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 2), no.\u00a039326/02, \u00a7 34, 27 May 2010).

That request was made after the applicant\u2019s mother had alerted the investigators to the existence of a suicide note written by her daughter, who had also appears to have started to self-harm as a result of the trauma she had experienced (see paragraph 12 above).",

Furthermore, the prosecutor failed to assess the overall context, the fact that the applicant was a girl aged less than fourteen, a guest in the home of a close friend who was also the intimate friend of the perpetrator, that she had been sleeping before the perpetrator initiated the sexual intercourse and that she had never had any relation with him prior to that.",
