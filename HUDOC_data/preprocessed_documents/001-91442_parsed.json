The court held its first session on 29 November 2001. In the course of the proceedings, the court was presented with written evidence, including 94 documents submitted by the applicant. It also received testimony from both defendants and twelve witnesses, four of whom were called by the applicant. The evidence included a written statement and the oral testimony of the Bankruptcy Ombudsman. On 10\u00a0May 2002 the court gave its judgment. It found that on 30 September 1994 the applicant had, as a receiver of a bankrupt\u2019s estate, unlawfully transferred a substantial sum of money from the estate\u2019s bank account to the account of his own law firm. The court also found that, on the same date, he had aided and abetted his associate R in the commission of two similar offences. The court convicted the applicant of aggravated embezzlement and two counts of aiding and abetting aggravated embezzlement and sentenced him to a suspended term of one year and four months\u2019 imprisonment. R was found guilty of having made unlawful money transfers on several separate occasions between 29\u00a0April 1993 and 31 May 1996. He was convicted of two counts of aggravated embezzlement, as well as aiding and abetting the applicant\u2019s aggravated embezzlement.",

In his letter of appeal, lodged on 16 July 2002, the applicant claimed that he had only transferred funds to which he believed he was entitled as a retainer and that he had, therefore, lacked criminal intent. He made similar claims in connection with the two counts of aiding and abetting R\u2019s offences. He also referred, inter alia, to the written statement of the Bankruptcy Ombudsman, in which the latter had considered it possible that the applicant had, in fact, lacked criminal intent in regard to the alleged embezzlement. On 15 and 17\u00a0November 2004 the Court of Appeal held an oral hearing. By its judgment of 13\u00a0January\u00a02005 it upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction but changed his sentence to one year and ten months\u2019 unconditional imprisonment. In its reasons the court had regard, inter alia, to the Bankruptcy Ombudsman\u2019s testimony. The Ombudsman had noted, inter alia, that at the time of drawing up his written statement he had not had all the information about the applicant\u2019s actions in the matter or, at least, had not paid attention to it. He had also testified that the receiver of a bankrupt\u2019s estate did not have a right to withdraw money from the estate\u2019s account without consent.",

That was, however, not the case here. In considering whether there were grounds for applying Chapter 6, section 7, subsection 3 of the Penal Code, the Supreme Court held that it had to be decided in casu whether the duration of the proceedings (here over 5.5 years) had been unreasonable.

The Court also observes that the statement was only one of the dozens of documents which the parties produced before the courts and that twelve witnesses were heard altogether, four of whom were called by the applicant. The Court reiterates that the assessment of evidence is primarily the task of the national courts (see, for example, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, \u00a7 67, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II).
