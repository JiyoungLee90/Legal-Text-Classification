The first phase of the development extended from 1992 to 1994 during which time the economic and commercial activity of the company was concentrated in the sphere of fast-income businesses, relying on cash, such as bakeries, retail shops, cake shops, restaurants and travel agencies. The second phase extended from the end of 1994 until the placement of the company in administration. During this period, the goal of the company was to modernise its lines of production and extend its activities within the country and abroad. In the court\u2019s view, this was the decisive period which gave rise to great economic and financial problems. The District Court acknowledged that the principal reason for the taking of loans from members of the public were the rapid pace of the company\u2019s expansion and development as well as the actual impossibility for the Albanian banks to give loans.",

In determining sentence, the court shall fix the sentence for the offence of intentional homicide and then the sentence for the offence of illegal possession of firearms. The court then imposes a single sentence, not on the basis of arithmetic addition but by imposing the most severe cumulative sentence. More specifically, the court imposes fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment for the offence of intentional homicide and five years\u2019 imprisonment for the offence of illegal possession of firearms. By applying a cumulative sentence, the court imposes a penalty of eighteen years\u2019 imprisonment, which corresponds to the most severe cumulative sentence.

This explained the inconsistent findings of the reports before the first-instance court and the Court of Appeal respectively. Furthermore, the experts\u2019 reports had been compiled two years after the company had been placed in compulsory administration, no prior experts\u2019 reports having been prepared.

Before the domestic courts, the applicant was duly assisted and represented by a lawyer of his own choosing. He was given the opportunity to challenge the evidence relied upon by the domestic courts. In particular, he questioned the experts concerning the production of the valuation reports. The Court cannot speculate as to whether the hearing of other witnesses would have had an impact on the findings of the domestic courts, which had relied on voluminous documents and detailed experts\u2019 reports in reaching their decision to convict the applicant. As a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses (see, most recently, Atanasov v. \u201cthe \u201d (no. 2), no. 41188/06, \u00a7 33, 19 April 2011). The domestic courts based their decision on substantial and decisive evidence which had been subjected to an adversarial procedure. Furthermore, the applicant lodged appeals on grounds that the lower courts had erred in the assessment of facts and the interpretation of domestic law. The national courts, whether in the first instance or on appeal, gave sufficient reasons why the applicant was considered guilty of deception.",

We also want to clarify at the outset that this conclusion does not alter the fact that, in our view, the complaints under Article 5 were inadmissible, as well as the conclusion that there was no violation of Article 6. As regards the complaints under Article 5, these were dismissed on purely formal grounds \u2013 the six months rule. As to Article 6, there was no procedural unfairness; it is the substantive fairness, more properly covered by Article 7, which was breached.",

Albania (dec.), no. 24096/05, \u00a7 31, 14 June 2011), which foreign assets also seem to have been ignored by the domestic courts.",

What, therefore, has to be assessed is whether the applicant was capable of envisaging what acts and omissions would make him criminally liable (see, inter alia, Cantoni v. France, no.\u00a017862/91, \u00a7 29, 11 November 1996; also Kokkinakis v. Greece, no.\u00a014307/88, \u00a7 52, 25 May 1993). The applicant and his company entered into loan agreements with individuals, beginning in an unspecified date in 1994. The loans were used to invest in and expand the activities of the company, a fact accepted by the domestic courts. In spite of the fact that these loans affected virtually every Albanian household, up till 1997 the authorities did not intervene in any way nor did they object to the activity, including adverts broadcast on television promoting the investment scheme. Up to 1997, therefore, there was absolutely nothing to indicate or suggest that the applicant\u2019s actions would be considered unlawful in relation to a practice which, it must be said, the State appeared openly to condone. There was no intention or attempt to institute criminal proceedings during this period against the applicant concerning the unlawfulness of his actions or, for that matter, against other persons involved in the scheme. Since the applicant conducted his activities openly and, given the authorities\u2019 tolerance of his investment scheme, we believe that it is highly unlikely that he would or could have been advised that he was exposing himself to criminal prosecution for deception. The Government did not submit any proof to the contrary.",

It is therefore, in our considered view, from that date that the applicant could have envisaged, with the help of legal advice if necessary, that the process of loan-taking was unlawful. However, even at that time Act no. 2 (see \u00a7 12) precluded the institution of criminal proceedings against the applicant before the compulsory administration had been terminated. This factor further indicates that the applicant could not reasonably have foreseen that his actions would have engaged his criminal liability. At the relevant time, there existed no interpretative case-law which would have satisfied the foreseeability test \u2013 the Supreme Court\u2019s unifying judgment of 15 September 2000 (\u00a7 114) was delivered well after the facts had been committed by the applicant. We note in particular that the Government failed to provide the Court with prior national courts\u2019 case-law which would have enabled the applicant to foresee the legal consequences of his actions. The inexorable conclusion, therefore, is that the applicant could not reasonably foresee that his acts would give rise to criminal responsibility within the meaning of Article 143 of the Criminal Code \u2013 a provision of law which, we would add, is formulated in a remarkably vague way. Suffice it to point out that not all lies necessarily produce deception and that deception does not necessarily require lies.",

The wording of Article 143 \u2013 \u201cstealing of property through lies or abuse of trust\u201d \u2013 is at the heart of the offence in question. In the instant case, after the political decision was taken to criminalise schemes such as that undertaken by the applicant, the domestic judicial authorities were confronted with the difficult task of applying the criminal provision of deception in the completely new context of a market economy, and in particular to the process of large-scale money borrowing. It is against this background \u2013 a highly politicised background \u2013 that the applicant was convicted mainly on the basis of organised massive borrowing and the alleged default on payment in the future. In our view the authorities, faced with the inability to apply retroactively the Pyramid Schemes Prohibition Act (and, of course, the second part of Article 143 which was introduced in 2001) overstretched the meaning of Article 143 beyond what was reasonably foreseeable, in violation of Article 7 of the Convention. The domestic courts\u2019 arguments and their interpretation of the applicant\u2019s actions do not persuade us that such actions could foreseeably engage the applicant\u2019s criminal responsibility. To hold that the applicant\u2019s actions constituted the criminal offence of deception when the loans were used for the company\u2019s expansion and development owing to his company\u2019s alleged inability to pay creditors would in effect mean that any unsuccessful economic initiative which could result, or effectively results, in bankruptcy would fall within the ambit of Article 143 of the Criminal Code in the event of failure to honour contractual obligations previously entered into with third parties.",

This is, we believe, the conclusion that the majority should have reached, which would then, of course, have made it unnecessary to examine whether the penalty imposed upon the applicant was more severe than that applicable at the time of the (alleged) offence.",
