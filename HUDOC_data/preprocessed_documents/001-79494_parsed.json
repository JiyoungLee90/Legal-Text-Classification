Moreover, the fact that the order did not indicate the dates on which, according to the judge deciding the case, the relevant time-limit had started to run and expired and the date on which the appeal had been submitted (see paragraph 18 above) is difficult to reconcile with Article 6 of the Convention, which, according to the Court's established case-law, embodies as a principle linked to the proper administration of justice, the requirement that court decisions should adequately state the reasons on which they are based (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.

In particular, the Court attaches weight to the speedy examination of the case during the first trial and in 1997 and to the global length of the proceedings, which was not excessive as such. It thus finds that the proceedings did not exceed a \u201creasonable time\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.
