[GC], no. 25702/94, \u00a7\u00a0150, ECHR 2001VII). It is obvious that in the instant case no such personal ties could have developed because the child was stillborn and because its biological father had been separated from the applicant before its birth and died shortly thereafter. However, it has also been the Convention organs' traditional approach to accept that close relationships short of \u201cfamily life\u201d would generally fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d (see, for example, Wakefield v. the United Kingdom, no. 15817/89, Commission decision of 1\u00a0October 1990 [relationship between a prisoner and his fianc\u00e9e]; X. and Y. v. the United Kingdom, no. 9369/81, Commission decision of 3 May 1983 [same-sex relationship]; and X. v. Switzerland, no. 8257/78, Commission decision of 10 July 1978 [relationship between a foster mother and the child she had looked after]). Bearing in mind that the applicant must have developed a strong bond with the embryo whom she had almost brought to full term and that she expressed the desire to give him a name and bury him, the establishment of his descent undoubtedly affected her \u201cprivate life\u201d, the respect for which is also guaranteed by Article 8.

The attribution of her late partner's surname and patronymic name to the stillbirth would come as a corollary of such recognition\u201d (see paragraph 25 of the judgment). This reading of the case by the majority faithfully reflects the position of the applicant during the domestic proceedings, in which she asked the national courts to establish Mr G.'s paternity in respect of the stillbirth and, as a consequence, to allow her to change the latter's name. So we are not faced with a situation where the applicant had simply asked for a change of a name: what she was requesting before the national courts was mainly a recognition of paternity.",

Yet the Court concludes that \u201c[b]earing in mind that the applicant must have developed a strong bond with the embryo whom she had almost brought to full term ... the establishment of his descent undoubtedly affected her 'private life', the respect for which is also guaranteed by Article 8\u201d (see paragraph 27 of the judgment).",

Here, we are concerned with the private life of the mother, not that of the child \u2013 who could have had, if born alive, a legitimate expectation of being recognised by his biological father as part of his family and private life \u2013 and we are dealing not simply with a request to change the name of another person, but with the latter's recognition by a third person.",
