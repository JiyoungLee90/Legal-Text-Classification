This being so, it is difficult to draw a distinction between proceedings of \u201cpurely\u201d or \u201cessentially\u201d economic interest and other kinds of proceedings. In the Neigel case, for example, the view could have been taken that the applicant, who had sought payment of the remuneration she would have received if she had been reinstated to a post in the administrative service she had previously worked for, was submitting an essentially economic claim. In another case the Court held that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was applicable on account of the fact that the issue \u201cat the heart of the proceedings\u201d concerned the applicant\u2019s \u201cmeans of subsistence\u201d (see the previously cited Le Calvez judgment, pp. 1900-01, \u00a7 58). Yet most proceedings brought by public servants against the administrative authorities which employ them have a bearing on their \u201cmeans of subsistence\u201d, so that, from that point of view too, the \u201ceconomic\u201d criterion gives rise to doubt. The Court can thus only confirm what it stated in its Pierre-Bloch v. France judgment in relation to electoral disputes, when it held: \u201cproceedings do not become \u2018civil\u2019 merely because they also raise an economic issue\u201d (judgment of 21 October 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2223, \u00a7 51).",

The Court notes, however, that in the current practice of the Contracting States established civil servants and officials under contract frequently perform equivalent or similar duties.
