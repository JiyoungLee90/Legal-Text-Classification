However, the Court is not convinced that the proceedings which were pursued by Mr K. but not accomplished by the applicant can be considered in the circumstances an effective remedy whose omission falls foul of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

Poland, no.\u00a01543/06, \u00a7\u00a7 67 to 73, 3 May 2007). For the Court, the applicant\u2019s omission to exhaust this legal avenue in addition to the one fully utilised cannot be held against him, all the more so, since there appears to be no obstacle to the authorities\u2019 assessing proportionality also in those proceedings, of which the applicant has already availed himself.

Such a relationship cannot be established with regard to the nature of Article 11 rights, which are not transferable. Logically, the question arises how the son in this particular case could have known what the applicant had wanted to express during the planned demonstration in 2006, permission for which he had never received from the police (in the Court\u2019s case-law, Articles 10 and 11 are very much interrelated, see Women On Waves and Others v. , no. 31276/05, \u00a7\u00a028, 3 February 2009). For me, the requested continuation of the case before the Court was based more on the pecuniary interests of the heir, but not on a legitimate interest in protecting the deceased applicant\u2019s rights of association under Article 11.
