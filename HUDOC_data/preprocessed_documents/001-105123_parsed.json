In \u0100damsons the Court underlined that if a State is to adopt lustration measures, they must fulfil certain conditions in order to be compatible with the Convention. Firstly, the lustration law should be accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to its effects, such conditions being inherent in the expression \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d within the meaning of the Convention. Secondly, lustration should not exclusively serve the purpose of retribution or revenge, as the punishment of offenders should be limited to the criminal law sphere. Thirdly, if domestic law allows restrictions on the rights guaranteed under the Convention, it must be precise enough to allow for the individualisation of the responsibility of each person affected thereby and contain adequate procedural safeguards. Finally, the national authorities should keep in mind that lustration measures are by their nature temporary and that the objective need to restrict individual rights as a result of such proceedings diminishes over time (see \u0100damsons, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116).

This is because lustration proceedings are, by their very nature, oriented towards the establishment of facts dating back to the communist era and are not directly linked to the current functions and operations of the security services. Lustration proceedings inevitably depend on the examination of documents relating to the operations of the former communist security agencies. If the party to whom the classified materials relate is denied access to all or most of the materials in question, his or her possibilities of contradicting the security agency\u2019s version of the facts will be severely curtailed. Those considerations remain relevant to the instant case despite some differences with the lustration proceedings in Poland (see Matyjek, \u00a7\u00a056; Luboch, \u00a7\u00a061; Rasmussen, \u00a7\u00a043; G\u00f3rny, \u00a7\u00a033, all cited above).",

Even accepting the Government\u2019s argument, the Court observes that the applicant\u2019s possibility of taking notes was considerably restricted. Any notes which he took could be made only in special notebooks that were subsequently sealed and deposited in the secret registry. The notebooks could not be removed from this registry and could be opened only by the person who had made them. The same restrictions applied to the applicant\u2019s lawyers.",

The fact that the applicant could not remove his own notes, taken in the secret registry, in order to show them to an expert or to use them for any other purpose, effectively prevented him from using the information contained in them as he had to rely solely on his memory.

Under section\u00a017(e) of the 1997 Lustration Act, the Commissioner of Public Interest had a right of access to full documentation relating to the lustrated person created by, inter alia, the former security services. If necessary, he could hear witnesses and order expert opinions. The Commissioner also had at his disposal a secret registry with staff that obtained official clearance allowing them access to documents considered to be State secrets and were employed to analyse lustration declarations in the light of the existing documents and to prepare the case file for the lustration trial.",

It is for the Government to prove the existence of such an interest in the particular case because what is accepted as an exception must not become a norm. The Court considers that a system under which the outcome of lustration trials depended to a considerable extent on the reconstruction of the actions of the former secret services, while most of the relevant materials remained classified as secret and the decision to maintain the confidentiality was left within the powers of the current secret services, created a situation in which the lustrated person was put at a clear disadvantage (see Matyjek, \u00a7\u00a062; Luboch, \u00a7\u00a067; Rasmussen, \u00a7\u00a050; G\u00f3rny, \u00a7\u00a040, all cited above).",

Consequently, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR\u00a01,500 covering costs under all heads.",
