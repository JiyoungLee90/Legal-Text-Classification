He noted that he had issued recommendations to the competent domestic authorities in previous years in this connection.

Accordingly, the question to be answered is whether there were factors capable of rebutting that presumption (ibid., \u00a7 138). As to the first of those factors, which need to be cumulatively met, the Court notes that the reduction in the applicant\u2019s personal space to below 3 sq. m was of a considerably long duration (more than one year). Such a period cannot be regarded as \u201cshort, occasional and minor\u201d and cannot therefore be used to rebut the presumption of a violation of Article 3 in the circumstances of the present case (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0151-52, where even a significantly shorter period of twenty-seven days could not be used to rebut the presumption).

It is the applicant\u2019s allegation in the present case that the reduced personal space afforded to him coupled with his disability made him particularly vulnerable.
