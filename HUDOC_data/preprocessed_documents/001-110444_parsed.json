It went on to agree with the prosecutor\u2019s submissions and stated that the term of the applicant\u2019s detention should have started running on 11 October 2005, the date when the case file had been received by the District Court, and that therefore it should be regarded as having expired on 29 October 2005.

Therefore, in the ordinary course of events such an appeal might be regarded as a possible remedy where the prosecution has decided not to investigate the claims. The Court, however, has strong doubts that this remedy would have been effective in the present case. It observes that the district prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s decisions to dispense with criminal proceedings in connection with the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment were quashed on at least two occasions by supervising prosecutors, who instructed the investigating authorities to carry out an additional inquiry (see paragraphs 61 and 64 above). That inquiry also resulted in decisions not to institute criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 63 and 65 above). In these circumstances, the Court is not convinced that an appeal to a court, which could only have had the same effect, would have offered the applicant any redress. It considers, therefore, that such an appeal in the particular circumstances of the present case would be devoid of any purpose. The Court finds that the applicant was not obliged to pursue that remedy and holds that the Government\u2019s objection should therefore be dismissed (see Khatsiyeva and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a05108/02, \u00a7 151, 17 January 2008, or Esmukhambetov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 23445/03, \u00a7 128, 29 March 2011).",

As can be ascertained from the aforementioned judgment, the trial court based its relevant finding on the conflict between the fact that the applicant\u2019s confession had been written on 6 October 2002 in the investigator\u2019s office and the absence of any record in the register of detainees of the temporary holding facility that the applicant had been taken out of his cell on that date.

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. An obligation to investigate \u201cis not an obligation of result, but of means\u201d: not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimant\u2019s account of events; however, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Thus, the investigation of serious allegations of ill-treatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see, among many other authorities, Mikheyev v. , no. 77617/01, \u00a7\u00a7 107 et seq., 26\u00a0January 2006, and Assenov and Others v.

Following a supervising prosecutor\u2019s decision of 6 February 2006, which listed a number of shortcomings and ordered that they be eliminated, a more thorough inquiry was obviously conducted. In particular, it appears that for the first time, apart from the aforementioned officials, several other people, including the applicant and those detainees who had shared cells with him during the relevant period, were interviewed. Also, some documentary evidence was examined, in particular, medical records and a register of detainees of the temporary holding facility where the applicant had been held. However, even that inquiry can hardly be said to have been adequate, given, in particular, that, as the applicant pointed out, its findings were subsequently not accepted by the domestic courts as reliable.",

It established, in particular, discrepancies between the fact that the applicant had signed his confession in the investigator\u2019s office and the absence of any record in the register of detainees to the effect that the applicant had been taken out of his cell on that date. Also, the court referred to a contradiction between the description of Ms Sh.\u2019s murder the applicant provided in his written confession and subsequent evidence obtained as a result of a medical examination of the victim\u2019s body carried out after the applicant had confessed (see paragraph 54 above).

The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely, to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see, as a recent authority, Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2010). It is in the first place for the national authorities, and notably the courts, to interpret domestic law, and in particular, rules of a procedural nature, and the Court will not substitute its own interpretation for theirs in the absence of arbitrariness. However, since under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention failure to comply with domestic law may entail a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (see Toshev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 56308/00, \u00a7 58, 10 August 2006, and Shteyn (Stein) v.\u00a0Russia, no. 23691/06, \u00a7\u00a7 89 and 94, 18 June 2009).",

It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, among recent authorities, Savenkova v. , no. 30930/02, \u00a7 65, 4 March 2010).",

In particular, the Court has held that the absence of any grounds given by judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time is incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1. Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific limit on the duration of that detention would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see also Avdeyev and Veryayev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 2737/04, \u00a7\u00a7 45-47, 9 July 2009; Bakhmutskiy v.

The resolution in question said nothing as to whether, in a situation such as the one in the present case where an individual was convicted by a trial court before the expiry of an authorised period of his detention, that \u201cremaining\u201d authorised period should automatically be applied to authorise an individual\u2019s detention after the quashing of his conviction on appeal. No provision to that effect can be found in domestic law either. The Court is therefore of the opinion that the practice adopted by the domestic court was based on an unforeseeable application of domestic law, which was arbitrary. It thus cannot be said to have met the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention (see paragraph\u00a0128 above).",

The Court notes that the said court order thus authorised the period of the applicant\u2019s detention between 13 August and 1 September 2004 retroactively. The Government did not indicate any domestic legal provision that permitted a decision to be taken authorising a period of detention retroactively. It follows that the applicant\u2019s detention, in so far as it had been authorised by a judicial decision issued in respect of the preceding period, was not \u201clawful\u201d under domestic law. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that any ex post facto authorisation of detention on remand is incompatible with the \u201cright to security of person\u201d as it is necessarily tainted with arbitrariness (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 142, and Solovyev, cited above, \u00a7 99).",

The Court thus considers that, although the applicant did not lodge appeals against any other extension orders issued before September 2004, by lodging an appeal against the aforementioned two detention orders he gave the Stavropol Regional Court \u2013 acting as a court of appeal \u2013 the opportunity to consider whether his detention was compatible with his Convention right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial. Indeed, the Regional Court had to assess the necessity of further extensions in the light of the entire preceding period of detention, taking into account how much time the applicant had already spent in custody (see, for similar reasoning, Lyubimenko v. Russia, no. 6270/06, \u00a7\u00a062, 19 March 2009; Polonskiy v. Russia, no. 30033/05, \u00a7 132, 19 March 2009; and Lamazhyk v. , no. 20571/04, \u00a7 80, 30 July 2009).",

It reiterates in this connection that although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v. , 26 June 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 207; Panchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 45100/98, \u00a7 102, 8 February 2005; Goral v.

The judiciary never specified why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicant and his lawyers in support of his requests for release, they considered the risk of his absconding or interfering with the course of justice to exist and to be decisive. Moreover, the preliminary investigation in the present case had ended by 6 February 2003, but the applicant remained in detention for more than another two years. The Court reiterates in this connection that whilst at the initial stages of the investigation the risk that an accused person might pervert the course of justice could justify keeping him or her in custody, after the evidence has been collected that ground becomes less strong (see Mamedova v. , no. 7064/05, \u00a7 79, 1 June 2006).",

As an administrative detainee, the applicant was, according to the register, taken out of his cell three times on 2 and 4 October, which were the crucial dates of his \u201cconfession\u201d to the crime. The District Court thus concluded that the \u201cconfession\u201d, although written by Mr Chumakov, could not be considered a voluntary statement about the crime in question and consequently could not be considered admissible evidence. For me this is sufficient proof of psychological pressure as prohibited by Article 3 (see G\u00e4fgen v.  [G.C.], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2010). I would point out that the District Court ultimately acquitted the applicant and acknowledged his right to rehabilitation.",
