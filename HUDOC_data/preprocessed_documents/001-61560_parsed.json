It was only police chief constable Mustafa \u00d6ztan according to whom just two helicopters had briefly flown over Lice around midday: one a troop carrier and one with fire-power which had been sent in order to enable the first helicopter to land but which had returned to Diyarbak\u0131r upon learning that that first helicopter had been forced to put down at Hani. The Delegates found Mr \u00d6ztan an evasive and rather reluctant witness who was unwilling to acknowledge pieces of information unless these were directly put to him from the various incident reports.

Huri Bi\u00e7er stated that helicopters had been flying around throughout the day. The Commission observed that it appeared from \u015eahap Yaral\u0131's account that one helicopter, with General Ayd\u0131n on board, had landed at the commando unit compound early in the morning and also that the commando unit's single helicopter had been sent to Kulp early on in the day. Although there had, therefore, been helicopters flying over Lice at an early stage, the helicopters used to transport the wounded and the armed Cobra helicopters did not arrive until later. The Government denied that any orders had been given to the helicopter forces prior to the events. However, they failed to comply with the Commission's request to submit the operational orders for these forces.

The Commission was struck by the apparent lack of communication and coordination between the police and gendarmerie which the oral testimony of Mr \u00d6ztan in particular brought to the fore: even after the events, this official, who was in charge of the local police force, appeared to be in the dark about many aspects of what had transpired on 22 October 1993.",

Yet those inhabitants of the Kal\u0131 neighbourhood who appeared before the Delegates and who had been in Lice on 22 and 23 October were adamant that their houses had still been intact at daybreak of that last day. In this respect the Commission found significant the assumption expressed by the police chief constable Mustafa \u00d6ztan that the people of Lice would have slept in their own homes in the night of 22 October or perhaps, because they were scared, in the house of a neighbour or of relatives. He appeared to discount the fact that if more than 400 houses had been destroyed in the course of that day it would have been impossible for people to stay in their own homes or those of most of their neighbours and relatives. This also led the Commission to make the observation that in all likelihood there would have been many more casualties and injured if all of the more than 400 houses that ended up damaged or destroyed had caught fire on 22 October since this implied that a very large number of people would have been out in the open, looking for shelter, perhaps attempting to put out the fires, amidst the heavy gunfire of that day. The testimonies of the afore-mentioned applicants and witnesses before the Delegates, on the contrary, contained convincing accounts of how they had spent the night of 22 October sheltering from gunfire rather than fire. At no stage had this evidence been disputed or any kind of suggestion made as to where these people would have spent the night if they were not where they said they were.",

Thus, on the basis of the evidence presented to it \u2013 but contrary to what the applicants claimed \u2013, the Commission found, for example, that it could not be excluded that there had been a terrorist presence in Lice on 22 October 1993. It follows already from this finding alone that the Government's position that no account was taken of evidence submitted by their officials does not stand up. The Court further does not hold with the premise which the Government appear to put forward, namely that where part of an applicant's allegation is not found proved, the entirety of that applicant's claims is invalidated. There is even less room for the application of such a premise in the present case where the Commission's Delegates did not express any doubts as to the general trustworthiness and reliability of the applicants and their witnesses. On the contrary, the Delegates found the applicants Ayder, Doman, Bi\u00e7er, Ekmek\u00e7i and their witnesses convincing \u2013 even if the evidence of the more elderly witnesses was at times somewhat confused. The Commission considered that their accounts were detailed and on the whole consistent (see paragraph 54 above). The applicant Lalealp's oral evidence was described as somewhat confusing, but nevertheless frank and convincing. The Delegates considered that he was sincere in his testimony and adjudged him to be a credible witness (see paragraph 47 above). Police chief constable \u00d6ztan, on the other hand, was described as an evasive and rather reticent witness (see paragraph 35 above).",

In this connection, the Court notes that the Government submitted two judgments delivered by the Diyarbak\u0131r Administrative Court in which that court awarded compensation to inhabitants of Lice in respect of damage to property and the killing of a relative in the course of clashes between the PKK and the security forces. The Government also referred to other cases which concerned the award of compensation by the administrative courts to those who brought actions as a result of damage or injury they had suffered due to terrorist incidents. Undoubtedly these decisions illustrate the real possibility of obtaining compensation before these courts in respect of injuries or damage to property arising out of the disturbances or acts of terrorism.",

In his testimony to the Commission's Delegates, \u0130brahim \u015eahin, the then Provincial Governor of Diyarbak\u0131r, confirmed that a public assurance had been given to the people of Lice that all damage sustained would be compensated by the State (see paragraph 63 above). It is true that Mr Acar testified that the damage assessment reports prepared on his instructions were intended to serve as evidence in the event that claims were filed by the individual property owners with the administrative courts and that, as appears from the judgments submitted by the Government, certain property owners filed such claims and obtained some compensation for their loss. However, as Mr Acar also accepted, not all property owners had understood this, believing that they would receive compensation without the need to bring proceedings. While Mr Acar stated in evidence that he had usually attempted to explain that property owners had to apply to the administrative courts to recover compensation for their loss, it would appear that this was not generally understood.",

Furthermore, despite the fact that a number of Government witnesses told the Commission's Delegates that, not long after the incident, they had become aware of allegations that houses had been burned deliberately by security forces, no official investigation was commenced until notice of the present application was given to the Government. The Lice public prosecutor reached a decision of non-jurisdiction because the investigation concerned alleged wrongdoing on the part of civil servants, and the file was referred to the District Administrative Council (see paragraphs 60 and 88 above). The Court has already found in a number of cases that this body, made up of civil servants who are hierarchically dependent on the Governor \u2013 an executive officer linked to the security forces under investigation \u2013, cannot be regarded as independent (see G\u00fcle\u00e7 v.

Moreover, in the present case Yunus Nebio\u011flu, who had been appointed to investigate the applicants' allegations for the District Administrative Council, drew up his report on the matter after having obtained a statement from only one of the applicants, Zeydin Ekmek\u00e7i, and, despite Mr Ekmek\u00e7i maintaining his allegations, without hearing any members of the security forces (see paragraph 60 above).

For the sake of completeness, the Court notes that it appears from the oral evidence given to the Commission's Delegates by \u015eevket Bi\u00e7er and Zeydin Ekmek\u00e7i that neither of these applicants, nor Mr Ekmek\u00e7i's wife, were present in the Kal\u0131 neighbourhood in Lice when their houses were burned (see paragraphs 170175 and 185-187 of the Commission's report). In any event, whilst the Court is prepared to accept that the facts complained of have not only affected the applicants on a strictly individual basis, but also their immediate family, it is nevertheless not persuaded that separate awards for each member of those families are called for. The Court considers that awards made under this heading are intended to compensate the applicants' households as a whole. ",
