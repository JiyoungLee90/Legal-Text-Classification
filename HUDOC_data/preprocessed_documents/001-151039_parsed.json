Thereby he could challenge the findings of the final judgment and potentially have it set aside. However, according to the settled practice of the domestic courts the person concerned should, at the time of making a request for reopening, be immediately available to the authorities and able to appear in court. The exception to this rule, which was notably the most important new feature introduced by the 2008 Code of Criminal Procedure, was provided under Article 504 \u00a7 2 of that Code (see paragraph 39 above) allowing a convicted person to seek the reopening of proceedings even if he or she was not immediately available to the court. But this was applicable only if he or she could show the existence of new facts or evidence which could lead to acquittal or resentencing under a more lenient provision (Gara\u010di\u0107 2009, pp. 106-108).",

The first (see paragraph 39 above; Article 497 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) had meant giving himself up to the Croatian authorities before asking them to reopen the proceedings. In his view, it had not been clear on what evidence the domestic courts had based their conclusions that he would not appear in court for a retrial had they granted him one. The mere fact that he did not reside in Croatia could not arguably support such a conclusion. Thus the only possibility for him had been to trade his liberty for a request to reopen the proceedings, because had he come to Croatia and sought a retrial he would have been arrested and imprisoned based on his conviction in absentia, which had been the result of an unfair trial.",

In the applicant\u2019s view he had demonstrated such facts and evidence by putting forward the names of witnesses who had testified that he had not been present in Petrinja at the time of the events.

As regards the possibility for the applicant to seek the reopening of the proceedings, the Government pointed out that the fact that he had not been granted a retrial had been his sole responsibility. This was because he had decided to remain unavailable to the domestic courts and had not provided sufficient evidence which could call his conviction into question. The Government pointed out that in the Croatian legal system there were two legal avenues for seeking a retrial in the event of a conviction in absentia. The first, provided under Article 497 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was a special ground for reopening proceedings conducted in absentia, and the second was provided under the general provision allowing for the possibility of a retrial (Article 501 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).",

The Supreme Court had consistently interpreted the first condition to mean that the convicted person had to actually be present on the territory of Croatia. In the applicant\u2019s case, he had left Croatia and despite an arrest warrant and decision ordering his imprisonment he had never been apprehended. Moreover, there had been no possibility for the domestic authorities to secure his presence, as he had lived in Serbia and Serbia did not extradite its citizens, nor would it ever accept the execution of the applicant\u2019s sentence because he had been tried in absentia. Thus, it had been up to the applicant alone to make himself available to the domestic courts and request a retrial.

The only thing the applicant needed to do was to appear before the domestic authorities or demonstrate that he would appear at the trial.

This \u201cpossibility\u201d has been interpreted in the case-law of the domestic courts to mean that a person convicted in absentia must appear before the domestic authorities to request a retrial and provide an address of residence in Croatia during the criminal proceedings. Accordingly, a request for a retrial by a convicted person who is not under the jurisdiction of the Croatian authorities cannot lead to the reopening of the proceedings (see paragraphs\u00a023-24 and 42-46 above).",

For instance, when a person convicted in absentia who was living in Bosnia and Herzegovina requested a reopening of the proceedings and provided all the necessary details of his whereabouts and promised to come to every court hearing, the domestic courts rejected his request on the grounds that in any event he was not available to the Croatian judicial authorities and was out of their jurisdiction. Similarly, in another case, the Supreme Court held that a person who had requested a retrial should personally approach the court and provide his or her address in Croatia where he or she would be available during the criminal proceedings, but also allow the execution of the final conviction to the prison sentence, which could then be, under the conditions provided in the law, postponed, suspended or terminated (see paragraphs 44 and 46 above).",

Neither is it possible to ascertain what such guarantees should have been, given that the Government has not specified them. On the contrary, the Court observes that the Supreme Court, when examining the applicant\u2019s request for a retrial, outwardly rejected this possibility on the grounds that the applicant lived in Serbia and was not available to the Croatian judicial authorities, making no mention that any guarantees or promises could be accepted (see paragraph 33 above).",

Only then, once the reopening was granted, which according to the materials available before the Court could even take more than a month (see paragraphs 23, 24 and 45 above), and once such a decision became final, would the enforcement of the sentence be stayed and, if there were no other grounds warranting pre-trial detention, the person concerned released pending trial (see paragraph 39 above; Article 507 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).",

In any case, such a possibility is discretionary as the relevant domestic law provides no possibility for the convicted person to request its application and, in case of an unfavourable outcome, to have an opportunity to appeal (compare Khalfaoui v. France, no. 34791/97, \u00a7 453, ECHR 1999IX). Moreover, the materials available to the Court do not show that any such consideration was given in the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraphs 23-24 above; and Khalfaoui, cited above, \u00a7 53). Therefore, given that the Convention is designed to \u201cguarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective\u201d (see, for example, Erkapi\u0107 v. Croatia, no.\u00a051198/08, \u00a7 78, 25 April 2013) the Court cannot accept that such a possibility was sufficiently probable in practice.",

Thus, had the domestic courts accepted the applicant\u2019s request and ordered a retrial, it would have postponed the execution of the judgment (see paragraph 39 above; Article 507 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) but his conviction would not as such be affected.

Unlike the remedy under Article 497 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the use of this remedy does not require the physical presence of the convicted person. However, this remedy is applicable only to a restricted category of cases tried in absentia since the condition for its use is the existence of new evidence or facts capable of leading to acquittal or resentencing under a more lenient provision (see paragraph 39 above). It is thus of a secondary and subsidiary nature for those tried in absentia.",
