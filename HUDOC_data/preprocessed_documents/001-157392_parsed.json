In the immigration procedure, a country was qualified as a safe third country, in particular if the person concerned was not threatened by persecution, torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. By contrast, for a country to be a safe third country in an asylum procedure, it was to have, additionally, a proper asylum administration system in place. Therefore, when admitting their asylum applications into the \u201cin-merit\u201d phase, the asylum authority had applied a more restrictive definition \u2013 which did not necessarily mean that there was no safe third country from an immigration perspective.

Indeed, at that point in time the applicants had not yet requested asylum and were no more than illegal border-crossers without identity documents. For the Court, this phase of the applicants\u2019 detention discloses no appearance of any arbitrariness (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66).",

It notes that the applicants applied for asylum on 9\u00a0November 2011, formal asylum proceedings started on 10 November 2011, and the case was admitted to the \u201cin-merit\u201d phase on 12 December 2011. For the Court, the pending asylum case does not as such imply that the detention was no longer \u201cwith a view to deportation\u201d \u2013 since an eventual dismissal of the asylum applications could have opened the way to the execution of the deportation orders. The detention nevertheless had to be in compliance with the national law and free of arbitrariness.",

Moreover, none of these decisions dealt with the possibility of alternative measures or the impact of the on-going asylum procedure. The extension decision of 1\u00a0February 2012 was indeed the first one to state that the expulsion had been suspended due to the asylum application, but the court drew no inference from this fact as to the chances to enforce, at one point in time, the expulsion.",
