Noting that the said provision protects the interests of persons placed at the government\u2019s disposal by ensuring that they know in advance whether or not there will be a request for extension \u2013 thus enabling them to seek the assistance of counsel \u2013 the Regional Court concluded that in the instant case the interests of the applicant were not violated since he was notified on 19 May 1993 that the public prosecutor would lodge a request. In addition, the Regional Court concluded that in substance there had not been a failure to respect the statutory time-limit as the public prosecutor had prepared the request in time. In its view the request was only \u201cformally\u201d submitted too late. Finally, the Regional Court held that in the instant case the interests of the applicant had to be weighed against the harm to the general interest if his placement were to be terminated given that he still represented a risk to the public.",

In this regard, the Commission held that Article 509q presupposes that a request for an extension must be submitted prior to the expiry of the statutory period. Since the request of the public prosecutor was lodged more than two months after the expiry of the statutory period, the Commission concluded that in the circumstances of the instant case the applicant\u2019s detention between 3 July and 8 September 1993 was not lawful for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

In any case, special circumstances existed which justified a departure from the principle that the failure to lodge a request for the extension of a placement within the prescribed time-limit should result in the inadmissibility of the request.

Similarly, if the decision to extend the placement order is taken after the time-limit referred to in Article 509t \u00a7 1 of the CCP the placement order remains valid. It is only in certain circumstances that the State would be obliged to terminate a placement order after the expiry of the statutory period and without a decision on its extension having been taken (see paragraphs 31 and 32 above). The Court recalls in this regard that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see the Bouamar v. Belgium judgment of 29 February 1988, Series A no.\u00a0129, p. 21, \u00a7 49).
