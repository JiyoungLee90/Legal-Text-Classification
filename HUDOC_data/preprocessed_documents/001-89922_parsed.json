The first applicant had been granted victim status in April 2003, or in May 2004 (see paragraphs 43 and 94 above). The relevant military units had been identified in December 2003 (see paragraph 53 above). Information about the questioning of the military servicemen of the 51st airborne regiment involved in the detention was collected in February 2004 (see paragraph 56 above). These delays in themselves were liable to affect the investigation of a crime such as abduction in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in first days after the event. While accepting that some explanation for these delays can be found in the precarious security situation that prevailed in Chechnya at the relevant time, as illustrated by the shelling of the district prosecutor\u2019s office in December 2002, in the present case they clearly exceeded any acceptable limitations on efficiency that could be tolerated in dealing with such a serious crime.",

The Court finds incomprehensible the position of the military prosecutors\u2019 offices, who continued to bluntly deny the servicemen\u2019s involvement in the events. The investigation failed to identify and question any of the officers of the FSB and of the Ministry of Justice, mentioned in the official documents, and to carry out confrontations in order to resolve the inconsistencies between the FSB denial of any knowledge of Mr Akhmadov\u2019s detention and the submissions of the servicemen of the 51st regiment that he had been delivered to the field subdivision of the FSB.

They also referred to Sections 11 and 13 of the Suppression of Terrorism Act, which established legal grounds for the involvement of military servicemen in counter-terrorist operations and authorised them to carry out identity checks and detain persons in order to convey them to the local bodies of the Interior (Sections 11 and 13 of the Act).",

Although the prosecutors\u2019 offices on several occasions invoked Mr Akhmadov\u2019s alleged involvement with illegal armed groups as the reason of detention (see, for example, paragraphs 56 and 60 above), none of the existing criminal or administrative procedures has been activated in his case. His detention was not acknowledged, was not logged in any custody records and there exists no official trace of his subsequent whereabouts or fate. The Government\u2019s reference to the Suppression of Terrorism Act is far from being sufficient to explain why after detention he was delivered to the headquarters of a military unit, and not to the local department of the interior, as the Act stipulates, and the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it.
