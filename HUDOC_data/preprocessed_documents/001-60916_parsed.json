His psychological and physical health were affected, the symptoms being daily headaches, shaking and loss of concentration, and he had had to seek the help of the prison psychologist.

It further considered that its task was to examine the decision to prolong Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9\u2019s detention in the EBI, and not the regime pertaining in that institution as such. For that reason, the Appeals Board declined to rule on the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention.

According to Dr\u00a0C., Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 was suffering from a moderately serious (matig ernstig) depression with endogenous features, moderately serious panic attacks and a conditioned avoidance response. Although Mr Lors\u00e9 was not found to be suicidal, he was troubled by nightmares relating mainly to suicide. He was also irritable and suffered regular panic attacks. One of the reasons for this psychiatric condition was the fact that contact with his wife and children was seriously disrupted. He was incapable of working, either alone or with others, and his activity level was very much reduced. Dr C. expressed the opinion that there was a causal link between the outward symptoms of the depression as well as the psychiatric disorders he found and Mr Lors\u00e9\u2019s long period of detention in the EBI. These disorders were becoming more marked now that Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 had more opportunities to have contacts with other people following his transfer from the EBI. His isolation in the EBI meant that his complaints were less visible to the outside world and he was in a better position there to fight against them.

Generally speaking, they fall into three categories: prisoners believed to be members of criminal organisations; prisoners serving sentences for manslaughter or murder; and prisoners who have escaped from prison in the past either by taking staff hostage or by using firearms (and perhaps with help from outside). Arrangements for the detention of such prisoners need to be based first and foremost on systematic, fail-safe security arrangements, though a humane regime should then be provided within that context. The task of the EBI, like any other prison, is to execute custodial sentences without disruption. The restrictions imposed on prisoners should be no more than are necessary to deprive them of their liberty. What distinguishes the EBI from other prisons is the nature of the restrictions required to achieve that purpose. They must be more severe because the prisoners present, by definition, an above-average risk of escape or disruption of the normal prison regime. In practice, this means that the purpose of the (T)EBI and EBI is to create a place and regime from which it is impossible to escape, even by taking staff hostage.",

The range of activities on offer gives prisoners regular opportunities for human contact and the staff of the EBI deliberately strive to encourage such contact and participation in activities wherever possible. The small size of the unit\u2019s population (paragraph 67) is essential to the maintenance of order, security and control and to the prevention of escapes.

On 17 April 2000 a report entitled \u201cCare in and around the Maximum Security Prison\u201d (Zorg in en om de Extra Beveiligde Inrichting) was issued by the researchers. It concluded that the concern expressed in policy documents for the mental well-being of detainees held in maximum security conditions was indeed evident in the day-to-day running of the EBI in that EBI personnel proved aware of the tension between security and humanity, and endeavoured to reduce this tension. It was further concluded in the report that a study of the psychological impact of a high security regime was feasible.

In this connection the Court emphasises that, although public order considerations may lead states to introduce high security prisons for particular categories of detainees, Article 3 nevertheless requires those states to ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 92-94).",

However, as it did in the cases against Italy referred to in paragraph 64 above, the Court cannot find that Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 was subjected either to sensory isolation or to total social isolation. As a matter of fact, the Italian special regime was significantly more restrictive both as regards association with other prisoners and as regards visits: association with other prisoners was entirely prohibited and only family members were allowed to visit, once a month and for one hour (see Messina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a013).",

Although Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 denied that he harboured any such intentions, it is not for the Court to examine the validity of the assessment carried out by the domestic authorities. In view of the very serious offences of which Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 was convicted (see paragraph 11 above), the Court accepts the assessment made by the domestic authorities. ",

Two of the reports submitted were drawn up during Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9\u2019s stay in the EBI, while the other two were compiled shortly after his transfer from the EBI. The first two reports, prepared by Mr\u00a0V. and Dr S. respectively, leave no doubt that Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 had difficulties coping with his stay in the EBI and that it had adverse consequences for his functioning, increasingly so as time went on (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). Dr C., who examined Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 two months after his transfer from the EBI, found that he was suffering from a \u201cmoderately serious depression with endogenous features\u201d and a \u201cmoderately serious panic disorder\u201d. In his opinion, there was a causal link between Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9\u2019s complaints and the psychiatric disorders found by him and Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9\u2019s long stay in the EBI (see paragraph 27 above). However, Dr\u00a0S., who examined Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 during the latter\u2019s stay in the EBI, found insufficient indications to conclude that he was suffering from a depression (see paragraph 26 above), and when Dr D. examined him some five months after his transfer from the EBI, Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 did not display any symptoms of a disturbance of a depressive nature. Dr D. thus replied in the negative to the question put by the Government as to whether Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 was indeed suffering from a \u201cmoderately serious depression\u201d as reported by Dr\u00a0C. She concluded in addition that the adjustment disorder which had affected Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 following his transfer from the EBI had gone into remission by the time of her examination (see paragraph 28 above).

As noted above (paragraph 67), it is not for the Court to assess the accuracy of this contention, but it does accept that the authorities were entitled to consider that an escape by Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 would have posed a serious risk to society. To this extent, the present case is thus different from the cases against Italy to which reference is made above (paragraph 64): in those cases, the particular security features of the special regime had been designed in order to cut all links between the prisoners concerned and the criminal environment to which they had belonged. In the present case, the security measures were established in order to prevent escapes. The Court considers that the particular features of the Italian special regime and those of the EBI regime effectively illustrate this difference. Thus, in the Italian special regime more emphasis was placed on restricting contacts with other prisoners and with family members than in the EBI regime, whereas in the EBI, security is concentrated on those occasions when, and places where, the prisoner concerned might obtain or keep objects which could be used in an attempt at escape or where he might obtain or exchange information relating to such an attempt. Within these constraints, Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 was able to receive visitors for one hour every week and to have contact, and take part in group activities, with other EBI inmates, albeit a limited number. Although strict security measures were in place, Mr\u00a0Lors\u00e9 and the other applicants were thus nevertheless able to maintain regular contact.",
