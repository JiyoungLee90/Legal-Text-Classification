However, once a\u00a0criminal complaint is lodged, the law enforcement authorities in  are under a\u00a0duty to follow it through. The making of a civil-party claim for damages in criminal proceedings constitutes an obstacle to the lodging of the same claim in the civil courts and has further legal consequences, for example, in respect of statute of limitations. Therefore, the determination of a criminal complaint to which a civil-party claim for damages was joined has direct consequences on the claim for damages (see, for example, Werner v. Austria, judgment of 24 November 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII, p. 2507, \u00a7 34). In view of the above, the Court finds that, as a\u00a0matter of principle, civil-party claims for damages made in Slovakia jointly with or subsequently to the lodging of a criminal complaint enjoy the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention from the moment they are made (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, Torri v.
