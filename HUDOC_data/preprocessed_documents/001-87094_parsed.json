Spain, judgment of 19\u00a0December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VIII, p.\u00a02955, \u00a7 31, and the Edificaciones March Gallego S.A. v.

Further, the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access is one aspect, is not absolute; it is subject to limitations permitted by implication, in particular where the conditions of admissibility of an appeal are concerned, since by its very nature it calls for regulation by the State, which enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in this regard. However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce a person\u2019s access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired; lastly, such limitations will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if they do not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued (see, among other authorities, the Edificaciones March Gallego S.A., judgment cited above, p. 290, \u00a7 34).",

Furthermore, the Court observes that the only evidence required to be adduced after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 21 October 1999 was information about the market value of sheep. The first-instance court did not manage to obtain that information from the Inspectorate, despite three requests to that effect (see paragraph 13 above). The Inspectorate\u2019s failure to provide that information had already caused a procedural delay (see paragraph 9 above). That and delays caused by the defendants\u2019 failure to attend seven hearings and the failure to summon witnesses properly (see paragraph 46 above) can only be attributed to the State.",
