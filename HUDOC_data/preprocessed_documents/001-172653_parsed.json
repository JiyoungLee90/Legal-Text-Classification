It stated, however, that the effectiveness of such a remedy may depend on whether it has a significant effect on the length of the proceedings as a whole (see Holzinger, cited above, \u00a7 22). Thus, where proceedings include a substantial period during which the applicant has no remedy to expedite them at his or her disposal, a request under section 91 cannot be considered an effective remedy (see, mutatis mutandis, Holzinger (no. 2) v. Austria, no.\u00a028898/95, \u00a7 21-22, ECHR 2001-I).",

After that, the applicant contributed to the length by causing procedural interruptions by his legal submissions and the complexity of the case required obtaining an expert opinion. As the applicant adduced grounds of bias in relation to the first expert when she had already terminated her report (see paragraphs 25 \u00a0and\u00a026 above), he had significantly contributed to the delays in this part of the proceedings.

Major delays occurred in relation to the appointment of an expert. Indeed, upon the applicant\u2019s objections two experts had to be replaced because of actual bias (see paragraph 25 and 27 above); a further expert was eventually discharged because he had failed to meet the time-limit assigned to him (see paragraph 29-30 above). Even assuming that the difficulties in finding an impartial and efficient expert could not be entirely attributed to the domestic authorities, the Court considers excessive an overall delay of almost five years and seven months to accomplish this task (from 6 October 2008 until 5 May 2014 \u2013 see paragraphs 21-30 above).",

However, as several of his claims had been successful (see paragraphs 17, 25, 27 and 29 above), it does not appear that the applicant had abused his rights or deliberately caused the proceedings to be protracted. Quite the opposite, the domestic courts held on 26 December 2013 that the applicant\u2019s rights had been violated because the prosecutor\u2019s office had not adequately reacted to the exceeding of the time-limit by the expert (see paragraph 29 above).",
