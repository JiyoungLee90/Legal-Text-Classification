The witnesses stated that the intruders had acted in a manner similar to that of a security operation \u2013 they had checked Lema Khakiyev\u2019s identity documents and had spoken Russian among themselves and to the applicants. The applicants\u2019 neighbours also indicated that the men had then gone towards the building of the district military commander\u2019s office, and referred to the use of military vehicles, which would not have been available to illegal paramilitaries (see paragraph\u00a019 above). Lema Khakiyev had recognised the abductors as ROVD officials and told the third applicant to look for him at the ROVD (see paragraph 17 above). In their applications to the authorities the applicants consistently maintained that Lema Khakiyev had been detained by unknown servicemen further to the accusations by the head of the district administration, Mr E.B., and requested the investigation to look into that possibility. The domestic investigating authorities accepted factual assumptions as submitted by the applicants and took steps to check whether law-enforcement agencies and Mr E.B. had been involved in the kidnapping. Moreover, they obtained proof that a special operation had taken place in  on the night in question and identified the military unit which had carried it out (see paragraph 123 above). However, it does not appear that any serious steps were taken to follow up this lead and to identify and question the persons involved.",

The investigation had failed to identify and question a substantial number of witnesses, including eyewitnesses to Lema Khakiyev\u2019s abduction, servicemen who might have participated in special operations conducted in Grozny at the material time, and officers assigned to the ROVD, the district military commander\u2019s office and the district FSB department, despite the supervising investigator\u2019s request to that effect (see paragraph 106 above). The applicants also emphasised that the transcripts submitted by the Government revealed the superficial nature of the questioning. Lastly, the applicants argued that the investigation had been adjourned and reopened a number of times and thus the taking of the most basic steps had been protracted, and that the applicants had not been informed properly of the most important investigative steps.

The investigation was opened on 24 August 2002, three days after the detention occurred. Prior to that decision the investigator inspected the scene of the crime and questioned the third applicant. However, it appears that afterwards, a number of crucial steps were delayed. In particular, the first applicant was questioned on 10 September 2002 and granted victim status only on 9 October 2002. The head of the district administration, whom the applicants suspected of involvement in the crime, was first questioned in October 2002. Testimony from Mr A.I., the officer of the district administration who had alleged that Lema Khakiyev had been detained on the premises of the Chechnya FSB, was not obtained until February 2005. The relatives of Mr R.Z., who had allegedly seen Lema Khakiyev in the remand prison in Pyatigorsk in 2003, were questioned in March 2009. Furthermore, it does not appear that any requests for information about Lema Khakiyev\u2019s possible whereabouts were sent prior to 25 September 2002, over a month after the disappearance. It is obvious that these measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, as soon as the investigation commenced. These delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2004XII).",

The Government argued that the first six applicants could have sought judicial review of the decisions of the investigating authorities in the context of the exhaustion of domestic remedies. However, the Court notes that the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in its early stages by the authorities\u2019 failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures. The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant measures were taken to identify those responsible for the kidnapping. Nor were the applicants properly informed of the progress of the proceedings. Furthermore, the investigation was resumed by the prosecuting authorities themselves a number of times owing to the need to take additional investigative steps. However, they still failed to investigate the applicants\u2019 allegations properly. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

Furthermore, they pointed out that the investigation had failed to take a number of important steps: to locate and question Mr Nikolenko, who had confirmed that Musa Temergeriyev had been brought to the grounds of the military unit (see paragraph 151 above), and the servicemen of the military unit who could have detained him; to establish the provenance of the two APCs used by the abductors; and to check whether the cartridges found on the crime scene had been registered in the federal database and ascertain which military unit could have used them. The applicants further submitted that they had not been informed properly of the most important investigative steps. In particular, they had been unaware of the questioning of the witnesses and had had no access to their statements.

Nor does it appear that any steps were taken to resolve the glaring inconsistency between the numerous statements and reports about the taking of Musa Temergeriyev to the premises of the criminal police department in Khankala and that department\u2019s commander\u2019s denial of his detention there (see paragraph 131 above).",

However, the investigation was opened only on 13 January 2003, that is, more than two weeks later. At the same time it is striking that the machine gun cartridges collected at the crime scene on 27 December 2002 were checked against the federal database only in July 2008 (see paragraph 158 above), despite the fact that as early as April 2003 the ballistic expert evaluation had concluded that their individual characteristics made it possible to identify the weapon used (see paragraph\u00a0157 above). Servicemen deployed on the grounds of the military base where Musa Temergeriyev had been taken after his detention were questioned in May 2007. It also does not appear that any requests for information about Musa Temergeriyev\u2019s possible whereabouts were sent prior to February 2003.",
