The applicant filed his request for a building permit on 21 April 1999 and his request for an exemption permit on 22 July 1999. However, the relevant period for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 started only on 20 September 2000, when the applicant filed an appeal against the refusal to grant him an exemption permit since it was at that moment that a serious and genuine dispute about the existence and scope in domestic law of a right asserted by the applicant first arose (see, mutatis mutandis, Wiesinger v. Austria, judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 213, p. 20, \u00a7 51, and Kolb and Others v. Austria, nos. 35021/97 and 45774/99, \u00a7 49, 17 April 2003). In this regard, the Court notes that the proceedings concerning the applicant's request for a building permit did not, in themselves, involve a determination of the applicant's civil rights within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as the relevant area zoning plan did not grant the applicant a right to build on the land concerned or to have the designation of that land changed (see, mutatis mutandis, Enzi v. Austria (dec.), no. 29268/95, 8\u00a0February 2000, with further references).",
