They were placed in an increased security cell, but were free to visit common areas. On 6 September 2003 they allegedly went to a meeting in a common area organised by another detainee. The meeting ended with a fight, as a result of which the applicants were again severely beaten by other detainees. The applicants claim that the security personnel disappeared for about 30 minutes during the event. They were again taken to hospital with serious injuries, and later transferred to another prison. According to the applicants, no serious investigation into these two assaults has taken place and none of the attackers has been identified and punished. According to the Government, three organisers of the meeting were identified and a criminal investigation was opened into the event. The applicants never complained about either of the attacks and refused to make statements to the administration against the detainees who had attacked them. The various investigations opened into the events of April and September 2003 ended on 12 May, 15 October and 10 December 2003 respectively, finding that the applicants had refused to avail themselves of additional measures of protection offered to them by the prison administration, fearing that such measures would diminish their reputation in the criminal world. The administration of the two prisons in which the attacks had taken place took measures to reinforce security, in order to minimise the risk of similar acts in the future.",

As a result, they were transferred to prison no. 29/4 and there was no reason to suppose that they risked any attack there (see paragraph 29 above). After the first attack, the authorities were alert to a possible continued threat and they placed the applicants in a separate cell in prison no. 29/15, warning them against meetings with other detainees in the common areas. The Court considers that these were reasonable steps to protect the applicants against possible danger, while preserving their right to contact with other detainees. There is no evidence in the file to support the applicants\u2019 contention that the security personnel had left open any barrier to facilitate an attack. Moreover, it appears that in each case the attackers were inmates detained together with the applicants, and that there was therefore no physical barrier to reaching the applicants in the common areas.",

The Government relied on these findings by the courts. The Court considers, however, that the domestic courts\u2019 analysis, made approximately two years after the events complained of, and limited to examining the documents in the file, could not remedy in any manner the failure to carry out a thorough investigation immediately after the events.",
