Thereafter, there was little, if any, progress in the handling of the case until the applicant was released on 4 October 2000. The Court agrees that the case was not a minor one, involving several accused and many counts of burglary. A number of victims and witnesses had to be heard. However, the authorities failed to hold hearings in the City Court for a considerable period of time. Having regard to the numerous occasions on which the trial hearing was adjourned while the applicant was kept in detention (from February 1999 to October 2000, the hearings were adjourned for various reasons \u2013 absence of victims, witnesses, defence counsel or co-defendants \u2013 on eight occasions) the Court is unable to conclude that the authorities met the \u201cspecial diligence\u201d requirement.",
