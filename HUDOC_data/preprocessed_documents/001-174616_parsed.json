The court partly annulled the Bar Association\u2019s decision and ordered the latter to reconsider the applicant\u2019s request to be readmitted to the Bar. The court noted that the applicant had been convicted of a minor intentional crime. On the day when the applicant had submitted the request to be readmitted to the Bar, her conviction had expired. Consequently, and relying on Article 8 (1) of the Law on the Bar (see paragraph 21 below), the Vilnius Regional Court found that the Bar Association had erred in finding that the applicant had not met the high-moral-character criterion.",

As to the question of high moral character, the Court of Appeal underlined that higher standards were applicable to advocates, as only persons of untainted reputation could participate in the justice system without discrediting it. Therefore, when evaluating an advocate\u2019s conduct it was not sufficient to have regard only to whether the person obeyed the law. It was also pertinent to see a person\u2019s behaviour in the context of the legal norms that regulate the ethics of the advocates\u2019 profession. In this connection the Lithuanian Code of Professional Ethics for Advocates underlined that an advocate should observe legal and moral duties (point 1.2.), should not discredit advocate\u2019s name, the oath he or she swore or the ideal of justice (point 1.3.). An advocate also had duties set out in the Constitution, the Law on the Bar and the Lithuanian Code of Professional Ethics for Advocates (point 2.2) (see paragraph 23 below).",

Nonetheless, taking into account the fact that she had committed the criminal offence in the course of her professional practice and that her professional practice had been aimed at committing crimes, of which there were more than thirty counts, it was reasonable to conclude that the applicant\u2019s behaviour did not meet the criteria set out in Article 8 (4) of the Law on the Bar. That the conviction had expired did not mean ipso facto that the applicant had regained an irreproachable reputation within the meaning of Article 8 (4) of that Law.

A person who claimed to have regained high moral character should bring clear and persuasive evidence that he or she had been following the ethical and disciplinary rules. It was then for the court to examine what the nature of the infringements of law was, what personal situation had led to the infringements being committed, and whether those factors still applied. In the present case, despite four years having passed since the date the crime had been committed, there was still no sufficient basis to conclude that the applicant was of high moral character within the meaning of Article 8 (4) of the Law on the Bar.",

Belgium, 7 August 1996, \u00a7\u00a025, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III). Although no general right to employment can be derived from Article 8, the Court has previously had occasion to address the question of the applicability of Article 8 to the sphere of employment (see Trava\u0161 v. Croatia, no. 75581/13, \u00a7 52, 4 October 2016). It is, after all, in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant opportunity to develop relationships with the outside world (see Mateescu v. Romania, no.\u00a01944/10, \u00a7 20, 14 January 2014). It would be too restrictive to limit the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d to an \u201cinner circle\u201d in which the individual may live his or her own personal life as he or she chooses and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle (see Niemietz v.\u00a0Germany, 16\u00a0December\u00a01992, \u00a7\u00a029, Series A no.\u00a0251-B, and Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez v.\u00a0Spain [GC], no. 56030/07, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2014 (extracts)).",

Prior conviction had an inevitable impact on the person\u2019s ability to meet such requirements. Sometimes, a criminal conviction could have a permanent impact and a person might never be considered as being of the required high moral character. To the Government\u2019s knowledge, such was the legal regulation as established in Latvia, Estonia and Turkey; in Poland, disbarment might be permanent following disciplinary proceedings. In other countries, presumption of the lack of high moral character might be valid for up to ten years (the Government referred to Belgium, Croatia and Portugal). There was also a common practice that the expiry of the conviction did not automatically mean that a person could not be reproached from a professional-ethics point of view. Usually the question of regaining one\u2019s good name was left to the discretion of certain authorities, which also took into account the gravity of the offence and whether it had been committed while performing a professional activity (the Government referred to practice in France, Austria, Slovenia and the Czech Republic).",

Furthermore, the principles applicable to lawyer\u2019s profession contain such values as the dignity and honour of the legal profession, the integrity and good standing of the individual lawyer, respect towards professional colleagues, as well as respect for the fair administration of justice (see paragraph 32 above). Before being accepted to the Bar for the first time, the applicant swore an oath to observe the laws and to honestly perform her duties as an advocate (see paragraph 6 above), but later committed a grave breach of these duties. It is true that because of the size of the criminal sanction the offences for which the applicant was convicted were not categorised as serious crimes, and the applicant was let off with a fine (see paragraph 8 above). That notwithstanding, it is not unreasonable to hold that the applicant\u2019s behaviour when systematically cheating the court system and the State out of sums of money also showed her disrespect for her colleagues and peers, thus undermining the entire ideal of justice. The Court therefore inclines to the view that the reasons given by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court not to hold the applicant as being of high moral character (see paragraphs 14, 15 and 20 above) can be regarded as relevant in terms of the legitimate aims pursued.",

In this particular case the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court considered that insufficient time \u2013 four years \u2013 had passed since the applicant\u2019s conviction for forgery of documents and fraud (see paragraph 8 above). It is not for the Court to substitute its view of what would be the appropriate interval until the applicant could claim to have regained her good name.
