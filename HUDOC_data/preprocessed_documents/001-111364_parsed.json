Moreover, the order for his preventive detention had been made following the finding of the  on 24 July 2007 that he had been placed in a psychiatric hospital without ever having been of unsound mind. He had thus already been deprived of his liberty unlawfully for many years during his placement in a psychiatric clinic.

To render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9\u00a0February 1995, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 307A; Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, \u00a7 30, Series\u00a0A no. 317B; and Uttley, cited above). The wording of Article 7 paragraph 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 28; Jamil, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031; Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 142). The severity of the measure is not, however, in itself decisive, since, for instance, many non-penal measures of a preventive nature may have a substantial impact on the person concerned (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 32; compare also Van der Velden, cited above).",

In consequence, where the nature and purpose of a measure relates to the remission of a sentence or a change in a regime for early release, this does not form part of the \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of Article 7 (see, inter alia, Hogben v. the United Kingdom, no. 11653/85, Commission decision of 3 March 1986, DR 46, p. 231; Grava v.

The Court refers in this connection also to the findings of the  in its leading judgment of 4 May 2011 on preventive detention.

Germany (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 128-129). There is nothing to indicate that the applicant had been offered a higher level of care, including an individualised and intensified offer of therapy, than that generally offered to persons in preventive detention at that time.
