She considered that throughout the enforcement proceedings the bailiffs had failed to display due diligence in handling her calls for assistance. They had appeared unprepared to face the task and had had no clear idea or action plan as to what could and should be done. As a result, the children continued to live with their parental grandparents instead of either parent. The applicant submitted that she had been present for all the enforcement attempts of which she had been duly and properly notified, namely 23 March, 2 April and 16\u00a0April 2015, except for the enforcement planned for 14 April 2015. She had been absent on that date due to illness. She had not been informed of any other enforcement dates. The case file contains no evidence to the contrary. The applicant further deplored the bailiffs\u2019 conduct during the enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 21 above), the delay in transferring the enforcement file from the Republic of Ingushetiya back to Moscow pursuant to the District Court\u2019s decision of 8 April 2015, and the failure to properly notify her of the enforcement dates, which rendered the enforcement measures completely useless. The total amount of administrative fines imposed on R.M. for his failure to comply with the judgment of 25 June 2014 was too small to be capable of inducing him to comply with the bailiffs\u2019 demands. Besides, none of the fines had actually been recovered from him. Bailiffs from the Izmaylovskiy District Bailiffs\u2019 Service in Moscow should have exercised their right under section 33(10) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act to travel to Ingushetiya to facilitate enforcement of the judgment rather than sending requests for assistance to the Sunzhenskiy District Bailiffs\u2019 Service in the Republic of Ingushetiya, which was clearly biased against the applicant and not predisposed to enforcing the judgment in her favour. The latter allegation was supported by references to unlawful actions by the bailiffs of that Bailiffs\u2019 Service, as well as by the existence of a common phenomenon in cases concerning custody decisions from Chechnya and Ingushetiya.",

The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and cooperation of all concerned are always important ingredients. Whilst the national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such cooperation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited, since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, as should be, more particularly, the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see P.P. v. Poland, no.\u00a08677/03, \u00a7\u00a082, 8\u00a0January 2008; Hokkanen, cited above, \u00a7 53; and Ignaccolo-Zenide v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a031679/96, \u00a7\u00a096, ECHR 2000I). The adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent (see P.P. v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a083). Although coercive measures involving a child are not desirable in this sensitive area, the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the child lives (see IgnaccoloZenide, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0105-106).",

It appears, however, that no preparatory measures had been undertaken by the bailiffs to make the scheduled enforcement attempts practicable, especially given that the children had been living with their parental grandparents since January 2014.
