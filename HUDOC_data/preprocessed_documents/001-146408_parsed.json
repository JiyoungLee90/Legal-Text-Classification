In view of the fundamental nature of the right to life, the circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must be strictly construed (Nachova and Others v.

In line with the above-mentioned principle of strict proportionality inherent in Article\u00a02, the national legal framework regulating arrest operations must make recourse to firearms dependent on a careful assessment of the surrounding circumstances, and, in particular, on an evaluation of the nature of the offence committed by the fugitive and of the threat he or she posed (see\u00a0Nachova, cited above, \u00a7 96).",

The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. This investigation should be independent, accessible to the victim\u2019s family, carried out with reasonable promptness and expedition, effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances or otherwise unlawful, and afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results (see Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, \u00a7\u00a7 105-109, 4\u00a0May 2001, and Tahsin Acar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 222-224).

In this connection, the Court notes that this provision corresponds to Article 11 of Law no. 1918 (Law on the Prevention of Smuggling \u2013Kacakciligin men ve takibine dair kanun), which is now defunct. The Court would further underline the fact that it has already held that Article 11 of Law no.\u00a01918 fell short of the level of protection that is required \u201cby law\u201d of the right to life under the Convention (see Halis Ak\u0131n, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 31-33, and Beyazg\u00fcl v.

This new law gives a detailed description of when and how a law enforcement officer may use firearms when dealing with smugglers. Pursuant to Law no. 5607, firearms may only be used in self-defence when a suspect uses firearms.",

As a result, it cannot be said that the gendarme officers were provided with clear and detailed instructions as to when and how they should use firearms. Accordingly, the Court considers that there is an absence of a clear legal and regulatory framework defining the circumstances in which gendarme officers may have recourse to potentially lethal force. The regulation, as in force, permits the use of lethal force should the gendarme officers become suspicious that the persons concerned are involved in smuggling. Under these regulations, it is lawful to shoot anyone who does not surrender immediately in response to an oral warning and the firing of a warning shot in the air.",

It is also clear from the submissions of the gendarme officers that they were well-prepared for a confrontation with a terrorist group and that there were several officers at the checkpoint, all of whom were equipped with heavy machine guns and hand grenades. The Court considers that the regulation, which is still in force today, does not make use of firearms dependent on an assessment of the surrounding circumstances, and, most importantly, does not require an evaluation of the nature of the offence committed by the fugitive and of the threat he or she poses.",

While the local public prosecutor was immediately informed about the incident, he instructed the gendarmerie to search the vehicles and to collect relevant evidence. It is clear from the documents in the case-file that no investigating authority independent from the military, such as a prosecutor, went to the scene of incident. The Court observes that the scene of the incident and the vehicle in question were examined by gendarme officers from the same unit and that no independent expert was involved in the investigation for the purposes of providing a ballistic analysis or a reconstruction of the events, taking into account a possible malfunctioning of the brake system, as well as the road conditions. In this connection, the Court observes that this was all the more important, given that the applicant and his cousin repeatedly stated before the public prosecutor that they had been unable to stop because there was a problem with the braking system of the vehicle and that they had been driving down a steep hill at high speed. Furthermore, two witnesses had also confirmed that the applicant and his cousin had shouted from the window that they had been unable to stop. Moreover, according to the documents in the case-file, the public prosecutor did not attach any weight to that allegation and failed to examine the matter any further.",
