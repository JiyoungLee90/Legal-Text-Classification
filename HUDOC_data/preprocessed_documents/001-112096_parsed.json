Obliging legal persons, similarly as the natural ones, who owned property in good faith to return it to the original owners or their heirs would require further measures with a view to ensuring appropriate compensation for them. This is supported by the fact that the amendment excluded restitution in natura of real property only in respect of legal persons who did not use or administer State-owned property.
