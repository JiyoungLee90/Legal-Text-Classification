The case originated in an application (no. 17833/16) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Syrian national, Mr A.S. (“the applicant”), on 17 June 2016.
The applicant was represented by Ms D. Trenina and Ms E. Davidyan, lawyers practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his being returned to Syria would breach his rights, as guaranteed by Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, and that he had had no effective remedies in respect of these complaints, in breach of Article 13 of the Convention. The applicant also alleged that his detention in Russia had been in breach of Article 5 of the Convention.
On 17 June 2016 the Court decided to indicate to the Russian Government, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that the applicant should not be expelled to Syria for the duration of the proceedings before the Court. The applicant’s case was also granted priority (under Rule 41) and confidentiality (under Rule 33), and the applicant was granted anonymity (under Rule 47 § 4).
On 5 August 2016 the application was communicated to the Government.
On 6 December 2018 the Government were informed that the application would be examined by a Committee and that, if they so wish, they could submit their comments by 19 December 2018. No reply was received from the Government in this respect.
The applicant was born in 1987 and lived in Syria before he came to Russia in 2015.
The facts of the case may be summarised as follows.
On 23 March 2016 the applicant was arrested for violation of migration rules. On the same day the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Izhevsk (“the district court”) imposed an administrative fine on the applicant and ordered his administrative removal and detention until his removal.
On 5 April 2016 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya excluded the removal order from the administrative penalty imposed on him by the district court.
On 2 June 2016 the applicant was released.
On 3 June 2016 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya reopened the applicant’s case at the request of the migration official and sent it for re-examination to the district court.
On 16 June 2016 the district court reviewed the administrative removal order of 23 March 2016 and confirmed its validity. The applicant was detained on the same day. On 12 September 2016 the judgment of 16 June 2016 was upheld by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya. On 7 February 2017 the applicant filed a cassation appeal against these three decisions at the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
On 15 July, 7 November and 19 December 2016 and 27 January, 2 March and 10 April 2017 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Izhevsk allowed an application lodged by the bailiff for the postponement of the enforcement of the order of administrative removal by one month owing to the application of an interim measure by the Court on 17 June 2016. The district court granted the bailiff’s request having relied on Article 31.5 of the Code of Administrative Offences ((“the CAO”), see paragraph 21 below). In these proceedings the applicant’s lawyer also argued that there was a lack of grounds for the applicant’s detention and requested that the enforcement proceedings be terminated and that the applicant be released. However, the district court dismissed her arguments, having concluded that,
“the grounds for the applicant’s detention had already been established by the court in the removal proceedings and the discontinuation of the enforcement proceedings in the circumstances of [the applicant’s] case is not provided for by Article 31.7 of the CAO” (see paragraph 22 below).
All these decisions, except the one of 15 July 2016 (no appeal was brought), were upheld by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya.
On 17 May 2017 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation (“the Supreme Court”) examined the cassation appeal complaint of the applicant and reviewed the judgments issued in respect of his removal (see paragraph 13 above). The Supreme Court confirmed the judgments but discontinued the enforcement of administrative penalty in the form of the removal imposed on the applicant on 23 March 2016. The Supreme Court found that the applicant might be exposed to a risk of torture or ill-treatment in Syria in the event of his return there. On 2 June 2017 the applicant was released (after the decision entered into force).
On 11 May 2016 the applicant’s request for refugee status was dismissed. According to the applicant, he did not appeal against this decision because the migration authorities had convinced the applicant that “his application for temporary asylum would be granted”.
On 4 July 2016 the applicant’s request for temporary asylum was dismissed.
On 25 November 2016 a second request lodged by the applicant for temporary asylum was denied by the migration authorities and the applicant did not lodge a complaint against this refusal.
According to the information provided by the applicant’s lawyer on 9 November 2017, while the proceedings before the Court were ongoing, the applicant left Russia of his own volition on 2 August 2017 and had settled in Sweden.
The relevant domestic law and practice relating to the expulsion and detention of foreign nationals in Russia, refugee status, temporary asylum, and the situation of Syrian nationals in the country is summarised in the Court’s leading judgment in the case of L.M. and Others v. Russia, nos. 40081/14 and 2 others, §§ 61– 75, 15 October 2015, and in the follow up case of S.K. v. Russia, no. 52722/15, §§ 23-41, 14 February 2017.
Article 31.5 of the Code of Administrative Offences (“the CAO”) provides that when the enforcement of, inter alia, of the administrative penalty in the form of removal is not possible within the procedural timelimits, the courts may postpone the enforcement of a decision imposing an administrative penalty by one month.
Article 31.7 of the CAO provides that a court which has issued a decision imposing an administrative penalty discontinues the enforcement of that decision in a number of specific cases (such as, for instance, an amnesty act, the debtor’s death, a change of legislation, or the expiration of the procedural time-limits), or in the event of a delivery, in cases provided for by the CAO, of a decision to discontinue the execution of the decision imposing an administrative penalty (Article 31.7 § 6 of the CAO).
Article 218 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (“the CAP”) provides that a person may lodge a complaint before a court concerning an act or decision by any State or municipal authority or official if he considers that it has violated his rights and freedoms. The complaint may concern any decision, act or omission which has violated that person’s rights or freedoms, has impeded the exercise of rights or freedoms, or has imposed a duty or liability on him.
