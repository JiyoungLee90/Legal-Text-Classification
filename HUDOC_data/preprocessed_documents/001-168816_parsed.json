The Government observed that the applicant had not challenged the accuracy of the records drawn up following his interviews by the investigating judge; and moreover, he had been assisted by counsel during the interviews, so that he had been afforded the same guarantee as the one set forth in Article 116-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

The Court had found in that case (\u00a7\u00a7 61-63) and in Engel and Others v. the Netherlands (8 June 1976, \u00a7 72, Series A no. 22) and Shelley v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 23800/06, 4 January 2008) that this applied to the status of a prisoner serving a fixed-term sentence of fifteen years or more as opposed to a life sentence, and also to military rank and to the status of a detainee in general.

As to the justification based on the seriousness of the alleged offence, it was inadequate on two counts: firstly because, as the Court had held in G\u00e4fgen v. Germany ([GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 177, ECHR 2010) and other cases, it was in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial had to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies; and secondly, because some offences that were just as serious as the one of which he had been suspected (since they carried the same sentence) were not covered by the exception.

The latter, however, cannot be assessed in the abstract but only in the circumstances of a particular case. Since there were no any adverse consequences for the applicant and since the issue has been resolved by the domestic authorities, there are no compelling reasons to keep the Convention machinery further engaged with such a complaint, all the more so if the underlying idea of this admissibility criterion is to allow the Court, in view of its workload, to devote more time to cases warranting an examination on the merits and also to provide some degree of flexibility in addition to the other admissibility criteria (see paragraphs 77-78 of the Explanatory Report on Protocol No. 14).

First, a complaint that has been declared inadmissible under Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b) because the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage may be of such a nature that it might otherwise have resulted in a judgment on the merits or even have indicated \u201ca violation of a right [that was] real from a purely legal point of view\u201d (see Korolev v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 25551/05, ECHR 2010). In other words, Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b) is also applicable to \u201carguable claims\u201d. Second, the guarantee of an effective remedy under Article 13 exceeds the scope of the individual case. This Article is of central importance from the point of view of the Convention system, which is based on the premise that the alleged violations must be addressed and remedied at the domestic level (the principle of subsidiarity). Third, depending on the availability of remedies in the particular domestic legal system, the complaint may attain the minimum level of severity warranting its consideration by the Court. Therefore, a complaint concerning the availability of effective remedies must be addressed separately, irrespective of the application of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b) to another Article. These considerations will weigh more heavily when the safeguard clause \u201cduly considered by a domestic tribunal\u201d is removed, as envisaged by Protocol No. 15.",

The applicant had access to a court, and his complaint concerning the relevant aspect of a fair trial from the point of view of the Convention was duly assessed by the Court of Cassation. The effectiveness of a remedy under Article 13 does not depend on a favourable outcome for the applicant (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 157, ECHR 2000-XI).
