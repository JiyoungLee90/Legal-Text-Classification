In view of the usual time taken to deliver mail, however, it seems unlikely that a letter could reach its destination more quickly. Even supposing that it had been physically possible for the applicant to prepare her application and send it on the day after she received notification of the impugned decision, that is to say on 27\u00a0November 1993, there is no guarantee that the registry of the Aoiz Court of First Instance would have received it by 30 November 1993, the time-limit for registering it.",

Under the relevant domestic legislation (see paragraph 27 above), the decision in issue could not be regarded as foreseeable in the context of proceedings to enforce an agreement. The applicant also tried to lodge the application, within the time-limit, with the registry of the Madrid duty court; noticing, however, that the application should have been lodged at the Aoiz Court of First Instance, the head of the registry crossed out the stamp with which it had been marked, thereby invalidating it (see paragraph 18 above). She also applied unsuccessfully to the Aoiz Court of First Instance to set aside its decision of 13 December 1993 (see paragraph 20 above) whereby, in declaring the reposici\u00f3n application inadmissible as being out of time, it had barred any appeal to the Navarre Audiencia Provincial.
