Taking into account the applicants\u2019 explanations concerning their compliance with the six-month rule and their efforts to communicate with the authorities (see paragraphs 48, 49, 51 and 52 above), given the overall time frame for lodging their applications with the Court and having regard to the complexity of the cases and the nature of the alleged human rights violations at stake, the Court concludes that it was reasonable for the applicants to wait for developments that could have resolved crucial factual or legal issues (see El -Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2012). The Court notes that having no information on the progress of the proceedings, the applicants and/or their relatives either lodged requests for information or complained about the investigations in the hope of expediting the proceedings (see paragraphs 51 and 52 above). Further to their requests, the authorities resumed the dormant proceedings and took steps to obtain evidence (see paragraphs 46 and 54 above). The Court therefore considers that the breaks in the domestic investigations cannot be held against the applicants or interpreted as a failure on their part to comply with the sixmonth requirement by unreasonably waiting for the pending investigation to yield results (see, for a similar situation, Sultygov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0375-80).",

Bearing in mind the cases reviewed by the Court concerning abductions perpetrated by State servicemen at around the same time from the very same settlement (see paragraph\u00a07 above), the Court notes that the investigations in the present cases have been pending for many years without bringing about any significant developments as to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of the abducted men, except for that of Mr Adam Temersultanov, whose body was subsequently found (see paragraphs 14 and 35 above). While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that each set of criminal proceedings has been plagued by a combination of defects similar to those enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012325). They have been subjected to several decisions to suspend the investigation, followed by periods of inactivity, which have further diminished the prospects of solving the crimes.

From the documents submitted it transpires that his body had been discovered in five days after the abduction. In a number of cases the Court has already found that while there was no doubt that a similar situation had caused the applicants profound distress and anxiety, taking into account the short time frame between the abduction and the death, it did not raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see, for example, Udayeva and Yusupova v. Russia, no. 36542/05, \u00a7\u00a7 82-83, 21\u00a0December 2010; Inderbiyeva v. Russia, no. 56765/08, \u00a7\u00a7 110-11, 27\u00a0March 2012; and Kosumova v. Russia, no. 2527/09, \u00a7\u00a7 100-01, 16\u00a0October 2014).
