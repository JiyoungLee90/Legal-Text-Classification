As to the first argument, the Government stressed that the applicant had not complained to a court or any other State body of ineffective medical assistance. The procedure for making claims before a court was established in Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as clarified by the Supreme Court\u2019s Ruling no. 2 of 10 February 2009. Having relied on two cases examined by the Russian courts and the Court\u2019s findings in the case of Popov and Vorobyev v. Russia (no. 1606/02, 23 April 2009), they submitted that it had also been open to the applicant to lodge a tort action claiming compensation for damage caused by allegedly inadequate medical assistance. Relying on Resolution no. CM/ResDH(2010)35 adopted at the 1078th Meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, the Government further noted that statistics and a number of cases presented to the Committee had demonstrated the developing practice of the Russian courts in awarding compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by unsatisfactory conditions of detention. In the Government\u2019s opinion, the applicant\u2019s failure to apply to a Russian court or any \u201cother instance\u201d with a complaint had to be interpreted by the Court as his unwillingness to comply with the admissibility requirements set out by Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v.\u00a0Belgium, 6\u00a0November 1980, \u00a7\u00a035, Series A no.\u00a040).

Indeed, the special importance attached by the Convention to that provision requires, in the Court\u2019s view, that the States Parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to any such treatment rapidly.

Even though the prosecutors\u2019 review undeniably plays an important part in securing appropriate conditions of detention, including the proper standard of medical care for detainees, a complaint to the supervising prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy because of the procedural shortcomings that have been previously identified in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, for instance, Pavlenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a042371/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088-89, 1 April 2010, and Aleksandr Makarov v. , no. 15217/07, \u00a7 86, 12 March 2009, with further references).

Croatia, no.\u00a051585/99, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001-VIII, and Gibas v. Poland, no. 24559/94, Commission decision of 6 September 1995, Decisions and Reports 82, pp. 76 and 82). The Court accepts the assertion that detainees may send their complaints to a prosecutor. However, there is no legal requirement on the prosecutor to hear the complainant or ensure his or her effective participation in the ensuing proceedings, which would entirely be a matter between the supervising prosecutor and the supervised body. The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint. The Court reiterates that, in the absence of a specific procedure, the ability to appeal to various authorities cannot be regarded as an effective remedy because such appeals aim to urge the authorities to utilise their discretion and do not give the complainant a personal right to compel the State to exercise its supervisory powers (see Dimitrov v. , no. 47829/99, \u00a7 80, 23 September 2004). Moreover, the Court has already seen cases in which an applicant complained to a prosecutor but his complaint did not elicit any response (see Antropov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a022107/03, \u00a7\u00a055, 29 January 2009).

Russia, no.\u00a030251/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a081-85, 25\u00a0November 2010; Shilbergs v. , no. 20075/03, \u00a7\u00a7 71-79, 17\u00a0December 2009; Kokoshkina v.\u00a0Russia, no. 2052/08, \u00a7\u00a052, 28 May 2009; Aleksandr Makarov, cited above , \u00a7\u00a7\u00a077 and 87-89; Benediktov v. , no. 106/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a029 and 30, 10 May 2007; Burdov v.

However, in its assessment of the effectiveness of tort proceedings for cases of inadequate medical care of detainees, the Court considers the following considerations to be more important. To prove the existence of the selection and successful use of mechanisms of redress, the Government cited two cases in which claimants, former inmates, had been granted compensation for damage to health resulting from inadequate medical care in detention. Without embarking on an analysis of the relevance of the cases to the case at hand and deciding whether the two cases sufficiently demonstrate the existence of a developed, consistent and coherent practice of remedies being available for victims of Article 3 violations resulting from a lack of medical assistance or its poor quality, the Court reiterates that to be adequate, remedies for the implementation of accountability of a State should correspond to the kind and nature of the complaints addressed to it. Given the continuous nature of the violation alleged by the applicant, in particular his complaint of suffering from an extremely serious medical condition with a continuous deterioration of his health in the absence of appropriate medical treatment, the Court considers that an adequate remedy in such a situation should imply a properly functioning mechanism of monitoring the conduct of national authorities with a view to putting an end to the alleged violation of the applicant\u2019s rights and preventing the recurrence of such a violation in the future. Therefore, a purely compensatory remedial avenue would not suffice to satisfy the requirements of effectiveness and adequacy in a case of an alleged serious continuous violation of a Conventional right and should be replaced by another judicial mechanism performing both the preventive and compensatory functions.",

Being convinced that a preventive remedial measure would have had an evidently pivotal role in a case such as the applicant\u2019s, with his pleas of ongoing deterioration of his health in view of a lack of proper medical care, the Court finds that a tort claim was not able to provide the applicant with relief appropriate for his situation. The purely monetary compensation afforded by a tort action could not extinguish the consequences created by the alleged continuous situation of inadequate or insufficient medical services. A tort claim would not have entailed the ending or modification of the situation or conditions in which the applicant found himself. It would not have brought about an order to put an end to the alleged violation and to compel the detention authorities to offer the applicant the requisite level of medical care and it would not have provided for any sanction for failure to comply, thus depriving a court examining the tort claim of the opportunity to take practical steps to eliminate the applicant\u2019s further suffering or to deter wrongful behaviour on the part of the authorities. This logic has been applied in a large number of cases raising an arguable claim under Article 3, with the Court insisting that if the authorities could confine their reaction in such cases to the mere payment of compensation, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice. The State cannot escape its responsibility by purporting to erase a wrong by a mere grant of compensation in such cases (see, among many other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Krastanov v.

The Russian Government, however, did not submit any judicial decision showing that a complainant had been able to vindicate his or her rights by having recourse to this remedy. The Court, for its part, has not noted any examples of the successful use of this remedy in any of the conditions-of-detention or medical-assistance cases that have previously come before it. The absence of established judicial practice in this regard appears all the more clear in the light of the fact that the Code of Civil Procedure, including its Chapter 25, has been in force since 1 February 2003 and that Chapter 25 merely consolidated and reproduced the provisions concerning a substantially similar procedure that had been available under Law\u00a0no.\u00a048661 of 27 April 1993 on Judicial Complaints against Actions and Decisions which have Impaired Citizens\u2019 Rights and Freedoms. The remedy, which has not produced a substantial body of case-law or a plethora of successful claims in more than eighteen years of existence, leaves genuine doubts as to its practical effectiveness.

Without altering its previous findings concerning the ineffectiveness of the two mechanisms (see paragraphs 8286 and 87-91 above), the Court also does not consider it unreasonable that in a situation where the domestic courts had assessed, a number of times, the quality of medical assistance provided to the applicant in detention, he did not lodge a separate action or a complaint with the same courts following the formal procedures required by the Russian Civil Code or Code of Civil Procedure. In circumstances where the domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction had examined and dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaints, having found that the quality of the medical assistance afforded to him in detention had fully complied with domestic legal norms, the Court\u2019s conclusion that a tort action or a separate judicial complaint could not offer the applicant a reasonable prospect of success becomes even more salient (see Arutyunyan v. , no. 48977/09, \u00a7\u00a7 64-65, 10 January 2012; Guliyev v.

His history of tuberculosis infection was also noted by the detention facility\u2019s administration and he was considered in need of close medical supervision, regardless of his long-time clinical recovery from the latter infection. Despite the steady progression of the HIV infection with the disease having passed to clinical stage 3 towards the end of 2005 (see paragraph 15 above) and then to the stage 4 in the beginning of 2007 with a further rapid progression of the illness, a fact which was not included in the typed version of the applicant\u2019s medical records (see paragraph 18 above), the applicant did not receive any treatment in respect of his HIV infection. During all those years there was also no proper immunological assessment, involving specific testing, to determine when it was time to initiate antiretroviral therapy. It was not until 12 February 2009, that is more than five years after the authorities had learned about the applicant\u2019s illness and almost two years after the illness had reached its most severe clinical stage, that he commenced the therapy. This fact alone is sufficient for the Court to find that the authorities failed to comply with their responsibility to ensure the provision of adequate medical treatment to the applicant.",

The Court does not find the refusal surprising in a situation in which the applicant was receiving an intensive chemotherapy regimen of anti-tuberculosis treatment, a very aggressive medical procedure known for its numerous side effects of which the applicant did not cease to complain. His reluctance to add more strong drugs to his daily treatment regime is understandable. The Court also does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant completed the intensive phase of the tuberculosis treatment in October 2008. However, the medical personnel only repeated their proposal to initiate antiretroviral therapy in February 2009.",

It holds the authorities responsible for the relapse of the applicant\u2019s tuberculosis in 2008. The Court considers it open to criticism that a person with a compromised immune system, such as the applicant, could be detained, on more than one occasion, together with inmates suffering from an active form of tuberculosis (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). It is also concerned that the typed version of the applicant\u2019s medical records did not include those two instances of detention with smear-positive tuberculosis inmates. The Court further observes that the authorities\u2019 response to the possibility of the applicant\u2019s tuberculosis relapsing was erratic and unregulated. His medical records do not bear any evidence that the doctor\u2019s recommendations to initiate treatment to prevent a relapse of the infection or to perform specific testing to assess the applicant\u2019s condition were followed through. The applicant only started receiving anti-tuberculosis treatment in May 2008, almost a year after the first instance of his detention with an infected inmate and after an X-ray examination had disclosed that the illness had progressed to the advanced stage.\u00a0\u00a0The Court is of the view that the applicant having developed multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, as well as the disease having become active merely months after he had completed an intensive phase of his anti-tuberculosis treatment, are the major signs of inadequate management of the applicant\u2019s health by the Russian medical authorities.",

The evidence presented by the Government in support of the assertion that the applicant continued receiving treatment is unconvincing (see paragraph 30 above).",

The Court is mindful of the fact that neither the Government nor the domestic authorities, including the courts which examined the applicant\u2019s motions for release, explicitly named the \u201cspecialised\u201d facility to which the applicant should have been transferred. It appears that the sole reason for the transfer was the lack of reserve anti-tuberculosis drugs in the colony hospital. The applicant only started receiving them in the hospital at the end of November 2010. There is no reasonable explanation for such a lengthy delay between the discovery of the applicant\u2019s resistance to at least three major anti-tuberculosis drugs in the summer of 2009 and the introduction of the reserve anti-tuberculosis drugs into his treatment.",

In their assessment of the applicant\u2019s state of health they relied on a report prepared by a medical panel from the tuberculosis hospital in May 2011.

It is very difficult for a judge to substitute his or her own view for that of a professional doctor and to assess the effectiveness of medical assistance, especially in this case, because Mr Koryak suffered from tuberculosis long before his incarceration and also became an injecting heroin user (see paragraph 8). In some similar cases the Court has concluded that the domestic authorities afforded the applicants comprehensive, effective and transparent medical assistance (see, among recent cases, Schebetov v. Russia, no. 21731/02, 10 April 2012, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a076-77, and Valeriy Samoylov v. Russia, no. 57541/09, 24 January 2012, \u00a7\u00a7 92-93). What convinced us to find a violation of Article 3 in this case was the fact that regular medical supervision, including frequent medical check-ups and clinical testing, had led to the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s condition had been stabilised, and that was just weeks before his death...",

We do not find the national courts\u2019 reasoning (see paragraphs 39 and 41) persuasive and are of the view that the applicant\u2019s situation was similar to that of Mr Aleksanyan (see Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, 22 December 2008). We are mindful of the conclusions of some national courts that the deterioration of prisoners\u2019 health does not justify their release (see, for example, Sizov v. Russia, no.\u00a033123/08, 15 March 2011). The problem would therefore seem to be a systemic one.",
