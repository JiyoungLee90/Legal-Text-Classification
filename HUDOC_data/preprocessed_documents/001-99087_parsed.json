After waiting for a few minutes and making certain that the applicant was trying to steal hens, the officers, both of whom were armed with pistols loaded with live cartridges, intervened. They split up and approached the yard from different directions. When the applicant noticed them, he jumped the fence and started running through empty plots towards the nearby Roma neighbourhood. Despite several warnings, he did not stop. Then one of the officers drew his pistol and fired at him with the intention of stopping him. At that moment the applicant was at about four metres from the officer and turned sideways. After that he kept on running. The other officer continued the chase, fired twice in the air, and caught up with the applicant about sixty metres from the place where he had been shot. The officer recognised the applicant, noticed that he was intoxicated, and saw a small wound on his stomach, but allegedly did not realise that it had been caused by a bullet.",

Also, it cannot overlook the facts that the applicant suffered a serious and, albeit temporarily, lifethreatening injury (see paragraphs 8 and 11 above and contrast with Tzekov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 42), that both officers' pistols were loaded with live cartridges, that the injury was caused by a bullet fired from about four metres away (see paragraphs 7 and 16 above and contrast with Tzekov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 42), and that the bullet could easily have inflicted more serious damage. Nor can the Court fail to notice that when the officers took the applicant to the hospital, they did not mention to the doctor who took charge of him that they had used firearms against him (see paragraph 8 above). It appears that that fact, which no doubt contributed to the doctor's failing to realise that the applicant's wound had been caused by a firearm, significantly increased the risk to the applicant's life.",

Under that section, police officers could legitimately fire upon any person who did not stop after being warned, and a simple warning was apparently sufficient for the prosecuting authorities and the courts to find that the use of firearms had been \u201ca means of last resort\u201d within the section's meaning. The Court further noted that until 2003 the wording of section 80(1)(4) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act \u2013 in issue in the present case (see paragraphs 17, 18, 19, 20 and 22 above) \u2013 was identical (see Tzekov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 28, 29 and 54).",

However, the military court did not even mention that provision and the military prosecuting authorities construed it as allowing the police to use firearms to arrest a person suspected of theft (see paragraphs 18, 20 and 21 above).

Such a legal framework is fundamentally deficient and falls well short of the level of protection \u201cby law\u201d of the right to life that is required by the Convention in presentday democratic societies in Europe. As the Court explained in Nachova and Others, the legitimate aim of effecting a lawful arrest can only justify putting human life at risk in circumstances of absolute necessity; there is no such necessity where it is known that the person to be arrested poses no threat to life or limb and is not suspected of having committed a violent offence, even if a failure to use lethal force may result in the opportunity to arrest the fugitive being lost. The principle of strict proportionality inherent in Article 2 requires the national legal framework regulating arrest operations to make recourse to firearms dependent on a careful assessment of the surrounding circumstances, and, in particular, on an evaluation of the nature of the offence committed by the fugitive and of the threat he or she posed. Furthermore, the national law regulating policing operations must secure a system of adequate and effective safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse of force and even against avoidable accident. In particular, law enforcement agents must be trained to assess whether or not there is an absolute necessity to use firearms, not only on the basis of the letter of the relevant regulations, but also with due regard to the preeminence of respect for human life as a fundamental value (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 9497, with further references).",

However, it has never been alleged that they had reason to believe that the applicant had committed a violent offence, that he was dangerous, or that if not arrested he would represent a danger to them or third parties (compare with Juozaitien\u0117 and Bikul\u010dius v.

The Court does not overlook the fact that the applicant was wounded during an unplanned operation that gave rise to developments to which the police had to react without prior preparation, and understands that the authorities' obligations under Article 2 must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible burden on them (see Tzekov, cited above \u00a7 61, with further references). Nevertheless, it cannot accept that in the circumstances of the present case the police could reasonably have believed that that the applicant was dangerous and that they needed to use firearms to immobilise him. The Court considers that in those circumstances any resort to potentially deadly force was prohibited by Article 2, regardless of the risk that the applicant might escape.

Indeed, Article 12a of the Bulgarian Criminal Code, which calls for an assessment of the necessity of the use of force in arrest operations (see paragraph 24 above), seems to reflect similar concerns.",

They gave chase during the night and under reduced visibility, and recognised the applicant only after he had fallen to the ground (see paragraphs 6 and 7 above). It is true that later the authorities found that the proximity of the Roma neighbourhood had been one of the reasons why the officers had estimated that the applicant would be able to flee (see paragraph 17 above). However, even if in view of that it can be accepted that the officers were conscious of the applicant's ethnic origin, it is not possible to speculate on whether or not that had any bearing on their perception of the applicant and their decision to use firearms (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a015052). The use of firearms in the circumstances in issue was not prohibited under the relevant domestic regulations, a flagrant deficiency which the Court has already condemned (see paragraphs 4347 above). Therefore, the possibility that the two officers were simply adhering to those regulations and would have acted as they did in any similar context, regardless of the ethnicity of the person concerned, cannot be excluded (ibid., and, mutatis mutandis, Bekos and Koutropoulos v. Greece, no.\u00a015250/02, \u00a7 66 in limine, ECHR 2005XIII (extracts)). While their conduct calls for serious criticism, it is not of itself a sufficient basis for concluding that the use of lifethreatening force against the applicant was racially motivated (see, mutatis mutandis, Zelilof, cited above, \u00a7 75). Moreover, there is no indication, and it has not been alleged by the applicant, either before the domestic authorities or before the Court, that the officers uttered racial slurs at any point during the events in question (compare with Celniku, cited above, \u00a7 80 in fine, and contrast with Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 35 in fine and 153; with Osman v.

It is true that in the course of his interview on 12 March 1999 sergeant I.S. twice referred to the applicant as a \u201cgypsy\u201d (see paragraph 10 above). However, the Court is not persuaded that, given the context in which those remarks were made, they denoted racist bias and were sufficient to warrant the authorities to inquire into whether racial prejudice had motivated the officers' conduct (compare with Beganovi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 46423/06, \u00a7 96, 25 June 2009, and contrast with Karagiannopoulos v. Greece, no. 27850/03, \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 73 in fine, 21 June 2007, and with Stoica v. Romania, no. 42722/02, \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 128 in fine, 4 March 2008). The Court further notes that the authorities found that the proximity of the Roma neighbourhood had been one of the reasons why the officers had estimated that the applicant would be able to flee (see paragraph 17 above). However, given that those authorities' assessment of the officers' consequent decision to use firearms was based on a flawed legal framework which authorised the use of firearms to arrest any person seeking to evade arrest (see paragraphs 4347 and 52 above), the Court is not convinced that that element was capable of alerting them to the need to investigate racist attitudes. It appears that they regarded the proximity of that neighbourhood as a factor in the officers' appraisal of the applicant's ability to flee, and not as a thing which had in itself made them more prone to use firearms. Moreover, there is no indication that the applicant made allegations of racial bias at any point during the investigation (compare with Karagiannopoulos, \u00a7 78; Turan Cakir, \u00a7 80; Beganovi\u0107, \u00a7 97; and Sashov and Others, \u00a7 84, all cited above, and contrast with Bekos and Koutropoulos, cited above, \u00a7 72).",
