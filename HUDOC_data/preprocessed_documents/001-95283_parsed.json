However, it points out that conditions of detention of comparable and even of much shorter length have previously been found to be incompatible with the requirements of Article 3 (see Riad and Idiab, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0100-111, in which the applicants were kept in detention for fifteen and eleven days; Fedotov v. , no.\u00a05140/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a066-70, 25 October 2005, in which the applicant was detained for twenty-two hours with no food and water or access to a toilet; and also the several cases against Armenia, Kirakosyan, Mkhitaryan and Tadevosyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46-53, \u00a7\u00a7 51-59 and \u00a7\u00a7 51-59 respectively, in which the applicants were also detained for ten days during the same period and in the same detention facility as the applicant in the present case). Therefore, while the length of a detention period may be a relevant factor in assessing the gravity of suffering or humiliation caused to a detainee by the inadequate conditions of his detention (see, for example, Kalashnikov, cited above, \u00a7 102, and Dougoz, cited above, \u00a7 48), the relative brevity of such a period alone will not automatically exclude the treatment complained of from the scope of Article 3 if all other elements are sufficient to bring it within the scope of that provision.",

As regards the lawyers' fees, it considers that not all the legal costs claimed were necessarily and reasonably incurred, including some duplication in the work carried out by the foreign and the domestic lawyers, as set out in the relevant time sheets.
