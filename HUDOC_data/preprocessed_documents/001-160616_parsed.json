Some of them were attributable to the respondent\u2019s change of legal representation and to requests from his solicitors to extend time over various steps. Some delays were unavoidable, bearing in mind that the panel consisted of part-time members and dates had to be found when they could all attend and the witnesses were available. I conclude accordingly that the Commissioners did not delay unduly at any stage, notwithstanding the very long time that the proceedings took to reach a determination. I therefore would not favour making any declaration of breach of article 5(4) of the Convention.\u201d",

The finding whether or not the relevant decision was taken \u201cspeedily\u201d within the meaning of that provision depends on the particular features of the case. However, the Court has repeatedly stated that where an individual\u2019s personal liberty is at stake, it has very strict standards concerning the State\u2019s compliance with the requirement of speedy review of the lawfulness of detention (see, for example, Mamedova v.

In certain instances the complexity of medical \u2013 or other \u2013 issues involved in a determination of whether a person should be detained or released can be a factor which may be taken into account when assessing compliance with the Article 5 \u00a7 4 requirements, but that does not mean that the complexity of a given dossier absolves the national authorities from their essential obligation under this provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Baranowski v.

These elements may change with the course of time, and thus new issues of lawfulness arise requiring determination by a body satisfying the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4. Article 5 \u00a7 4 therefore requires that a mandatory life sentence prisoner should be able periodically to challenge the continuing legality of his detention in an appropriate procedure (see, for example, Stafford v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 87). It is not the Court\u2019s task to inquire into what would be the most appropriate system of review in the sphere under examination (see Shtukaturov v. Russia, no.\u00a044009/05, \u00a7 123, ECHR 2008).",

It has not, therefore, applied the same strict approach as can be seen in cases concerning detention pending trial, in which it has held that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of a period of detention as the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v. Poland, no. 27504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4 October 2001). Nevertheless, the domestic authorities are not dispensed from conducting reviews of the legality of the ongoing detention \u201cspeedily\u201d. That is especially so in a case such as the present, where the role of the review body was not simply to determine the current risk posed by the applicant (as is the case with all post-tariff prisoners), but also to assess the lawfulness of the decision to revoke his licence and recall him to prison.",

The Court also accepts that the applicant was himself responsible for certain periods of delay in the review process. For example, he dismissed his solicitors at the hearing on 17 June 2002, leading to delay while his new solicitors obtained legal aid (see paragraph 16 above); his new solicitors then asked the panel to recuse itself so that a new panel could conduct a full merits review of the recall decision, even though his former solicitor had requested a paper review (see\u00a0paragraph 15 above); and finally, according to the domestic courts he was engaging in a \u201ctactical manoeuvre\u201d which hindered the resolution of the issue concerning the attendance of the complainant as a witness (see paragraphs 19 \u2013 26 above).",

However, it is of some concern that, having for the first time heard evidence to the effect that the risk he posed was manageable in the community, the Rodgers panel had apparently not heard the remainder of the evidence by 11 June 2008, which is the date the House of Lords gave its decision in respect of the applicant\u2019s second judicial review application. Moreover, following the House of Lords\u2019 decision, which resulted in the disbanding of the first Rodgers panel and its replacement by the second Rodgers panel (which was composed of the same members), no hearing was listed until 7 October 2008, despite the fact that by this time the only live issue was whether the risk posed by the applicant was manageable in the community, and the panel was aware of the existence of evidence that the risk he posed had become manageable.
