Germany, 22 September 1993, \u00a7\u00a030 Series A no. 269). However, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7\u00a087, ECHR 1999V). Such an investigation, as under Article 2, should be capable of leading to the identification and, if appropriate, punishment of those responsible, and should reflect a serious effort on the part of the authorities to discover what really occurred (see Poltoratskiy v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a038812/97, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2003V). According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the investigation should be independent, impartial, prompt and subject to public scrutiny (see Bat\u0131 and Others v. Turkey, nos. 33097/96 and 57834/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0135-136, ECHR 2004IV (extracts)) and involve external authorities (see Poltoratskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0126). For an investigation to be considered effective, the authorities must, among other tasks, take reasonable steps to secure evidence concerning the incident, including a detailed statement concerning the allegations from the alleged victim, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, additional medical reports (see Bat\u0131 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0134).",

In particular, he complained to the prosecutor of police coercion while he was being questioned in the Central Prison, and raised complaints in relation to his state of health (see paragraphs - above). Even assuming that the applicant\u2019s statements as such might not be sufficient to trigger the application of measures prescribed by the Law on the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s allegations about his health would have at least prompted the prosecutor to consult the applicant\u2019s medical records drawn up at the Central Prison, which contained information about the applicant\u2019s injuries as well as the latter\u2019s statements that the injuries had been caused by police ill-treatment (see paragraph  above). It is very likely that the injuries the prison doctor recorded on 26\u00a0June\u00a01997 were still visible during the prosecutor\u2019s questioning four days later.

The Court notes in this respect that the decision of 25\u00a0June\u00a02001 did not indicate the authority to which an appeal against the decision should be submitted, whereas the procedure provided by the Law of Police suggests that the decisions were to be appealed against within the State police system, therefore raising reasonable doubts as to the effectiveness and independence of the review. Even disregarding this uncertainty, the Court emphasises that at the latest in 1998 the applicant attempted to bring to the authorities\u2019 attention his complaint of ill-treatment, and that therefore in these particular circumstances it would be unreasonable to expect that the applicant maintains confidence in these mechanisms, which would not provide a remedy for his grievances, especially taking into account the co-defendant\u2019s failed attempts to attain an investigation of his alleged ill-treatment (see paragraph 16 above) as well as the Court\u2019s findings in comparable situations (see paragraph 97 above).",

It also does not appear that the new investigation addressed the inconsistencies in the statements of the police officers. In particular, although the reports of 20\u00a0June\u00a01997 drawn up by police officer A.E. did not mention use of force, and stated that the applicant had no visible injuries, when questioned several years later A.E. admitted that force had been used. Despite the irreparable deficiencies in the investigation carried out in 2001 which, as admitted by the prosecutor\u2019s office, could not be supplemented with other evidence owing to the passage of time (see paragraph 41 above), there was no explicit recognition on the part of the supervising prosecutor that the allegations made by the applicant could not be properly investigated because of the ineffectiveness of the investigation carried out in 2001.

Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7\u00a028, ECHR 1999I). The Court\u2019s duty is limited to an assessment as to whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair, and involves an examination of the alleged \u201cunlawfulness\u201d (see Allan v. the United Kingdom, no. 48539/99, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2002IX). The Court has held that it is not required under Article 6 that the national courts should always prefer to rely on evidence given in open court, rather than other statements made by the same person in the course of criminal proceedings, not even when the two are in conflict (see, mutatis mutandis, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, \u00a7\u00a078, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II). Nevertheless, in order to examine whether as a result of improper coercion such internationally protected standards as the right to silence and the right against self-incrimination have not been infringed, the Court looks, in particular, at the nature and degree of the compulsion, the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures, and the use to which any such material is put (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7\u00a0101, ECHR 2006IX). Moreover, particular considerations apply in respect of the use in criminal proceedings of evidence obtained in breach of Article 3 for the use of such evidence, secured as a result of a violation of one of the core and absolute rights guaranteed by the Convention, always raises serious issues as to the fairness of the proceedings, even if the admission of such evidence was not decisive in securing a conviction (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0165-166, ECHR 2010).",

Latvia (dec.), no. 11682/03, 5\u00a0February\u00a02013; \u00a7\u00a7\u00a084-85) and that the defence could effectively pursue this plea by questioning witnesses for the prosecution and allowing a witness for the defence to be called (see paragraph\u00a030 above). Even though the national courts did not explicitly exclude from the criminal file the self-incriminatory statements obtained on 20\u00a0June\u00a01997, there are clear indications that both the R\u012bga Centre District Court as well as the R\u012bga Regional Court had weighed critically his statements given on the impugned date (see paragraph\u00a0 above). It could not be concluded from the national court\u2019s decisions that in finding the applicant\u2019s guilt the court had relied at all on the applicant\u2019s disputed self-incriminatory statements given on 20\u00a0June\u00a01997, whereas the lower court\u2019s decision, which was later upheld by the appellate court, relied explicitly on the applicant\u2019s self-incriminatory statement he gave to the prosecutor on 7\u00a0July\u00a01997, and confirmed on 20\u00a0August\u00a01997. However, observing that there is no evidence and the applicant did not allege that the statements given to the prosecutor were made under coercion, and that he did not contest their credibility before the domestic court, the Court cannot conclude that his protection against self-incrimination has been infringed.",

In particular, as admitted by the Government, the first delay of about a year was caused by the authorities\u2019 failure to schedule the first hearing (see paragraphs 18-19 above), whereas the returning of the criminal case to the Office of the Prosecutor (see paragraph 20 above) caused another delay of four months which was attributable to the authorities (see Bragadireanu v.\u00a0Romania, no. 22088/04, \u00a7\u00a0120, 6\u00a0December\u00a02007). A further delay of six months was caused by irregular scheduling of a hearing. The Court is of the opinion that a significant delay was caused by the dispute over the court\u2019s jurisdiction (see paragraph  above) and the Court reiterates in this respect that it is for the State to organise its judicial system in such a way as to enable its courts to comply with the requirements of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Estrikh v. Latvia, no. 73819/01, \u00a7\u00a0138, 18 January 2007). The Court also notes that the delay of four months in total was required by the applicant to enable him to pursue his defence rights, for which he could not be blamed (see, amongst others, Svetlana Orlova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4487/04, \u00a7\u00a046, 30 July 2009). Even though the delays of about eighteen months in total (see paragraphs 23-24 above) were not attributable to either of the parties, and the appellate courts adjudicated the criminal case rather speedily (see paragraphs 29-32 above), the Court considers that the delays attributable to the State authorities in the adjudication of the above criminal proceedings have rendered the length of the criminal proceedings unreasonable.",
