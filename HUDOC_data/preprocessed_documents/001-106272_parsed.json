It moreover considers that, in addition to the judicial review, the applicants cannot be required to have availed themselves of the procedure under section 20 of the Administrative Procedure Act. For the Court, it could not reasonably be expected that the common supervisory organ of the alien administration authority and the refugee authority would remedy a perceived omission of the latter, whereas a court decision had already upheld the conduct of the former. In any event, the Court considers that, by pursuing a judicial review, the applicants did afford the domestic authorities the opportunity of putting right the alleged violation of the Convention. It follows that the application cannot be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.

In any case, the ambiguous wording of section 55(3) entailed a discretionary administrative practice, inasmuch as the release of those asylum-seekers whose cases were admitted to the in-merit phase was, as a pattern, not initiated by the refugee authority. In their view, the expression \u201cat the initiative of the refugee authority\u201d must be interpreted as establishing an obligation on the refugee authority\u2019s side, otherwise there was inadmissible legal uncertainty in this field.

In fact, this provision was enacted to ensure compliance with Article 18 of Council Directive 2005/85/EC, that is to ensure that no asylum-seeker be held in detention for the sole reason that he or she was an applicant for asylum. The Government stressed that section\u00a055(3) was sufficiently precise for the purposes of lawfulness within the meaning of the Court\u2019s case-law and must be interpreted as creating a possibility for the refugee authority to initiate release if the asylum-seeker\u2019s case appeared well-founded, rather than an obligation automatically to initiate release in every case of in-merit examination.

They further add that the deprivation of liberty by virtue of the mere silence of an authority is a procedure verging on arbitrariness (see paragraph 24 of the judgment).

When a case of an asylum\u2013seeker reaches the in-merit stage, section 55(3) of the Asylum Act provides that the alien administration authority shall, at the initiative of the refugee authority, terminate the detention of the asylum-seeker. We would point out that the law does not provide for an unconditional legal obligation to liberate the asylum-seeker in all situations when his/her case reaches the merits stage. The fact that the refugee authority did not take the initiative is, in our view, not enough to render the continued detention arbitrary. It must be assumed that, under these circumstances, the continued detention is based on the same reasons as the original decision. There is nothing in the case file to suggest that the refugee authority in this case behaved differently compared to other similar cases. Furthermore, the continued detention of the applicants was subject to judicial review, in which the applicants\u2019 motion was rejected. Finally, we would add that the applicants were released when the maximum period of detention in asylum cases had expired (see section 54(4) c) of the Asylum Act and paragraph 9 of the judgment).",
