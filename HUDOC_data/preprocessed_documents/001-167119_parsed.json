The task of the Court is to ascertain whether the proceedings in issue, considered as a whole, were fair (see Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a0235B). An applicant claiming a violation of his right to obtain the attendance and examination of a defence witness should show that the examination of that person was necessary for the establishment of the truth and that the refusal to call that witness was prejudicial to his defence rights (see Guilloury v. France, no. 62236/00, \u00a7 55, 22 June 2006). Although it is normally for the national courts to assess the evidence before them, as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce, there might be exceptional circumstances which could prompt the Court to conclude that the failure to hear a person as a witness was incompatible with Article 6 (see Bricmont v. Belgium, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 89, Series A no. 158, and Destrehem v. France, no. 56651/00, \u00a7 41, 18 May 2004).",

It does not, however, appear from the circumstances of the case that the witnesses in question could have proved the applicant\u2019s innocence in any way: the only thing the applicant had been expecting from them was a confirmation that A. and Se. existed and that the applicant had been seen in their company at a time and at places having no relevance for the criminal offences incriminated to the applicant. The Court is therefore not persuaded that the failure of the domestic courts to hear the witnesses to whom the applicant referred was significant enough to compromise the outcome of the criminal proceedings (see and compare with Balitskiy v. Ukraine, no. 12793/03, \u00a7 45, 3 November 2011). Nor has the applicant shown that he could not duly challenge the statements of some witnesses, which had been made at the pre-trial stage or that that evidence was sole or decisive for his conviction.",
