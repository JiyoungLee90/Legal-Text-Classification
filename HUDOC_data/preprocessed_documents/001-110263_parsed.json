Russia, nos.\u00a057942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7 135, 24 February 2005). Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court, however, is not bound by the findings of domestic courts, although in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts (see Klaas v. Germany, judgment of 22 September 1993, Series A no. 269, pp. 17-18, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30, and Av\u015far v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7 283, ECHR 2001VII (extracts)). The Court considers that this reasoning applies also in the context of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Europapress Holding d.o.o. v. , no. 25333/06, \u00a7 62, 22 October 2009).",

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Nachova and Others v.

The political opposition intensified its rallies in protest against the results of the presidential election which had been held the previous year and which they claimed had been flawed and unfair. In this respect, the Court notes that a number of international and domestic reports alleged that, during the same period, the authorities resorted to various seemingly arbitrary measures to quell the support for the opposition (see paragraphs 64-68 above). The PACE Committee on the Honouring of Obligations and Commitments by Members States of the Council of Europe stated, in particular, in its Report no. 10163 of 27 April 2004 that \u201cthe Armenian authorities reacted to the opposition call for protests with a campaign of political intimidation and administrative and judicial harassment\u201d (see paragraph 65 above). It further follows from these materials that the CAO and its provisions prescribing short-term administrative detention for petty offences were widely used by the authorities for that purpose. Other means, such as restricting freedom of movement, were also employed to prevent people from participating in demonstrations. Moreover, a number of sources suggest that the legal grounds used for detention of opposition activists were quite diverse and also included such grounds as use of foul language and not following police orders (see, in particular, the Human Rights Watch and the Armenian Ombudsman\u2019s reports in paragraphs 66 and 68 above).",

In order to comply with the rule, normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see Assenov and Others v.

While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute \u201carbitrariness\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the notion of arbitrariness in the context of Article 5 varies to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved (see Mooren v.

It pursued aims unrelated to the formal grounds relied on to justify the deprivation of liberty and clearly involved an element of bad faith on the part of the police officers. Furthermore, while there are not sufficient elements to conclude that the domestic court which imposed the detention also acted in bad faith, it undoubtedly showed negligence in reviewing both the factual and the legal basis for the applicants\u2019 detention (see paragraph 98 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the applicants\u2019 deprivation of liberty as a whole was arbitrary and therefore unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1.

The circumstances of the present case are practically identical. It is true that the applicants in the present case were subjected to two almost consecutive terms of administrative detention instead of just one and were allegedly never released from detention following the expiry of their first terms. The Court, however, does not find it necessary to establish whether the applicants were indeed not released from detention since, regardless of that fact, both sets of proceedings against them were conducted in a very similar manner and fell short of the fair trial requirements of Article 6.",
