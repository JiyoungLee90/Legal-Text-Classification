In response to the Government\u2019s submission (see paragraph 123 below), the applicant argued that recreational facilities had only been made available after July\u00a02008, following the construction works in the unit for life-sentenced prisoners in Daugavpils Prison.

The Court\u2019s task is limited to examining the personal situation of the applicant who has been affected by the regime concerned (see Van der Ven v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, no. 50901/99, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2003II). Public-order considerations may lead the State to introduce highsecurity prison regimes for particular categories of detainees and, indeed, in many State Parties to the Convention more stringent security rules apply to dangerous detainees (see Horych v. , no. 13621/08, \u00a7\u00a088, 17 April 2012, and Piechowicz v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a020071/07, \u00a7 161, 17\u00a0April 2012).

However, where the manner in which a search is carried out has debasing elements which significantly aggravate the inevitable humiliation of the procedure, Article 3 has been engaged: for example, where a prisoner was obliged to strip in the presence of a female officer, and his sexual organs and food were touched with bare hands (see\u00a0Vala\u0161inas, ibid.), and where a search was conducted in front of four guards who derided and verbally abused the prisoner (Iwa\u0144czuk, ibid.). Similarly, where the search has no established connection with the preservation of prison security and the prevention of crime or disorder, issues may arise (see, for example, Iwa\u0144czuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59, where a search of the applicant, a remand prisoner detained on charges of nonviolent crimes, was conducted when he wished to exercise his right to vote; and Van der Ven, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62, where strip-searching was a systematic and long-term practice without convincing security needs).",

The Court notes that the CPT has confirmed that life-sentenced prisoners were prohibited from sitting on their bed in the daytime at Daugavpils Prison; the CPT has described this rule as being \u201canachronistic\u201d and called for its abolition (see paragraph 50 above). Moreover, it appears from the material before the  that the relevant domestic authority mistakenly considered that this prohibition was contained in the applicable regulation issued by the Cabinet of Ministers and that in practice that regulation was erroneously implemented and applied in prisons (see\u00a0paragraph 77 above). The Court considers that the CPT and the domestic material are sufficient to prove the veracity of the applicant\u2019s allegations as concerns Daugavpils Prison. Furthermore, the Court takes note of the CPT\u2019s findings that in Daugavpils Prison life-sentenced prisoners were locked up in their cells for twenty-three hours per day, without being offered any purposeful activities, for most of the time in which the applicant was detained there (see paragraphs 40, 46 and 56 above). While the Government submitted that recreational and educational activities (daily exercise, use of the gym, TV, computer and library) had been put in place, the Court notes that most of those activities were only made available in July 2008, meaning that the applicant would have spent nearly four years in Daugavpils Prison before he could have benefited from any of them. In addition, these activities can be hardly considered as constituting a comprehensive regime of out-of-cell activities (on which the CPT have repeatedly insisted) or appropriate in-cell stimulus (compare, for example, with the stimulus provided in ADX Florence, see Babar Ahmad and Others v. the , nos.\u00a024027/07, 11949/08, 36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09, \u00a7\u00a0222, 10 April 2012). Indeed, following its 2009 visit the CPT noted that no purposeful activities were offered in Daugavpils Prison; the gym was small and largely used to watch TV and to interact with other life-sentenced prisoners, as this was the only occasion when they could do so (see paragraph 56 above). In fact, for the purposes of its report on the needs of life-sentenced prisoners in 2009 the Prisons Administration itself interviewed all life-sentenced prisoners in Daugavpils Prison, who confirmed the limited range of activities offered (watching TV, reading books, magazines and newspapers, writing letters and exercise). Even though it appears that they themselves did not express dissatisfaction with the range of activities offered, the Court considers such a state of affairs unacceptable.",

The Court notes that the applicant was not subjected to complete sensory deprivation or total social isolation, but relative social isolation, being prevented from communicating with prisoners subject to different prison regimes (see\u00a0paragraph 64 above). Nevertheless, automatic segregation of life-sentenced prisoners from the rest of the prison population has been criticised by the CPT, which has stressed that life-sentenced prisoners are not necessarily more dangerous than other prisoners and has called for individual risk assessments to be carried out (see paragraphs 40 and 53 above and contrast with the above-mentioned Horych and Piechowicz cases, where the applicants were classified as \u201cdangerous detainees\u201d following assessments by a penitentiary commission, which classification was reviewed, albeit in a summary fashion, every three months). Even assuming that the applicant shared a cell with another inmate for certain periods of time, he was segregated from the rest of the prison population and could only engage in largely limited social contact with other life-sentenced prisoners during daily exercise and, from around July 2008, while watching TV in the gym. In the Court\u2019s view, automatic and thus arbitrary segregation of life-sentenced prisoners from the rest of the prison population and from communication among themselves, in particular in circumstances in which no comprehensive out-of-cell activities or in-cell stimulus are available, may raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention. In the present case, the applicant\u2019s segregation from the prison population and limited contact with other life-sentenced prisoners was in no way examined to determine if such restrictions were necessary and proportionate; there appear to have been no safeguards in place to scrutinise the effects of such restrictions on the applicant\u2019s physical and mental health. The Court considers the authorities\u2019 approach manifestly arbitrary and notes that its view in this regard is in line with the repeated criticism expressed by the CPT towards the Latvian prison system as set out above, as well as with the European Prison Rules (see paragraph 61 above) and the Council of Europe recommendations (see paragraph 62 above) on this matter.",

These security measures have been criticised by the CPT and labelled as \u201cdraconian\u201d, together with the systematic handcuffing of prisoners such as the applicant (see paragraph 41, 43 and 48 above). The Court observes that the applicant has not alleged that he was particularly affected by the latter. However, it can take this factor into account as background information when examining the security measures imposed on the applicant. These measures, like the applicant\u2019s isolation, were applied automatically and in respect of all life-sentenced prisoners. The Court cannot but conclude that in the circumstances of the present case the use of dogs whenever the applicant was being escorted was arbitrary. At the same time, the Court notes that the CPT has confirmed that this practice was discontinued in Daugavpils Prison in 2007 (see paragraph 48 above).",

The Court notes that it is undisputed that the applicant regularly underwent full body searches and that in that connection he was required to strip naked in the presence of several prison guards, to hand them his clothes and to display his genitals for inspection. The Court notes in this respect that it is the regularity of these searches that the applicant complained of and, for this reason, the alleged discrepancies in his submissions as concerns the exact number of searches per month are minor. The Court notes that the Government submitted that in 2009 only three full searches had been carried out in respect of the applicant, to which the applicant disagreed. The Court will proceed on the assumption that between 2004 and 2008 the applicant was subject to full body searches at least twice per month, which is the frequency to which the Government admitted, even though there is some evidence that during certain periods the searches might have been carried out more often (see the relevant CPT report at paragraph 51 above; and the applicant\u2019s submissions at paragraph 121 above). Similarly, the Court considers that for the purposes of the present case it is not necessary to establish the exact number of prison guards in whose presence the applicant was ordered to strip naked; there is no evidence that there was a female officer among them (contrast the above-cited Vala\u0161inas case) or that there were several prison guards who derided and verbally abused the applicant (contrast the above-cited Iwa\u0144czuki case). The Court also does not consider it necessary to establish the frequency of full body searches in 2009 and it will confine its analysis to the preceding period.",

The only piece of evidence contained in the case material to which the Government referred in arguing that illegal objects had been found during body searches of the applicant is the report following the 20\u00a0May 2005 search that contains a note on previous disciplinary action as follows: \u201c21 December 2004. Illegal objects. A reprimand\u201d. Even assuming that full body searches of the applicant might initially have been justified in view of a reasonable suspicion of illegal objects immediately after his transfer to Daugavpils Prison, the Court considers that such a suspicion may not last for an indefinite period of time and, after the initial period, cannot by itself serve as the basis for systematic searches of the applicant.",

While the Government noted that the applicant was a dangerous person with violent behaviour, they did not provide more substance to this argument. They based their claim on the prison governor\u2019s description of the applicant as being \u201cprovocative, sometimes aggressive and shameless\u201d, which dated back to 2005 and which, in the Court\u2019s view, cannot be sufficient to justify systematic full body searches in the absence of convincing security needs or any specific suspicion that carrying out a search would prevent disorder or crime. In the applicant\u2019s submission, his resistance to the prison guards during the full body searches had been directed at what he considered the humiliating nature of exactly these searches, which is the matter now before the Court. The Government argued that the work of the panels conducting individual risk assessments of life-sentenced prisoners had been started in Daugavpils Prison. It is clear from the Government\u2019s submissions, however, that those panels only examine the need for the use of special measures, i.e. handcuffs (see paragraphs 49 and 58 above for a summary of the CPT\u2019s findings as concerns the adequacy of these panels). It does not appear from the parties\u2019 submissions that any examination whatsoever has been carried out in respect of the applicant and whether systematic full body searches of him could be justified on the basis of prison security or for other reasons.",
