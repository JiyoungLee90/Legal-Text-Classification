The case originated in an application (no. 19467/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Kazım Karakuş (“the applicant”), on 25 April 2007. The applicant was represented by Mr Z. Kadayıfçı, a lawyer practising in Hatay. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent. On 30 January 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant owned two adjacent plots of land (157 square meters of plot no. 1640 and 132 square meters of plot no. 1641) situated near the coast-line in Tekirdağ on which he built two semi-detached houses. On 20 May 2005 the Tekirdağ Court of First Instance delivered two separate judgments and annulled 83,36 square meters and 71,02 square meters of the respective plots on the ground that they were situated on the coastline which could not be subject to private ownership. The court further ordered the demolition of any constructions thereon. The Court of Cassation upheld the judgments on 5 May 2006 and 24 May 2006 respectively. The applicant’s requests for rectification were rejected on 13 November 2006.
