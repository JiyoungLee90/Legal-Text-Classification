In this connection, the Court reiterates that a demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life including disruption of traffic. However, where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, it is important for public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 is not to be deprived of all substance (see Nurettin Aldemir and\u00a0Others v.
