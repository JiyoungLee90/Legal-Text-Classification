It was also supposed to assess how dangerous the defendant was. The two experts appointed by the investigating judge concluded that the offences with which the applicant had been charged, and of which his nephews and niece, the alleged victims, had accused him, were linked with a state of sexual perversion. They stated, however, that it was difficult to assess the extent and nature of that perversion \u2013 in so far as the applicant presented the facts as isolated incidents \u2013 or to gauge the applicant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation since a cure would be possible only if his underlying sexual problems were more clearly identified.
