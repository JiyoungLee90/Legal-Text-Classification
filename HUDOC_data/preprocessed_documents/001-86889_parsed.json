The  held that there was no proof that the Ministry owned the impugned aircraft. In particular the sales contract was said to be lost and the license to operate the plane, issued by the Ministry of Defence, authorised a certain Ministry\u2019s unit to use it, without any reference being made as to who was its owner. However, the court decided to quash its ruling of 13 March 2003 and prohibited the Ministry from disposing of the aircraft in any form whatsoever and from moving it outside the Zhuliany airport, where it was stationed at the material time.",

The claim relating to the aircraft itself is being considered in the criminal proceedings, and, as the Government contend and the applicant company agrees, it is therefore premature to consider it while the criminal proceedings are still pending. The domestic courts declined to deal with the damages claim in the context of the criminal proceedings, but it remains open to the applicant company to bring ordinary civil proceedings in this respect either now or once the criminal proceedings have ended. Complaints in this regard are therefore also premature. The Court would point out that, after the respective final rulings are given, it will be open to the applicant to re-submit its complaints to the Court if it still considers itself a victim of an alleged violation of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 (see Merit v. , no.\u00a066561/01, \u00a7\u00a048, 30\u00a0March 2004).
