It therefore finds that exhausting that particular remedy does not interrupt the running of the six-month time-limit which started to run when the Tarsus Assize Court\u2019s decision rejecting the applicants\u2019 objection to the prosecutor\u2019s second decision was served on the applicants on 14 January 2010 (see paragraph 34 above). Noting that the applicants introduced their application with the Court on 3 June 2010, the Court considers that they complied with the six-month rule.",

The Court considers that the questioning of these potential witnesses, as soon as possible after the discovery of the body, could have yielded information on whether they had seen or heard anything suspicious. It considers that the failure to take such an obvious measure constitutes an important gap in the investigation (see paragraph 80 below).",

The Court is not convinced by those submissions. It observes that the statements taken from the two relatives, the caretaker and the security guard (see paragraph 11 above) merely confirmed that those persons had no relevant information to offer in respect of the death and do not conclusively rule out the involvement of another person in Mustafa D\u00f6leksoy\u2019s death.",

This, in the opinion of the Government, meant that no one had been involved in the death and that the incident had already been solved (see paragraph 25 above). Once again the Court is unable to accept the Government\u2019s submissions because it notes that the report referred to by the Government was drawn up more than one year after Mustafa D\u00f6leksoy\u2019s body was found and cannot, therefore, explain the prosecutor\u2019s failure to seek and question any eyewitnesses during that period.",

As set out above, no responses were given to the pertinent points raised by the applicants in the course of the investigation, which continued for a period of two and a half years, and no explanations were proffered to justify those failures by arguing, for example, that questioning the people in the vicinity, looking for fingerprints in the house, examining the call records in the mobile phone and forensically examining the clothes would not be relevant to solving the incident.",

Without passing judgment on the quality of the examinations conducted by the respondent State\u2019s forensic experts and notwithstanding the respondent State\u2019s obligation to pursue an effective investigation, the Court considers it pertinent for its assessment that the applicants were denied the opportunity to have the hair examined privately by forensic experts according to whom it would have been possible to obtain results (see paragraph 31 above). Had the applicants been able to do so and establish that the hair belonged to another person, they could have brought that information to the attention of the judicial authorities who would have had to conduct fresh inquiries. If the results of the private forensic examinations had confirmed the results of the Forensic Medicine Institute, then the applicants\u2019 suspicions would have been alleviated.",

Nevertheless, the Court held that it was not necessary for them to take these steps. The Court based its reasoning on the fact that the domestic authorities were obliged to investigate of their own motion killings resulting from the use of force by members of the security forces, as well as on the fact that the deceased\u2019s father had \u201cjoined the proceedings in question and raised all the issues concerning his son\u2019s killing\u201d (see Y\u00fcksel Erdo\u011fan and Others v.

By contrast, there is no indication in the present case that Mustafa D\u00f6leksoy was killed by State actors. While the domestic investigation was ultimately deficient in this case, it is nonetheless to be distinguished from the special situation of State involvement in a death followed by passivity or even partiality on the part of the authorities or the utter ineffectiveness of the domestic remedies (compare Aytekin v.\u00a0Turkey (preliminary objection), 23 September 1998, \u00a7\u00a085, Reports 1998VII).",

While the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies under Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some flexibility, I consider the degree of flexibility employed by the majority in this judgment to be unwarranted and not in conformity with the underlying principle of subsidiarity whereby applicants must have acted at domestic level so as to afford the member States the opportunity to secure their Convention rights. By finding that it was not necessary for the deceased\u2019s siblings to exhaust domestic remedies, the majority departed from the test of determining whether, under the circumstances, an applicant or applicants did everything that could be reasonably expected to exhaust domestic remedies (see Av\u015far, cited above, \u00a7 380, with further references). At the time of the domestic investigation, Mustafa D\u00f6leksoy\u2019s siblings failed to show any interest in participating in the proceedings.
