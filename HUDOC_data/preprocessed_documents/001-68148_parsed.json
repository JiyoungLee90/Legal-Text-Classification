In fact, whilst in the first trial only nine witnesses had been heard, in the second round of proceedings which began almost a year after the applicant\u2019s release, the district court took evidence from 33 witnesses. It is not alleged that the applicant attempted to exercise pressure on those called to the witness stand in the course of the renewed proceedings and, in any event, these proceedings were eventually discontinued, in part due to the prosecution\u2019s abandoning of the charges and, as to the rest, as being time-barred.",

It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Letellier v.\u00a0France, judgment of 26\u00a0June 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0207, \u00a7 43). In the present case the decisions of the domestic authorities give no reasons why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicant in support of his applications for release, they considered the risk of his absconding to be decisive. In this connection the Court cannot overlook the applicant\u2019s submission that he was granted permission to visit his parents \u2013 not just in another town but in another state \u2013 barely three months after the district court had held for the last time that holding him in custody had been the only certain means to prevent him from absconding. A further permit was granted to him in August 2000, a mere six months after his release. The granting of such permits demonstrates that the domestic authorities considered the flight risk to be negligible. As no new factors reducing such risk appear to have come into being between the applicant\u2019s release and the issuing of the permits, the Court considers that during the final phase of the applicant\u2019s detention the authorities cannot have had reasonable grounds to keep him in custody in order to prevent his absconding.",

They did not describe in detail the applicant\u2019s personal situation beyond a mere reference to his \u201cpersonality\u201d and were not accompanied with any explanation as to what his personality actually was and why it made his detention necessary. In fact, it was not until 29 February 2000 that the city court, when ordering the applicant\u2019s release from custody, took stock of the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances, such as his permanent residence and family ties, positive work references and the absence of a criminal record, which mitigated, if not removed, the risk of his absconding or interfering with the administration of justice. The Court notes that this decision appears to be the first one in the four years of the applicant\u2019s detention when the domestic courts addressed the arguments concerning his personal situation, which he repeatedly \u2013 and unsuccessfully \u2013 raised in his appeals against the prolonged detention. This is all the more remarkable, taking into account that these arguments referred to facts of which the domestic authorities had had full knowledge from the first days of the proceedings.",

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to the detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (Navarra v.\u00a0France, judgment of 23\u00a0November 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273B, \u00a7\u00a028; Toth v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 12\u00a0December 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224, \u00a7 84).

In that context, the Court also recalls that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4\u00a0October 2001).",

Although a criminal case had been opened barely a year after the offences imputed to the applicant had been last committed, ten years later the prosecution became time-barred in respect of most charges and, as to the remainder, the prosecutor dropped the charges because evidence sufficient for securing a conviction had not been collected. It is also remarkable that, in dismissing the applicant\u2019s complaint about a violation of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, on 18\u00a0May 2002 the district court explained the reasonableness of the overall duration of the investigation by reference to, in particular, \u201cthe remoteness [in time] of the criminal offence\u201d, disregarding the fact that the investigation had been pending throughout all that time.",
