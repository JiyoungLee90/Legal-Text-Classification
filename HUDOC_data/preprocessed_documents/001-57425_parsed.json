The reason for these refusals was that the two branches of the trade union of the nursing staff at Oakwood (the Confederation of Health Service Employees) were, and had since 1975 been, operating a total ban on the admission of offender patients subject to section 65 restriction orders (see paragraph 26 below). The union members considered that, owing to lack of adequate resources, they could not provide sufficient treatment, rehabilitation and security for section 65 patients in the open environment of Oakwood (as to which, see paragraph 24 below). The Secretary of State for Social Services had been advised by the Health Authority that to admit the applicant without the agreement of the nursing staff would be likely to result in a withdrawal of labour which could endanger the health and well-being of other patients and would not be in the applicant\u2019s own interests. They had further advised that such a step would jeopardise the prospects of obtaining agreement of the staff to the lifting of the ban and that to admit the applicant to another hospital might not only result in disruptive industrial action at that hospital, but would be likely to worsen industrial relations at Oakwood itself.",

Section 141(1) of the 1959 Act propounded a subjective not an objective test: \"if a person is acting honestly with the intention of performing, in the best way he knows how, the statutory functions or duties which are cast upon him, then it seems to me he is acting in purported pursuance of the statute\". Although Mr. Ashingdane alleged a breach of statutory duty under section 3 of the National Health Service Act 1977 to provide hospital accommodation to meet all reasonable requirements (see paragraph 25 below), the essential act out of which liability was said to arise was the refusal of transfer, which fell within the protection of section 141. Applying the case of Pountney v.  ([1976] Appeal Cases 314 and [1975] 2 All  Law Reports 881), he further held that \"section 141 does not create a personal immunity which is capable of being waived but imposes a fetter on the Court\u2019s jurisdiction which is not so capable\".

The Court\u2019s task in verifying the fulfilment of these conditions is limited to reviewing under the Convention the decisions taken by the national authorities (see, inter alia, the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, p. 20, para. 43 in fine).",

More generally, it follows from the very aim of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) that no detention that is arbitrary can ever be regarded as \"lawful\" (see the above-mentioned Winterwerp judgment, Series A no. 33, pp. 17-18, para. 39). The Court would further accept that there must be some relationship between the ground of permitted deprivation of liberty relied on and the place and conditions of detention. In principle, the \"detention\" of a person as a mental health patient will only be \"lawful\" for the purposes of sub-paragraph (e) of paragraph 1 (art. 5-1-e) if effected in a hospital, clinic or other appropriate institution authorised for that purpose. However, subject to the foregoing, Article 5 para. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e) is not in principle concerned with suitable treatment or conditions (see the above-mentioned Winterwerp judgment, p. 21, para. 51).",

Whilst these differences were of vital concern for Mr. Ashingdane and for the quality of his life in detention, they were not such as to change the character of his deprivation of liberty as a mental patient. Both Broadmoor and Oakwood were psychiatric hospitals where, as the Commission noted (see paragraphs 78 and 80 of the report), qualified staff displayed a constant preoccupation with the applicant\u2019s treatment and health. Consequently, although the regime at Oakwood was more liberal and, in view of the improvement in his mental state, more conducive to his ultimate recovery, the place and conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention did not cease to be those capable of accompanying \"the lawful detention of a person of unsound mind\". It cannot therefore be said that, contrary to Article 17 (art. 17), the applicant\u2019s right to liberty and security of person was limited to a greater extent than that provided for under Article 5 para. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e).",

This was so even though the immediate cause of the delay in his transfer from the special security hospital to his local hospital was industrial rather than therapeutic, a circumstance which the Commission described as \"deplorable\" (see paragraph 79 of the report). It is clear, however, that the delay was not in conscious disregard of Mr. Ashingdane\u2019s mental welfare. Efforts were made to find a solution as soon as possible (see paragraphs 15 in fine and 21 above). The evidence before the Court suggests that any course other than that adopted by the responsible authorities would probably have been impracticable. In any event, the Court is satisfied that the applicant\u2019s continued detention was not arbitrary or effected for an ulterior purpose, contrary to Article 5 para. 1 (e) read in conjunction with Article 18 (art. 18+5-1-e).",

The problem of transfer from the \"special\" hospitals in  and , which lay at the root of the present case, was undoubtedly a serious one for those affected (see paragraph 28 above).

Even assuming that a right is conferred on the individual citizen by section 3 (see paragraph 30 above), the legal obligation thereby created, being couched in rather general terms, leaves a wide discretion to the Minister and would, by its very nature and quite apart from section 141 of the 1959 Act, not be amenable to full judicial control by the national courts. Section 141 did not qualify section 3 of the 1977 Act as such, but had the effect of qualifying claims grounded on section 3 in so far as they related to measures carried out in purported pursuance of the 1959 Act (see paragraph 17 above). As can be seen from Lord Justice Bridge\u2019s judgment in the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 18 above), this was held to be the case with Mr. Ashingdane\u2019s claims since the essential act out of which liability was alleged to arise was the refusal to transfer him from Broadmoor Hospital to Oakwood Hospital, this being a category of measure governed by the 1959 Act and the Regulations made thereunder (see paragraph 27 above). Even though thereby applicable, section 141 only partially precluded the responsible authorities from being sued, in respect of a refusal of this kind, for breach of statutory duty under section 3 of the 1977 Act, as it would have allowed any such action alleging bad faith or negligence to proceed, subject to leave of the High Court being obtained (see paragraph 17 above). In the instant case, no such allegation was made against the responsible authorities and consequently Mr. Ashingdane\u2019s claims were barred.",

Adopting the view expressed by Mr. Justice Dillon, he considered that section 141 (1) of the 1959 Act propounded a subjective not an objective test. \"If a person is acting honestly with the intention of performing, in the best way he knows how, the statutory functions or duties which are cast upon him, then it seems to me he is acting in purported pursuance of the statute.\" Although Mr. Ashingdane alleged a breach of statutory duty under section 3 of the National Health Service Act 1977 to provide hospital accommodation to meet all reasonable requirements, the essential act out of which liability was said to arise was the refusal of transfer, which fell within the protection of section 141 (see paragraph 18 of the Court\u2019s judgment).",
