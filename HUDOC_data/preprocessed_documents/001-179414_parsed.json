It is the Government\u2019s case that that time-limit is optional and that failure to observe it cannot lead to a detainee\u2019s release. However, that interpretation appears to be contrary to Article 230 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 10 above), which states in clear terms that failure to observe a time-limit provided for the exercise of a procedural right causes the loss of that procedural right and the nullity of the acts effected in breach of the time-limit. Moreover, the explanatory judgment of the Plenary Supreme Court of Justice (see paragraph 11 above) states that a detainee must be released upon the expiry of his or her period of detention if the prosecutor fails to observe the five-day time-limit for lodging an application for its prolongation. While this interpretation was given after the events, there is nothing to support the Government\u2019s contention that the provision contained in Article 186 \u00a7 6 was optional.",
