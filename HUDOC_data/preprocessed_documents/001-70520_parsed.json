Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty laid down in Article 5 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a7 110-111 with further references, ECHR 2000-XI).",

In this respect he pointed out that his mother had been allowed to visit him during the investigation stage of the proceedings but subsequently, when the trial had commenced, the authorities had decided that visits could have negatively influenced the proceedings. The applicant further stressed that the authorities did not envisage other measures as specifically provided for in the Rules Governing the Execution of Detention, in particular, the possibility of arranging supervised visits in a prison officer\u2019s presence. This, in his opinion, had amounted to detention incommunicado.
