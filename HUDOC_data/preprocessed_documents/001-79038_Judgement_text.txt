The case originated in an application (no. 44115/98) against the  lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national Mr. Jarosław Wedler (“the applicant”) on 22 December 1997.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, first Mr K. Drzewicki and subsequently by Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant complained, in particular, about the excessive length of his detention, the length of criminal proceedings as a whole, the alleged lack of medical care in prison and about the non-adversarial nature of the proceedings concerning the applicant’s detention on remand.
On 27 May 2003 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the length of detention on remand, the length of criminal proceedings, the alleged lack of medical care in prison, and the non-adversarial nature of the proceedings concerning the applicant’s detention on remand.
On 17 October 2006 under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, the Court decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in .
On 15 March 1995 the applicant left Poland and went to  in order to set up a business. On 31 May 1995 the Opole District Prosecutor issued a warrant to locate the applicant by means of a wanted notice. A detention order for a period of seven days was also issued. The applicant was suspected of, inter alia, obtaining credit by false pretences, forgery of documents and embezzlement.
The applicant was arrested in  on 30 September 1996. According to his submissions, which were not contested by the Government, on 2 December 1996 the applicant was handed over to Polish police officers at the Moscow airport, put on a plane and transported to .
On 5 December 1996 the applicant was examined by a physician of the Opole Detention Centre. He found the applicant to be in good condition. Because the applicant had complained about bad headaches and, noting that a birth-mark on his leg had changed tint, the physician ordered a specialist examination of the applicant to be carried out and that he should be seen by a dermatologist. The applicant was prescribed analgesics.
On the same day the applicant underwent a dental examination; several caries were found and it appeared that the applicant’s teeth had been trimmed-down in preparation for the restoration of crowns.
On 3 January 1997 the applicant visited a dentist and requested porcelain fillings for his decayed teeth. The applicant was informed that under the applicable laws this kind of specialist dental treatment could be offered only upon payment.
As during his subsequent dental examination the applicant had complained about the hypersensitivity of his trimmed-down teeth, the dentist partly reconstructed the crowns of the teeth.
In a letter of 25 February 1997 the Opole Regional Prosecutor requested the Head of the Opole Detention Centre to allow the applicant to continue his dental treatment.
Since the applicant declared that he had no financial means that would allow him to cover the costs of crowns (the treatment received so far had been of a temporary character), on 22 December 1997 the Chief Physician of the Regional Inspectorate of Prison Administration in Opole decided that the applicant should obtain artificial replacements and the related treatment in the hospital of the First Wroclaw Prison. During his stay in the Wroclaw Prison in January 1998 the applicant received two sets of artificial dentures. The costs were covered by the Prison Administration.
Further dental treatment (correction of artificial dentures, restoration of crowns, dental fillings) was conducted in the Opole Detention Centre.
The applicant was often examined by various specialists, including an internist, a dermatologist, a psychiatrist, a neurologist, a laryngologist, and a eye specialist. It was established that the applicant suffered from, inter alia, arterial hypertension, gastritis and dizziness. Pharmacological treatment and a special diet were ordered.
In March 1997 the applicant intentionally injured himself by cutting his forearm and afterwards refused to have the wound stitched.
In March 1999 the applicant was diagnosed as suffering from uric acid diathesis and was placed for a month in the hospital of the First Prison in . Subsequently, he continued his treatment in the Opole Detention Centre. On 19 June he was examined by a rheumatologist.
The Government submit that during his detention the applicant contested the quality of his medical treatment and complained about inadequate medical care. On the other hand, he refused to co-operate with medical staff. In particular, the applicant did not consent to giving blood samples for examination, did not adhere to a prescribed diet and refused to take medication for arterial hypertension (the applicant held on to the medication in his cell). The applicant also refused to undergo hospital treatment and questioned the competence of several specialists.
On 2 October 1999 the applicant was examined by the medical panel of the Opole Detention Centre. The panel confirmed the adequacy of medical treatment provided to the applicant and found that his health did not preclude his further detention on remand.
On 2 December 1999, the last day of his detention, the applicant was examined and his general state of health was described as good.
On 5 December 1996 the prosecutor informed the applicant of the charges against him.
On 6 December 1996 the Opole District Court decided to detain the applicant on remand until 2 March 1997. The court considered that in the light of evidence gathered there was a sufficient likelihood that he had committed an offence. The court also pointed to a risk of the applicant’s absconding, observing that he had been arrested by a special Interpol unit in  on the strength of an international search warrant.
It would appear that on the same date he lodged an appeal against this decision.  On 30 December 1996 the  dismissed the appeal. It held that as the applicant had remained abroad for a lengthy period of time before being arrested, his argument that his parents required his constant care was not convincing.
On 6 January 1997 the applicant filed a request for release. On 12 February 1997 the Opole Regional Prosecutor dismissed the request.
On 16 February 1997 the applicant appealed. On 10 March 1997 the Wrocław Appellate Prosecutor dismissed the appeal, finding that the evidence gathered so far in the case, as well as the nature of the offences concerned, justified his continuing detention. Moreover, there were no grounds for releasing him under Article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Nevertheless, in view of the applicant’s repeated requests, the prosecutor ordered an examination of his health and a review of the situation of his partner and his parents.
On 26 February 1997 the  prolonged the applicant’s detention until 2 June 1997, finding that the grounds on which the detention had been ordered were still valid. The court also observed that a number of witnesses and an expert in accountancy had still to be heard.
On 28 February 1997 the applicant appealed. On 25 March 1997 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that the grounds for maintaining him in detention remained valid. The court referred to a justified risk of the applicant’s absconding and of his hindering the conduct of the investigation. The court recalled that the applicant had been sought and arrested by Interpol pursuant to an international search warrant and noted that further extensive evidence needed to be obtained in the case.
On 28 March 1997 the Opole Regional Prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s request of 25 March 1997 for release, stating that contrary to his submissions, a thorough examination of his health and his family’s situation had shown no grounds which would warrant his release.

On 17 July 1997 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal of 4 June 1997.
On 18 July 1997 the Opole Regional Prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s request for release of 17 July 1997.
On 21 August 1997 the Wrocław Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant’s detention until 2 December 1997. The court relied on the probability of the applicant’s guilt, the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, the need to continue the investigation and on the risk that the applicant, if released, would go into hiding. On 3 September 1997 the applicant appealed against this decision. On 26 September 1997 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.
On 15 September 1997 the applicant requested the prosecuting authorities to release him from detention and to apply more lenient preventive measures. On 24 September 1997 the Opole Regional Prosecutor dismissed the request, observing that his continued detention had been justified and that it had been constantly reviewed by the courts. On 23 October 1997 the Wrocław Appellate Prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s appeal of 6 October 1997, referring to the probability of his guilt, the gravity of the charges against him and the fact that the investigation had not yet been completed. The applicant’s family situation, although difficult, did not argue in favour of his release.
On 9 October 1997 the Opole Regional Prosecutor discontinued the investigation against the applicant in respect of certain of the charges against him.
On 2 December 1997 the Supreme Court prolonged the applicant’s detention until 2 March 1998, finding that all the necessary evidence had not been yet obtained and that there was a reasonable risk of the applicant’s absconding. On the same date the applicant complained that the hearing before the Supreme Court, at which the prosecution had been present, had been held in violation of the principle of equality of arms in that he had not been given an opportunity to present his defence in person. The applicant was informed by the Supreme Court that no appeal was available against this decision.
On 8 January 1998 the applicant requested that his detention be replaced with more lenient preventive measures, namely bail in the amount of around PLN 5,000, police supervision, prohibition on leaving the country and seizure of his passport. The applicant’s lawyers also argued that it was not true that their client had been hiding in Russia before his arrest, given that he had regularly visited the Polish Consulate in .

On 26 February 1998 the Supreme Court prolonged the applicant’s detention until 2 June 1998, finding that his continuing detention was necessary since the investigation had not yet been concluded. In particular, the Central Forensic Laboratory and the Opole Forensic Laboratory had not completed the taking of all necessary expert evidence and the judicial assistance requested from the German prosecuting authorities had not yet been provided. In addition, further victims were emerging in the case. Moreover, there was a reasonable fear that the applicant, if released, would abscond or might otherwise obstruct the investigation.
On 30 March 1998 the applicant, invoking Articles 5 § 1, 5 § 4 and 6 § 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, complained to the President of the Supreme Court that neither he nor his lawyer had been allowed to participate in a session during which the lawfulness of his detention on remand was examined.
