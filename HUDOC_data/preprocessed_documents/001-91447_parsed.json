Seeing that these circumstances constitute exceptions to a most basic guarantee of individual freedom, only a narrow interpretation is consistent with the aim of this provision (see \u010conka v. Belgium, no.\u00a051564/99, \u00a7 42 in limine, ECHR 2002-I, and Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, \u00a7 396, ECHR 2005-III). The Court notes that it is common ground between the parties that the applicant was detained with a view to his extradition from Russia to . Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention is thus applicable in the instant case. This provision does not require that the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to extradition be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or absconding. In this connection, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from \nArticle 5 \u00a7 1 (c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d (see \u010conka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038, and Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, \u00a7 112). However, any deprivation of liberty under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) will be justified only for as long as extradition proceedings are in progress. If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) (ibid., p. 1863, \u00a7\u00a0113).",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Amuur\u00a0v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, \u00a7 50). Thus, the notion underlying the term in question is one of fair and proper procedure, namely that any measure depriving a person of his liberty should issue from and be executed by an appropriate authority and should not be arbitrary (see C. v. Germany, no. 0893/84, Commission decision of 2 December 1985). The words \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d do not merely refer back to domestic law; they also relate to the quality of this law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention. Quality in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible and precise, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2001-II, citing Amuur v. France, cited above, pp.\u00a0850-51, \u00a7 50).",

Nine days later, pursuant to that faxed letter, the applicant was arrested and placed in the temporary detention unit in .

The Court observes, and the parties did not dispute this assertion, that the applicant\u2019s detention pending extradition was governed by Russian law, in particular the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure in force at the material time. This conclusion is also supported by Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the 1993 Minsk Convention (see paragraph 25 above), Article 16 \u00a7 1 of the European Convention on Extradition (see paragraph 26 above), Article 8 of the 1992 Treaty (see paragraph 30 above) and Article 1 of the CCrP itself (see paragraph 32 above) which provide that issues of legal assistance, including those pertaining to provisional arrest and detention with a view to extradition, are governed by the domestic law of a State providing such an assistance (see, for similar reasoning, Shchebet v. Russia, no. 16074/07, \u00a7\u00a067, 12 June 2008 and Soldatenko v. Ukraine, no. 2440/07, \u00a7\u00a0112, 23\u00a0October 2008). The Court further observes that the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure did not contain separate legal provisions governing detention of a person with a view to his extradition. However, it was uncontested by the parties, and the Court therefore finds it established, that the general provisions of the CCrP thus applied to the authorisation of the detention of such a person.",

In particular, by virtue of Article 122 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure after the report on the applicant\u2019s arrest had been drawn up, a police investigator should have submitted it to a prosecutor authorised to take a decision on the applicant\u2019s detention or his release (see paragraph 35 above). No exceptions to the rule were permitted or provided for. There is no argument between the parties that between the date of the applicant\u2019s arrest on 19 September 2001 and the Tsentralniy District Prosecutor\u2019s decision of 25 October 2001 on the applicant\u2019s release there was no decision \u2013 either by a Russian prosecutor or a judge \u2013 authorising the applicant\u2019s detention.

The information on the applicant\u2019s refugee status had been made available to the Russian competent authorities almost a week before the applicant\u2019s arrest when the Moscow Representation of the UNHCR sent letters both to the Prosecutor General\u2019s office in Moscow and the St. Petersburg City Prosecutor (see paragraph 9 above). The Court also does not lose sight of the fact that the Prosecutor General dismissed the request for the applicant\u2019s extradition precisely on the ground of his refugee status (see paragraph 17 above). The Court reiterates that it has already examined a similar situation in the case of Garabayev v. Russia (no.\u00a038411/02, \u00a7 89, 7\u00a0June 2007, ECHR 2007). In that case the Court held that the detention of the applicant, a Russian national, with a view to his extradition, had been arbitrary and unlawful from the outset, on the ground that Russian law prohibited the expulsion of Russian nationals. Having regard to the similar protection Russian law affords against expulsion both to Russian nationals and refugees, the Court does not consider that the conclusion reached in the Garabayev case is altered in the present case. The Court therefore finds that the flaw in the very act of the applicant\u2019s arrest was so fundamental as to render it arbitrary and ex facie invalid from the outset (see also, mutatis mutandis, Khudoyorov v. , no.\u00a06847/02, \u00a7\u00a0165, ECHR 2005X (extracts)).",

However, it was not until 25 October 2001 that the Tsentralniy District Prosecutor authorised the applicant\u2019s release. The Court reiterates that some delay in implementing a decision to release a detainee is understandable and often inevitable in view of practical considerations relating to the running of the courts and the observance of particular formalities. However, the national authorities must attempt to keep it to a minimum (see Quinn v.\u00a0France, judgment of 22\u00a0March 1995, Series A no.\u00a0311, p. 17, \u00a7\u00a042; Giulia Manzoni v.\u00a0Italy, judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, p. 1191, \u00a7\u00a025 in fine; K.-F. v.\u00a0Germany, judgment of 27\u00a0November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p.\u00a02675, \u00a7\u00a071; and Mancini v. Italy, no. 44955/98, \u00a7\u00a024, ECHR 2001-IX). The Court reiterates that administrative formalities connected with release cannot justify a delay of more than a few hours (see Nikolov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 38884/97, \u00a7\u00a082, 30\u00a0January 2003). It is for the Contracting States to organise their legal system in such a way that their law-enforcement authorities can meet the obligation to avoid unjustified deprivation of liberty.\u00a0\u00a0The Court finds it striking that in the instant case it took the domestic authorities three days to communicate the Prosecutor General\u2019s decision to a prosecutor in  and to release the applicant. Having regard to the prominent place which the right to liberty holds in a democratic society, the respondent State should have deployed all modern means of communication of information to keep to a minimum the delay in implementing the decision to release the applicant as required by the relevant case-law. The Court is not satisfied that the Russian officials complied with that requirement in the present case.",

Whilst this information must be conveyed \u201cpromptly\u201d, it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest. Whether the content and promptness of the information conveyed were sufficient is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the , 30 August 1990, \u00a7\u00a040, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0182).",

The above reasoning applies, mutatis mutandis, to the arrest of persons with a view to their extradition, the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 2 being that a person should know why he is arrested by the police. While it is true that insufficiency of information of the charges held against an arrested person may be relevant for the right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention for persons arrested in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), the same does not apply to arrest with a view to extradition, as these proceedings are not concerned with the determination of a criminal charge (see K. v.

In the case of Bordovskiy v. Russia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-59), the Court found that the fact that in the course of the arrest for a purpose of extradition the applicant had been told that he was wanted by the Belarus authorities was sufficient to satisfy the requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

The Court also does not lose sight of the fact that on the day following the applicant\u2019s arrest the Moscow Representation of the UNHCR complained on the applicant\u2019s behalf to the head of the  police department about his arrest with a view to extradition. It therefore appears that, being aware that his arrest had been effected for the purpose of extradition to Azerbaijan, the applicant was merely dissatisfied that he was not provided with the full information on the criminal proceedings pending against him in , including the factual basis for the charges and their legal characterisation. Although the Court considers it regrettable that at the time of his arrest the applicant was not served with a copy of the arrest warrant issued by the prosecutor of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the information provided to the applicant by Russian authorities was sufficient to satisfy their obligation under Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Day v.

Russia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67) it found that the judicial review of detention pending extradition was in principle available in  under the provisions of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure. The Court observes that the domestic courts which had received the application for the applicant\u2019s release held hearings and issued decisions, finding that the detention had been lawful. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the issue is consequently not so much whether there was a judicial review of the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention, since the parties did not dispute that there was one, as whether it was conducted speedily and effectively (see, by contrast, Nasrulloyev v. , no.\u00a0656/06, \u00a7\u00a7 88-89, 11\u00a0October 2007 and Ryabikin v. , no. 8320/04, \u00a7\u00a7 138-141, 19 June 2008).",

Austria, no.\u00a067175/01, \u00a7\u00a039, ECHR 2005XII). The Court observes that the issues submitted to a domestic court in the context of such challenges of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of a deprivation of liberty as are the subject of this case, are often of a more complex nature than those which have to be decided when a person detained in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) is brought before a judge or other judicial officer as required by paragraph 3 of that Article (see E. v. Norway, 29 August 1990, \u00a7\u00a064, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0181A). The notion of \u201cpromptly\u201d in the latter provision indicates greater urgency than that of \u201cspeedily\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, 29 November 1988, \u00a7\u00a059, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0145B). Even so, a period of approximately five months from the lodging of the application for release to the final judgment does appear, prima facie, difficult to reconcile with the notion of \u201cspeedily\u201d. However, in order to reach a firm conclusion, the special circumstances of the case have to be taken into account (see Sanchez-Reisse v. Switzerland, 21 October 1986, \u00a7\u00a055, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0107).",

The Government explained that the delay was caused by the transfer of the case file to the prosecution authorities and back to the District Court. In this connection, the Court reiterates that Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to examine detention matters speedily (see E. v. Norway, cited above, \u00a7 66). The Court notes with concern the conflicting decisions of the domestic courts on the issues of avenues of review to be followed by those detained with a view to extradition (see paragraph 15 above). In these circumstances, the Court considers that the entire delay of eleven weeks is attributable to the conduct of the domestic authorities. The Court also finds peculiar a further delay of one week afforded to the prosecution authorities for the purpose of studying the case file, taking into account that the file had been in the possession of the same prosecution authorities for the previous ten weeks. The Court is also unconvinced that the domestic authorities tried to keep to a minimum possible delays in the proceedings by affording the parties an additional five weeks for provision of information. Although, it appears that no further delays occurred in the examination of the detention matter after 4 February 2002, in all the circumstances the Court concludes that the domestic courts failed to comply with the requirement of speediness.",

The Court finds that the issue of the speediness of review in the present case overlaps with the issue of its effectiveness. The Court considers that in the circumstances of the case the authorities\u2019 failure to review without a delay the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention, in principle, deprived the review of the requisite effectiveness (see Sabeur Ben Ali v. , no.\u00a035892/97, \u00a7\u00a040, 29 June 2000 and Galliani v. , no. 69273/01, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62, 10\u00a0June 2008; and, mutatis mutandis, Kolanis v. the , no.\u00a0517/02, \u00a7\u00a082, ECHR 2005V).",
