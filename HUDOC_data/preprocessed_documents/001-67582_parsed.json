In this connection, the Government pointed out that the 's judgment of 19 February 1985 consisted of 1,977 pages and that there were ninety prosecution files in the archives belonging to this case. They further asserted that when the original judgment and conviction of the applicant was quashed, the proceedings against 188 suspects, including the applicant, recommenced before the . The latter had to establish the whereabouts of the suspects in order to take their testimonies as well as the testimonies of the witnesses.
