According to them, on those dates the GPO received the final pieces of information relevant to the question of extradition (see paragraphs\u00a042 and 44 above).

In that period, as afterwards, the applicants pursued their asylum claims in Ukraine (compare Akram Karimov v. Russia, no.\u00a062892/12, \u00a7 158, 28 May 2014). The GPO also assisted the US authorities in the processing of the first and third applicants\u2019 requests for asylum (see paragraphs 43 and 46 above). Moreover, the GPO believed, based on information apparently received from the second applicant and from the US authorities, that the US authorities were reviewing the second applicant\u2019s asylum application (see paragraph 46 above), even though it ultimately turned out that he was ineligible for resettlement in a third country due to his marital situation (see paragraph 49 above).",

There is no indication that the GPO followed up on that conclusion at any point in the course of the applicants\u2019 subsequent detention, right up to their release.

In view of the close similarities between the charges brought against all three applicants in Uzbekistan, and in view of the practice followed by the GPO in the cases of the other two applicants, the Court finds it established that the requirements of due diligence required the GPO to follow up the conclusion of the regional prosecutor\u2019s office concerning the second applicant within a reasonable time.",

Moreover, the domestic authorities might have needed time to clarify certain matters concerning the applicants\u2019 extradition even after the regional prosecutor\u2019s office had reached its conclusion in their cases. In particular, the GPO might have needed time to challenge or verify that conclusion or request information from the Uzbek authorities which the regional office had found missing. However, the domestic authorities were under an obligation to act with due diligence. In the present case, there is no satisfactory explanation as to why the GPO failed to follow up in any way on the conclusion reached by its regional office, with the applicants remaining in detention for more than a year and two months after that conclusion had been reached (compare Khomullo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 67-69).",

However, those proceedings as such could not justify their detention (see Athary v. Turkey, no. 50372/09, \u00a7 31, 11 December 2012). Under Ukrainian law, the requesting state\u2019s failure to submit sufficient information and the presence of refugee status were two separate and independent grounds for rejection of an extradition request, each of them sufficient on its own to justify such a rejection (see Article 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, quoted in paragraph 59 above). Therefore, the fact that asylum proceedings which could have resulted in the grant of refugee status and barred the applicants\u2019 extradition were pending in respect of the applicants, did not change the fact that, at least as of 22 November 2010, the domestic authorities had sufficient information in their possession to reach a conclusion that there was a high likelihood that another, independent, obstacle to extradition existed. That was a possibility which they were under an obligation to explore with due diligence and there is no satisfactory explanation for their delay in doing so.",
