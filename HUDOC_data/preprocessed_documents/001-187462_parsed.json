In the present case the Court discerns nothing in the materials in its possession to suggest that closing only part of the hearing, during which witnesses would testify, would have jeopardised or impacted negatively on the clarity and accuracy of their testimony or infringed their privacy. Alternatively, as a matter of last resort, it was also open to the court to ban the press from reporting the details from the trial.",

Austria, no. 35115/97, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR\u00a02000XII). Admittedly, it was incumbent on the domestic judicial authorities to protect the safety and security of the persons present in the courtroom. However, in the Court\u2019s view, the security measures should be narrowly tailored and comply with the principle of necessity. The judicial authorities should thoroughly consider all possible alternatives to ensure safety and security in the courtroom and give preference to a less strict measure over a stricter one when it can achieve the same purpose. The Court notes that in the present case no such effort was made by the domestic courts. The court did not explain why the general security measures already in place had not been sufficient to ensure safety and security in the courtroom. Nor can the Court accept, in the absence of any specific details, the national court\u2019s reasoning that the conduct of a public hearing was a threat to any party to the proceedings and their family members.",
