It has found, in particular, that in deciding on a complaint concerning breaches of domestic regulations governing the provision of medical care to detainees, the prison authorities would not have a sufficiently independent standpoint to satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a035 of the Convention (see Koryak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a079, and Dirdizov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075). The Court has also stressed that even though review by a supervising prosecutor plays an important part in securing appropriate medical care in detention, a complaint to the supervising prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy because of the procedural shortcomings that have been previously identified in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Koryak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-81). Having assessed a civil claim for compensation under the tort provisions of the Civil Code, the Court has held that such a claim could not offer an applicant any redress other than a purely compensatory award, and could not put an end to a situation where there is an ongoing violation, such as inadequate medical care (see Reshetnyak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-73). Moreover, the Court has found that such a remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, in particular because the award was conditional on the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities, which was extremely improbable in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed the application of a certain measure, for instance certain conditions of detention or a certain level of medical treatment (see A.B. v. Russia, no.\u00a01439/06, \u00a7 96, 14 October 2010).",

Accordingly, the respondent State had an obligation to ensure the availability of an effective remedy to deal with the substance of his complaint. Taking into account the circumstances of the present case and the aforementioned case-law, the Court sees no reason to depart from its previous findings on the issue. It concludes that the legal avenues put forward by the Government did not constitute an effective remedy that could have been used to prevent the alleged violations or their continuation and provide the applicant with adequate and sufficient redress for his complaint under Article 3 of the Convention.",

The judgment closely follows the reasoning in Svinarenko and Slyadnev ([GC], nos. 32541/08 and 43441/08, \u00a7\u00a7 53-76, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). In that case the Court established that the applicants must have suffered intensely while being caged in a courtroom. The Court thus found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, applying the threshold of severity test. However, the Court also stated the view that holding a person in a metal cage during a trial constitutes in itself \u2013 having regard to its objectively degrading nature, which is incompatible with the standards of civilised behaviour that are the hallmark of a democratic society \u2013 an affront to human dignity in breach of Article\u00a03. In the case of Bouyid v. Belgium ([GC], no.\u00a023380/09, 29\u00a0September 2015) the Grand Chamber elaborated on the relationship between human dignity and degrading treatment and concluded that it was not necessary to establish a minimum level of suffering. Thereby the Court departed from the threshold of severity test. The case concerned police-officers slapping arrested persons in the face as a reaction to their disrespectful behaviour. The slap administered to each of the applicants by the police officers while they were under their control in the police station did not correspond to a recourse to physical force that had been made strictly necessary by their conduct, and had thus diminished their dignity. Applying that logic to the use of metal cages in courtrooms could have liberated the reasoning of the Court from the rather speculative effect of intense suffering of the applicant. Putting a person on trial in a metal cage without any necessity is degrading in its denial of human dignity. It is a pity that the Court did not depart from the threshold of severity test in the present case and that it even chose not to refer at all to the Bouyid v.\u00a0Belgium case.",
