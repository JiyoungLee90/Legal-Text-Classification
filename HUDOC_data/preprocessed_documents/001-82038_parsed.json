The common law in the United States has long protected journalists against claims for defamation brought by unnamed members of a group based upon criticism voiced about the group under the \u201cgroup libel\u201d doctrine (Abramson v. Pataki, 278 F.3d 93 \u2013 no libel claim for unnamed union members based on statement accusing certain employees of criminal behaviour; Anyanwu v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 887 F.

The doctrine holds that an allegedly false statement about a group is not \u201cof and concerning\u201d any individual member of the group (Restatement [Second] of Torts, \u00a7 564A). Not only individual members but even elected leaders of an organisation are barred by the \u201cgroup libel\u201d doctrine from asserting individual defamation claims based on statements critical of the group (McMillen v.

The Law Lords considered that elected bodies should not be entitled to sue in defamation because any reputation they might have would belong to the public as a whole, which on balance benefits from uninhibited criticism. Allowing public bodies to sue was therefore an inappropriate use of taxpayers' money, one which may well be open to abuse by governments intolerant of criticism (Die Spoorbond and Anor. v.

Although a significant part of the letter was devoted to exposing his alleged wrongdoings, he was nevertheless not among the plaintiffs, who were collectively described as his \u201cclose circle\u201d, \u201cteam\u201d, \u201cacolytes\u201d or simply as \u201cthe regional authorities\u201d.",

The Court is not convinced that in reaching this finding the domestic courts applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 (see, for example, Grinberg\u00a0v. , no.\u00a023472/03, \u00a7\u00a027, 21\u00a0July 2005). It reiterates that a fundamental requirement of the law of defamation is that in order to give rise to a cause of action the defamatory statement must refer to a particular person. If all State officials were allowed to sue in defamation in connection with any statement critical of administration of State affairs, even in situations where the official was not referred to by name or in an otherwise identifiable manner, journalists would be inundated with lawsuits. Not only would that result in an excessive and disproportionate burden being placed on the media, straining their resources and involving them in endless litigation, it would also inevitably have a chilling effect on the press in the performance of its task of purveyor of information and public watchdog (see, mutatis mutandis, Radio Twist, A.S.\u00a0v. , no.\u00a062202/00, \u00a7\u00a053, ECHR 2006...).",

Mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant or that he was targeted by the criticism. Thus, in a freedom-of-expression case against Luxembourg, the Court noted the size of the country as a special feature to be taken into account, before accepting that the claimants in the defamation action were easily identifiable to listeners even though they had not been mentioned by name in the applicant's radio programme (see Thoma\u00a0v. , no.\u00a038432/97, \u00a7\u00a056, ECHR 2001III). In the present case, however, the Court does not discern any elements which could have warranted extending to all officials of a regional government the same protection that was appropriately afforded to a small group of employees of a named department in a particular ministry.",

The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article\u00a010 (see Lingens\u00a0v.

Their failure to embark on that analysis was accounted for by the state of the Russian law on defamation at the material time. As the Court has already found, it made no distinction between value judgments and statements of fact, referring uniformly to \u201cstatements\u201d (\u201csvedeniya\u201d), and proceeded from the assumption that any such \u201cstatement\u201d was amenable to proof in civil proceedings (see Grinberg, cited above, \u00a7 29; Zakharov\u00a0v. , no.\u00a014881/03, \u00a7\u00a029, 5 October 2006; and Karman\u00a0v.\u00a0, no.\u00a029372/02, \u00a7\u00a038, 14 December 2006, and the domestic law cited in paragraphs 23 and 24 above).",

However, since under the Court's case-law a value judgment must be based on sufficient facts in order to constitute a fair comment under Article 10, the difference between a value judgment and a statement of fact finally lies in the degree of factual proof which has to be established (see Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft\u00a0v. , no.\u00a039394/98, \u00a7\u00a040, ECHR 2003XI). The Court observes that the document at issue was the product of a collective effort reflecting, as it did, the concerns about the curtailing of the freedom of the press expressed by a representative sample of regional editors-in-chief, journalists and human-rights activists at a public round table. It was founded on their first-hand knowledge of the situation and experience of working in the media. The Court notes with concern that the domestic courts adopted an unusually high standard of proof, finding that a description of the governor's policy as \u201cdestructive\u201d would only be true if it was based on a scientifically sound comprehensive assessment of the social and economic development of the region (see paragraph 17 above). It stresses that the degree of precision which ought to be observed by a journalist when expressing his opinion on a matter of public concern could hardly be compared with that for making economic forecasts.",
