The investigation in case no. 24012 was instituted on 12 February 2003, that is, eight days after Ramzan Babushev's abduction. Such a postponement was liable per se to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. In the course of the following days the first applicants, her relative and two of her neighbours were questioned. It appears that these were the only investigative steps taken by the prosecutor's office. After that a number of essential investigative measures were not taken at all. For instance, the investigators failed to conduct a crime-scene examination at the applicants' house; failed to identify and question the officers from the Khattuni OVD who had been present during the abduction; failed to question the Vedeno district military commander or any other chief officers of local law-enforcement authorities who could have issued an order for Ramzan Babushev's arrest; failed to establish the identity of the owner of the APC which had been used by the abductors or to question a number of residents of the village who might have witnessed the abduction. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

The Court observes that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged acts or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this respect that while the adjourning or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the decisions to adjourn were made without the necessary investigative steps being taken, which led to numerous periods of inactivity and thus unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

For more than five years the applicants have not had any news of their close relative. During this period the applicants have applied to various official bodies with enquiries about their close relative, both in writing and in person. Despite their attempts, the applicants have never received any plausible explanation or information as to what became of their family member following his kidnapping. The responses received by the applicants mostly denied that the State was responsible for his arrest or simply informed them that an investigation was ongoing. The Court's findings under the procedural aspect of Article 2 are also of direct relevance here.",

At the same time the Court notes that the seventh applicant was born in July 2003, more than five months after Ramzan Babushev's disappearance. Having regard to this, the Court does not find that this applicant has suffered such distress and anguish as a result of the disappearance of her father that it would amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.",
