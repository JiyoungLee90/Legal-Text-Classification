In 2007 its members decided to discontinue the organisation\u2019s registration on grounds of alleged pressure and intimidation by the State. In particular, they complained of the refusal of the Ministry of Justice to register amendments to the organisation\u2019s articles of association, the repeated freezing of its bank account, the arbitrary arrest of its members, attempts to shut down its newspaper, among other things. Several of the organisation\u2019s leaders requested political asylum in western countries. It was decided to continue the organisation\u2019s activity under the same name but without registering it with the State authorities. It was also decided that the new unincorporated association would become the former organisation\u2019s successor. After removal of the organisation from the Government\u2019s list of non-governmental organisations on 2 June 2008, Hyde Park\u2019s activities continued as before on the basis of its new articles of association.

He accuses the police and the State authorities of illegal behaviour.
