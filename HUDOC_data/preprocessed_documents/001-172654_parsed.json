Moreover, the case was pending before the Administrative Court for more than three years and four months during the first round of the proceedings (see paragraph 10 above). These delays were solely attributable to the authorities. Finally, the Court observes that the present case concerns the applicant\u2019s request for an invalidity pension, which calls, as a matter of principle, for a swift termination of the proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Otto\u00a0v. Austria, no.\u00a012702/08, \u00a7 22, 22\u00a0October 2009).",
