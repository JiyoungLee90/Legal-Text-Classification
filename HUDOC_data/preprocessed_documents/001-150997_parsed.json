The court found that there was no impediment to imposing taxes on disguised dividends even if there was already a final criminal judgment in this respect, because imposing taxes on disguised dividends was not considered criminal. There could thus be no question of double jeopardy in this respect. The taxation decisions for the tax years 2002 and 2003 were thus upheld. As far as the tax surcharges and the right to impose additional taxes were concerned, the court found that the tax surcharges and the charges on tax fraud concerned the same matter. The tax surcharges thus related to acts in respect of which the applicant had already been convicted or acquitted. As both matters were pending simultaneously and not consecutively, there was no impediment to continuing the taxation proceedings. Even if the criminal proceedings became final while the taxation proceedings were still pending, this did not prevent the continuation of the taxation proceedings. There was thus no reason to change the tax surcharges as far as the corresponding criminal charges had been dismissed, namely, in respect of the disguised dividends received during the tax years 2002 and 2003. As far as the proceedings led to both criminal conviction and imposition of tax surcharges, the situation was contrary to Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention and the tax surcharges were therefore cancelled in respect of tax years 2001 to 2003.

In that case it found, inter alia, that even though a final judgment in a taxation case, in which tax surcharges had been imposed, prevented criminal charges being brought about the same matter, such preventive effect could not be applied to pending cases (lis pendens) crossing from administrative proceedings to criminal proceedings or vice versa. However, in July 2013 the Supreme Court reversed its line of interpretation, finding that charges for tax fraud could no longer be brought if there was already a decision to order or not to order tax surcharges in the same matter (KKO 2013:59).",

According to the Act, the tax authorities can, when making a tax decision, assess whether to impose a tax surcharge or to report the matter to the police. The tax authorities can decide not to impose a tax surcharge. If they have not reported the matter to the police, a tax surcharge can be imposed by a separate decision by the end of the calendar year following the actual tax decision. If the tax authorities have imposed tax surcharges, they can no longer report the same matter to the police unless, after imposing the tax surcharges, they have received evidence of new or recently revealed facts. If the tax authorities have reported the matter to the police, tax surcharges can, as a rule, no longer be imposed. The purpose of the Act is thus to ensure that a tax or a customs duty matter is processed and possibly punished in only one set of proceedings.

Finland (cited above). In that case the Court found that, regarding the first criterion, it was apparent that the tax surcharges were not classified as criminal but as part of the fiscal regime. This was, however, not decisive but the second criterion, the nature of the offence, was more important. The Court observed that the tax surcharges were imposed by general legal provisions applying to taxpayers generally. Further, under Finnish law, the tax surcharges were not intended as pecuniary compensation for damage but as a punishment to deter reoffending. The surcharges were thus imposed by a rule, the purpose of which was deterrent and punitive. The Court considered that this established the criminal nature of the offence. Regarding the third Engel criterion, the minor nature of the penalty did not remove the matter from the scope of Article 6. Hence, Article 6 applied under its criminal head, notwithstanding the minor nature of the tax surcharge (see Jussila v. Finland [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38). Consequently, proceedings involving tax surcharges are \u201ccriminal\u201d also for the purpose of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7.",

Russia [GC], no. 14939/03, \u00a7\u00a7 81-84, ECHR 2009) the existence of several approaches to the question of whether the offences for which an applicant was prosecuted were the same. The Court presented an overview of the existing three different approaches to this question. It found that the existence of a variety of approaches engendered legal uncertainty incompatible with the fundamental right not to be prosecuted twice for the same offence. It was against this background that the Court provided in that case a harmonised interpretation of the notion of the \u201csame offence\u201d for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. In the Zolotukhin case the Court thus found that an approach which emphasised the legal characterisation of the two offences was too restrictive on the rights of the individual. If the Court limited itself to finding that a person was prosecuted for offences having a different legal classification, it risked undermining the guarantee enshrined in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 rather than rendering it practical and effective as required by the Convention. Accordingly, the Court took the view that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 had to be understood as prohibiting the prosecution or trial of a second \u201coffence\u201d in so far as it arose from identical facts or facts which were substantially the same. It was therefore important to focus on those facts which constituted a set of concrete factual circumstances involving the same defendant and inextricably linked together in time and space, the existence of which had to be demonstrated in order to secure a conviction or institute criminal proceedings.",

This is the case when it is irrevocable, that is to say when no further ordinary remedies are available or when the parties have exhausted such remedies or have permitted the time-limit to expire without availing themselves of them\u2019\u201d. This approach is well entrenched in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, for example, Nikitin v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2004VIII; and Horciag v. Romania (dec.), no.\u00a0, 15 March 2005).",

However, under the Finnish system the criminal and the administrative sanctions are imposed by different authorities without the proceedings being in any way connected: both sets of proceedings follow their own separate course and become final independently from each other. Moreover, neither of the outcomes of the proceedings is taken into consideration by the other court or authority in determining the severity of the sanction, nor is there any other interaction between the relevant authorities. More importantly, the tax surcharges are imposed under the Finnish system following an examination of an applicant\u2019s conduct and his or her liability under the relevant tax legislation, which is independent from the assessments made in the criminal proceedings. This contrasts with the Court\u2019s earlier cases R.T. and Nilsson relating to driving licences, where the decision on withdrawal of the licence was directly based on an expected or final conviction for a traffic offence and thus did not contain a separate examination of the offence or conduct at issue. Therefore, it cannot be said that, under the Finnish system, there is a close connection, in substance and in time, between the criminal and the taxation proceedings.",
