Furthermore, it is to be recalled that Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio. Where the events in issue lie within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during that detention. In such a case, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u00a0[GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7\u00a7 151 and 152, ECHR 2012, with further case-law references), and any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by the person\u2019s own conduct is, in principle, an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7 88, 28 September 2015).",

However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, such a waiver must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance. Such a waiver need not be explicit, but it must be voluntary and constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right. Before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be. Moreover, the waiver must not run counter to any important public interest (see Simeonovi v.\u00a0Bulgaria\u00a0[GC], no. 21980/04, \u00a7 115, CEDH 2017 (extracts), with further reference).",

The immediate inspection of the place revealed two detached cattle heads and two respective identification tags which were used as evidence in the case (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). The Court accepts that after the applicant became legally represented by a lawyer, it was open for her in principle to say \u2013 and she did so \u2013 that she had not committed the crime; however, it is difficult to see how it would be possible to effectively retract the statement concerning the place of the crime after remains of animals had actually been found and inspected by the police.
