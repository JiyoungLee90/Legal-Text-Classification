In its view, only the questioning of the jurors would have been likely to shed any light on the nature of the communications, if any, and the influence they might have had on the jurors, as alleged by V. Furthermore, the text of the bailiff\u2019s letter does not enable the Court to determine the effectiveness of the inquiry conducted by his service. It merely stated, without providing any detail, that none of the jurors had reported any irregularities as regards the fulfilment of their duties.",
