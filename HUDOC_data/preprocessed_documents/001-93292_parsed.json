The Court additionally examined the conduct of the proceedings and found no undue or unjustified delays. Between 15 September and 23 November 2004 the District Court held nine hearings.

Thus, bearing in mind the severity of the charges and of the likely penalty, the applicant's detention was justified, in the Government's opinion, by a genuine public-interest requirement which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighed the rule of respect for individual liberty. Thirdly, the detention was aimed at ensuring the proper conduct of the proceedings and was justified by the risk that the applicant would obstruct the proceedings or tamper with the evidence. This risk stemmed from the fact that the proceedings concerned an organised criminal gang and that the applicant was a persistent offender. There existed a serious threat that the accused might attempt to influence some of the other defendants and the witnesses. Having said that, the Government concluded that only the isolation of the members of the group could prevent their colluding and coordinating their testimonies.",

The courts also took proper measures to ensure the speedy progress of the proceedings (see paragraph 17 above).

The length of the investigation and of the trial was justified by the complexity of the case. It should not be overlooked that, while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the efforts of the judges to clarify fully the facts in issue, to provide both the defence and the prosecution with all necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case and to give judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence to be imposed.",
