He had applied for a change of surname relying on section\u00a02(1)(10) of the Name Amendment Act, which prescribes as a reasonable ground for such change the pre-emption of unacceptable economic and social disadvantages. In the past he had been the victim of discrimination because of the \u201coriental origin\u201d of his surname and he had suffered such disadvantages. Accordingly, he had changed his name in compliance with the law, as in force at the time in question. However, he could not submit a diploma certificate to a potential employer without being forced to reveal his former surname. The need to submit the Vienna Municipality\u2019s decision of 12 February 2010 together with the diploma certificate would require explanations and would eventually lead to social stigmatisation. The university\u2019s refusal to amend the certificate had therefore violated his rights under Article 8 of the Convention.",

Examining the provisions in force at the time of the applicant\u2019s graduation, the Administrative Court found that the right to use an academic degree was linked to the person to whom that academic degree had been awarded, regardless of whether that person\u2019s name was subsequently changed. There was no subjective right for a person to have all previously issued documents changed after a change to that person\u2019s name. There was no provision compelling the university authorities to take specific steps in the event of a change in surname after a student had finished his studies, or after that student\u2019s academic degree had been awarded. The Constitutional Court had already stated in its decision of 11 June 2012 that there were no sufficient reasons to assume that the provisions applicable to the case would violate the applicant\u2019s rights under the Convention. Therefore, and on the basis of the applicant\u2019s complaint, as formulated, the Administrative Court likewise did not see any reason to institute proceedings for review of the compliance of the law with the Constitution (Gesetzespr\u00fcfungsverfahren) with the Constitutional Court.",

While according to the Court\u2019s case-law the selection of a person\u2019s name fell within the ambit of Article\u00a08 of the Convention, academic degrees were not part of the name but rather a facultative addition to it, indicating acquired qualifications forming a prerequisite for certain offices and professions. Thus, there had been no interference with Article\u00a08 of the Convention as the addition of a degree to one\u2019s name had no identification function. Furthermore, the applicant was in any event free to use the awarded academic degree. He was entitled to change his name and to use the new name. He could provide full proof to everyone that he was legally entitled to hold the academic degree \u201cMagister iuris\u201d by presenting a current excerpt from the Central Personal Status Register. As a result, the refusal to issue a new diploma certificate did not constitute an interference with Article 8.",

The notion of \u201crespect\u201d is not clear cut, especially as far as positive obligations are concerned: having regard to the diversity of the practices followed and the situations obtaining in the Contracting States, the notion\u2019s requirements will vary considerably from case to case (see Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a028957/95, \u00a7\u00a072, ECHR\u00a02002VI). Nonetheless, certain factors have been considered relevant for the assessment of the content of those positive obligations on States. Some of them relate to the applicant. They concern the importance of the interest at stake and whether \u201cfundamental values\u201d or \u201cessential aspects\u201d of private life are in issue (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7\u00a027, and Gaskin, cited above, \u00a7 49), or the impact on an applicant of a discordance between the social reality and the law, the coherence of the administrative and legal practices within the domestic system being regarded as an important factor in the assessment carried out under Article 8 (see B. v.\u00a0France, 25 March 1992, \u00a7\u00a063, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0232C, and Christine Goodwin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07778). Other factors relate to the impact of the alleged positive obligation at stake on the State concerned. The question here is whether the alleged obligation is narrow and precise or broad and indeterminate (see Botta v.\u00a0Italy, 24 February 1998, \u00a7\u00a035, Reports 1998I), or about the extent of any burden the obligation would impose on the State (see Rees v. the United Kingdom, 17\u00a0October 1986, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04344, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0106, and Christine Goodwin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a086-88).\u201d",

Even though it cannot be said that fundamental values or essential aspects of private life have been impaired, the Court, nevertheless, accepts that the impact of the lack of a new or amended diploma certificate on the applicant as a graduated lawyer is significant, while the alleged positive obligation can be considered relatively narrow and precise and the possible impact on the State does not appear to be severe (see H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066 in fine).",

The Court cannot see how the issuing of an amended diploma certificate or a duplicate with the new name could adversely affect the reliability of such a document or of the award of the academic degree itself. The Court does not disregard the fact that such measures may constitute a certain administrative burden; however, this in itself cannot justify an unconditional refusal of the applicant\u2019s request, since the university seems free, for example, to impose charges and to put strict requirements in place for such services. In fact, the refusal of the applicant\u2019s request was based purely on formal considerations, without taking into account the specific reasons advanced by him for his request, and therefore without conducting any balancing exercise of the competing interests (compare Akta\u015f and Aslaniskender v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 47). Moreover, the Court cannot discern any competing private interests that could justify the refusal of the issuance of an amended certificate.",
