In a great number of cases, the Court has consistently found a violation of the applicants\u2019 rights on account of a lack of sufficient personal space during their pre-trial detention. The present case is no exception in this respect. In view of the foregoing, the Court accepts that the applicant was detained in severely overcrowded cells for over a year.

Their submissions were based on the statements of the remand prison officers made some four years after the events under consideration. Moreover, the Court cannot but note a certain discrepancy between this and other cases as far as the data submitted are concerned. For instance, in the case of Skachkov the Government submitted that between 11\u00a0February and 8\u00a0August 2003, cell no.\u00a0159 had accommodated twenty-two detainees (see Skachkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a018), while in the present case the national authorities affirmed that in the periods from 18\u00a0February to 23\u00a0April 2003 and from 25\u00a0April to 15\u00a0August 2003, the same cell had accommodated only thirteen inmates.

Austria, no. 67175/01, \u00a7\u00a031, ECHR 2005XII). In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), a hearing is required (see Nikolova v.
