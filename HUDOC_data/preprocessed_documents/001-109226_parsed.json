The Chamber also noted that the Government had submitted no tangible information on the authorities\u2019 attitude with regard to the applicant\u2019s status during the day of 16 July 2003. They had provided no document enabling the Chamber to determine whether or not the applicant had left the prosecution service headquarters, for example information recorded in logbooks regarding persons entering or leaving the NAP, or any steps taken by the authorities to inform the applicant that he was entitled to leave the building. The Chamber further noted that during that same day, the prosecution service had opened a criminal investigation in respect of the applicant and that, in the evening, it had ordered that he be placed in pre-trial detention. The sequence of the day\u2019s events as they appeared in the case file \u2013 interview, opening of the investigation, a second interview as an accused, placement in pre-trial detention \u2013 led the Chamber to conclude that the applicant had remained in the prosecution service headquarters all day and had not been free to leave.

In the instant case, no warrant had been issued for the applicant\u2019s placement in police custody. The Chamber also pointed out that by the order of 16 July 2003, the prosecutor had instructed that the applicant was to be placed in pre-trial detention for three days. However, the period specifically indicated in that order, namely from 10\u00a0p.m. on 16 July 2003 to 10 p.m. on 18 July 2003, corresponded in reality to only two days of pre-trial detention. The Chamber noted in that regard that, having been issued on the basis of a prosecutor\u2019s order in accordance with domestic law, the warrant for pre-trial detention could cover only the same period as that specified in the order. In the instant case, although it did not indicate the time from which the measure took effect, that warrant could not constitute a legal basis for the preceding period, which was not mentioned in the order.",

The Government added that although the applicant had initially stated that he had reported to the NAP at around 9 a.m., he had indicated the time with pinpoint accuracy in his aforementioned written observations, that is, 8.45\u00a0a.m. The Government conceded, however, that the applicant had entered the NAP premises at 9 a.m.",

In the absence of a consensus among States, the Court could not impose guiding principles. Accordingly, States had to enjoy a wide margin of appreciation with regard to the regulations applicable at that stage of the proceedings, in accordance with their own criminal policies. Furthermore, the Government pointed out that the State\u2019s criminal legislation should not spell out such rules in detail because the investigation authorities needed to be afforded effective means of uncovering the truth. They argued that detailed regulations, affording various guarantees to individuals summoned before the prosecution service before any criminal proceedings had been opened against them, could impede the activities of the investigation authorities and would be likely to deprive the criminal proceedings of their purpose. Romanian law set out procedural guarantees for the parties to criminal proceedings, in particular after they had commenced. In the instant case, in the framework of the preliminary investigation, the applicant had been informed of the purpose of the inquiries and had been invited to make a statement in that respect. Once the criminal investigation had been opened in respect of him, he had been fully able to enjoy his rights, having been duly informed of the nature of the proceedings and having had the opportunity to be assisted by a lawyer of his choosing when making his statements.

In proclaiming the \u201cright to liberty\u201d, paragraph 1 of Article 5 contemplates the physical liberty of the person; its aim is to ensure that no one should be deprived of that liberty in an arbitrary fashion. It is not concerned with mere restrictions on the liberty of movement; such restrictions are governed by Article 2 of Protocol\u00a0No. 4. The Court also points out that paragraph 1 of Article\u00a05 makes it clear that the guarantees it contains apply to \u201ceveryone\u201d. Subparagraphs\u00a0(a) to (f) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 contain an exhaustive list of permissible grounds on which persons may be deprived of their liberty and no deprivation of liberty will be lawful unless it falls within one of those grounds. Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see, among other judgments, Guzzardi v. Italy, 6\u00a0November\u00a01980, \u00a7 92, Series A no. 39, and A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7\u00a7 162-164, 19 February 2009).",

However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a  has violated fundamental rights (see Nachova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 147, ECHR 2005-VII).",

It reiterates its case-law under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention to the effect that where the events in issue lie within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII; \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7 85, ECHR 1999-IV; and Rupa v.\u00a0Romania (no.\u00a01), no. 58478/00, \u00a7 97, 16 December 2008). The Court has already found that these considerations apply also to disappearances examined under Article 5 of the Convention, where, although it has not been proved that a person has been taken into custody by the authorities, it is possible to establish that he or she was officially summoned by the authorities, entered a place under their control and has not been seen since. In such circumstances, the onus is on the Government to provide a plausible and satisfactory explanation as to what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned was not detained by the authorities, but left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty (see Tan\u0131\u015f and Others v. Turkey, no. 65899/01, \u00a7 160, ECHR 2005-VIII, and Yusupova and Zaurbekov v. Russia, no. 22057/02, \u00a7 52, 9\u00a0October\u00a02008). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that, again in the context of a complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, it has required proof in the form of concordant inferences before the burden of proof is shifted to the respondent Government (see \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2005IV).",

If that condition is satisfied, the Court will be able to consider that he was not free to leave, particularly when investigative measures were under way. It could therefore require the Government to provide a detailed hour-by-hour report on what happened in the premises in question and to account for the time spent there by the applicant. The Government would then have to provide satisfactory and convincing written evidence to support their version of the facts. Failure to provide such evidence would enable conclusions to be drawn as to the merits of the applicant\u2019s allegations.",

Thus, children who had spent two hours at a police station in order to be questioned without being locked up were not found to have been deprived of their liberty (see X v. Germany, no. 8819/79, Commission decision of 19\u00a0March\u00a01981); nor was an applicant who had been taken to a police station for humanitarian reasons, but who was free to walk about on the premises and did not ask to leave (see Guenat v. Switzerland (dec.), no.\u00a024722/94, Commission decision of 10 April 1995). Likewise, the Commission attached decisive weight to the fact that an applicant had never intended to leave the courtroom where he was taking part in a hearing (see E.G. v. Austria, no. 22715/93, Commission decision of 15 May 1996). The case-law has evolved since then as the purpose of measures by the authorities depriving applicants of their liberty no longer appears decisive for the Court\u2019s assessment of whether there has in fact been a deprivation of liberty.

Firstly, the remedy in question was not directly open to the parties, since only the Procurator General could make use of it. However, the latter was the hierarchical superior of the prosecutor who had ordered that the applicant be placed in detention and who had requested the courts to extend that measure. The prosecutor had had an opportunity to present his arguments on this matter during the ordinary proceedings, but had failed to do so. Secondly, the Chamber noted that Article 410 of the CCP, by which an application to have a final judicial decision quashed could be lodged where the decision was \u201ccontrary to the law\u201d, was too vague to make intervention in the proceedings through an extraordinary remedy of this kind foreseeable.

It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski, cited above, \u00a7 52; Mooren v.

In making its assessment, the Court has not in general found it necessary to have recourse to questions of the burden and standard of proof. Where the underlying facts have been found by national courts in domestic proceedings, the Strasbourg Court will normally require cogent elements to lead it to depart from those findings, even though it is not constrained by the national court\u2019s legal conclusions as to whether or not those facts give rise to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1. Where, as in this case, there has been no such judicial determination and there is a factual dispute between the parties, the Court\u2019s assessment has normally been made on the basis of a free evaluation of all the material before it, including such inferences as may flow from the agreed facts and the submissions of the parties.",

However, the judgment goes on to find, on the contrary, that in the present case the burden of proof shifted to the respondent Government once the applicant had provided prima facie concordant evidence capable of showing that he was under the exclusive control of the authorities on the day of the events in question.",

I have considerable hesitations as to whether it is, in any event, a case suitable for applying a reverse burden. The two categories of case cited in paragraph 89 of the judgment, in which the burden of proof is shifted to the respondent Government \u2013 namely, cases under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention concerning deaths occurring and injuries sustained in custody and those under Article 5 \u00a7 1 concerning disappearances of persons last seen in military or police establishments to which they had been summoned to appear \u2013 are far removed from the circumstances of the present case. In particular, while there are compelling reasons, in a case where an individual has been officially summoned to premises under the control of the authorities and has not been seen since, for shifting the evidential burden to the authorities to prove that he has voluntarily left the premises, no such reasons apply in the present case, where the question is whether the factual circumstances are such that the individual is to be regarded as having been deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1. The mere fact, which is relied on in the judgment, that the present applicant entered premises which were under the control of the authorities pursuant to a summons is not in my view sufficient to justify placing an evidential burden on the authorities.",

While it may be true that, once he had entered the NAP premises, he might have had problems in trying to leave without permission, the same applies to many persons summoned to testify before a police authority, a prosecutor or a court. Such persons are under a duty to appear and to remain in place for such time as is necessary for their depositions to be taken, which means that they are not free to leave as long as investigative measures are under way (see paragraph\u00a090 of the judgment). This limitation applies not only to persons summoned in their capacity as a \u201cwitness\u201d, but also to those \u201csuspects\u201d (that is, persons already charged) who have not been detained on remand. Even if they may not be physically restrained to prevent them from leaving without permission, the law provides for sanctions, criminal as well as administrative, to secure their compliance. It is regarded as obvious, including under the Court\u2019s case-law, that in the context of a criminal investigation, both the duty to appear and the duty not to leave before being permitted to do so are regarded as restrictions on freedom of movement.",

He, together with several other colleagues, received an order from his hierarchical superior to report to the NAP. Hence, his presence in the NAP premises resulted from due application of the discipline he was subject to. The very essence of military discipline consists of situations when a subordinate must go where he or she is ordered to go and remain there as long as he or she is ordered to stay. It may also include punishments for disregarding an order and even physical restraint in the event of non-compliance. Such restrictions on movement constitute an inherent part of the operation of any armed formation and have nothing to do with deprivation of liberty.",
