However, the Ministry of the Interior informed the applicant's representative that the procedure regarding the applicant had been suspended pending the outcome of the proceedings before the Court.

In the present case, the Court observes that in May 2008 the applicant's representative asked the authorities to conduct a medical examination of the applicant, noting that she was suffering from a serious illness. Subsequently, in June and July 2008 the applicant underwent a number of medical examinations in relation to her past medical operation. As a result of these examinations, the doctors observed that the applicant was not suffering from any illness. Given that the authorities secured sufficiently detailed medical examinations of the applicant and her medical history rapidly after her representative's request, the Court concludes that the applicant did have access to adequate medical assistance.
