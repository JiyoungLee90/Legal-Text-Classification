It requires in addition, however, that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5 (art. 5), namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see inter alia the van der Leer v. the Netherlands judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 170-A, p. 12, para. 22, and the Wassink v. the Netherlands judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 185-A, p. 11, para. 24). Consequently, in order to justify detention, the fact that a person is \"of unsound mind\" must be established conclusively, except in case of emergency.
