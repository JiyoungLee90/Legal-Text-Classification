It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person. The notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of its guarantees (see\u00a0Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a02346/02, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2002-III). This Article also protects a right to identity and personal development, and the right to establish relationships with other human beings and the outside world. It may include activities of a professional or business nature. There is, therefore, a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d. There are a number of elements relevant to a consideration of whether a person\u2019s private life is concerned in measures effected outside a person\u2019s home or private premises. In this connection, a person\u2019s reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, though not necessarily conclusive, factor (see\u00a0P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a044787/98, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57, ECHR 2001-IX).",

If individuals are to be protected from arbitrary interference by the authorities with the rights guaranteed under Article 8, a legal framework and very strict limits on such powers are called for.

This served as a basis for then asserting that such \u201cgoods\u201d could be lawfully subjected to the sampling procedure, without any further consideration of the context in which the customs control concerned the non-material digital contents (electronic data amounting to information or images, for instance) accessed by way of \u201copening\u201d a \u201ccontainer\u201d (the laptop) (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above). Before the Court the Government attempted to supplement that consideration by references to further provisions of Russian law, such as the Civil Code. However, those provisions were not part of the domestic assessment and, in any event, do not seem to provide a sufficiently sound legal basis for copying electronic data in the customs context. Having regard to the reasoning of the domestic decisions, the Court is not satisfied that the combined reading of the relevant provisions of the Customs Code (a \u201cfederal statute\u201d within the meaning of Article 55 of the Constitution, cited in paragraph 27 above) and other legal rules constituted a foreseeable interpretation of national law and provided a legal basis for the copying of electronic data contained in electronic documents located in such a \u201ccontainer\u201d as a laptop.",

The Court has also taken note of the Government\u2019s submission that it was the chief officer of the customs unit who was empowered to authorise an examining officer to carry out an inspection and sampling. However, the Court is not satisfied that there was a clear requirement at the authorisation stage that the inspection and, first and foremost, the copying be subjected to a requirement of any assessment of the proportionality of the measure (compare Gillan and Quinton, cited above, \u00a7\u00a080, where stop-and-search powers were additionally subject to prompt confirmation by the Secretary of State and judicial review).",

For its part, the Court refers in this connection to the appeal court\u2019s finding in the applicant\u2019s case that the customs control had to be based on the principle of selectiveness and, as a rule, had to be limited to such forms of control as were sufficient for ensuring compliance with customs legislation. It was also stated that when carrying out a customs check, the customs authority was allowed to take samples of goods which were needed for further assessment. However, both the domestic court decisions and the Government\u2019s submissions before the Court are limited to general assertions about the risk-profiling approach and do not specify how it was applied to the applicant. In fact, when carrying out their review of the customs officers\u2019 actions, the courts did not even refer to the abovementioned Instruction. Moreover, the reference to risk management (including risk profiling) does not address the matter of the extensive copying of the data from the applicant\u2019s laptop, which is at the heart of the present complaint. The Court does not overlook that the domestic courts pointed out that extensive copying was \u201cneeded\u201d because of the diverse nature of the \u201cgoods\u201d to be sampled, which was electronic data in the present case. In the Court\u2019s view, it is usual for an electronic device to contain various types of electronic files (text, photographs, videos and others) and that the contents may vary even within the same type of file. In addition to the abovementioned considerations relating to the legal basis in this case, it is evident that the usual approach to the sampling by customs of \u201cgoods\u201d was not adequate as regards electronic data (see also paragraph 80 above).",

However, the Court is not convinced that in order to avoid arbitrariness it was indispensable for the customs officer to have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity stricto sensu (as being in breach of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), that is some objective basis for suspecting the particular person of \u201ccriminal\u201d activity in the particular circumstances of a given situation taken as a whole. By way of comparison, the Court reiterates that it is also possible to envisage a justified interference with Article\u00a08 rights by way of search-and-seizure or comparable measures in contexts other than those of a criminal investigation, in relation to unlawful conduct punishable under other procedures (see, for instance, DELTA PEK\u00c1RNY a.s. v.\u00a0the Czech Republic, no. 97/11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-83, 2\u00a0October 2014).",

Indeed, the Russian Customs Code linked its various procedures to the need for \u201censuring compliance with customs legislation\u201d. The present case concerns one specific context where imputed \u201cnoncompliance\u201d is related to the ban set out in Presidential Decree no.\u00a0310 of 23 March 1995 read together with the Federal Customs Authority\u2019s order no.\u00a0677 of 10\u00a0November 1995 and Article 13 of the Customs Code of 2003 (see paragraphs 29, 35-36 above).
