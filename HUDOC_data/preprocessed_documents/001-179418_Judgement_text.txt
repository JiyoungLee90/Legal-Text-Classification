The case originated in an application (no. 332/13) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Mehmet Ali Kaya (“the applicant”), on 1 November 2012.
The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 3 November 2016 the complaints concerning the alleged unfairness of the proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court on account of the applicant’s inability to access the classified documents submitted by the Ministry of Defence, and the alleged independence and impartiality of the tribunal because of the presence of two military officers sitting on the bench who did not enjoy the same judicial guarantees as the other military judges, were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Diyarbakır.
The applicant was an officer in the Army. On 1 August 1989, relying on classified investigation reports, the applicant’s contract was terminated and he was dismissed from his office. At the time, he did not have access to the classified reports and there was no remedy against this decision. Subsequently, following the adoption of a new law in 2011, the applicant once again applied to the Ministry of Defence on 7 April 2011, and asked for reinstatement. His request was rejected.
On 4 August 2011 the applicant initiated proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court to have the annulment of the decision of the Ministry of Defence. During the proceedings, the defendant party submitted classified documents for the court’s consideration. On 24 April 2012 the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s case. This decision was served on the applicant on 15 May 2012.
A description of the domestic law at the material time can be found in Yavuz v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 29870/96, 25 May 2000), and Tanışma v. Turkey (no. 32219/05, §§ 29-47, 17 November 2015).
