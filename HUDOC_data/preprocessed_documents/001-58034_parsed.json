Even supposing that inflation had not been taken into account when calculating those amounts, the Government relied on the Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that if the compensation was reasonably proportional to the value of the expropriated property, the conditions laid down in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) were satisfied.

Abnormally lengthy delays in the payment of compensation for expropriation lead to increased financial loss for the person whose land has been expropriated, putting him in a position of uncertainty especially when the monetary depreciation which occurs in certain States is taken into account.

Since the rate of statutory interest was lower than the rate of inflation, she suffered a loss. Inflation is and has been a serious problem in many countries and governments view the fight against inflation as a major part of their economic policy. Rules on human rights are not an effective instrument in this battle. The general impact of inflation means that it affects economic life as a whole and the repercussions on individuals, even if frequently serious, are rarely - or at least not in this case, in my opinion - individual and specific.
