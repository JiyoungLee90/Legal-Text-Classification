However, in the Court\u2019s view the present case is not a civil-law dispute in the traditional sense, nor was the State\u2019s role limited to providing a judicial forum for the determination of such a dispute. In this connection the Court first notes that the contract of sale whereby the Sisak Ironworks Holding company sold the applicant the flat in question was declared null and void as being contrary to mandatory rules of the Sale to Occupier Act. The nature and rationale of that Act suggest that it is legislation which has a predominantly (if not entirely) public law character. This is best illustrated by the fact that under the legislation in question, former socially-owned companies (such as Sisak Ironworks Holding in the present case), even after they had been privatised and transformed into private companies, had to sell the flats in their ownership to those who held specially protected tenancies in respect of those flats under favourable conditions for the buyers (see paragraph 26 above). What is more, the competent State Attorney had to approve such contracts (see paragraph 27 above). It is precisely for that reason that the Court has not, in similar cases, confined itself to examining whether the judgments of domestic courts depriving applicants of the ownership of flats purchased under the Sale to Occupier Act were arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see Gashi, cited above, and Pavlinovi\u0107 v. Croatia (dec.), nos. 17124/05 and 17126/05, 3 September 2009). Rather, it has held that such judgments amounted to an interference with the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and examined whether the interference was provided for by law, was in the public interest and was proportionate. Moreover, at time when the flat in question was sold to the applicant, in 1994, the Sisak Ironworks Holding was still State-owned and State-controlled (compare to Ali\u0161i\u0107 and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 60642/08, \u00a7\u00a7 115-117, ECHR 2014; R. Ka\u010dapor and Others v.

The first, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph and is of a general nature, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third rule, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property, are to be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among other authorities, Draon v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 1513/03, \u00a7\u00a069, 6\u00a0October 2005).",

However, until 1997 the majority of the capital of Sisak Ironworks Holding was still State-owned. The Sisak County Court\u2019s judgment of 22 November 2007 declaring null and void the contract of sale from which the applicant derived his ownership constituted an interference with his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions, as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. As to the question whether the interference was covered by the first or second paragraph of that Article, the Court has already found that declaring title to property null and void is to be examined under the first paragraph, second sentence, as it amounts to a deprivation of possessions (see Gashi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02728, and Velikovi and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, nos. 43278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01 and 194/02, \u00a7\u00a7 159-160, 15 March 2007).

Holding otherwise would, inter alia, amount to sanctioning an inappropriate allocation of scarce public resources, which in itself would be contrary to the public interest (see Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, \u00a7 73, 15\u00a0September 2009). On the other hand, the need to correct an old \u201cwrong\u201d should not disproportionately interfere with a new right which has been acquired by an individual relying in good faith on the legitimacy of the actions of a public authority (see, mutatis mutandis, Pincov\u00e1 and Pinc v. the Czech Republic, no. 36548/97, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2002VIII). In other words, State authorities which fail to put in place or adhere to their own procedures should not be allowed to profit from their wrongdoing or to escape their obligations (see Lelas, cited above, \u00a7 74). The risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State itself and any errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individuals concerned (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Pincov\u00e1 and Pinc, cited above, \u00a7 58; Gashi, cited above, \u00a7 40; and Trgo v. Croatia, no. 35298/04, \u00a7\u00a067, 11 June 2009). In the context of the revocation of a title to property which has been granted erroneously, the \u201cgood governance\u201d principle may not only impose on the authorities an obligation to act promptly in correcting their mistake (see Moskal, cited above, \u00a7 69), but may also necessitate the payment of adequate compensation or another type of appropriate reparation to its former good-faith holder (see Pincov\u00e1 and Pinc, cited above, \u00a7 53; To\u015fcu\u0163\u0103 and Others v.

The applicant was aware of the circumstances in which S.K. and Z.K. had left the flat in Sisak since he had maintained contact with them. He was also aware, at the time when he bought the flat at issue, that Z.K. and S.K. had applied for the reopening of the civil proceedings in which their specially protected tenancy of that flat had been terminated. In these circumstances, the Court considers that it cannot be entirely ruled out that the applicant did not act in good faith or that the defect rendering the contract of sale null and void was partly attributable to him.",
