He said that after the briefing a chief lieutenant checked the weapons of all soldiers taking part in the practice, and ordered two soldiers to step aside and clean their weapons. Then the captain announced to the soldiers the manner in which the practice would be conducted and the safety measures. They were to fire solely upon his command, and stop firing immediately if he so ordered, or if they received a visual signal from the watchtower, or if they noticed people, animals or machines near the targets. The firing range was delimited by markers at both ends. It was strictly forbidden, under any circumstances, to point a firearm outside the firing range. If a firearm jammed, the soldier had to report it immediately, remain still, put the safety catch down and not touch the firearm. The soldiers fired in groups of four, with those waiting their turn having unloaded weapons. The soldiers first went to the starting point, received magazines containing twelve rounds, and put them in their bags, while keeping their rifles on their backs. When they received the order to fire, they had to run to the firing position with their rifles pointing towards the firing range. Then, on a further order, they had to take the magazines out of the bags, put them onto the rifles, load a round, lift the safety catch and report that they were ready to fire. When ordered to fire, after the captain had made sure that each of them had loaded his weapon and was ready to fire, they put the safety catch in automatic firing mode and started firing. After finishing firing, they had to report, remove the magazine, and, when ordered, fire a control shot towards the firing range and put the safety catch on. After that they had to stand up, have their rifles checked by the captain with the magazine removed, fire a second control shot, and hand back the spent cartridges. At the time of the incident a group of soldiers was firing, with the captain standing about two metres behind them. Immediately after hearing the applicant's screams the captain ordered the soldiers to stop firing and empty their weapons, and then checked the weapons.",

It was established that the spent cartridge case handed over to the investigator by SergeantMajor G.I. did not come from the applicant's rifle.

Moreover, the incident took place during planned shooting exercises, in which the risk to the applicant's life and health was minimal. Those exercises were conducted at a special firing ground, under the supervision and command of professional military instructors. They complied strictly with the applicable rules, and were conducted in broad daylight and in good weather conditions. The authorities thus had no reason to expect risks that would be higher than the usual ones inherent in such activities. The firearm assigned to the applicant was checked beforehand and the applicant was apprised of the applicable safety measures. When the incident happened he was given immediate first aid and taken to hospital. He had not been behaving unusually prior to the incident. The apparent reason for the shooting was his failure to follow the instructions on how to handle the firearm assigned to him.",

Secondly, Dr G.D.'s conclusion about the range at which the shot had been fired could also not be trusted because it was based solely on medical documents and not on a personal examination of the applicant. Moreover, Dr G.D. had himself stated that this matter could be clarified solely through an expert examination of the applicant's clothes. Thirdly, the authorities did not try to elucidate the discrepancies between the statements of Chief Lieutenant P.P. and medical officer N.G. about the noise they had heard while standing under the watchtower. The applicant further asserted that he did not shoot himself. He did not have bullets in his weapon, as evident from the statement of SergeantMajor G.I. His weapon was in good working order and no extra force was needed to push the breechblock forward, which was the apparent cause of the shot. This was established by both Captain P.P., who checked the firearm after the incident, and by the ballistics experts. Lastly, no spent cartridge case was found near the applicant, and the tests showed that he did not have gunpowder residue on his palms or wristbands.",

It finds that a procedural obligation arose to investigate the circumstances in which the applicant sustained his life-threatening injury, for four reasons. First, he was a conscript soldier under the care and responsibility of the military authorities (see Abdullah Yilmaz v. , no. 21899/02, \u00a7 58, 17 June 2008; and also Ataman v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 46252/99, \u00a7 64, 27 April 2006; Salg\u0131n v.

Secondly, he suffered his injury in a military firing range, which was an area under the exclusive control of the State's armed forces (see, mutatis mutandis, Beker v. , no. 27866/03, \u00a7 42, 24 March 2009). Thirdly, the obligation to investigate is not confined to situations where it has been established that a deadly attack was caused by an agent of the State (see Ya\u015fa, cited above, \u00a7 100, and Ergi v. Turkey, 28 July 1998, \u00a7 82, Reports 1998IV). Lastly, the circumstances in which the applicant sustained his injury, which undoubtedly resulted from the use of a deadly firearm, were suspicious and called for an explanation (see, mutatis mutandis, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 105, ECHR\u00a02000VII, and Slimani v. France, no. 57671/00, \u00a7\u00a7 30 and 47, ECHR\u00a02004IX (extracts)). Indeed, this need for scrutiny was acknowledged by the national authorities, which opened an investigation the very day of the incident (see paragraph 11 above).",

The Court would add that the nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfy the minimum threshold of effectiveness depend on the circumstances of each particular case. They must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see, among other authorities, Velikova v. , no. 41488/98, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2000VI). To be effective, an investigation must be objective and thorough; its effectiveness cannot be gauged simply on the basis of the number of reports made, witnesses questioned or other investigative measures taken (see Anguelova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, \u00a7 144, ECHR 2002IV).",

In the following months he conducted further interviews in order to gather information about the applicant's state of mind before the incident (see paragraph 24 above). He commissioned and obtained a medical expert report just a few days after the incident (see paragraphs 14 and 25 above), and later obtained a biological, a ballistics and a physiochemical experts reports (see paragraphs 26, 27 and 28 above). The medical expert, whose professional competence and impartiality have not been called into question, was able to determine that the shot which had wounded the applicant had been fired from a close distance. Indeed, that fact was later confirmed by the private expert approached by the applicant's representative before the Court (see paragraph 36 above).",

The duty to investigate requires thoroughness and effectiveness in deploying all possible and reasonable means leading to the proper and uncontroversial identification of the circumstances and of those individuals possibly responsible. In cases where the mechanism of the injury is established and where any causal link between that injury and possible omissions on part of the authorities is excluded in an uncontroversial manner, it would be unreasonable and unnecessary to require investigative scrutiny over further circumstances, like the origin of the cartridge or the organisation of the shooting exercise in the instant case.",

Whether the shot was produced at a very close range or was a direct contact one appears to be irrelevant for the clarification of the circumstances. It is regrettable that, not least due to the actions of Lieutenant M. (see paragraph 20 above), the authorities were not able positively to identify the firearm from which the shot had originated (see paragraphs 27 and 34 above), that they did not clarify how the applicant's rifle could have produced a shot when apparently not loaded (see paragraphs 16, 20 and 21 above), that they did not try to identify and question the soldiers who were shooting on the range at the time when the applicant was wounded, and that they were not able to establish whether the blood taken from the scene of the incident belonged to the applicant (see paragraph 26 above). However, in the circumstances those omissions were not crucial because the available evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion reached by the investigator (see, mutatis mutandis, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 77 in fine, ECHR\u00a02002II).

However, it does not find it appropriate to adopt the same approach in the present case, for three reasons. First, unlike Mr Beker, the applicant in the present case did not die. Secondly, in contrast to the case of Mr Beker (ibid., \u00a7 49), the applicant and his family were not fully excluded from the ensuing investigation. Indeed, the applicant was twice able to challenge the investigation's conclusions before the higher prosecutor's offices, which gave reasoned decisions (see paragraphs 3134 above). Thirdly, as pointed out above, in spite of certain regrettable omissions, the investigation was effective and did provide a plausible explanation for the origin of the applicant's injury. Therefore, the Court does not consider that the burden of proof in the present can be shifted to the Government. It reiterates in this connection that the distribution of that burden is intrinsically linked to, among other things, the specificity of the facts of the case (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 147).",

In the circumstances of the present case, the applicant's allegation that he was shot by another serviceman cannot be discarded as prima facie untenable.

This duty extends, in appropriate circumstances, to a positive obligation to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual, or from self-harm (see, among other authorities, Ataman, cited above, \u00a7 54).

Indeed, the experts later found that the case handed by SergeantMajor G.I. to the investigator had not housed a cartridge from the applicant's rifle (see paragraph 27 of the judgment), and the prosecuting authorities found that it would be virtually impossible to test all spent cartridge cases in order to determine whether one of them originated from the applicant's rifle (see paragraph 34 of the judgment).",
