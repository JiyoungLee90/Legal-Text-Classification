It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the organs of the Convention and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see Walker v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), no. 34979/97, ECHR 2000-I). In particular, where an accused person\u2019s pre-trial detention is broken into several non-consecutive periods and where applicants are free to lodge complaints about pre-trial detention while they are at liberty, those non-consecutive periods should not be assessed as a whole, but separately. This, in the Court\u2019s view, respects more fully the purposes of the six-month rule referred to above. Therefore, once at liberty, an applicant is obliged to bring any complaint which he or she may have concerning pre-trial detention within six months of the date of actual release. It follows that periods of pre-trial detention which end more than six months before an applicant lodges a complaint before the Court cannot be examined, having regard to the provisions of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, with reference to a complaint concerning the length of pre-trial detention under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, Idalov v.

Switzerland, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 62, and Pe\u0161a v. Croatia, no. 40523/08, \u00a7\u00a0138, 8\u00a0April 2010). It has been the Court\u2019s consistent approach that the right to the presumption of innocence will be violated if a judicial decision or a statement by a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects the opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved guilty according to law. Even in the absence of any formal finding, it suffices that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of public officials\u2019 choice of words in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see B\u00f6hmer v. Germany, no. 37568/97, \u00a7\u00a7 54 and 56, 3\u00a0October 2002, and Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v. Slovakia, no. 65559/01, \u00a7\u00a7 88 and\u00a089, 27\u00a0February 2007). The issue of whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Pe\u0161a, cited above, \u00a7 141).",

In this context, the impugned expression does indeed seem to refer to the classification of the crime of which the applicant was accused, as indicated by the President of the District Court. Furthermore, at the beginning of the decision, the District Court expressly stated that the applicant had been accused of a criminal offence. It also noted in the concluding part of the decision that the proceedings had not yet been completed and that a number of investigative steps had yet to be taken in order to establish the truth in the case (see paragraph 17 above).",

Read as a whole, the impugned decision confined itself in taking into account the suspicions and accusations which weighed against the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Marziano v.
