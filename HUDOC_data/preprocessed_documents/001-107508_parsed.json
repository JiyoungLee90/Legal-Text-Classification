On 25\u00a0September 1998 the court-appointed architect was requested to conduct an on-site inspection to determine whether the property built by the Government was indeed built on the applicants\u2019 property and what use was being made of the ground floor. The report was submitted on 5\u00a0January\u00a01999; however, the court-appointed expert failed to draw up an estimate of the value of the property in issue and the applicants\u2019 request for additional terms of reference to be given to the expert was rejected on 16 December 1999 on the basis that the value of the property was irrelevant to the merits of the claim.

It held that, since the applicants were still owners of the said property, the taking under both titles could not be considered a deprivation of property but a control of the use of such property. This control had been necessary in view of the fact that the property had been ruined in the war and that there had been a need to provide social housing in the post-war years. For the same reasons, even assuming that the taking under title of public tenure had been a deprivation of possessions, it would have been in the public interest. In respect of the fair balance required, the court observed that, when the State was pursuing economic reform or social justice, less reimbursement was due than the full market value. While it was true that the recognition rent payable to the applicants was not high and there were no prospects for it to be increased in future years, it was comparable to the rents applicable under the controlled rents regime in force in respect of other old properties. Moreover, in the present case the owners had not been required to incur expenses for the building of the new apartments or for their maintenance and when the property had been originally purchased by the owners\u2019 ancestors it was already rented to third parties to which such regulated rents applied. In consequence, it could not be said that the applicants had borne an excessive burden. The court found that their related complaint under the same provision in respect of the unauthorised demolition could not be examined ratione temporis.",

Other properties, where the Government wished to keep control of the expropriated property, were taken under title of public tenure. While this choice allowed for a large margin of appreciation, the applicants had not proved that other people in an analogous position had been treated more favourably and it did not appear that the policy had been applied arbitrarily or in a discriminatory fashion in the applicants\u2019 case.",

It noted that the applicants had not even contested the amount of rent due before the Land Arbitration Board (\u201cLAB\u201d) and that their acquiescence had led to a situation where even if they had wanted to do so, they could not prove the boundaries of the property. However, it was also true that the authorities had failed in their duty to draft a report as to the state and the boundaries of the property before they demolished it and created new plans for it. Thus, at this stage it was impossible to determine the actual boundaries of the property and in this state of uncertainty it was not surprising that the applicants had not taken up the procedure before the LAB.

France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999-V). Article 35 \u00a7\u00a01 is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 (with which it has a close affinity), that there is an effective domestic remedy available in respect of the alleged breach of an individual\u2019s Convention rights (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 152, ECHR 2000-XI). Thus the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits.\u00a0Nevertheless, the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies only requires that an applicant make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances (see Balogh v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a047940/99, \u00a7 30, 20 July 2004). The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Mifsud v.\u00a0France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, ECHR 2002-VIII).",

These amounts were to be considered a pittance, particularly against the fact that the Government were receiving rent from the current tenants, and that part of the property was being used as a commercial business.

The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among other authorities, James and\u00a0Others\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 37, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a098; Beyeler v.

Under this title, the taking was meant to be temporary. However, the applicants failed to request the termination of the measure or its conversion to an outright purchase, as provided for by law. Thus, the measure under this title persisted for forty years during which time the applicants never lost their right to sell the property and the ownership title was never transferred to third parties; in fact they continued to receive rent from the Government in its respect. Although in the present circumstances the sale was improbable, both because little interest lay in the purchase of property which cannot be used, and because of the fact that the boundaries were not clearly established, the Court cannot accept that the measure complained of amounted to a de facto expropriation. However, the applicants\u2019 right of property was severely restricted: they could not exercise the right of use in terms of physical possession as the building was occupied by third parties. Thus, this constituted a means of State control of the use of property, which should be examined under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01.",

However, the Court observes that public tenure implies that the property is taken permanently. Consequently, the applicants were not simply restricted in or temporarily deprived of their use and enjoyment of the property (see, conversely, Erkner and Hofauer v. Austria, 23 April 1987, \u00a7 74, Series A no. 117, and Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden, 23\u00a0September 1982, Series A no. 52). The Court reiterates that in the absence of a formal expropriation, that is to say a transfer of ownership, the Court must look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of (ibid). In the Court\u2019s view, the measures taken by the authorities were aimed at subjecting the applicants\u2019 property to a continued tenancy in favour of third parties, with a view to eventually taking it from them permanently, as was confirmed by the recent offer (2010) to take the property by means of outright purchase. Therefore, the Court considers that it is possible that the interference over the second period went beyond State control of the use of property, verging on what could be equated to a de facto expropriation.",

Throughout the sixty years the owners (the applicants own half an undivided share) have received a rent of not more than EUR 205 per year for a property which consisted, inter alia, of twenty-five apartments. The Court notes a discrepancy in the facts as presented by the parties: while both parties agree that the law provided for a 40% increase for recognition rent vis-\u00e1-vis what had been the acquisition rent, the applicants stated that the owners had received EUR 205 per year in rent throughout the whole period, without alleging that after 1993 the increase had not been applied to them.

Indeed, the constitutional jurisdictions themselves asserted that the rent \u201cwas by today\u2019s standards low for the property in issue\u201d. The Court notes that the law did not provide for any increase according to the cost of living and other factors but, as confirmed by the , it had to be tied to the rental values of 1951. This factor has to be seen against the background of the State\u2019s economic situation today which surely cannot be compared to that of a post-war nation. In this light, the Court cannot but find that this system could lead to unreasonable results. In the present case, the fact that the property was rebuilt by the Government is not sufficient to establish that the original property was worthless. Indeed, when it was originally taken, the applicants, who had previously paid contributions towards this fund, were due war-damage compensation which, at the time, would have enabled or at least helped in the reconstruction of the damaged premises, had it remained in their possession. The Court considers that the amount of rent received by the owners is manifestly disproportionate to the market value of the building (as submitted by the applicants in their just satisfaction claims). The fact that, as argued by the Government, the rent received was in line with the rent laws applicable on the island, does not favour the Government\u2019s case. Indeed, the Court has on various occasions held that various legislation regarding controlled rents in Malta was in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Ghigo v.

The Court notes that lodging a constitutional application involves a referral to the First Hall of the  and the possibility of an appeal to the . The Court has already held that this is a cumbersome procedure, especially since practice shows that appeals to the Constitutional Court are lodged as a matter of course (see Sabeur Ben Ali v. , no. 35892/97, \u00a7 40, 29 June 2000 and Kadem v.\u00a0Malta, no. 55263/00, \u00a7 53, 9 January 2003, where the Court held that the relevant proceedings are invariably longer than what would qualify as \u201cspeedy\u201d for Article 5 \u00a7 4 purposes). The length of these proceedings is furthermore aggravated by the fact that they may be adjourned sine die pending any proceedings concerning the substantive complaints before this Court. In consequence, the Court considers that, even though the domestic legal system allows for such a new complaint to be lodged, the length of the proceedings detracts from their effectiveness (see McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], cited above, \u00a7 123). It notes that in the present case the applicants had been involved in proceedings which lasted for eleven years before the constitutional jurisdictions.",
