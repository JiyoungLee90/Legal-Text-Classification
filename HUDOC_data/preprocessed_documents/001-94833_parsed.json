In such circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that the amount which the applicant could reasonably have expected to receive should be calculated on the basis of the realities of 2000 rather than those of 1990-1992, and should therefore be comparable with an amount that any other depositor of the Savings Bank of  could have received in 2000. In this latter respect the Court notes the Government's argument that payments to former depositors of the USSR Savings Bank were being made from the federal budget in the amount defined by the State (see paragraph 32 above). It therefore accepts that the amounts the applicant could legitimately have expected to receive in 2000 were equal to those indicated by the Government in paragraphs 19-21. As to the applicant's complaint about the loss in value of his deposits, the Court reiterates that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not oblige a State to maintain the purchasing power of sums deposited with financial institutions (see Appolonov v.
