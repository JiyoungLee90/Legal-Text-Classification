The loss of her employment undoubtedly deprived the applicant of her main source of income. Hence, there is a direct causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage claimed, which has to be reimbursed in such a way as to restore, as far as possible, the situation existing before the breach (see, inter alia, Rainys and Gasparavi\u010dius v.\u00a0Lithuania, nos. 70665/01 and 74345/01, \u00a7 45, 7 April 2005). However, the Court notes that a precise calculation of the sums necessary to make complete reparation (restitutio in integrum) in respect of the pecuniary loss suffered by the applicant is prevented by the inherently uncertain character of the damage flowing from the violations. This is particularly so in relation to the question of how long the applicant would have remained in TEDA\u015e had it not been for her dismissal. Nevertheless, an award may still be made notwithstanding the large number of imponderables involved in the assessment of future losses, though the greater the lapse of time involved the more uncertain the link becomes between the breach and the damage. The question to be decided in such cases is the level of just satisfaction, in respect of both past and future pecuniary loss, which it is necessary to award to each applicant, the matter to be determined by the Court at its discretion, having regard to what is equitable (see Lustig-Prean and Beckett v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (just satisfaction), nos. 31417/96 and 32377/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a022-23, 25\u00a0July 2000, and Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom (just satisfaction), nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7\u00a7 18-19, ECHR 2000IX).",

The Court therefore finds it difficult to ascertain the precise amount of pecuniary damage which ensued. At the same time, it considers that the applicant would have been able to work as a security officer at least between 27 June 2000 (the date on which she was notified that she had been appointed to the post of security officer in the Kilis branch of TEDA\u015e) and 1 April 2003 (the date on which she started working subsequent to the first-instance court\u2019s judgment in her favour). Moreover, had the administrative courts prevented the violation found under Article\u00a014 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention, the applicant would have been able to obtain redress for her loss of income concerning the period starting from her dismissal until the date of the final judgment in the domestic proceedings. The Court also considers that the applicant must have sustained non-pecuniary damage which the finding of a violation of the Convention in this judgment does not suffice to remedy. Therefore, taking into account the number of imponderables involved in the assessment of the applicant\u2019s loss of earnings and in the light of all the information in its possession, the Court decides on an equitable basis to award the applicant an aggregate sum of EUR\u00a011,000 under all heads of damage combined, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
