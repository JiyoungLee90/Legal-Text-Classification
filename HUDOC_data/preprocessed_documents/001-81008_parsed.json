In his view, it thereby introduced restrictions not envisaged by the law and conferred an arbitrary power of censorship on prison governors. He added that by depriving those held in punishment cells of the possibility of corresponding with their friends or relatives and prison visitors, the circular imposed more restrictive conditions than those laid down in Article\u00a0D. 169 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which simply provided for restrictions on correspondence.",

It does not appear from the evidence that the aims thus set forth could be achieved in equivalent conditions without the need to carry out full body searches. The impugned rules provide that a full body search should normally be carried out by a single officer, who is not allowed to have any contact with the prisoner 'except ... when the hair is being inspected', and must take place in a room set aside for the purpose, unless this is impossible because of the layout of the premises, 'out of sight of other prisoners and of anyone not involved in the operation itself'. Regard being had to the measures envisaged to protect prisoners' privacy and dignity, and to the particular constraints inherent in the running of custodial facilities, the Minister of Justice neither interfered disproportionately with the principle set forth in Article 3 of the Convention ..., nor breached the provisions of Article D. 275 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, by which prisoner searches must be carried out 'in conditions which ... maintain respect for the dignity inherent in the human being'.",

In reiterating through the circular of 14\u00a0March 1986 that a prisoner's refusal to undergo a search may give rise to a disciplinary sanction and, if the prisoner persists in refusing, to the use of force subject to the conditions set out in the above-mentioned provisions, the Minister of Justice did not issue a new rule.

The Government added that the circular defined two types of search: full body searches \u2013 where the prisoner was naked \u2013 and rub-down searches. Full body searches involved no contact between the prisoner and the officer, except when the hair was being inspected; they could not be performed collectively, normally took place in a room set aside for the purpose and at all events out of the sight of anyone not involved in the operation, and were generally conducted by a single officer. The Government referred to the text of the circular, which in their submission \u201cgave a precise definition of the professional actions to be performed during a full body search\u201d so that operations of this kind could be conducted with due respect for prisoners' dignity. They emphasised that while prisoners could be required to bend over and cough, this took place solely \u201cin the specific case of searches for prohibited objects or substances\u201d and not in any other cases. Rub-down searches were \u201cordered by the governor whenever he deem[ed] necessary, in particular when prisoners moved about the detention facility\u201d. The prisoner remained clothed, standing in front of the officer with his arms and legs apart, and \u201cas appropriate\u201d, the officer could \u201cinspect the prisoner's hair, ears and neck\u201d.",

In the Government's submission, it could be noted from the relevant incident reports that the applicant's refusals to undergo searches had always concerned regulation searches, after receiving visits, when leaving the premises, after doing exercise or while detained in the punishment block; they referred in that connection to eleven reports, dated 15\u00a0March 1993, 28\u00a0June, 9\u00a0August, 13\u00a0September, 19 and 21 December 1994, 25\u00a0March, 13\u00a0and 20 May 1995, and 26 and 27 May 1996, six of which (those of 19\u00a0and 21\u00a0December 1994, 25 March, 13 and 20 May 1995 and 27 May 1996) stated that the applicant had refused to \u201cbend over and cough\u201d. The Government pointed out that, having regard to the applicant's position of principle in systematically refusing to undergo searches, it had been necessary, for the purposes of ensuring order and safety in the prisons in question, for the prison authorities to take disciplinary sanctions against him. They added that from the end of 1996 the applicant had complied with the measures in force and had no longer been the subject of disciplinary proceedings for refusing to undergo searches.",

They observed in that connection that in France, the system of strip-searches was strictly framed by statutory and regulatory instruments (the Government referred in particular to Articles 728 and D. 275 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), the scope for circulars being marginal in that they were limited to setting out the manner in which such instruments were to be applied and implemented. They added, firstly, that the frequency of searches was laid down in the instruments in question and that the applicant had been strip-searched only in the circumstances envisaged in them and not in any systematic or repetitive manner, and, secondly, that the full body searches to which he had been subjected had addressed security concerns since they had taken place after he had been in contact with persons from outside the prison (prison visits and temporary removals) or other prisoners (after exercise). In any event, the \u201cfrequency\u201d of searches was not sufficient to make them \u201ca routine operational aspect of detention\u201d, and the circular of 14 March 1986 encouraged supervisory staff not to make such acts commonplace. The Government also pointed out that the applicant was detained under the ordinary regime and not subject to any special supervisory measures, and emphasised that full body searches did not involve any contact between prisoners and prison staff, did not include anal inspections (for which the intervention of a doctor was compulsory) and ensured respect for prisoners' human dignity and intimacy. Lastly, the Government observed that the judgments cited above indicated, among other things, the Court's acceptance that strip-searches might sometimes be necessary to ensure prison security or to prevent disorder or crime.",

He added that such a regime \u2013 which by its very nature deprived the prisoners concerned of access to the group activities available to others \u2013 had been singularly demanding; in particular, he had been allowed to do exercise with another prisoner at Bois d'Arcy Prison only after going on hunger strike for eight days. He added that, although he had been detained under the ordinary regime since 1990, he had not had access either to the chapel or to the prayer room at Fresnes Prison, where he had been transferred in 1994; this showed that he had not always retained the ability to exercise his fundamental rights. Furthermore, contrary to what the Government maintained, the registration of prisoners in the \u201chigh risk\u201d category amounted to a particular prison regime, which had no legal basis and in practice deprived the prisoners concerned of a number of rights they should be able to enjoy: contact with other prisoners \u2013 and hence exercise and activities \u2013 was limited (very often, their daily schedule consisted of one hour's solitary exercise and twenty-three hours in the cell), their correspondence was subject to increased monitoring, they were accompanied by a warder whenever they moved about the prison, they were not allowed to work in the general service or in a workshop that did not have the necessary security arrangements in place, they were frequently transferred to a higher-security prison and, depending on the prison where they were being held, they were required to change cells frequently and to undergo additional searches. As regards the last-mentioned point, they were particularly at risk of being subjected to unannounced searches, as the circular of 14 March 1986 explicitly stated that such searches \u201cconcern chiefly, although not exclusively, high-risk prisoners\u201d and, as the Government had indicated in their observations before the Court, full body searches; classification as a high-risk prisoner was thus an aggravating factor in the performance of checks.",

It further notes that the Government did not claim that, in the particular circumstances in which such measures had been taken, they had been based each time on strong and specific suspicions that the applicant had \u201cprohibited objects or substances\u201d concealed in his anus, or even that a change in the applicant's behaviour had rendered him particularly suspect in that regard. In fact, it appears from the applicant's undisputed submissions that in the prison concerned, when detainees were searched after each visit, they were systematically ordered to \u201cbend over and cough\u201d. In other words, there was a presumption in that prison that any prisoner returning from the visiting room was concealing objects or substances in the most intimate parts of his body.",

The Court therefore finds it understandable that the prisoners concerned, such as the applicant, might feel that they are the victims of arbitrary measures on that account. It can accept that this feeling might be aggravated by the fact that the rules on prisoner searches in general, and full body searches in particular, are mainly set out in an instruction issued by the Prison Service itself \u2013 the circular of 14 March 1986 \u2013 and, moreover, allow each prison governor a large measure of discretion.",

Moreover, the humiliation felt by the applicant was aggravated by the fact that on a number of occasions his refusal to comply with such measures led to his being placed in a punishment cell.",
