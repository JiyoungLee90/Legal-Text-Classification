The case originated in an application (no. 23103/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Milan Momčilović (“the applicant”), on 29 May 2007.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Perišić, a lawyer practising in . The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
The applicant alleged that the Supreme Court, when ruling in his case on 25 June 2007, had not been constituted in accordance with the relevant domestic law.
On 6 January 2011 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in .
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 13 April 1990 the applicant lodged a civil claim with the Novi Sad Municipal Court, seeking damages and the restitution of certain personal effects from his former employer (“the respondent”).
Following a remittal in 1995, in December 2000 the Municipal Court declined jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Novi Sad District Court as the competent court of first instance in the matter.
Following another remittal in 2002, the District Court, by judgment of 30 June 2006, ruled partly in the applicant’s favour.
On 18 January 2007 the Supreme Court of , acting as a second-instance court, partly upheld and partly reversed the said judgment on appeal.
On 27 April 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija).
On 25 June 2007 the Supreme Court, sitting as a panel of five judges, rejected the applicant’s appeal on points of law, referring to Articles 361 § 2.9, 399 and 405 of the Civil Procedure Act 2004 (see paragraph 18 below).
The decision of 25 June 2007 was served on the applicant on 10 September 2007.
Article 44 § 4 provided that where a decision at second instance had been given by the Supreme Court itself, a five-judge panel of the same court would decide any subsequent appeal on points of law.
The Civil Procedure Act 2004 entered into force on 23 February 2005, thereby repealing the Civil Procedure Act 1977.
Article 38 § 2 of the Act reads as follows:
“The Supreme Court shall decide an appeal on points of law [revizija ili zahtev za zastitu zakonitosti] lodged against a second-instance decision of a lower court in a panel composed of five judges.”
Article 38 § 3 provides as follows:
“Where a decision at second instance was given by the Supreme Court itself, a seven-judge panel of the same court should decide any subsequent appeal on points of law.”
Articles 361 § 2.9, 399 and 405 established, in principle, the scope of the Supreme Court’s competency and the relevant issues it would examine when deciding upon an appeal on points of law.
Article 422 § 10 further provided that a case could be reopened if the European Court of Human Rights had in the meantime given a judgment relating to Serbia concerning the same or a similar legal issue.
Article 491 § 4 provides as follows:
“The applicable rules of civil procedure, as regards an appeal on points of law [revizija] lodged against a decision of a second-instance court, in the proceedings which had been initiated before the date on which the current Act entered into force, shall be those rules which were in force prior to the said date.”
The Civil Procedure Act 2011 entered into force on 1 February 2012, thereby repealing the Civil Procedure Act 2004. Article 426 § 11 of the 2011 Act provides that a case may be reopened if it subsequently becomes possible for a party in civil proceedings to rely on a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights finding a violation of a human right, which could have resulted in a more favourable decision in the domestic proceedings.
