With regard to the aim of \u201cliving together\u201d in a democratic society, it was the opposite reasoning \u2013 that of openness and tolerance \u2013 which should take precedence in a pluralist democratic society as was evidenced by the tolerance that there had always been of dress codes rejecting the living together principle. At best, it could be regarded as a praiseworthy political objective, but one that could not be achieved by some stigmatising by-laws that were contrary to the Convention. In her submission, the factors justifying the ban on safety grounds had been advanced exclusively with regard to the full-face veil, were non-existent and the real aim being pursued by the by-laws was the prohibition of the full-face veil in public places. She argued, lastly, that the issue of dignity and gender equality was irrelevant to justification on grounds of \u201cprotection of the rights and freedoms of others\u201d since the exercise of the freedom and wishes of women themselves was hindered.",

France, it must stress the fundamentally subsidiary role of the Convention system and reiterate that the national authorities have direct democratic legitimation in so far as the protection of human rights is concerned. Moreover, by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, the State authorities are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions (see Dubsk\u00e1 and Krejzov\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic [GC], nos. 28859/11 and 28473/12, \u00a7 175, 15 November 2016). In matters of general policy, on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely, the role of the domestic policy-maker is to be given special weight. With regard to Article 9 of the Convention, the State should thus, in principle, be afforded a wide margin of appreciation in deciding whether and to what extent a limitation of the right to manifest one\u2019s religion or beliefs is \u201cnecessary\u201d. That being said, in delimiting the extent of the margin of appreciation in a given case, the Court must also have regard to what is at stake therein.

France, cited above, \u00a7 149). Nor is it unaware that by imposing a ban on wearing in public places a garment designed to conceal the face the respondent State restricts to a certain extent the reach of pluralism, since the ban prevents certain women from expressing their personality and their beliefs by wearing the full-face veil in public (see S.A.S. v. France, cited above, \u00a7 149).",

In doing so, it sought to protect a form of interaction between individuals that was essential, in the respondent State\u2019s view, to the functioning of a democratic society (see the above-cited judgment, paragraph B.28, cited in paragraph 21 above). From this perspective, and similarly to the situation which previously arose in France (see S.A.S. v.

The allegation by the intervening organisations that the democratic process that had led to the ban on wearing the full-face veil in Belgium had not taken full account of what was at stake cannot carry weight in the present case regarding the assessment of the situation. Besides the fact that this criticism does not directly concern the by-laws in question but refers to the Law of 1 June 2011, the Court notes, obiter dictum, that the decision-making process leading up to the impugned ban took several years and was accompanied by a wide-ranging debate within the House of Representatives and by a detailed and thorough examination by the Constitutional Court of all the interests involved.",

It is however important to understand the scope of the Court\u2019s findings in S.A.S. As follows clearly from \u00a7 141, which refers also to \u00a7 122 of the judgment, the particular context in which the Grand Chamber accepted the invoked aim was a finding by a member State that it was \u201cessential to give particular weight ... to the interaction between individuals and [it might] consider this to be adversely affected by the fact that some conceal their faces in public places\u201d. The Court thus acquiesced to the State\u2019s view that the \u201cbarrier raised against others by a veil concealing the face is perceived by the respondent State as breaching the right of others to live in a space of socialisation which makes living together easier\u201d.",

In S.A.S this justification was subsumed under the aim of the \u201crights and freedoms of others\u201d provided for in Articles 8 \u00a7 2 and 9 \u00a7 2, (see \u00a7\u00a7 121-122).

Secondly, as demonstrated by my colleagues Judges Nussberger and J\u00e4derblom in their dissenting opinion in S.A.S, the concept of \u201cliving together\u201d is \u201cfar-fetched and vague\u201d (see \u00a7 5). As they explain, it is difficult to define which \u201cconcrete rights of others within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 and Article 9 \u00a7 2 of the Convention could be inferred from the abstract principle of \u201cliving together\u201d or from the \u201cminimum requirements\u201d of life in society\u201d. It seems clear to me that the legitimacy of an aim must be based on objective, identifiable factors that are directly conducive to alleviating certain harms that flow from the exercise of the human right that is restricted. The rights and freedoms of others, referred to in the Convention, thus represent clear and concrete legal rights the protection of which can form a justifiable aim in restricting Convention rights. In other words, the substance of the \u201cliving together\u201d principle is so malleable and unclear that it can potentially serve as a rhetorical tool for regulating any human interaction or behaviour purely on the basis of a particular view of what constitutes the \u201cright way\u201d for people to interact in a democratic society. That is anathema to the fundamental values of the autonomy of self, human dignity, tolerance and broadmindedness which are the foundations of the Convention system.",

The requirement of \u201cliving together\u201d has its ideological basis in some kind of societal consensus or a majoritarian morality of how individuals should act in the public space. This is nothing short of Government imposed assimilation of human interaction and behaviour. An aim invoked for restricting human rights that is in fact based on a transient majority\u2019s opinion of what is suitable and right, and without the majority being required to define in concrete terms particular harms or mischiefs that need clearly to be addressed, can not in principle form the basis of justifiable restrictions of Convention rights in a democratic society.",

However, it must be made clear that the Court\u2019s increased emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity does not give a carte blanche to member States in their choice of measures and means that restrict Convention rights even though a balancing of interests has taken place at the legislative level. History has amply demonstrated that there is an inherent risk in democratic societies that majoritarian sentiments, subsequently translated into legislative enactments, are formed on the basis of ideas and values which threaten fundamental human rights. Insular and vulnerable groups are therefore left with recourse to courts and these courts, whether national or international, like this Court, have the duty to review and detect, if possible, whether the imposition of measures, although widely accepted in the legislative forum, are triggered by animus or intolerance towards a particular idea, view or religious faith.",

In S.A.S. v France, the Grand Chamber concluded that it could be justified, as such, to use the criminal law in the enforcement of the ban against full face veils (see \u00a7 152). However, I note that in S.A.S. the sanctions provided for by the French law were among the lightest that could be envisaged. They consisted of a fine that could amount to EUR 150 maximum, with the additional possibility for the national court to impose an obligation to follow a citizenship course (\u00a7 152). Under the Belgian law, as interpreted by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 21 in Dakir v Belgium and paragraph 27 in Belcacemi and Oussar v Belgium) failing to comply with the ban on full-face veils in public spaces can, on the contrary, be me met with a sentence of up to one to seven days of imprisonment in repetitive cases.",

Although it follows from S.A.S v France that criminal sanctions can, as such, constitute a proportionate measure in enforcing the ban on full face veils, it is crucial to recall that that finding was not based on a law that allows for imprisonment like the Belgian law, although the latter only allows for such a measure in repetitive cases.",

They do not require the Court to assess the application of the law to a concrete set of facts where a criminal sentence as been meted out. In the absence of a concrete application of the Belgian law, it is in the first place for the national courts to decide on the severity of sanctions that can be imposed in the specific circumstances of each case and to ensure that the sanction is in compliance with the principle of proportionality (see paragraphs 57-60 in Belcacemi and Oussar v Belgium). Having said that, and taking account of the nature of the activity that is being prohibited, involving a restriction on the rights of women choosing to wear a full face veil due to their religious faith, it is my view that any deprivation of liberty in the enforcement of this ban, even in repetitive cases, would implicate a strong presumption of disproportionality of the interference with Convention rights.",

However, so as not to unduly dilute the individual right in question, it is self-evident that Governments are not free to base their attempts at restricting Convention rights on any aim whatsoever. The legitimacy of an aim must be based on objective, identifiable factors that are directly conducive to alleviating certain harms that flow from the exercise of the human right that is restricted.
