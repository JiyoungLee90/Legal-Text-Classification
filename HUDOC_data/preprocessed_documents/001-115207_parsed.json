The officers knew that the first applicant\u2019s driving licence had been suspended after several violations of the traffic rules. J.S. approached the first applicant and informed him that he was committing a violation of the traffic rules by driving without a valid driving licence. The first applicant did not reply. Instead, he got out of the car and went into the mechanic\u2019s workshop \u0122ik\u0161i, which belonged to his father, the second applicant. Although J.S. continued to shout towards the first applicant, requesting him to stop and come back, the latter did not pay any attention. Accordingly, J.S. and V.D. decided to apprehend him in order to draw up an administrative offence report. They followed him, took hold of his hands and attempted to walk him towards the police car. However, the first applicant resisted by pulling his hands away, pushing the police officers away and falling on the ground in order to drag J.S. down with his weight. In addition, the workshop employees actively obstructed the officers\u2019 arrest of the first applicant by dragging him away, as well as by grabbing the police officers\u2019 uniforms. At some point, the first applicant managed to break free and ran off.",

The court also took into account the apparent conflict between the applicants and the C\u0113sis District Police Department. In particular, the events of 14 March 2004 were noted. The court expressed doubts about the objectivity of the police officers of that police department towards the applicants. Concerns about their objectivity were evident from the preliminary investigation procedure as a whole. First of all, no bodily injuries had been recorded in the first applicant\u2019s detention order even though the police officers had used force against the applicant. Second, even though the first applicant had been examined by an ambulance doctor twice and a diagnosis established, no mention of it had been contained in the forensic report. The court noted that it had been impossible for the first applicant to prove that he had sustained concussion because he was being held in custody, whereas it had been a duty incumbent on the investigating authorities to examine his physical condition and on the forensic expert to take it into account. Third, the same officer (D.B.) had taken decisions in both the first applicant\u2019s case and that of the police officers; in such circumstances her impartiality was questionable. The court also concluded that the prosecutor dealing with the case had been keen to send the first applicant\u2019s case for trial as soon as possible.",

Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a01710/06, \u00a7 19, 11 September 2012). In the present case the Government provided more examples from domestic case-law; however, the Court does not recognise them as relevant for the purposes of the present case. The first of these relates to events that took place nearly five years after the events at issue in the present case. The first-instance court ruling referred to by the Government in the second case was overruled by the appellate court and the claim was rejected. Lastly, the third set of proceedings appears to be still pending. The ruling to which the Government referred in this connection was adopted by the Senate of the Supreme Court in 2010 and the case was sent back for fresh examination to the regional court. Having established that the domestic case-law referred to by the Government does not prove the effectiveness of the administrative courts at the material time for the purposes of the present case, the Court finds that the proposed remedy cannot be considered effective in so far as the applicants\u2019 complaint is concerned. Therefore, the applicants did not need to exhaust it (see, for the principle that only effective remedies need to be exhausted, Paksas v.\u00a0 [GC], no.\u00a034932/04, \u00a7\u00a075, 6 January 2011).",

They did not provide any, however succinct, reference to the factual basis of their complaint and the nature of the alleged violation.

Since the officers conducting the investigation were subordinated to the same chain of command as those officers subject to investigation, serious doubts arise as to their ability to carry out an independent investigation (see Matko v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 43393/98, \u00a7 89, 2\u00a0November 2006, and \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 87). Furthermore, not only did officer D.B., who was in charge of the investigation, work for the C\u0113sis District Police Department, she had also been in charge of the preliminary investigation in the criminal proceedings brought against both applicants in connection with the events of 30 June 2004 which eventually resulted in the first applicant\u2019s conviction for resisting a representative of public authority. In this connection, the Court notes that the first applicant\u2019s counsel first brought up the issue of bias on 5\u00a0July 2004, but received a negative reply from the two supervising prosecution authorities. The Court therefore rejects the Government\u2019s argument that the first applicant did not properly bring this issue to the attention of the domestic authorities.\u00a0The independence of the investigation carried out by the C\u0113sis District Police Department is further tainted by the history of disagreement between both the applicants and another officer of that police department. In this regard it is not insignificant that there had been a prior incident involving the use of a firearm in breach of the rules of discipline by the police officer, as a result of which he had been discharged from his duties. Taking into account the foregoing, the Court considers that the investigation carried out by the C\u0113sis District Police Department cannot be considered to have been independent.",

It seems rather unlikely that in such a short period of time a thorough examination of the first applicant\u2019s state of health could have been made.",

In this respect, the Court emphasises that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. The Court has already held on a number of occasions that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute not capable of being applied automatically; it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see\u00a0\u0130lhan v.  [GC], no. 22277/93, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2000VII).",

Firstly, the Court notes that the prosecution authorities participated in the criminal proceedings against the first applicant. They were well aware of his allegations of the excessive use of force at the mechanic\u2019s workshop \u0122ik\u0161i and the Jaun\u0123ik\u0161i country house and of the fact that he maintained those allegations throughout his trial (see the next paragraph). In addition, the prosecution authorities dropped, during the first applicant\u2019s trial before the C\u0113sis District Court, the charges in relation to his resistance at the Jaun\u0123ik\u0161i country house. They implicitly agreed that he had not actively obstructed his arrest, which fact, if properly established, would have rendered any use of force by the police officers against him excessive. Secondly, the higher-ranking prosecutors of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office attached to the , in fact, examined several complaints by the first applicant and concluded that there was no bias in the investigation carried out by the C\u0113sis District Police Department (see paragraphs 41 and 49 above). The first applicant did not have any grounds to consider that they would provide a different answer if he lodged another complaint.\u00a0It follows that the prosecution authorities, including the higher-ranking prosecutors, knew about the first applicant\u2019s allegations as concerns the events of 30\u00a0June 2004 and yet they did not consider that these allegations merited any further independent investigation. The Court therefore considers that in the circumstances of the present case the first applicant did everything that he could reasonably have been expected to do and that he complied with his duty to inform the relevant national authorities of both alleged episodes of the alleged ill-treatment. It accordingly rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection as concerns the exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

In this regard the Court considers that initially the C\u0113sis District Court showed sufficient diligence by forwarding the first applicant\u2019s complaint of 21\u00a0October 2004 to the prosecutor\u2019s office. However, when the first applicant\u2019s charges concerning the events at the Jaun\u0123ik\u0161i country house were withdrawn during his trial for lack of evidence, the district court as well as the prosecutor had nevertheless heard the first applicant\u2019s allegations made during the trial, namely that at Jaun\u0123ik\u0161i \u201cV.D. [had] dealt several blows to [his] sides and head\u201d while he was lying on the ground. This information should have triggered an official investigation. However, no additional investigative steps were taken by the domestic authorities in response to the first applicant\u2019s allegations concerning this episode. The district court, in its judgment of 20\u00a0December 2004, merely stated that the first applicant\u2019s testimony had not been corroborated. Because the charges against the first applicant did not include the events at Jaun\u0123ik\u0161i, any material that might have been related to that episode, including the testimony of the second applicant and K.R., was not included in the judgment. Although the first applicant maintained his request for the opening of criminal proceedings against the police officers throughout his trial also before the  and the Senate of the Supreme Court, it was refused as being not related. The prosecution authorities, for their part, did not undertake any investigation whatsoever in relation to this episode. In such circumstances, the Court concludes that there has not been a thorough investigation into the first applicant\u2019s allegations concerning the events at Jaun\u0123ik\u0161i.",
