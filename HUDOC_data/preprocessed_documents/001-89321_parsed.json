The Court of Appeal found no reason to depart from the evaluation of the case made by the lower court. As concerned its decision not to hold an oral hearing the court stated that, according to the relevant rules in the Code of Judicial Procedure, an appeal could always be adjudicated without a main hearing if it was clear that such a hearing was unnecessary. The court then considered that it was clear that a main hearing was unnecessary in the case before it in view of the investigation of the matter at hand. The fact that the applicant opposed the determination of the case without a hearing was immaterial as the issues of law raised in the case had been elucidated at the District Court in a way that made it obvious that a main hearing would not add anything of value to the case.

The publicity requirement is certainly one of the means whereby confidence in the courts is maintained. However, the Court has also accepted that there are other considerations, including the right to a trial within a reasonable time and the related need for an expeditious handling of the courts\u2019 case-load, which must be taken into account in determining the necessity of public hearings in the proceedings subsequent to the trial at first-instance level (see, for example, Rippe v. , no.\u00a05398/03, February 2006; Jan \u00c5ke Andersson v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212B, \u00a7\u00a027; and Helmers v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212A, \u00a7 36).",

Finland (dec.), no. 49453/99, 18\u00a0October 2005). Accordingly, the Court has held that leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, although the appellant was not given an opportunity to be heard in person by the appeal court. Furthermore, a hearing may not be necessary when it raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties\u2019 written observations (see Fejde v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0212C, \u00a7\u00a033; and Pahverk v. Sweden (dec.), no. 41042/98, 11 February 2003). However, it is the overarching principle of fairness embodied in Article 6 which is, as always, the key consideration (see Jussila v.  [GC], no.\u00a073053/01, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2006...).",

Moreover, they knew that the Court of Appeal\u2019s examination of the case would be limited to the investigation of the matter presented to and examined by the District Court. Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, it must have been clear to both parties that they had to invoke and present all circumstances and evidence before the District Court. In fact this also seems, essentially, to have occurred since, before the Court of Appeal, the applicant did not request to hear any new witnesses but wanted the four witnesses heard before the District Court to be heard again. The Court also observes that the State agreed with the Court of Appeal that an oral hearing was unnecessary.",

Furthermore, both parties submitted extensive written submissions which were considered by the District Court and the entire case file was sent to the Court of Appeal together with the applicant\u2019s appeal. Thus, when the Court of Appeal examined the case, it had access to all the material, including the tapes from the oral hearing before the District Court, as well as to the supplementary submissions made by the parties before the appellate court. Here, the Court also has regard to the fact that the parties were informed by the Court of Appeal, on 30 December 2003, that it was considering not holding an oral hearing and were given the opportunity to finalise their submissions, which they did. Since the appellate court gave judgment in June 2004, about six months later, the applicant had ample time to make his final pleadings in the case.",
