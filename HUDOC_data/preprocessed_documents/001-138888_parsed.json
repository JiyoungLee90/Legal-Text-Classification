The Administrative Court rejected his claim brought before it. Specifically, the Administrative Court declared that the two Fund\u2019s bodies lacked jurisdiction ratione materiae to consider the claimant\u2019s request. Relying on Article 266 \u00a7 2 of the General Administrative Act, the Administrative Court directed the claimant to file an enforcement request with the competent civil court, rather than have recourse to the administrative dispute procedure.",

In the instant case, the Fund, the competent administrative authority empowered to order the payment of a pension, acknowledged its debts following the last devaluation of the domestic currency and the conversion to the new currency, by a decision that has not been appealed, amended or invalidated (revoked) by any subsequent administrative or judicial decision on the basis that it is impossible for the decision to be enforced (see paragraphs 9, 10 and 32\u00a0above). Moreover, the Fund provided a copy of the decision containing an enforceability clause in 2006, that is to say following the ratification date (see paragraph 14 above). Further, the Supreme Court stated that the applicant had no right to damages to compensate him for the effects of inflation during the relevant period, but did not exclude his entitlement to a supplementary pension in the original amount claimed, together with statutory interest (see paragraph 24 above). Lastly, the Government repeated on several occasions that the applicant is still entitled to the original amount claimed, plus statutory interest, and did not attempt to justify the non-enforcement by the extinguishment of the debt or any inability to enforce the decision.",

The Court cannot endorse the submissions about the applicant\u2019s failure to request \u201cadministrative enforcement\u201d before the administrative bodies. The applicable administrative and enforcement legislation, as well as the Supreme Court and the Administrative Court\u2019s interpretation of the law, had all designated the civil courts as the competent authorities for the execution of an administrative decision establishing a monetary obligation (see paragraphs 37, 38, 40, 48 and 50).

There was apparently legal uncertainty as to whether the administrative or judicial authorities were invested with jurisdiction ratione materiae in cases such as that of the applicant (see paragraph 46 above). The non-enforcement of the 1994 decision was due, to an extent, to the fact that the Fund had failed to indicate the exact amount to be paid to the applicant by way of supplementary pension. The debt established by the 1994 decision was the liability of the Fund, in charge of administering pensions, which omitted to pay the debt and strikingly claimed to lack the appropriate software to calculate the amount due in view of hyperinflation. In addition, the competent enforcement court was empowered to obtain expert reports in complex cases and was provided with sufficient calculation parameters to identify the amount due. However, the competent court did not even attempt to arrive at a final calculation, nor did it make any reference to the expert report supplied by the applicant. The manner in which the domestic court conducted these lengthy enforcement proceedings (see paragraphs 11-17 above) and the reasons given to decline jurisdiction in favour of the \u201cadministrative authorities\u201d appear to be arbitrary. They did not comply with the procedures enshrined in the relevant legislation for the enforcement of final administrative decisions establishing obligations of a monetary nature (see paragraphs 37-40, 44, 48, 50 and 53\u00a0above).",
