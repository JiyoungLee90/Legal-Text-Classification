The court also found that since the institution was no longer funded through the federal budget the judgment of 16 December 2002 could not be executed via the Federal Treasury. The judge further noted that the Ministry had already paid a part of the debt under the judgment. Thus, she concluded that the relevant judgment could have been enforced directly by the Ministry prior to the applicants\u2019 claim concerning the vicarious liability from the federal budget sources. The judge, inter alia, index-linked the amounts due to the applicants under the judgment of 16\u00a0December 2002.
