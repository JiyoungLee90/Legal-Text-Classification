Even a brief explanation of their aims and scope are sufficient to demonstrate what a good idea they are. One of the obvious benefits is that victims of domestic violence and the like can remain in their own homes (if they want to) rather than being forced out by the fear of violence. Leaving their home as a result of domestic violence can have serious consequences for the stability of their lives. Government statutory homelessness statistics show that domestic violence is consistently reported as the main reason for the loss of a last settled home for 12-13% of homelessness acceptances in England; see the witness statement of [ P.N.] of Women\u2019s Aid at [C4]. [the applicant\u2019s representative] submitted that Sanctuary Schemes are a means of homelessness prevention. Whilst the work costs money, it avoids the expense and upheaval of re-housing and (as A\u2019s case well illustrates) of losing the support network of friends and neighbours that takes years to build up and which is so important for the continued safety and general wellbeing of people in A\u2019s position.

However, there is one further piece of evidence provided by the replies to these requests which was the subject of some argument. Local authorities were asked for the number of households in Sanctuary Schemes affected by the under-occupancy provisions. The answer was 120. The average gap in funding was \u00a316.70 per week (above the average figure). Of that group of 120, the number receiving DHPs was 24 (or 20%). The Claimant relies upon that statistic to show that DHPs are not being provided to 80% of households in Sanctuary Schemes which are affected by these regulations and who should be receiving DHPs. The Defendant says that it proves nothing of the sort. [...] I observed during the course of argument that I would need to know more about the 80% before I could draw any conclusions from these figures. That remains my view. The statistic shows that DHPs are being paid to people in Sanctuary Schemes. Indeed that is A\u2019s experience. What we do not know is why they are not being paid. It may be that it is because applications are being refused. Or it may be because claimants are bridging the gap in other ways.\u201d",

Reducing her Housing Benefit by reference to the number of bedrooms puts at risk her ability to stay there.

The Secretary of State accepts that she needs to stay in a Sanctuary Scheme and probably in this very house.

But if the discretionary housing payment scheme is not good enough to justify the discrimination against the [other] households, it is not good enough to justify the discrimination against Ms\u00a0A\u2019s household either. Its deficiencies were acknowledged in the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Burnip v Birmingham City Council [2012] EWCA Civ 629; [2013] PTSR\u00a0117, para 46. They are well-summed up by Mr Drabble QC [...]: it is discretionary, cash-limited and produces less certainty; it has a stricter means test; it offers different and less attractive routes of judicial challenge; it can be onerous to make applications; and it encourages short term, temporary and conditional awards. For a woman in a Sanctuary Scheme to have to endure all those difficulties and uncertainties on top of the constant fear and anxiety in which she lives cannot be justified. This is not a question of the allocation of scarce public resources: it is rightly acknowledged that public resources will have to meet this need one way or another.\u201d",

In each case, their Housing Benefit had been reduced by the effect of [...] Regulation B13. The Court of Appeal (Maurice Kay and Hooper\u00a0LJJ and Henderson J) held that the claimants had established a prima facie case of discrimination under Article 14 of the ECHR, and that the Secretary of State had failed to establish objective and reasonable justification for the discriminatory effect of the statutory criteria (paragraph 24 of Maurice Kay LJ\u2019s judgment). Henderson\u00a0J (with whom the other members of the court agreed) held that DHPs could not be regarded as a complete or satisfactory answer to the problem (paragraphs 46 and 64). He also held in paragraph 64 that there was no question of a general exception from the normal bedroom test for disabled people of all kinds. The exception was sought for only a very limited category of claimants, namely those with a disability so severe that an extra bedroom is needed for a carer to sleep in, or in Gorry\u2019s case where separate bedrooms were needed for children whose disabilities were so severe they could not be reasonably expected to share a single room. He made clear that such cases were by their very nature likely to be relatively few in number, easy to recognise, not open to abuse, and unlikely to undergo change or need regular monitoring.\u201d",

Cyprus, no. 33631/06, \u00a7 64, 13\u00a0October 2015). To assess admissibility the question is whether, but for the condition of entitlement under domestic law about which the applicant complains, he or she would have had a right enforceable under domestic law, to receive the benefit in question (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2005X).

The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed, taking account of both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In the context of allegations of discrimination, the question of what amounts to a \u2018significant disadvantage\u2019 for an applicant requires particularly careful scrutiny. Moreover, an alleged violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage without affecting an applicant\u2019s pecuniary interest. It may also be that, even in the absence of a \u201csignificant disadvantage\u201d, a question of principle raised by an application is of a general character affecting the observance of the Convention, such that, under the terms of the second element in Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a03 (b), \u201crespect for human rights defined in the Convention ... requires an examination of the application on its merits\u201d (see Daniel Faulkner v. the United Kingdom, no. 68909/13, \u00a7 26, 6\u00a0October 2016, with further references).",

The Court acknowledges that the DHP scheme had a number of significant disadvantages which were identified by the domestic courts, namely that the awards of DHP were purely discretionary in nature; their duration was uncertain; they were payable from a capped fund; and their amount could not be relied upon to replace the full amount of the shortfall (see paragraph 41 above). On the other hand, the scheme had some advantages in that it allowed local authorities to take individualised decisions, which the Court has identified as an important element to ensure proportionality (see a contrario Guberina\u00b8 cited above, \u00a7\u00a093). Moreover, the awards of DHP are made subject to certain safeguards, in particular the requirement on local authorities to take their decisions in light of the Human Rights Act and their Public Sector Equality Duty which in the Court\u2019s understanding would prevent them from refusing to award DHP where that could mean the applicant\u2019s need for appropriately adapted accommodation was not met. The Court observes that the first applicant has in fact been awarded DHP for several years following the changes to the Housing Benefit Regulation. Whilst the DHP scheme could be characterised as not ensuring the same level of certainty and stability as the previous, unreduced Housing Benefit, its provision with attendant safeguards, amounts to a sufficiently weighty reason to satisfy the Court that the means employed to implement the measure had a reasonable relationship of proportionality to its legitimate aim.

The Government have not provided any weighty reasons to justify the prioritisation of the aim of the present scheme over that of enabling victims of domestic violence who benefitted from protection in Sanctuary Schemes to remain in their own homes safely. In that context, the provision of DHP could not render proportionate the relationship between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised where it formed part of the scheme aimed at incentivising residents to leave their homes, as demonstrated by its identified disadvantages (see paragraph 102 above).",

It is therefore difficult to agree with the assertion that \u201c[i]n the case of the second applicant, loss of her home would risk her personal safety\u201d (see paragraph 92). For these reasons, it is difficult to understand why a particular need to be able to remain in the same home is a special characteristic justifying enhanced protection under the Convention. The relevant characteristic for the purpose of the discrimination test in the instant case should rather be presented as the existence of legitimate special needs in respect of housing \u2013 needs exceeding those of an average, ordinary family. We note in this context that there may be individuals with legitimate special needs in respect of housing not belonging to sub-classes (i) and (ii).

We note in this respect that there are numerous victims of domestic violence who were not affected by the impugned legislative measures. Firstly, domestic violence affects all social classes and not all victims of domestic violence are on low incomes. Secondly, not all victims of domestic violence apply for protection under the Sanctuary Scheme. Thirdly, not all victims of domestic violence who receive Housing Benefit and who have been given protection under the Sanctuary Scheme will be forced to move out. Fourthly, not all victims of domestic violence insist on remaining in the same accommodation. On the contrary, many victims of domestic violence prefer to leave the place where the domestic violence occurred. The old accommodation reminds them of stressful moments and they want to start a whole new life somewhere else. Fifthly, no evidence based upon statistical data was provided which would show that the impugned legislation affects mainly victims of gender-based violence or, more generally, that it affects, for instance, a clearly higher percentage of women than men (compare the decision in Hoogendijk v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, no. 58641/00, 6 January 2005).",

The victim may stay in the same accommodation as long as she is validly entitled to stay there. The legislation does not protect against other factors which may force someone to move, such as a loss of income, the termination of the lease agreement by the landlord, the fact that a person is no longer eligible for social housing, etc. Domestic violence does not entail reinforced protection of the tenant in relations with the landlord. The real aim of the legislation \u2013 interpreted in the broader context of all relevant provisions \u2013 appears to be that of enabling victims of domestic violence who benefited from protection in Sanctuary Schemes to remain in their own homes safely as long as they are not forced to move out for other reasons.",

Therefore any legislation may be contested from the viewpoint of the principles of equality and non-discrimination and such cases have become more and more frequent in the courts. As a result of this, the broad discretionary judicial power under these principles may be exercised quite frequently. The problem becomes even more acute when differentiation concerns the distribution of public resources. A review of non-discrimination in the distribution of resources easily turns into decision-making about the distribution of those resources. We are not persuaded that judicial proceedings are the most appropriate forum for such decision-making. Rational allocation of public (or more precisely tax-payers\u2019) money requires a comprehensive view, taking into account the totality of available funds and all legitimate needs. Given the scarcity of available resources and immensity of legitimate needs, not all of them can be satisfied and very painful trade-offs are unavoidable. Judicial proceedings in discrimination cases necessarily bring a very fragmentary and limited view of the question: they focus on a specific area, while all other areas of social life are completely overlooked. In our view, the judge and in particular the European judge, has to be extremely cautious in exercising his or her discretion in equality and discrimination cases, especially if their gist lies in an allegedly deficient allocation of financial resources. The majority, by addressing the issue of prioritisation of legislative aims in complete isolation from the Convention values, leave the area of judicial enforcement of Convention rights and enter the field of policy-making. Not only our views about what law is just, but also our views about what this Court\u2019s mandate is, are very different.",
