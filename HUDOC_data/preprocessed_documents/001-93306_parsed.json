Poland, no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4 October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention (see, Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised criminal gangs, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other coaccused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high. In this respect, the Court notes that although the authorities invoked the risk of absconding and tampering with evidence, they did not specify any concrete grounds justifying their opinion. On the other hand, the Court observes that the applicant and some of his codefendants had made attempts to disrupt the trial in its early stages (see paragraphs 16 and 41 above). Furthermore, it accepts that certain delays during the trial were caused by the defendants\u2019 obstructiveness (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above).",

However, as stated above, while this element is to be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 and may justify a longer period of detention than in a case concerning an individual offender, a member of an organised criminal group is entitled to the protection against unreasonably lengthy detention afforded by this provision (see paragraphs 44 and 48-50 above). As in other numerous similar detention cases, the authorities did not justify the applicant\u2019s continued detention by relevant and sufficient reasons (see paragraphs 45-50 above). Moreover, as demonstrated by the ever increasing number of judgments in which the Court has found Poland to be in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of applicants involved in organised crime, the present case is by no means an isolated example of the imposition of unjustifiably lengthy detention but a confirmation of a practice found to be contrary to the Convention (see, among many other examples, Celejewski v. Poland, cited above; K\u0105kol v.\u00a0Poland, cited above; Malikowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a015154/03, 16\u00a0October\u00a02007 and also Hilgartner v. Poland, no.\u00a037976/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046-48, 3\u00a0March 2009; not final). Consequently, the Court sees no reason to diverge from its findings made in Kauczor as to the existence of a structural problem and the need for the Polish State to adopt measures to remedy the situation (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62 ).",
