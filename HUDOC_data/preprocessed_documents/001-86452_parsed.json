Belgium, no. 13178/03, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2006XI). Paragraph 1 of this Article circumscribes the circumstances in which individuals may be lawfully deprived of their liberty. Seeing that these circumstances constitute exceptions to a most basic guarantee of individual freedom, only a narrow interpretation is consistent with the aim of this provision (see, as recent authorities, \u010conka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, \u00a7 42 in limine, ECHR 2002I; and Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, \u00a7 396, ECHR 2005III).",

That provision does not require that the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing. All that is required under subparagraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation\u201d. It is therefore immaterial, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national or Convention law (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, pp. 186263, \u00a7 112).",

On this point, the Court observes that the authorities were indeed taking steps to take the applicant out of the country throughout the entire period of his deprivation of liberty between 8 and 16 November 1999. It is therefore satisfied that this condition was met as well. It is true that a delay of three days occurred after 13 November 1999, due to certain administrative formalities. However, as these were dealt with quite rapidly, it could be deemed that the deportation proceedings were conducted diligently (see paragraph 8 above).",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Chahal, p. 1864, \u00a7 118; and \u010conka, \u00a7 39, both cited above; see also Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06774, 29 January 2008). Thus, the words \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d do not merely refer back to domestic law; they also relate to the quality of this law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention. Quality in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible and precise, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Dougoz v. , no. 40907/98, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2001II, citing Amuur v.

That position was further elucidated with the adoption in May 2000 of the regulations for the application of the 1998 Aliens Act, whose section 49(1) specifically provides that an alien may be placed in a holding facility until being taken out of the country only if this is expressly stated in the order for his or her taking to the border by force or his or her expulsion (see paragraph 12 above), and with the April 2003 amendment to section 44 of the Act, which provided that detention pending deportation could be imposed only on the basis of an additional order to that effect (see paragraph 11 above).",

Nor does the available evidence allow the Court to find that after his arrest he was not permitted to get in touch with a lawyer. The Court is accordingly satisfied that the applicant had the possibility of challenging the order in an administrative appeal or by way of judicial review (see paragraph 13 above). However, as has already been found above, the applicant\u2019s detention was not covered by this order. It is therefore not apparent that these avenues of redress were adequate or effective as means for vindicating his right to liberty. It is one thing for applicants to contest the decision to deport them, and quite another to challenge their deprivation of liberty pending deportation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ntumba Kabongo v. Belgium (dec.), no. 52467/99, 2 June 2005). Article 35 \u00a7 1 requires applicants to have recourse only to remedies which are sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged, and whose existence is sufficiently certain (see \u010conka, cited above, \u00a7 43). Article 5 \u00a7 4 also refers only to domestic remedies which are sufficiently certain (see Sabeur Ben Ali v. , no.\u00a035892/97, \u00a7 38 in limine, 29 June 2000; Kadem v. , no. 55263/00, \u00a7 41 in fine, 9 January 2003; and Nasrulloyev, cited above, \u00a7 86). The Government have not referred to any example of a person detained pending deportation having obtained his or her release by contesting the order for his or her deportation. This lack of precedents indicates the uncertainty of this remedy in practice (see, mutatis mutandis, Sak\u0131k and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 26 November 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VII, p. 2625, \u00a7 53).",

It is clear that an appeal to the higher administrative authority \u2013 which in the instant case meant the Minister of Internal Affairs or one of his subordinates\u00a0\u2013 would not have satisfied the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, which states that proceedings against detention have to be brought before a \u201ccourt\u201d, a term implying, firstly, independence of the executive and of the parties to the case (see Neumeister v. Austria, judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, p. 44, \u00a7 24 in limine) and, secondly, guarantees of a judicial procedure (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, judgment of 18\u00a0November 1970, Series A no. 12, pp. 4041, \u00a7 76; and also, mutatis mutandis, Chahal, cited above, p. 1866, \u00a7 130). As regards an application for judicial review, the Court notes that it could only be lodged if the administrative avenues of appeal had already been exhausted or if the timelimit for their exhaustion had expired (see paragraph 14 above). In these circumstances, and bearing in mind that the applicant was deported eight days after his arrest, the Court does not consider that he had a realistic possibility of using this remedy to obtain a speedy review of his detention pending deportation (see, mutatis mutandis, \u010conka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45, 46 and 55). It does not seem that the applicant had at his disposal any other avenues of redress, and Bulgarian law does not provide for a general habeas corpus procedure applying to all kinds of deprivation of liberty (see Stoichkov v. , no. 9808/02, \u00a7 66, 24 March 2005).",
