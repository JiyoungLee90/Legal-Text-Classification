On 14 March 2001 the old CCrP was amended to permit defendants to be remanded in custody if the charge carried a sentence of at least two years' imprisonment, if they had previously defaulted, had no permanent residence in  or their identity could not be ascertained. The amendments of 14 March 2001 also repealed the provision that permitted defendants to be remanded in custody on the sole ground of the dangerous nature of the criminal offence they had allegedly committed. The new CCrP reproduced the amended provisions (Articles 97 \u00a7 1 and 108 \u00a7 1) and added that a defendant should not be remanded in custody if a less severe preventive measure was available.",

The lawfulness of the arrest was challenged by the applicant in domestic proceedings, where the courts at two instances, having examined the applicant's claims that his arrest was not justified by a suspicion based on reasonable grounds, rejected them as unfounded (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above).

Italy, no. 27143/95, Commission decision of 14 January 1997, Decisions and Reports (DR) 88-A).

The domestic courts merely repeated the same conclusion concerning possible collusion, without citing any reason why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicant in support of his requests for release, they considered the risk of interference with witnesses and evidence to exist and be decisive. Furthermore, the Court has not lost sight of the fact that the applicant was not in custody for a certain period after the criminal proceedings had been instituted on the fraud charge.

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v.\u00a0France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7\u00a028, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273-B, and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee and Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003-IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4\u00a0October 2001).",

Nothing suggests that the applicant caused delays in the examination of his request for release or appeals against the detention orders. The Court considers that these four periods cannot be considered compatible with the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 4, especially taking into account that their entire duration was attributable to the authorities (see, for example, Mamedova v.

Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000). However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, a waiver of the right must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2006-II; Kolu v. Turkey, no. 35811/97, \u00a7 53, 2 August 2005; and Colozza, cited above, \u00a7\u00a028). A waiver of the right, once invoked, must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and informed relinquishment of the right. Before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be (see Talat Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 32432/96, 27\u00a0March 2007, \u00a7\u00a059, and Jones v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 30900/02, 9 September 2003).",

The circumstances surrounding Ms\u00a0Karlova's repeated refusal to represent the applicant, despite the trial court's attempts to discipline her, further support the conclusion of the deliberate character of the applicant's absence and dismissal of his counsel. The Court also considers that the applicant, being initially represented by three lawyers of his own choosing, could have been advised by his lawyers of the consequences of his refusal to attend the trial hearings and to terminate representation contracts and could have been expected to appreciate that his failure to attend and to retain counsel would result in his being tried and convicted in his absence and in the absence of legal representation (see, by contrast, Pfeifer and Plankl v.

In this regard the Court reiterates that proceedings held in an accused's absence are not in principle incompatible with the Convention if the person concerned can subsequently obtain from a court which has heard him a fresh determination of the merits of the charge, in respect of both law and fact (see Poitrimol, cited above, \u00a7 31). It is open to question whether this latter requirement applies when the accused has waived his right to appear and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance (ibid).

Firstly, the Court is convinced that the statement that Mr M. had organised an attempt to murder the applicant was clearly an allegation of fact and as such susceptible to proof (see, among many other authorities, McVicar v. the United Kingdom, no. 46311/99, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2002III; Steel and Morris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 90 in fine and 94; and Panev v. Bulgaria, no. 35125/97, Commission decision of 3 December 1997, unreported). That statement, directed specifically and exclusively at Mr M., established a causal link between the attempt on the applicant's life and Mr M.'s actions. This was explicitly accepted by the domestic courts (see paragraph 54 above). Whether or not an act has a causal link with another is not a matter of speculation, but is a fact susceptible of proof (see Pfeifer v. Austria, no. 12556/03, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2007XII). Having made the offending allegations, the applicant was liable for their truthfulness (see Rumyana Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 36207/03, \u00a7 62, 14 February 2008).",

France, no. 51279/99, \u00a7 66, ECHR 2002-V). In view of the nature of that averment, that task was not unreasonable or impossible (see, by contrast, Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, 25 June 1992, \u00a7 65 in fine, Series\u00a0A no. 239). However, no such proof was adduced. The only argument put forward by the applicant, pertaining to the alleged threats made by Mr M. two days prior to the attempted murder, was dismissed as false after the alleged witnesses to the threats had refuted the applicant's allegations in open court (see paragraph 54 above). The Court sees no reason to question that finding.",

The applicant also apologised (see paragraph 54 above). However, the admission and subsequent apology did not detract from the fact that the applicant's initial statements had been made known to a considerable number of individuals, including representatives of the mass media, their readers and employees of the Smolensk Regional Council (see, mutatis mutandis, Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 38 in fine, ECHR 2004II). Furthermore, the apology, while indicative of the applicant's willingness to rectify the situation, did not fully wipe out the damage inflicted on Mr M.'s reputation. The potential consequences of the allegations made by the applicant during the press conference for an individual who at that time was running for election were grave (see, mutatis mutandis, McVicar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a085). In any event, these developments, which took place only after the applicant had been made aware of the institution of the criminal proceedings against him in view of the defamatory nature of the allegations, do not show that the applicant was concerned with verifying their truth or reliability (see Rumyana Ivanova, cited above, \u00a7 65, with further references).",

In view of the margin of appreciation left to Contracting States by that provision, a criminal measure as a response to defamation cannot, as such, be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued (see Radio France and Others, cited above, \u00a7 40; and Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.\u00a0France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2007-...). Nor is it contrary to the Convention to require the defendant to prove, to a reasonable standard, that his allegations were substantially true (see paragraph 153 above). It should also be observed that the proceedings were instituted on the initiative of Mr M., not by a State authority (see, by contrast, Raichinov v. Bulgaria, no. 47579/99, \u00a7 50 in fine, 20 April 2006).",

Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, \u00a7 111, ECHR 2004-XI). It considers that the sanction imposed on the applicant \u2013 one year's probation \u2013 does not, in the specific circumstances of the case, appear excessive. The Court attaches particular weight to the fact that after convicting the applicant, the Justice of the Peace refrained from imposing the maximum sentence envisaged by Article 129 of the Russian Criminal Code (see paragraph 143 above) and opted for probation instead of a prison sentence, taking into account various mitigating circumstances (compare and contrast Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37, 112, 113 in fine and 118). The trial court gave cogent reasons for its ruling on this point, in line with this Court's case-law that a criminal sentence for defamation must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered (see Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, 13\u00a0July 1995, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 316-B; Krutil v.

In these circumstances, it considers that the applicant's suffering and frustration cannot be compensated for by a mere finding of a violation. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, and taking into account in particular, the length of the applicant's detention, it awards the applicant 5,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",

The counsel acted as the applicant's representative throughout the procedure. It is clear from the length and detail of the pleadings submitted by the applicant that a great deal of work was carried out on his behalf.
