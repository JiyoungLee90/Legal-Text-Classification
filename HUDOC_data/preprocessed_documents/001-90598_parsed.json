Furthermore, it observes that in cases of wilful ill-treatment resulting in death, a breach of Article 2 cannot be remedied exclusively through an award of compensation to the relatives of the victim. This is so because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful police ill-treatment to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough in the prosecution and punishment of those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity and the general legal prohibitions on killing, torture or inhuman and degrading treatment, despite their fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Nikolova and Velichkova v. Bulgaria, no. 7888/03, \u00a7\u00a055, 20\u00a0December 2007; Ya\u015fa v. Turkey, 2 September 1998, \u00a7 74, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI; Kaya v.

It is apparent from the above that the possibility of seeking and receiving compensation represents only one part of the measures necessary to provide redress for death resulting from wilful ill-treatment by State agents. The Court must, then, also examine the effectiveness of the criminal proceedings against the police officers. Accordingly, as the Government\u2019s preliminary objection under this head is closely linked to the merits of the applicants\u2019 complaints, the Court decides to join it to them.",

While it is true that it is not the Court\u2019s task to address issues of domestic law concerning individual criminal responsibility, or to deliver guilty or not guilty verdicts, in order to determine whether the respondent State has fulfilled its international responsibility under the Convention, the Court must have regard to the Istanbul Assize Court\u2019s considerations in convicting police officer M.Y. and to the punishment imposed on him as a result. In so doing, the Court should grant substantial deference to the national courts in the choice of appropriate sanctions for ill-treatment and homicide by State agents. However, it must still exercise a certain power of review and intervene in cases of manifest disproportion between the gravity of the act and the punishment imposed (see Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran, cited above, \u00a7 66).",

The first-instance court convicted a police constable, M.Y., and the proceedings against deputy superintendent A.O. are still pending as A.O.\u2019s whereabouts cannot be established. The Court further notes that, although initially the first-instance court sentenced officer M.Y. to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, his sentence was reduced to five years, as the court held that the offence had been carried out by two or more people and the main perpetrator had not been identified. The sentence was further reduced to four years and two months\u2019 imprisonment on account of the accused\u2019s good conduct during the proceedings. It is noteworthy that following his conviction, M.Y. was sent to prison on 28 February 2005, but was released on 19 March 2005, nineteen days later. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Istanbul Assize Court used its power of discretion to lessen the consequences of a serious criminal act \u2013 causing death as a result of inflicting ill-treatment upon a detainee \u2013 rather than to show that such acts could in no way be tolerated (see Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 75). The Court is also concerned that, although the proceedings have been pending for more than nine years, the former deputy superintendent A.O., who is accused of killing Mr\u00a0Yeter under torture, cannot be located.",

As a result, no disciplinary sanction was imposed on them. In this connection, the Court reaffirms that when an agent of the State is accused of crimes that violate Article 3, the criminal proceedings and sentencing must not be time-barred and the granting of an amnesty or pardon should not be permissible (see, mutatis mutandis, Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman v. Turkey, no. 32446/96, \u00a7 55, 2 November 2004, and Ye\u015fil and Sevim v. Turkey, no. 34738/04, \u00a7 38, 5 June 2007). In the present case, the way in which domestic law was applied (see paragraph\u00a023 above) undeniably falls within the category of \u201cmeasures\u201d which are unacceptable according to the Court\u2019s case-law, as they once again rendered the disciplinary proceedings ineffective.
