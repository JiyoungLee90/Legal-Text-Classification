However, the national authorities' obligation to take measures to facilitate reunion is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with children who have lived for some time with the other parent may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures to be taken. The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and co-operation of all concerned are always an important ingredient. Whilst national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such co-operation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited, since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account and, more particularly, the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention. Where contacts with the parent might appear to threaten those interests or interfere with those rights, it is for the national authorities to strike a fair balance between them, having regard to the general interest in ensuring respect for the rule of law (see Hokkanen, cited above, p. 22, \u00a7 58; Ignaccolo-Zenide v. , no. 31679/96, p. 265, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2000I; Nuutinen v. , no. 32842/96, \u00a7 129, ECHR 2000VIII).",
