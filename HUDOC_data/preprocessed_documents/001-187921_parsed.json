Accordingly, any outstanding aspects of the applicant\u2019s right to housing, including the evolution of his personal situation and any subsequent entitlement to additional housing, fall outside the scope of the present case. The Court further observes that the judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour has not been enforced and also notes the Government\u2019s acknowledgment of their obligations under the Gerasimov and Others pilot judgment and their intention to deploy all means to enforce the judgment which had remained without execution or resolve the issue by any appropriate means (see paragraph\u00a020 above). Indeed, in so far as the judgment of 9\u00a0April 2007 remains in force, the Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article\u00a06 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85). Having regard to the violation found, the Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well. It therefore considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the judgment of 9\u00a0April 2007.",

In general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention (see Shofman v. Russia, no.\u00a074826/01, \u00a7\u00a053, 24\u00a0November 2005, with further references). By finding a violation of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 and Article\u00a01 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 in the present case, the Court has established the Government\u2019s obligation to take appropriate measures to remedy the applicant\u2019s individual situation, that is to ensure compliance with the applicant\u2019s enforceable claim under the judgment of 9\u00a0April 2007 (see, for instance, Humbatov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 13652/06, \u00a7\u00a038, 3\u00a0December 2009, with further references). The decision on appropriate measures to enforce the judicial award, or, if this proves impossible, granting the applicant reasonable compensation, or a combination of these and other measures, falls to the respondent State (see, mutandis mutadis, Tarverdiyev v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no.\u00a033343/03, \u00a7\u00a066, 26\u00a0July 2007). The Court, however, emphasises that any measures adopted must be compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no.\u00a071503/01, \u00a7\u00a0202, ECHR 2004-II, with further references).",
