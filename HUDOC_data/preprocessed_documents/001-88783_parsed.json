The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. There is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective.

It further notes that the legal instrument referred to by the Government became operative on 1 July 2002 and that the applicants had clearly been unable to have recourse to the remedy invoked by the Government prior to that date.

It has held on many occasions that, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused. The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of a detained individual is particularly stringent where that individual dies or disappears thereafter (see, among other authorities, Orhan v. Turkey, no.\u00a025656/94, \u00a7\u00a0326, 18 June 2002, and the authorities cited therein). Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death of such persons. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000-VII, and \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7 85, ECHR 1999IV). These principles also apply to cases in which, although it has not been proved that a person has been taken into custody by the authorities, it is possible to establish that he or she entered a place under their control and has not been seen since. In such circumstances, the onus is on the Government to provide a plausible explanation as to what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned was not detained by the authorities, but left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty (see Tani\u015f and Others v. , no.\u00a065899/01, \u00a7\u00a0160, ECHR 2005\u2013VIII).",

On the other hand, they acknowledged the specific facts underlying the applicants\u2019 version of Abdulkasim Zaurbekov\u2019s disappearance. In particular, it is common ground between the parties, and it had clearly been established in the domestic proceedings (see paragraph 40 above), that on 17 October 2000 he had arrived at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD and entered its premises unimpeded. The Government did not convincingly show that he had ever left thereafter. In this respect, the Court notes the Government\u2019s reference to a witness statement by officer B., who had allegedly seen Abdulkasim Zaurbekov walking outside the territory of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD on the day of his disappearance, and their reference to a witness statement by officer S. to the effect that Abdulkasim Zaurbekov might have been killed by members of illegal armed groups (see paragraph\u00a036 above), which might suggest that Abdulkasim Zaurbekov had left the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. It observes, however, that the Government did not produce transcripts of the interviews of officers B. and S. to which they referred, nor did they corroborate those statements by any other witness statements, or any other evidence. The Court therefore cannot place any reliance in those statements and finds it established that Abdulkasim Zaurbekov entered, and never left, the premises of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD.",

The investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see O\u011fur v.  [GC], no.\u00a021594/93, \u00a7\u00a088, ECHR 1999III). In particular, there must be an implicit requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition (see Ya\u015fa v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 2 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, \u00a7\u00a0102-04, and Mahmut Kaya v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022535/93, ECHR 2000-III, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0106-07). It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the next of kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see Shanaghan\u00a0v. the , no.\u00a037715/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a091-92, 4 May 2001).",

Indeed, from the information provided by the Government it can be ascertained that law-enforcement officers who at the time of Abdulkasim Zaurbekov\u2019s disappearance had been serving at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD were only questioned in 2002\u00a0\u2013\u00a02005 (see paragraph 36 above), most likely when they had already left for their permanent place of residence.

The Court thus considers that in the circumstances of the case it has not been established with sufficient certainty that the remedy advanced by the Government would have been effective within the meaning of the Convention.

[GC], no.\u00a023763/94, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 1999IV). This obligation requires the Contracting States to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court, whether it is conducting a fact-finding investigation or performing its general duties as regards the examination of applications. Failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their hands, without a satisfactory explanation, may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.

The Court further notes that the provisions of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to which the Government referred, do not preclude disclosure of the documents from the file of an ongoing investigation, but rather set out the procedure for and limits to such disclosure. The Government failed to specify the nature of the documents and the grounds on which they could not be disclosed (see, for similar conclusions, Mikheyev v.

The Court also notes that in a number of comparable cases that have been reviewed by the Court, similar requests have been made to the Russian Government and the documents from the investigation files have been submitted without reference to Article\u00a0161 (see, for example, Khashiyev and Akayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a046, and Magomadov and Magomadov v. , no.\u00a068004/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a036 and 82, 12\u00a0July 2007).
