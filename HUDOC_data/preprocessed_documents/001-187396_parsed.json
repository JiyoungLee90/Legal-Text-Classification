As regards her first reason for continuing the proceedings, it held that she had already been awarded the maximum number of points allowed by law for experience abroad. As regards her chances of being selected as a deputy coordinator of education in a future selection procedure, the domestic court held that that was not a lawful reason to continue the procedure in court, because it concerned an uncertain, future administrative procedure. Based on the above and on domestic law, the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal held that there was no need to adjudicate, on the grounds that the contested act was no longer in force (decision). As regards the applicant\u2019s arguments that the eventual rejection of her application would violate Article 20 of the Constitution and Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the domestic court held that the provision of Article 32 \u00a7 2 of Presidential decree no. 18/1989 served the legal aim of avoiding any unnecessary trials. The individual who had lodged the application was no longer in need of judicial protection as the contested act no longer had any unfavourable consequences. Having also regard to the possibility provided for by law to continue the trial if the individual could prove that he or she still suffered from unfavourable consequences that could be removed only by the annulment of the contested act, the right to judicial protection remained intact.",

There can be no doubt about the fact that there is a right within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 where a substantive right recognised in domestic law is accompanied by a procedural right to have that right enforced through the courts (see Regner v. the Czech Republic [GC], no.\u00a035289/11, \u00a7\u00a7 101-102, 19\u00a0September\u00a02017). Furthermore, in some cases, national law, while not necessarily recognising that an individual has a subjective right, does confer the right to a lawful procedure for examination of his or her claim, involving matters such as ruling whether a decision was arbitrary or ultra vires or whether there were procedural irregularities (see Van Marle and Others v. the Netherlands, 26\u00a0June 1986, \u00a7\u00a035, Series A\u00a0no.\u00a0101, and, mutatis mutandis, K\u00f6k v. Turkey, no. 1855/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 19\u00a0October 2006). This is the case as regards certain decisions where the authorities have a purely discretionary power to grant or refuse an advantage or privilege, with the law conferring on the person concerned the right to apply to the courts, which, where they find that the decision was unlawful, may set it aside. In such a case Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7 1 of the Convention is applicable, on condition that the advantage or privilege, once granted, gives rise to a civil right (see Regner, cited above \u00a7\u00a0105).",

According to these criteria, in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant\u2019s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. First, the State, in its national law, must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question.

France (dec.), no. 171/03, 15 November 2005, and Tencheva\u2011Rafailov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 13885/04, 5 January 2010). However, the Court later considered that an applicant who possessed all the necessary qualifications for a post and could legitimately expect to obtain it, could invoke Article 6 as the outcome of the proceedings would be directly decisive for his or her right to participate in a recruitment procedure conducted in compliance with the principles of legality and transparency, where such right was arguably recognised under the domestic law (see Fiume v. Italy, no. 20774/05, \u00a7 35, 30 June 2009; see also Majski v.

Similarly, in Tsanova-Gecheva v. Bulgaria (no.\u00a043800/12, \u00a7 84, 15 September 2015), the Court held that the proceedings were decisive for the applicant\u2019s right to a lawful and fair promotion procedure in so far as they could have ended in the annulment of the contested procedure and the organisation of a new competition for the post, if the domestic courts had granted the applicant\u2019s appeal (see also Dzhidzheva-Trendafilova cited above, \u00a7 43).",

As a result, the applicant had the right to challenge before the domestic courts the fact that she had not been chosen for the posts and the legality of the procedure followed.

The combination of all these safeguards makes up the right to a fair trial secured by Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 18). However, the right of access to the courts is not absolute and may be subject to limitations that do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, \u00a7\u00a0120, 23 June 2016, and Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 76943/11, \u00a7 89, 29 November 2016).",

Thus, in principle, it cannot be ruled out that, in exceptional cases, the maintenance of a pending procedure for an excessive period may affect even the right of access to a court. In particular, the unjustified absence of a decision by the trial court for a particularly prolonged period may inevitably amount to a denial of justice; the remedy exercised by the person concerned may be deprived of all its effectiveness, when the court concerned fails to settle the dispute in due time, as required by the circumstances and the issue of each particular case (see Vassilios Athanasiou and Others v.

The contested act, by its nature, called for a speedy examination of its validity as its duration was for a period of two years, and was therefore liable to expire soon, a fact which the applicant\u2019s representative stressed with his two memoranda, submitted on 16 July 2009 and 28 May 2010. However, adjournments took place on 13 November 2009, 5\u00a0March, 4\u00a0June, 17\u00a0September\u00a0and 8\u00a0October 2010, until the case was finally heard on 10\u00a0December\u00a02010. With the exception of the first adjournment, on which no information has been provided to the Court, it appears that the sole reason for those adjournments was the delay of the Administration in adducing their views on the additional grounds for annulment lodged by the applicant on 3 February 2010. The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant contributed significantly to the delays because she submitted additional grounds for annulment. It recalls however that it has consistently held that applicants cannot be blamed for making full use of the remedies available to them under domestic law (see Golha v. the Czech Republic, no. 7051/06, \u00a7 59, 26\u00a0May 2011). On the contrary, it is for the Contracting States to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts are able to guarantee the right of everyone to obtain a final decision on disputes concerning civil rights and obligations within a reasonable time (see Comingersoll S.A. v.\u00a0Portugal [GC], no.\u00a035382/97, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2000IV, and Vassilios Athanasiou and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a026).",
