The applicant's right to respect for her home was thus violated by the fact that there was no prior judicial warrant and no possibility to obtain an effective judicial review a posteriori of either the decision to order the search or the manner in which it was conducted (see Varga v. , no. 73957/01, \u00a7 73, 1 April 2008; and I\u015f\u0131ldak v. , no. 12863/02, \u00a7 52, 30 September 2008).

Nor could a private prosecution be regarded as access to a court. The threshold for \u201creason to suspect\u201d was very low and none of the private prosecutions initiated against officers having conducted or ordered a search had been successful. This remedy was therefore theoretical as well as illusory. The same was true for lodging a complaint with the Parliamentary Ombudsman (eduskunnan oikeusasiamies, riksdagens justitieombudsman) and the Chancellor of Justice (oikeuskansleri, justitiekanslern).

Under Chapter 4, section 13, of the Coercive Measures Act the legality of a seizure could be examined by a court. An unlawful search could also result in the civil or criminal liability of the State or the officer carrying out the search. Moreover, an injured party could bring a private prosecution if the public prosecutor had decided not to press charges. Also the possibility for the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of Justice to control the legality of measures taken by national authorities should be taken into account. In the Government's view the applicant had thus had access to a court in respect of the search and seizure conducted at her office. In the Government's view, Article 13 was of relevance only in the situations of ex post factum judicial review. As no charges had yet been pressed in the present case, there was not yet an arguable claim.
