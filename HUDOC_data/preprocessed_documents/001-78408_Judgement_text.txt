The case originated in an application (no. 29759/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Mr Marijan Mačinković (“the applicant”), on 12 July 2004.
The applicant was represented by Ms L. Kušan, a lawyer practising in Ivanić-Grad. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Štefica Stažnik.
On 5 September 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Kloštar Ivanić.
On 1 September 1999 the Ivanić Grad Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Ivanić Gradu) adopted a judgment ordering a certain F.P. to pay some money to the applicant. On 18 May 2000 the applicant sought enforcement of the above judgment.
The Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) issued an enforcement order on 6 July 2000.
On 20 November 2000 a court bailiff attempted to draft a seizure list of F.P.’s possessions, but he refused to cooperate.
On 19 December 2000 the applicant informed the court that F.P. owned a motor vehicle and proposed to seize it. On 17 April 2001 the court invited the applicant to advance the costs of the bailiff’s intervention, which the applicant did on 25 April 2001. On 12 April 2002 the court scheduled another on-site intervention for 3 June 2002, which was unsuccessful because F.P. once again refused to cooperate.
Pursuant to the applicant’s further motion, on 26 September 2002 the court decided that another on-site intervention would be scheduled after the applicant advanced the costs.
The applicant asked the court to size F.P.’s passport on 20 February 2003. Following that demand, on 1 July 2003 the court asked the Ministry of the Interior whether F.P. was the owner of a certain motor vehicle. The Ministry replied in negative on 22 July 2003.
The applicant then on 8 September 2003 asked for another bailiff’s intervention.
However, on 24 May 2004 the case-file was transferred to the newly-established Zaprešić Municipal Court.
Since F.P.’s wife presented the evidence that F.P. had paid part of the sum due to the applicant during the bailiff’s intervention on 25 October 2004, the intervention was adjourned with consent of the applicant’s legal representative.
However, F.P. did not comply with the rest of his obligation and therefore, on 24 December 2004 the applicant asked for another bailiff’s intervention. The intervention took place on 8 March 2005 and a seizure list was drafted.
On 29 September 2005 the applicant asked the court to schedule a public auction. The auction was scheduled for 22 November 2005.
The enforcement proceedings still appear to be pending before the first-instance court.
Section 63 of the Constitutional Act on the  (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske –Official Gazette no. 49/2002 of 3 May 2002; “the Constitutional Court Act”) reads as follows:
 “(1) The Constitutional Court shall examine a constitutional complaint even before all legal remedies have been exhausted in cases when a competent court has not decided within a reasonable time a claim concerning the applicant’s rights and obligations or a criminal charge against him ...
 (2) If the constitutional complaint ... under paragraph 1 of this Section is accepted, the  shall determine a time-limit within which a competent court shall decide the case on the merits...
 (3) In a decision under paragraph 2 of this Article, the  shall fix appropriate compensation for the applicant in respect of the violation found concerning his constitutional rights ... The compensation shall be paid from the State budget within a term of three months from the date when the party lodged a request for its payment.”
Under the case-law of the , constitutional complaints lodged under section 63 in the context of enforcement proceedings were to be declared inadmissible. In its decision no. U -IA/1165/2003 of 12 September 2003 the  interpreted section 63 as follows:
“The Constitutional Court shall institute proceedings pursuant to a constitutional complaint lodged under section 63 of the Constitutional Act [on the Constitutional Court] for the length of proceedings only in cases where the court has not decided within a reasonable time on the merits of the rights and obligations of the complainant, that is, where it has failed to deliver a decision on the merits within a reasonable time.
In the present case the constitutional complaint has been lodged for non-enforcement of a final decision by which the party’s rights and obligations had already been decided.
Taking into consideration the above cited provisions of the Constitutional Act [on the Constitutional Court] ..., the Constitutional Court is of the opinion that in this case the conditions for applicability of section 63 were not met.”
In its decision no. U-IIIA/781/2003 of 14 May 2004 the Constitutional Court provided further interpretation of section 63:
“Taking into consideration the above cited provisions of the Constitutional Act [on the Constitutional Court] and the fact that the constitutional complaint was not lodged for a failure to deliver a decision within a reasonable time but rather because the enforcement was not carried out, the Constitutional Court is of the opinion that in this case the conditions for applicability of section 63 were not met.”
In decision no. U-IIIA/1128/2004 of 2 February 2005 the Constitutional Court changed its practice, accepting a complainant’s constitutional complaint and awarding him compensation as well as ordering the competent court to conclude the enforcement proceedings within six months from its decision. In doing so, the  expressly relied on the Court’s case-law on the matter.
