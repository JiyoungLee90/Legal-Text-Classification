Instead, it was a procedural safeguard in favour of suspects against arbitrary prosecutorial decisions, aimed at guaranteeing that only on the basis of a judicial decision could an investigation be reopened against suspects already cleared of charges. This was demonstrated by the ministerial reasoning in the bill underlying the Code of Criminal Procedure, supported by scholarly views expressed in various commentaries attached to this provision of the Code, and proven by the fact that section 191 was located in Chapter IX, Title III of the Code (entitled Conducting the investigation), rather than Title IV (entitled Remedy during the investigation). In any case, under section 191, the investigating judge might order the continuation of the investigation only in cases where it was conducted against a particular suspect, which had not been the applicant\u2019s case.",
