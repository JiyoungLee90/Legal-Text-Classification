The delay in commencing the investigation was attributable to the first applicant as she had officially reported the crime only in August 2003 and not to a prosecutor's office, but to the President's Administration. The first applicant had allegedly mentioned the crime to officials from a prosecutor's office, whom she had seen on the VOVD premises, but their identities remained unknown.

Moreover, the Government mentioned the possibility for the applicants to apply for judicial review of the decisions of the investigating authorities in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court observes that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged actions or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Besides, given that the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the criminal-law remedies relied on by the Government were ineffective in the circumstances and rejects their objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, 25 June 1997, \u00a7\u00a064, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III).",

The Court notes that this case was rather complex and required a certain amount of research and preparation.

Moreover, the case involved little documentary evidence, in view of the Government's refusal to submit most of the case file.
