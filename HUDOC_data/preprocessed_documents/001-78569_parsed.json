That submission, which was not disputed by the appeal court or by the respondent Government, begs the conclusion either that the maximum permitted fourteen-day period of service had been significantly exceeded or that lay judge Kr. had been called for service more than once in the same year. In either case this amounted to a breach of the rules for the selection of lay judges established in section 9 of the Lay Judges Act (see paragraph 21 above). Furthermore, the Government failed to show that the requirements of the Lay Judges Act had been complied with as regards the drawing of judges' names by lot and the mandatory ratification of the subsequent list by the regional legislature.

The application of the domestic law on defamation in the present case does not appear unreasonable or unforeseeable.

A falsehood may be communicated by stating untrue facts, but also by leaving out true facts which, had they been stated, could have significantly altered the perception of the matter.

In the present case it appears that the applicants did not approach Ms P. for comments before publication and did not verify the information about her education.

It has been the Convention organs' constant approach that the claim to respect for private life is automatically reduced to the extent that an individual brings his private life into contact with public life. Thus, communication of statements made during public proceedings was not considered as giving rise to an interference with private life (see X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 3868/68, Commission decision of 25 May 1970, 34 Coll. 10; and, more generally, Friedl v. Austria, no. 15225/89, Commission's report of 19 May 1994, \u00a7\u00a044). When people knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which are or may be recorded or reported in a public manner, a person's reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although not necessarily conclusive, factor. It is also relevant whether the individual voluntarily supplied the information and whether he could reasonable anticipate the later use made of the material (see P.G. and J.H. v. the , no. 44787/98, \u00a7\u00a057, ECHR 2001IX; Lupker v.\u00a0the Netherlands, no. 18395/91, Commission decision of 7 December 1992; Peck v. the , no.\u00a044647/98, \u00a7\u00a062, ECHR 2003I; and Perry v. the United Kingdom, no. 63737/00, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2003IX (extracts)).",

He did so on his own initiative, apparently seeking to convince the court that the applicants' first publication had perturbed him and caused him damage. However, as the majority rightly stressed, the document was made available to the applicants in their standing as defendants and it must be assumed that it was read out in court as part of the written evidence, in accordance with the procedural requirements of the RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure. Thus, the information was accessible not only to the parties to the case but also to those members of the general public present in the courtroom. Although the applicants' publication of it undeniably contributed to wider dissemination of the information in question, Mr\u00a0K. could not reasonably have expected that it would be afforded the same degree of protection as that enjoyed by confidential medical material held in private files. For that reason we cannot subscribe to the domestic courts' finding that the applicants should be liable for the disclosure of information received in confidence.",

Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no.\u00a0313, \u00a7\u00a038). We are of the opinion that the impugned publication did not resort to offensive or intemperate language and did not go beyond a generally acceptable degree of exaggeration or provocation. Granted, the commanding officer of a regiment is not a politician. However, he is certainly a public figure, who has authority over 200 soldiers and is responsible for their wellbeing. Consequently, he is also subject to closer than usual public scrutiny and criticism.",

Iceland, judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, \u00a7\u00a063). We recall that, in this particular case, that interest was further aroused by the fact that a very large number of soldiers had fallen ill. The mental health problems of a military officer with more than two hundred conscripts under his command was undeniably a matter of general and particular public concern. We consider that public concern about the facts involved in this case overweighs the individual interests.",
