She argued that the conditions governing the individual applications under the Convention were not necessarily the same as the national criteria relating to locus standi (referring to A.K. and L. v. Croatia, no. 37956/11, \u00a7\u00a046, 8 January 2013), and that a restrictive or purely technical approach to the issue of locus standi must be avoided (S.P., D.P. and A.T. v. the United Kingdom, no. 23715/94, Commission decision of 20 May 1996, unreported). In that connection, the first applicant insisted that she and R. had developed emotional ties that were equivalent to those between a mother and her child. The first applicant stressed that, unlike in the case cited by the Government, she had been taking care of R. for a very prolonged period, and more specifically during the first nine years of his life; during that period she had remained the only significant adult in his life. Moreover, during that period, she had had a formal legal link to R., having been his guardian. The first applicant further insisted that there was no conflict of interest between her and R., and that R.\u2019s biological parents were not in a position to protect effectively his interests in the present case, given the issues it raised. The first applicant compared the situation in the present case with cases brought on children\u2019s behalf by their natural parents deprived of the parental authority over those children, and argued that there was a danger that otherwise R.\u2019s interests would never be brought to the Court\u2019s attention.",

Italy ((dec.), no. 38972/06, ECHR 2007-V). They pointed out that, once her guardianship over the child had been terminated, the first applicant had lost any entitlement under domestic law to act as his legal representative. R.\u2019s biological parents had full parental authority over him and were his legal representatives. They had never authorised the first applicant to represent R. before the Court.

Croatia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a048-49, with further references). The Court further observes that the first applicant is no longer R.\u2019s guardian, as her guardianship was definitively withdrawn by the court decision of 4 May 2010, as upheld on appeal on 23 June 2010 (see paragraphs 46 and 49 above), with the result that she no longer has legal status to act on his behalf in the context of judicial or other proceedings at the domestic level. Furthermore, R. has been transferred to, and is now living with, his parents, who have full parental authority over him, which includes, among other things, the representation of the minor\u2019s interests. They have never authorised the first applicant to represent R. before the Court.

The Government pointed out that, in various sets of proceedings, the domestic courts had established that R.\u2019s parents had never abandoned their child; they had enquired about his life and health, supported him financially, and brought him necessary medicine and food for a special diet and clothes; and they had also responded to the first applicant\u2019s requests regarding R.

The child\u2019s best interests may, depending on their nature and seriousness, override those of the parents. In particular, a parent cannot be entitled under Article 8 to have such measures taken as would harm the child\u2019s health and development (see, for instance, Kocherov and Sergeyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a016899/13, \u00a7 95, 29 March 2016). The parents\u2019 interests nevertheless remain a factor when balancing the various interests at stake. Child interests dictate that the child\u2019s ties with his or her family be maintained, except in cases where the family has proved particularly unfit. It follows that family ties may only be severed in very exceptional circumstances and that everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, if and when appropriate, to \u201crebuild\u201d the family (see, as a recent authority, Kacper Nowakowski v. Poland, no.\u00a032407/13, \u00a7 75, 10\u00a0January 2017).

The Court notes, firstly, that, as pointed out by the applicants (see paragraph 101 above), R. spent the first nine years of his life in the first applicant\u2019s care, a period during which she remained the boy\u2019s primary carer, having fully assumed the role of his parent. The Court considers that, albeit undoubtedly a considerable period of time, this factor alone could not have ruled out the possibility of R.\u2019s reunification with his biological family. Indeed, effective respect for family life requires that future relations between parent and child be determined in the light of all the relevant considerations and not by the mere passage of time (see Ribi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 27148/12, \u00a7\u00a092, 2 April 2015).",

At the same time, as pointed out by the Government, they never formally renounced their parental authority over their son; neither were they restricted in, nor deprived of that authority (see paragraphs 16 and 39 above). Moreover, the domestic courts established that, although during the first eight years of R.\u2019s life his parents had not maintained contact with him, they had nevertheless supported him financially and had accommodated the first applicant\u2019s requests regarding medicine, food for a special diet for the boy, and the like (see paragraph 18 above). Moreover, in 2009, they re-established their relationship with R. when the District Court determined their contact rights regarding him (see paragraphs 28-30 above). They therefore remained present in their son\u2019s life, with the result that, even in the absence of any explicit time-limits or conditions for ending the first applicant\u2019s guardianship in the text of the administrative decision of 23 November 2001, she could not have realistically assumed that R. would have remained in her care permanently. It thus rejects the first applicant\u2019s argument to that end (see paragraph 99 above). The Court reiterates in that connection that care orders are by their very nature meant to be temporary measures, to be discontinued as soon as circumstances permit, and any measures implementing temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parents and the child (see Ageyevy, cited above, \u00a7 143, and S.S. v.

In various sets of court proceedings, they noted, in particular, the first applicant\u2019s attachment and genuinely caring attitude towards the child; her proactive approach in taking care of him and addressing his health issues, which had ensured progress in his physical and psychological development and overall improvement of his conditions (see paragraphs 22 and 40 above). As regards the biological parents, initially the authorities had doubts about whether they were fit and capable of securing R.\u2019s needs. In particular, the authorities pointed to the lack of personal contact between them and R. and urged them to take a more responsible attitude regarding their parental obligations (see paragraphs 15, 19 and 23\u00a0above). In that connection, the courts rejected R.\u2019s parents first claim for the boy\u2019s transfer to their care, noting that such an immediate transfer could traumatise him and compromise his health, and that an adaptation period was necessary for R. to get used to his natural parents (see paragraph 24 above). In the proceedings concerning R.\u2019s parents\u2019 second claim for his transfer, however, the courts found that R.\u2019s parents were fit to raise him. It is noteworthy that by that time the contact arrangements between R. and his parents had been in place for a year. When taking that decision, the domestic courts satisfied themselves, with due regard to written evidence, including psychological reports, and witness statements, that R.\u2019s parents had re-established their relations with the child; that they could adequately understand his psychological particularities, emotional state, needs and capabilities; that they had appropriate living conditions for the child; and that the latter felt calm and comfortable with them (see paragraphs 35, 42 and 43 above).",

Moreover, even though the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individuals against arbitrary interference by public authorities, there may be positive obligations inherent in an effective \u201crespect\u201d for family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for family life even in the sphere of relations between individuals, including both the provision of a regulatory framework of adjudicatory and enforcement machinery protecting individuals\u2019 rights and the implementation, where appropriate, of specific steps (see, for instance, Kacper Nowakowski, cited above, \u00a7 71, 10\u00a0January 2017).",

Those provisions set out an exhaustive list of individuals who are entitled to maintain contact with a child, without providing for any exceptions to take account of the variety of family situations and of the best interests of the child. As a result, a person, who is not related to the child but who has taken care of him or her for a long period of time and has formed a close personal bond with him or her, is entirely and automatically excluded from the child\u2019s life and cannot obtain contact rights in any circumstances, irrespective of the child\u2019s best interests (see Nazarenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 67). The Court has found that the complete and automatic exclusion of the applicant from the child\u2019s life after his parental status in respect of her was terminated as a result of the inflexibility of the domestic legal provisions \u2013 in particular the denial of contact rights without giving proper consideration to the child\u2019s best interests \u2013 amounted to a failure to respect the applicant\u2019s family life (ibid., \u00a7\u00a068).",

In fact, in its final and binding decision, the appellate court limited itself to holding that the right to seek access to a child could in no circumstances be guaranteed to any individuals other than those listed in Article 67 of the Russian Family Code (see paragraphs 57 and 58 above). The Court cannot accept such reasoning as \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d to deny the applicants access to R.

However, its judgments are essentially declaratory in nature and, in general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (see, among other authorities, Scozzari and Giunta\u00a0v.\u00a0Italy\u00a0[GC], nos.\u00a039221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7\u00a0249, ECHR 2000VIII; Brum\u0103rescu v.\u00a0Romania (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7 20, ECHR\u00a02001-I; Akdivar and Others v.
