Moreover, it has been accepted that the limits of acceptable criticism in respect of civil servants exercising their powers may admittedly in some circumstances be wider than in relation to private individuals.

In fact, the article for which the applicant was convicted followed an article posted by B.M. and criticised the views expressed in that. It follows that even if B.M. could not be compared to a public figure having regard to his activity of headmaster, he still exposed himself to journalistic criticism by the publicity he chose to give to some of his ideas or beliefs, some of which were likely to give rise to considerable controversy (see BrunetLecomte and Lyon Mag\u2019 v. France, no. 17265/05, \u00a7 46, 6 May). The\u00a0Court additionally notes that as regards teachers, who are a symbol of authority for their students in the field of education, it has previously held that the special duties and responsibilities incumbent on them also apply to a certain extent to their activities outside of school (see Gollnisch v. France (dec.), no.\u00a048135/08, 7 June 2011 and the cases cited therein). Consequently, B.M. willingly exposed himself to public scrutiny by stating his political views and therefore had to expect careful scrutiny of his words and show a higher degree of tolerance towards potential criticism of his statements by persons who did not share his views (see GRA Stiftung gegen Rassismus und Antisemitismus v.\u00a0Switzerland, no. 18597/13, \u00a7 65, 9\u00a0January 2018).",

Nonetheless, it also reiterates that journalistic freedom is not unlimited and that the press must not overstep certain bounds in this connection, in particular \u201cthe protection ... of the rights of others\u201d (see, inter alia, MGN Limited, cited above, \u00a7 141). In the present case, the Court considers that neither the impugned statements nor the article seen as a whole can be understood to be a gratuitous personal attack on, or insult to B.M.",

Greece, no. 19331/05, \u00a7 38, 6 December 2007; Mika, cited above, \u00a7 32; and Athanasios Makris, cited above, \u00a7 38). In the instant case, the Court takes into account that the applicant was sentenced to a three-month suspended prison sentence. In that regard, the Court reiterates that while the use of criminallaw sanctions in defamation cases is not in itself disproportionate (see Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, \u00a7\u00a040, ECHR 2004II; Lindon, OtchakovskyLaurens and July, cited above, \u00a7\u00a047; and Ziembi\u0144ski v. Poland (no. 2), no. 1799/07, \u00a7 46, 5 July 2016), a criminal conviction is a serious sanction, having regard to the existence of other means of intervention and rebuttal, particularly through civil remedies (see Frisk and Jensen v. Denmark, no. 19657/12, \u00a7 77, 5 December 2017). The Court has emphasised on many occasions that the imposition of a prison sentence in defamation cases will be compatible with freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been seriously impaired, as, for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see Cump\u0103n\u0103 and Maz\u0103re v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no.\u00a033348/96, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2004XI, and Paraskevopoulos, cited above, \u00a7\u00a042). It considers that the circumstances of the instant case \u2013 a classic example of criticism of a person known in the local community in the context of a debate on a matter of public interest \u2013 presented no justification for the imposition of a prison sentence. Such a sanction, by its very nature, will inevitably have a chilling effect on public discussion, and the notion that the applicant\u2019s sentence was in fact suspended does not alter that conclusion particularly as the conviction itself was not expunged (see Marchenko v. Ukraine, no. 4063/04, \u00a7 52, 19\u00a0February 2009, and Malisiewicz-G\u0105sior v. Poland, no. 43797/98, \u00a7 67, 6\u00a0April 2006).",

In particular, they did not take into account in their assessment: the applicant\u2019s duty as a journalist to impart information on a matter of public interest and the contribution of his article to such a debate; the position of B.M. as a public official vested with public functions who had previously expressed his views on political matters; the presence or absence of good faith on the applicant\u2019s part and whether his value judgments were supported by a clear factual basis; and the content and form of the article. By omitting any analysis of those elements, the domestic courts failed to pay heed to the essential function that the press fulfils in a democratic society (see Margulev v. Russia, no. 15449/09, \u00a7\u00a051, 8\u00a0October 2019).",

Indeed, if the balancing exercise had been carried out by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for theirs (see Perin\u00e7ek v.

However, in the absence of such a balancing exercise at national level, it is not incumbent on the Court to perform a full proportionality analysis.
