They pointed to several shortcomings in the application of the legal regulations governing compassionate leave from prisons. Firstly, the wording of the domestic law left wide discretion to the State particularly as regards the classification as\u00a0to what circumstances could be regarded as \u201cespecially important\u201d. Moreover, the authorities usually provided very limited reasoning for their decisions so that prisoners were not sufficiently informed of the reasons for the refusals. They submitted that a prisoner should not be obliged to\u00a0produce a formal death certificate as it normally took time and delayed the procedure while other arrangements could be made for the authorities to\u00a0confirm the prisoner\u2019s assertion and a certificate could be delivered at\u00a0a\u00a0later stage. Moreover, there should be a right to an expeditious appeal against a\u00a0decision of the Penitentiary Judge as the 7-day time-limit could not be considered adequate in cases characterised by urgency.",

The Court emphasises that, even if a detainee by the very nature of his situation must be subjected to various limitations of his rights and freedoms, every such limitation must nevertheless be justifiable as necessary in a democratic society. It is the duty of the State to demonstrate that such necessity really existed (ibid \u00a7 35).",

The applicant had been convicted of\u00a0domestic violence, his term of imprisonment had been originally suspended in favour of probation, and there is no indication that he was a\u00a0dangerous criminal or that he had acted in an organised criminal gang. There is no appearance that the applicant had ever previously been convicted or detained; although the Government submitted that he had been simultaneously involved in another set of criminal proceedings for driving while under the influence of alcohol, they failed to inform the Court if\u00a0he\u00a0had been convicted of the offence. The applicant was thus not a\u00a0habitual offender whose return to prison could not be guaranteed. In\u00a0particular, there is no evidence that after the courts decided to enforce his suspended sentence the applicant had failed to report to the prison or\u00a0attempted to avoid the penalty. At the time of the events in question, on\u00a022\u00a0July 2003, the applicant had already served almost four months of his sentence. Thus, the Prison Director\u2019s negative recommendation regarding the applicant\u2019s request referred to by the Government does not seem to\u00a0be\u00a0supported by facts.",

In the absence of such grounds it is difficult for the Court to understand the reasons for which the Penitentiary Judge dismissed the applicant\u2019s request. The decision gave no\u00a0considerations to other measures expressly provided for by law which could have facilitated and secured the applicant\u2019s stay outside the prison such as the possibility of escorted leave (see P\u0142oski, cited above, \u00a7 36). Finally, it is regrettable that Penitentiary Judge\u2019s decision did not take into account the above-mentioned P\u0142oski judgment, in which the Court several months earlier had found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in\u00a0circumstances very similar to those in the instant case.",
