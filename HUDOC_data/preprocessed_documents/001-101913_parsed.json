As noted above, although the debt arising out of the bonds had been recognised by the  in a series of legislative acts, the absence of implementing regulations has made redemption of the bonds impossible. The thrust of the applicant's complaint was thus directed against the lack of legal regulation of his entitlement and absence of a specific procedure for redemption of bonds of that type. This element distinguishes the present case from those cases in which the legislative framework had already been put in place but applicants were dissatisfied with the level of compensation available to them (see, for example, Grishchenko v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a075907/01, 8 July 2004). On the other hand, the Court has recently had an opportunity to examine a series of cases substantially similar to the present one, in which the absence of implementing regulations for redemption of a different type of Russian bonds, Urozhay-90, was at issue (see Malysh and Others v. Russia, no. 30280/03, 11 February 2010; SPK\u00a0Dimskiy v. Russia, no. 27191/02, 18 March 2010; and Tronin v. , no.\u00a024461/02, 18 March 2010).

In the context of the present case, those principles required the  to fulfil in good time, in an appropriate and consistent manner, the legislative promises it had made in respect of claims arising out of the 1982 bonds (compare Malysh and Others, \u00a7 82, cited above). In particular, it was incumbent on the authorities to legislate on the conditions for implementation of the bond-bearers' entitlement, with a view to satisfying the undertaking that had been created through the enactment of the Savings Protection Act and follow-up legislation.",

Those acts laid down a legislative framework for settlement of bond-bearers' entitlements, which had been continuously recognised as part of the State's internal debt. In early 2000, the Russian Government adopted a regulation on the application of the conversion procedure. However, for reasons that remain unclear to the Court, as no explanation was put forward by the Government, starting from 2003 the application and implementation of the existing legal framework governing redemption of the 1982 bonds was repeatedly suspended, year by year. The information available to the Court does not allow it to find that the Russian Government took any measures in that period with a view to satisfying the claims arising out of the bonds. An appropriate balancing exercise determining the exact amount that would be required to settle the debt under the bonds in relation to other priority expenses could not have been possible in the absence of crucial figures, such as the quantity and total valuation of the remaining bonds. While the Court agrees that the radical reform of Russia's political and economic system, as well as the state of the country's finances, may have justified stringent financial limitations on rights of a purely pecuniary nature, it finds that the Russian Government were not able to adduce satisfactory grounds justifying, in terms of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the continuous failure over many years to implement an entitlement conferred on the applicant by Russian legislation (compare Malysh and Others, \u00a7 83, cited above).",
