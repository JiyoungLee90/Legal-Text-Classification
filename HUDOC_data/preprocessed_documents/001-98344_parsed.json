The investigation in case no.\u00a004600054 was instituted on 20 August 2004, that is, 18 days after Sultan Khatuyev's abduction. Such a postponement per se is liable to affect the investigation of a kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It also appears that within the following days the applicant, some of her relatives and two ROVD officials were questioned. The applicant was granted victim status in August 2004. However, it appears that after that a number of crucial steps were delayed, or not taken at all. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2004XII).",

No documents were sought or obtained about the alleged apprehension and questioning of Mr Khatuyev. It does not appear that, apart from Mr U.I., his fellow detainees were questioned. In fact, the presentation of the events in the Government's observations seems to leave more questions than answers.",

Other essential information, including the dates of adjournments and suspensions of the investigation, has not been communicated to her.

Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy relied on by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection. The Government argued that the applicant could have sought judicial review of the decisions of the investigating authorities in the context of the exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court observes that the applicant did, in fact, make use of that remedy, which eventually led to the resumption of the investigation. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in its early stages by the authorities' failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures. Moreover, the district court's instructions to the district prosecutor's office to investigate the crime effectively did not bring any tangible results for the applicant. The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant investigative measures were taken to identify those responsible for the kidnapping. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the district prosecutor's office. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicant's failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

His detention was not acknowledged in a meaningful manner, was not duly logged in any custody records and there exists no official trace of his subsequent whereabouts or fate. In accordance with the Court's practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371). In fact, the Government's argument points to the heart of the problem, because even though the evidence amply demonstrates that Mr Khatuyev had been deprived of his liberty by State agents, none of the safeguards against arbitrary detention contained in the domestic legal order had been employed.",
