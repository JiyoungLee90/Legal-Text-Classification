He argued, in particular, that the said courts\u2019 finding, on the basis of the case-file alone, that he had committed another burglary had disregarded the rule of law and the presumption of innocence as guaranteed by the Basic Law and by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention. His initial confession before the investigating judge was irrelevant as he had revoked that confession, the credibility of which had not been tested by the courts revoking the suspension of his sentence on probation. He further took the view that the question whether he had committed a new burglary had to be determined by the competent criminal courts following a trial. The domestic courts\u2019 finding that he had committed another burglary before he had been convicted thereof by a final judgment also disregarded the European Court of Human Rights\u2019 findings in a judgment of 3 October 2002 (B\u00f6hmer v.

The applicant had withdrawn his confession at the time of the decisions of the domestic courts revoking the suspension of the prison sentence.

The Regional Court was further of the \u201cfirm conviction that the applicant had again committed an offence\u201d in view of the applicant\u2019s confession before the investigating judge (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a020 above).",

Under that provision, it is a precondition for the domestic courts to revoke the suspension of a prison sentence that the young offender \u201ccommits a criminal offence during the period of probation\u201d (see paragraph 28 above). The Court considers that, in accordance with the clear wording of the provision, and contrary to what the Government\u2019s observations may suggest (see paragraph 49 above), it was therefore necessary for the domestic courts to have obtained certainty that the person concerned committed a new offence. It was not sufficient for those courts to make a finding that the person concerned was suspected of having committed another offence. The Regional Court in the present case accordingly confirmed that it was necessary for it to obtain certainty that the applicant had committed another offence and stated that, having assessed the evidence before it, it was convinced that the applicant had committed the new burglary in question (see paragraphs 19-20 above). This finding is, furthermore, not called into question by the fact that the decision to revoke a suspension, as was stressed by the Government, entails a correction of the initial prognosis based on section 21 of the Juvenile Courts Act that the applicant would not reoffend even if he did not have to serve his sentence (compare already B\u00f6hmer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61 et seq.).",

That provision is practically identical in its wording to Article 56f \u00a7 1 (1) of the Criminal Code, applicable to adult offenders, which was at the root of the breach of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention found by the Court in 2002 in the case of B\u00f6hmer (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63 et seq.). It further observes that it had already noted in that judgment that the German Federal Government had previously declared that it would consider whether an amendment of Article 56f \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code was necessary in order to ensure that the revocation of a suspended sentence in such circumstances does not conflict with Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 65).",

However, the proceedings in the present case reveal that the right under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention has not been fully implemented in line with that Article on the domestic level through interpretation of the wording of section 26 \u00a7 1 (1) of the Juvenile Courts Act.",
