In order to comply with this requirement, an interference does not merely have to have a basis in domestic law; the law itself must correspond to certain 'quality' conditions. In particular, a norm cannot be regarded as a \u201claw\u201d unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able \u2013 if need be with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.
