Referring to the rulings of the Constitutional Court of Russia (described in paragraphs 41-42 above), they contended that the applicant\u2019s procedural status of witness had not barred him from complaining to a court. They further pointed out that the applicant had not appealed to a court against any of the decisions not to institute criminal proceedings, although a court appeal had been recognised in the case of Trubnikov v. Russia (no. 49790/99, 14 October 2003) as an effective remedy against the arbitrary exercise of power by investigation authorities. The Government concluded that the applicant had failed to exhaust the available domestic remedies and suggested that the complaint concerning the substantive limb of Article 3 be declared inadmissible under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (a) of the Convention.

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7\u00a01 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and timelimits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used.

He further averred that the reasons given by the authorities to explain S.\u2019s use of the rifle were not plausible as it would have been much easier in that situation for S. to use the handgun he was carrying at his waist. It was also unlikely, in conditions where it was difficult to breathe and see because of the foam from the fire extinguisher, that within one or two minutes he could have found and cut the phone cords, put on a jacket belonging to one of the guards and hidden behind the doorframe to further attack the guards. Upon analysing the results of the expert ballistic examination, he held them to demonstrate that he had been shot while lying on the floor. He further pointed out that the results of S.\u2019s alcohol test showed that S. had avoided the test altogether and hence it was likely he had been in a state of inebriation. He presented statements from several individuals testifying that before the incident he had enjoyed good health and had never complained of any urogenital problems.

It further notes that the investigation authorities failed to examine the knife for fingerprints. It appears that in the disputed circumstances of the incident, an examination of the fingerprints on the weapon would have been decisive for the determination of the plausibility of the version of the events offered by the guards present during the incident. It also does not lose sight of the negligence in respect of a crucial piece of evidence, the amputated extremity, which was disposed of in a careless manner at the time when the investigation was already under way.

While the applicant might have been entitled under Article 56 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Russia to lodge requests and challenge the acts or omissions of the authorities as a witness, he was never consistently informed of such acts or omissions and, having been denied access to the case file, learned about some of them in a very haphazard manner.
