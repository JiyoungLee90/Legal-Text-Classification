The condition, that a person claiming a pension through the lawyers' pension scheme must be registered on a List of Lawyers at the time that the pension is granted, corresponded to the requirement under a damage insurance scheme of a valid contractual relationship at the time that the damage occurred. The system, about which the applicant complained, already existed when the applicant took up his profession and he must have been aware of the conditions for granting pension payments. He had also been free to join the general social insurance scheme (outside the bar) on a voluntary basis.",

It is true that the applicant must have been aware of the system as a whole when he started his profession as a lawyer, but that argument should not be overstated. In view of the compulsory nature of the affiliation to the Chamber of Lawyers pension scheme and the compulsory contributions thereto, it was clearly intended to give to lawyers reaching the retirement age a pension which largely corresponded to the cover provided under the social security scheme. In this respect the Court considers that an old age pension scheme can hardly be compared to a damage insurance contract, as the Government suggest, because the latter is designed for providing financial compensation for damage caused by an event, such as fire, flood or accident, which is not sure to occur, whereas the former is clearly intended to provide for means of subsistence in the future during a period of life in which the capacity to earn will diminish partly or fully. One cannot, therefore, expect a lawyer to subscribe to a further pension scheme under the social security system to protect himself against the complete loss of his or her pension just in case he or she looses the right to exercise the profession. This must be considered a quite exceptional risk. It also transpires from the facts which were stated after the applicant had gone bankrupt, that the Chamber of Lawyers had had considerable difficulty dealing with a situation which also seemed unusual to them. Moreover, the subsequent amendment to the lawyers' pension scheme in 2003, which abolished the condition that a lawyer must be inscribed in the List of Lawyers at the time of reaching the retirement age in order to be granted an old-age pension, and making the payments of that pension dependent on a minimum time of contribution (see paragraph 25 above) shows that that situation was no longer considered appropriate.",
