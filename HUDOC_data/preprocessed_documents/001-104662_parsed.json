It referred, in particular, to statements of a number of residents of the quarter that had come under attack on 19\u00a0October 1999 who, being eyewitnesses to the incident, insisted that the military planes had been flying at a low altitude and that the pilots could therefore have clearly seen that they were targeting a residential quarter. The decision further referred to the residents\u2019 statements to the effect that no illegal fighters had ever lived in their quarter and that property occupied by the rebel fighters had been located on the outskirts of Urus-Martan and by that time had already been hit by federal bombers, and that therefore there had been no reason to bomb a residential quarter inhabited by civilians. The decision went on to note that during the inspection of the scene of the incident large metal fragments of aerial bombs had been found and that, in addition, unexploded bombs were still lying in the courtyards of a number of properties. The decision stated that the evidence obtained proved the involvement of the federal air forces in the attack of 19 October 1999, this finding being confirmed by eyewitness statements, photographs and video-recordings, evaluation reports attesting to the inflicted damage and a report on the inspection of the scene of the incident.",

The letter pointed out, in particular, that whilst some of the witnesses had stated that they had seen planes that had allegedly carried out the strike, some other witnesses had indicated that they had not been able to see planes as on the day in question it had been cloudy and misty. Moreover, according to the letter, there were also discrepancies in witness statements concerning the overall number of planes that had allegedly participated in the attack and their colour. The letter went on to note that the origin of the ammunition fragments seized from two of the properties that had allegedly come under the attack on 19 October 1999 (see paragraph 133 below) had not been established and it had not been ascertained how it was possible for those fragments still to be found a year after the attack. At the end, the letter stated that at the same time the command of the United Groups Alignment and the Russian Ministry of Defence had reported that on 19 October 1999 the federal aircraft had not carried out any strikes on Urus-Martan.",

They both stated that the town had been occupied by the Wahhabis, who had significantly fortified it and prepared for long-term defence. According to them, the depth of defence extended to three to four quarters from the outskirts towards the town centre; the fighters had dug trenches and dugouts, filled pits with oil to be able to explode them on the approach of the federal forces, and organised numerous firing posts in residential buildings. Mr Af. also stated that the majority of the local residents had left the town, and that an insignificant number of residents remaining in Urus-Martan had been forcibly kept by the extremists who had used them as human shields. The decision also referred to statements of Mr\u00a0Kh., a resident of Urus-Martan, who pointed out, in particular, that at the material time more than half of the civilian residents had left the town because of persecutions by illegal fighters, who had detained, robbed, killed and used as human shields those residents who had shown resistance to them.",

The experts stated that General-Major Sh.\u2019s decision to carry out bomb strikes on 19 October 1999 on fortified points and bases of illegal armed groups and on their radio and electronic facilities had been well-founded and timely, as at that time the town of Urus-Martan had been occupied by illegal fighters, amounting to over 1,500 persons, who had fortified it and had not been prepared to surrender and who had been reinforced with a new group of around 300 illegal fighters a day before the attack. According to the experts, any other methods of action by federal forces, such as a ground attack, storming, forcing out, would have led to unjustified losses among them. The experts also stated that, when organising the bomb strike in question the command of the Group \u201cWest\u201d had taken certain measures with a view to minimising civilian casualties. In particular, according to the report, the military authorities had opted for pinpoint strikes, which had resulted in only six people being killed and seventeen wounded, four of the latter belonging to illegal armed groups. On the other hand, considerable losses had been caused to the illegal fighters who, as a result, had subsequently, on 7 and 8 December 1999, surrendered the town without fighting with the result that there had been no casualties among the federal armed forces. The report thus concluded that the actions of General Major Sh. and General Lieutenant G. had complied with all relevant instructions and regulations, including the Infantry Field Manual, that the decision to carry out a strike on 19 October 1999 had been reasonable and that the federal aircraft had been used in Urus-Martan on 19\u00a0October 1999 pursuant to competent officers\u2019 decision and taking into account the existing situation and intelligence data.",

Therefore, according to Mr K., the civilians residing in Urus-Martan had been warned; however, given that the illegal fighters had not surrendered, pinpoint bomb strikes had been carried out on their bases.

The pilots also stated that the results of the bombing had been recorded by means of objective control devices \u2013 video recorders and photographic cameras \u2013 and after the flight had been given to a commanding officer. The pilots insisted that they had been instructed to launch bombs in an area situated at a distance of no less than three kilometres from any inhabited settlement and that they had never carried out any strikes on Urus-Martan. They also stated that they had never heard of any such incidents, as in that case an internal investigation should have been carried out and those responsible should have been punished.",

Accordingly, in the Government\u2019s view, the decision of 17\u00a0November 2003 should be regarded as the final domestic decision for the applicants\u2019 complaints under Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention and Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1, and therefore the applicants should have lodged their applications within six months after the date on which that decision had been taken, that is before 18 May 2004. The Government further pointed out that, as could be ascertained from the Court\u2019s stamp on the application forms submitted by the third to nineteenth applicants, it had received those applications on 1, 14, 15 and 23 June 2004 and 7 February 2005 respectively, that is outside the six-month period that ended on 18\u00a0May 2004.",

Special considerations may apply in exceptional cases where an applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances which make that remedy ineffective. In such a situation, the six-month period may be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware, or should have become aware, of those circumstances (see Bulut and Yavuz v.

A civil court is unable to conduct any independent investigation and is not capable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings as to the identity of the perpetrators of fatal assaults, still less of attributing responsibility. Furthermore, a Contracting State\u2019s obligation under Articles\u00a02 and 13 of the Convention to conduct an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible in cases of fatal assault might be rendered illusory if, in respect of complaints under those Articles, an applicant would be required to pursue an action leading only to an award of damages (see Khatsiyeva and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a05108/02, \u00a7 112, 17 January 2008 and the authorities cited therein).

The Government, for their part, appear to have confirmed such a conclusion, albeit in a rather controversial manner. On the one hand, they advanced an argument about the applicants\u2019 alleged failure to avail themselves of a civil procedure to obtain compensation for their damaged property, whereas, on the other hand, they argued in their objection regarding the applicant\u2019s compliance with the six-month rule that \u201cthe decision of 17 November 2003 had established the absence of any grounds to hold the relevant officials criminally responsible for the alleged violations of the applicants\u2019 rights which, in its turn, indicated that there had been no grounds for the applicants to receive compensation in civil proceedings\u201d (see paragraph 195 above).",

As regards Governmental Decree no. 404 of 4 July 2003, which afforded a right to compensation to permanent residents of the Chechen Republic, it is clear from the relevant legal instrument that the compensation in question is paid without regard to the particular circumstances in which the property was lost, that is to say, irrespective of whether State agents were responsible for the destruction. Moreover, the value of the lost property is not taken into account either, since the overall amount paid for lost housing and other possessions cannot exceed RUB 350,000 (approximately EUR 9,000).

The situations where deprivation of life may be justified are exhaustive and must be narrowly interpreted. The use of force which may result in the deprivation of life must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a), (b) and (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims. In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 146-50, Series A no. 324; Andronicou and Constantinou v.

Moreover, an expert\u2019s report of 18 June 201 confirmed that metal fragments found at the scene of the incident of one of the residents\u2019 houses destroyed in the attack of 2 October 1999 were splinters from an exploded aerial bomb (see paragraph 88 above), a type of weapon that is also presumably held in the exclusive possession of the State.

They also failed to submit documents concerning that attack, such as copies of plans of the operation, orders, reports on its results, or the like.

It notes, in particular, that Mr K., a high-ranking officer, who gave explanations to that effect, later refused to confirm them alleging that he could no longer recall the events in question (see paragraph 160 above). In any event, in a situation where, as acknowledged by the Government, the authorities knew that the residents who had remained in the town were, in fact, prevented from leaving by the illegal fighters who intended to use them as human shields (see paragraphs 30 and 126 above), the measures referred to by the Government could hardly be regarded as adequate. It is true that the evacuation of inhabitants in a situation where they were held hostage by fighters might have been particularly difficult, but the Government did not demonstrate that the authorities had taken any steps at all in that direction, that they had attempted to organise a safe exit for civilians, to negotiate their evacuation with the fighters, or the like.",

It is clear from the relevant reports that both strikes on residential quarters of Urus-Martan had been carried out using aerial bombs (see paragraphs 88, 156 and 172 above), this being a high-explosive indiscriminate type of weapon. In particular, the Government acknowledged that during the attack of 19 October 1999 high-explosive fragmentation bombs of calibre 250-270 kg were used (see paragraph 34 above). The Court has already held that using this kind of weapon in a populated area is impossible to reconcile with the degree of caution expected from a law-enforcement body in a democratic society. As was rightly pointed out by the applicants, no martial law or state of emergency had ever been declared in the , and no derogation had been made under Article 15 of the Convention. The attacks in question therefore have to be examined against a normal legal background. Even when faced with a situation where the population of the town was held hostage by a large group of well-equipped and well-trained fighters, the authorities\u2019 primary aim should have been to protect lives from unlawful violence. The use of indiscriminate weapons stands in flagrant contrast to this aim and cannot be considered compatible with the requisite standard of care that should be exercised in operations involving the use of lethal force by State agents (see Isayeva, cited above, \u00a7 191).",

Nor does it overlook the relevant applicants\u2019 argument that, as is apparent from the military documents, the only target that had been indicated as pre-selected in the attack of 19 October 1999 was located at a distance of one kilometre from Urus-Martan (see paragraphs 34, 66 and 67 above), whereas the residential quarter that came under attack on that date had not been mentioned in any of those documents at all.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, the results of a large-scale attack involving federal aircraft should normally become known to the authorities immediately after such an attack. It falls to the State to ensure that State agents who participated in the attack duly report on it, and that the competent authorities, including those in charge of it, ascertain its results without delay. The Court does not overlook the Government\u2019s argument that at the relevant time active warfare was ongoing and that on the date of the incident in question Urus-Martan was occupied by illegal fighters. However, it notes that, as pointed out by the Government, the town had been overtaken by the federal forces no later than on 7 and 8 December 1999, and therefore the authorities could and should have become aware of the results of the attack of 2 October 1999 at that time. The Government did not advance any explanation as to why the authorities had remained passive, and had left without investigation an incident that resulted in multiple deaths and the destruction of property, from the time when they had regained control over the town of  until 20 October 2000.

The Court reiterates that the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention, and that they cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see, for example, Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2001III (extracts)).

It further notes that in a situation where the effectiveness of the investigation was undermined from a very early stage by the authorities\u2019 failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures, where the investigation was repeatedly stayed and reopened, and where the first applicant was not duly informed of the conduct of the investigation, it is highly doubtful that the remedy invoked by the Government would have had any prospects of success.

In line with its finding in paragraph 269 above with regard to the investigation into the strike of 2\u00a0October 1999, the Court considers that, even if the authorities did not have a realistic opportunity to commence the investigation into the attack of 19\u00a0October 1999 immediately after that incident, once they had taken over the town of Urus-Martan on 7 and 8 December 1999, they were under an obligation to enquire about the results of that attack and to institute criminal proceedings in that connection. The Court also finds that the authorities\u2019 failure to act for such a prolonged period significantly undermined the effectiveness of the investigation. Indeed, it is clear from the materials produced that a number of important items of evidence which might have been directly relevant to the attack in question, such as registers of orders given and received, registers of combat air missions, registers of military actions, tactical maps, tasking schedules, combat orders, reports on executed combat missions, photographs and tape-recordings, were destroyed a year, or even three months, after the attack (see paragraphs  and  above).",

Russia (dec.), no. 49790/99, 14 October 2003). Therefore, in the ordinary course of events such an appeal might be regarded as a possible remedy where the prosecution has decided not to investigate the claims. The Court, however, has strong doubts that this remedy would have been effective in the present case. The materials in its possession reveal that the authorities only notified the relevant applicants\u2019 representative of the decision of 17 November 2003, but did not furnish him with a copy. Moreover, he made it clear that he needed a copy of the decision of 17 November 2003 to be able to appeal against it in a court, but his request to that effect was explicitly refused by the authorities (see paragraphs 73 and 75 above).",

Indeed, it is highly questionable whether, in the absence of a copy of the decision of 17\u00a0November 2003, the relevant applicants, or their representative, would have been able to detect possible defects in the investigation and bring them to the attention of a domestic court, or to present, in a comprehensive appeal, any other arguments that they might have considered relevant. In other words, in the circumstances of the present case, the relevant applicants would have had no realistic opportunity effectively to challenge the decision of 17 November 2003 before a court. Accordingly, the Court considers that it has not been established with sufficient certainty that the remedy advanced by the Government had a reasonable prospect of success (see, in a similar context, Chitayev and Chitayev v. , no. 59334/00, \u00a7\u00a7 140-41, 18 January 2007).
