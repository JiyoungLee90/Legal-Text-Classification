It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim\u2019s behaviour. Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, inter alia, Price v. the United Kingdom, no. 33394/96, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2001-VII and Jalloh, cited above, \n\u00a7 67). Allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, Klaas, cited above, \u00a7 30 and Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7 67). To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 161 in fine, Series A no. 25; Labita v.

Treatment has been considered \u201cdegrading\u201d when it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their physical or moral resistance (see Hurtado v. Switzerland, \n28 January 1994, opinion of the Commission, \u00a7 67, Series A no. 280), \nor when it was such as to drive the victim to act against his will or conscience (see, for example, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands v. Greece (the \u201cGreek case\u201d), nos. 3321/67, 3322/67, 3323/67 and 3344/67, Commission\u2019s report of 5 November 1969, Yearbook 12, \np. 186 and Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7 110, \nECHR 2001-III). Furthermore, in considering whether treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, one of the factors which the Court will take into account is the question whether its object was to humiliate and debase the person concerned, although the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of \nArticle 3 (see Raninen v.\u00a0Finland, 16 December 1997, \u00a7 55, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII; Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 74, ECHR 2001-III; and Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7 68). In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment (see Labita, cited above, \u00a7 120 and Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7 68).",

The Court notes, however, that the applicant\u2019s placement in this cell was, at no time, considered by the prison authorities as a long-term measure.
