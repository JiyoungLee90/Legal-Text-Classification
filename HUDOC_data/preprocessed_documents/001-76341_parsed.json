He had applied for medical assistance almost every week. However, either he was provided with no medical assistance at all or it was offered to him a week after the paroxysm. The only medicine the applicant had received was an analgesic. He had not been given the specialised medicine prescribed by his uro-oncologist and bought for him by his mother at the request of the remand prison medical unit. On a number of occasions the applicant had undergone blood and urine tests and ultrasound scans. In 2003 he had been placed in the medical unit several times. However, the medical unit did not have facilities to perform specialised tests, e.g., a cystoscopy. The applicant had refused to undergo certain tests because the personnel of the medical unit was not qualified to perform them. The unit did not have a \nuro-oncologist and the applicant had never been examined by a qualified specialist. The ultrasound scan performed in August 2003 had revealed a new tumour in his prostate measuring eight millimetres. The diagnosis had been confirmed by the ultrasound scan performed in September 2003. A scan performed in December 2003 showed that the tumour had grown up to nine millimetres. The doctors of the medical unit had consulted by telephone the uro-oncologist, Dr\u00a0M., who used to supervise the applicant. However, the medical unit had never provided Dr M. with the information about the new tumour, as confirmed by his report of 9\u00a0September 2004.",

According to the applicant, this was further evidenced by the fact that the court had dismissed all his applications for release pending trial. Furthermore, while the prosecutor had raised no objections against the applicant's motion of 19 May 2003 to have certain evidence declared inadmissible, the trial court had not granted the motion. The court had thereby breached Article 234 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provided that in the absence of objections from the other party the court should grant the motion to exclude evidence. The applicant contended that this had violated the equality of arms and undermined the fairness of the proceedings.

This is confirmed by her signature on the document dated 9 September 2003 in which she acknowledged that as a witness she had been notified about criminal responsibility for giving false evidence. However, she had not been given the opportunity to testify at the trial.

The schoolboys were not eyewitnesses to the murder, but on 26\u00a0September\u00a02001, the date of the murder, they had seen two young men fighting and had subsequently learned that one of them had been found dead later that day. At the identification parade held half a year after the event M. had recognised the applicant as one of the men he had seen on 26\u00a0September 2001 and later confirmed this statement at a hearing on 8 September 2003 before the Preobrazhenskiy District Court. Z. had stated at the identification parade that he recognised the applicant. At the hearing he submitted that he could no longer remember what the offender had looked like. F. had stated at the identification parade that he had not been quite sure he could recognise the applicant and at the hearing he stated that he did not recognise him. Sh., who was not examined at the hearing, had stated at the identification parade that he had never seen the applicant before. The schoolboys' teacher, examined at the hearing, submitted that they suffered from certain memory problems or forgetfulness, because of which they could not adequately recollect a situation after half a year. The trial court accepted the schoolboys' statements as evidence that the applicant had fought with the victim on the date of murder. The identification evidence before the court thus comprised the conflicting evidence of four schoolchildren who had difficulties in recollecting events after half a year, and the identification parade itself had taken place more than half a year after the fight to which the identification related.",

The Court notes, however, that the trial court gave no explanation as to how the above items proved the applicant's guilt, nor indeed why they were relevant to the case at all, save for the victim's post-mortem and the crime scene reports, the relevance of which is obvious, but they do nothing more than confirm the death. At the same time the trial court established neither the reason for the quarrel that took place on 26\u00a0September\u00a02001 nor the murder weapon. The court of appeal did not make its own assessment of the facts. Therefore, in the Court's view, the applicant's murder conviction was to a decisive degree based on the assumption that the applicant had been involved in a fight with the victim near the crime scene, which the trial court found to be corroborated by the schoolboys' statements.",

The examination had showed no signs of anaemia and he had been released in a satisfactory state. The specialists who had examined the applicant had been suitably qualified. The examination and treatment provided had been appropriate to his condition.

According to the records in the applicant's medical file, after the resection of the cancerous tumour in 1994 he was recommended supervision by a uro-oncologist. Since that time until his arrest the applicant was under the supervision of the oncological dispensary no. 3 in , where he was regularly examined by Dr M.

During the applicant's placement in the medical unit of remand prison SIZO 77/1 of  between 23\u00a0January and 21 March 2003, examination by a uro-oncologist and a cystoscopy were recommended for him.

The Court reached a similar conclusion in the Labzov case, where the applicant was afforded less than 1 sq. m of personal space during his 35-day period of detention (see Labzov v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-49), and in the Mayzit case, where the applicant was afforded less than 2 sq. m during over \n9 months of his detention (see Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, \u00a7\u00a040, 20\u00a0January 2005).",

Russia (dec.), no.\u00a030138/02, 16 September 2004). According to the applicant, apart from his placement in the medical unit when walks were not permitted, he was allowed 40-minute daily walks outside the cell. The information was not contested by the Government. Accordingly, the applicant was confined to his cell for more than 23 hours a day. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the extreme lack of space weighs heavily as an aspect to be taken into account for the purpose of establishing whether the impugned conditions of detention were \u201cdegrading\u201d from the standpoint of Article 3. The fact that the applicant was obliged to live, sleep, and use the toilet in the same cell with so many other inmates was itself sufficient to cause distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention, and arouse in him the feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him (see the Peers, Kalashnikov and Labzov cases, cited above; see also the CPT's 11th General Report [CPT/Inf (2001) 16], \u00a7 29).",

He knew that in case of further development of the cancer, any delay in diagnosis could have fatal consequences as even surgical treatment would no longer be possible.

The Court accepts that, in addition to this minimum scope, other tests, e.g. a biopsy, might be required or recommended depending on the applicant's actual state of health. However, the Court considers that it was for the uro-oncologist who physically examined the applicant to assess whether such tests were required to supplement the examination conducted.
