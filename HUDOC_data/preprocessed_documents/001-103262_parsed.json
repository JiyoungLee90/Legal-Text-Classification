However, the obligation under Article 6 \u00a7 1 to hold a public hearing is not an absolute one. Thus, a hearing may be dispensed with if a party unequivocally waives his or her right thereto and there are no questions of public interest that would make a hearing necessary. A waiver can be done explicitly or tacitly, in the latter case for example by refraining from submitting or maintaining a request for a hearing (see, for example, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v.\u00a0Sweden, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 171-A, \u00a7 66; and Schuler-Zgraggen v.
