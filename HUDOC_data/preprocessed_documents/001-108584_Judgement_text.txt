The case originated in an application (no. 38202/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Vladimir Alekseyevich Melnikov (“the applicant”), on 15 July 2007.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 22 April 2008 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.
In accordance with the pilot judgment Burdov v.  (no. 2) (no. 33509/04, ECHR 2009...), the application was adjourned pending its resolution at the domestic level.
As the matter was not resolved at the domestic level, the Court decided to resume examination of the present application.
The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Vladikavkaz, .
By a judgment of 30 April 2002 the Military Court of the Vladikavkaz Garrison granted the applicant’s complaint against the commander of the North-Caucasus Military Institute of the Interior Armed Forces and, among other things, recovered in his favour a number of unpaid allowances due to the applicant for his service in the conditions of an armed conflict. The Court did not mention any specific amounts, instead suggesting that the debtor calculate them on a certain basis.
The above judgment was not appealed and became final. It was enforced in the larger part on 11 July 2008, with only the food allowance remaining unpaid.
On 8 December 2008 the applicant was paid the outstanding food allowance, and the judgment of 30 April 2002 was thus enforced in full.
