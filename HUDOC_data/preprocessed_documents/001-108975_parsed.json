However, the same term has been used to describe local Muslims who joined the foreign mujahedin, endorsed their ideology and adjusted to their way of dressing.

As stated by Ali Hamad, an ICTY witness of Bahraini origin who came to BH in 1992, some of the mujahedin were members of al-Qaeda who had the aim of \u201ccreating a base that would allow them to increase their area of operations\u201d.

They were also given religious instruction. A number of groups comprising foreign and/or local mujahedin were active. Notwithstanding instances of participation in combat alongside each other, it appears that these groups were anxious to maintain their distinct identities.

Although the original idea had been to replenish the unit with foreign mujahedin only, locals soon outnumbered its foreign members. The factors that motivated locals to join it included: its stricter regimental discipline; a better degree of organisation; superior equipment and combat morale; its religious dedication; and material benefits. The unit received funds and assistance from many organisations and individuals from the Islamic world, including the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation and the Benevolence International Foundation.

It was led by foreign mujahedin who were not appointed by the ARBH. At the top of the hierarchy was an emir, who has been described as the highest-ranking person within the unit. Abu Haris, a Libyan, was its first emir. In December 1993, he was succeeded by an Algerian, Abu Maali, who remained in that position until the end of the war. A different person from the emir, the military commander, headed the military council and was responsible for the conduct of combat operations. In 1993, this post was held by an Egyptian named Vahidin or Wahiuddin. After his death in October 1993, another Egyptian, Muatez, succeeded him. Muatez was killed in September 1995. The unit had a religious council, the shura, which was its supreme decision-making body. It consisted of approximately twenty prominent members of the unit, mostly of Arab origin. The emir was elected by and answerable to the shura. At the end of 1994, Sheikh Shaban joined the leadership of the unit. He was the head of the Islamic Cultural Institute in  and known to be an extremist who was well-connected with Islamic fundamentalists all over the world (the ICTY relied in that regard on a judgment of the Milan Criminal Court of 1 January 2006). He facilitated the recruitment of volunteers from Arab countries for the struggle in BH. Although Sheikh Shaban did not hold an official function within the unit, its members considered him to be the political authority and even the real emir within the unit. He could issue binding rulings (fatwa) and his authority was never challenged by the shura. Sheikh Shaban was killed, together with Abu Haris, at an HVO (Croatian Defence Council) military checkpoint on 14\u00a0December 1995.",

Article III of Annex 1A to that Agreement called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, including individual advisors, freedom fighters, trainers, volunteers, and personnel from neighbouring and other States, irrespective of whether they were legally and militarily subordinated to any of the local forces. In view of that, on 14 December 1995 the ARBH disbanded El\u00a0Mujahedin and ordered its foreign members to leave the country by 10\u00a0January 1996. Despite initial resistance, the shura accepted that the unit be disbanded. It would appear that awards, such as the \u201cGolden Lily\u201d, were given to its members as an incentive for foreigners to leave. Members of the unit were also provided with ARBH certificates of service, which assisted its foreign members to acquire BH citizenship.

He maintained that he would be perceived by the Syrian authorities as a member of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood (in view of his involvement in rallies organised by that organisation in the 1980s) or as an Islamist (given his association with the mujahedin movement advocating the Saudi-inspired Wahhabi/Salafi version of Islam). The applicant claimed that the Syrian authorities were aware of his activities in BH, as he had always been outspoken about them (for example, he had given a number of interviews to the Al Jazeera television channel and the Asharq Alawsat newspaper between 1996 and 2001). Those authorities had allegedly interviewed his father and brothers on several occasions in this connection and, furthermore, had held one of his brothers in detention for nine months because of his refusal to spy on the applicant. He referred to the situation of Muhammad Zammar, a mujahedin of Syrian origin, who had reportedly been tortured in Syria and sentenced to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment for membership of the Muslim Brotherhood (although no proof of his membership in that organisation had been presented at trial), belonging to an organisation formed with the purpose of changing the economic or social structure of the state, carrying out activities that threatened the state or might damage its relationship with a foreign country and weakening national feeling and inciting sectarian strife. The applicant claimed that he might also be targeted because of his draft evasion. Given all the above and the general political and human rights situation in Syria, the applicant argued that his deportation to  would expose him to a risk of being subjected to ill-treatment. Lastly, he submitted that his deportation would be contrary to Article 8 of the Convention in view of his family situation.",

They had links with fundamentalists all over the world (notably, through the Islamic Cultural Institute in Milan) and with charities which have been placed on the United Nations list of entities associated with al-Qaeda (such as the Al Haramain & Al Masjed Al Aqsa Charity Foundation, the Al Haramain Islamic Foundation, Taibah International, Igasa, Al Furqan and the Benevolence International Foundation). It is also well-known that some mujahedin were members of al-Qaeda (for example, Nasser Al Bahri, also known as Abu\u00a0Jandal, was admitted to Osama bin Laden\u2019s inner circle after having fought in BH and Somalia).",

Even assuming that this remained unnoticed by the Syrian authorities, the applicant was again made the centre of attention when he was wrongly identified as convicted terrorist Abu Hamza al-Masri in the US Department of State\u2019s Country Report on Terrorism in BH (see paragraph 26 above) and arrested in BH on national security grounds. The Court is of the view that these factors would be likely to make him a person of interest for the Syrian authorities. In fact, the applicant submitted a document issued by the Syrian security services on 16\u00a0August 2002 indicating that he should be arrested upon the moment of his entering the country and a document issued by the Syrian armed forces on 15 October 2009 indicating that the security services were holding a file containing information about the applicant.

It does no more than afford the Contracting States a means of preventing offences which are concrete and specific as regards, in particular, the place and time of their commission and their victims (Guzzardi, cited above, \u00a7 102; M.\u00a0v.\u00a0Germany, no. 19359/04, \u00a7\u00a7 89 and 102, 17 December 2009; and Shimovolos v.\u00a0, no. 30194/09, \u00a7 54, 21 June 2011). Detention to prevent a person from committing an offence must, in addition, be \u201ceffected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority\u201d (see Lawless v.  (no. 3), cited above, \u00a7\u00a014). Sub-paragraph (c) thus permits deprivation of liberty only in connection with criminal proceedings (see Ciulla, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Schwabe and M.G. v. , nos. 8080/08 and 8577/08, \u00a7 72, 1\u00a0December 2011, not yet final). Since neither the domestic authorities nor the Government mentioned any concrete and specific offence which the applicant had to be prevented from committing, his detention was not covered by sub-paragraph (c).

This case, in my opinion, should have been dealt with by the Grand Chamber because it is not only this applicant\u2019s case, but gives rise to the more general problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s inability to deal with the consequences of the presence of paramilitary armed forces on its territory after the war.

In view of that, on 14 December 1995 the ARBH disbanded El Mujahedin and ordered its foreign members to leave the country by 10 January 1996. The applicant decided not to do so. He stayed in the country and acted as leader of a group of foreign mujahedin and their supporters.

An expulsion may, however, give rise to an issue under Article 3, and engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if expelled, faces a real risk of being subjected to ill-treatment. The assessment of the existence of a real risk must be rigorous (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 96). As a rule, it is for applicants to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, they would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 (N. v.

The domestic courts therefore upheld the Asylum Service\u2019s decisions not to grant the applicant asylum, which decisions, in my understanding, were correct and justified. Under the domestic legislation, a claim for asylum and an application for judicial review of a refusal of such a claim have a suspensive effect on the enforcement of a deportation order.

One of the exceptions, contained in sub-paragraph (c), permits the State to control the liberty of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so. I find this to be a basis for the applicant\u2019s arrest and the initial period of his detention. The first period of the applicant\u2019s detention (lasting from 6 October 2008 until 31 January 2011) might not have been justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention, but the fact is that he was arrested not in order to face deportation but on suspicion of posing a threat to national security.

The applicant was arrested in compliance with the domestic law, pursuant to which an alien must be detained if it has been established that he or she constitutes a threat to national security (see paragraph 36 of the judgment).

I agree, except for the fact that in this case the arrest was not a measure of general prevention, but a very individual measure directed at someone who was previously convicted and, as established by the domestic courts, who posed a threat to national security and was wanted by INTERPOL.",

Ireland (no. 3), \u00a7 14). Sub-paragraph (c) thus permits deprivation of liberty only in connection with criminal proceedings (see Ciulla, \u00a7 38). Since the domestic authorities had not brought criminal proceedings against the applicant, the application of sub-paragraph (c) would necessarily lead to finding a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1, which I would have supported if the Chamber had decided to apply Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c).",

I am of the opposite opinion. While I believe that the applicant\u2019s deportation to Syria would not constitute a violation of Article 3, I am of the opinion that there would be a violation of Article 8 in the event of the applicant\u2019s deportation to , bearing in mind the decision not only to expel the applicant but to prohibit his re-entry for five years. As mentioned in the factual background to the case, the applicant is married to a citizen of  and they are together bringing up six children.
