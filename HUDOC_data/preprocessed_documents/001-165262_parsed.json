They added that they had not been preserved from the daily violence stemming from the confinement of other adults. They would come into contact with those adults in the communal areas of the centre. In addition, their child had been obliged to follow them in all their movements around the centre (OFII, CIMADE, medical visits), then on their visits to the courthouse (when summoned to appear before the Liberties and Detention Judge, Court of Appeal, Administrative Court), when they were always escorted by armed police in uniform, sometimes crossing paths with other detainees who were handcuffed.

It is convinced, however, that in the case of a longer period, the repetition and accumulation of such mental and emotional aggression would necessarily have harmful consequences for a young child, exceeding the above-mentioned threshold. Accordingly, the passage of time is of primary significance in this connection for the application of this Article. The Court concludes that the permissible short duration has been exceeded in the present case, which concerns the detention of a four-year-old child lasting for eighteen days in the conditions set out above.",

Secondly, they pointed out that Article L. 553-1 of the Entry and Residence of Aliens and Right of Asylum Code, as worded following the Law of 16 June 2011, now indicated that minors could be held in certain centres when the law expressly provided that they could stay there with their parents. Lastly, the Government noted that the prefectoral authority had examined beforehand the possibility of an alternative measure of restricted residence but had rejected it because the applicants had not presented guarantees that they would not abscond. In the detention order the prefect had thus noted that the applicants did not have sufficient guarantees that they would not abscond, as they did not have \u201ca valid passport, ... neither a fixed abode nor sufficient resources, [had] not complied with the previous removal directions issued to [them] and [had] formally opposed, when interviewed, [their] return to [their] country of origin\u201d.

In principle it is therefore immaterial whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national or Convention law, or whether the detention was reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent the person concerned from absconding or from committing an offence. The Court nevertheless has regard to the specific situation of the detained person. Thus, by way of exception, when a child is involved it considers that the deprivation of liberty must be necessary to fulfil the aim pursued, namely to secure the family\u2019s removal. In the case of Popov (cited above) it found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 after observing in particular that the authorities had not verified that the placement in administrative detention was a measure of last resort for which no alternative was available (ibid., \u00a7 119).",

That deprivation of liberty stems from the legitimate decision of the parents, having authority over their children, not to entrust them to the care of a third party. The Court can accept that such a situation is not, in principle, incompatible with domestic law.

The Court would refer to the finding of the Administrative Court of Appeal that there was no indication in the detention orders that the prefect had verified, in view of the child\u2019s presence, whether an alternative measure that would have been less coercive than detention was possible. Accordingly, while having regard to the reasons given in the prefect\u2019s decision to place the applicants in a detention centre, the Court takes the view that the evidence before it is not sufficient for it to be satisfied that the domestic authorities had effectively verified that the administrative detention of the family was a measure of last resort with no possible alternative.",
