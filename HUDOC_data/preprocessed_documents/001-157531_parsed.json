She explained that they used wood for heating and that the electricity had been cut off six months previously after an electrical accident. She contended that she cared for her child, supplying her with toys, clothes and shoes, and that A. had been provided with medical assistance by a medical institution other than the local polyclinic, submitting a copy of A.\u2019s immunisation record. She stated her wish to be with A. and her commitment to discharge her parental responsibilities. She referred to the letter of 27 October 2011 (see paragraph 31 below) as evidence that she had requested access to her child, but to no avail. She argued that the incident of 22 September 2011 had not been typical and could not constitute grounds for the removal of her parental authority. She submitted that she had left in order to work in Turkey for a period of only two weeks, after which she had returned to unofficial employment in different jobs, and supplied confirmation that after the incident she had found official employment in Moldova. She also supplied confirmation that she had obtained the documents necessary to enrol A. in a pre-school institution. She denied having been intoxicated at the Committee meeting on 27 September 2011 and stated that she consumed alcohol only occasionally.",

The possibilities of reunification will be progressively diminished and eventually destroyed if the biological parents and the child are not allowed to meet each other at all, or only so rarely that no natural bonding between them is likely to occur (see K.A. v.

The Committee decided to place her in the Municipal Children\u2019s Centre and to initiate proceedings to withdraw the applicant\u2019s parental authority. The district court decided to withdraw the applicant\u2019s parental authority and the appellate court confirmed that judgment. Both judgments were upheld by the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the situation of the child had improved considerably, as established in a psychological report (see paragraph 14 of the judgment). She was placed in the family of a professional social worker at the beginning of 2013 and afterwards with her aunt. Afterwards, from 26 December 2013 onwards, the mother was allowed to visit the child in the presence of the child\u2019s guardian.",

                        "content": "3.\u00a0\u00a0The majority considers that the domestic authorities did not give sufficient consideration to the best interests of the child (see paragraph 65 of the judgment), and did not focus sufficiently on reuniting mother and child. In my view the domestic authorities gave priority to the child\u2019s physical and psychological well-being when there was ample reason to believe that the child was endangered. I think the domestic authorities were in a position to make the right decision as to where the priority should lie. That is what prompts me to dissent from the majority, although I do acknowledge respectfully that there are strong procedural arguments in favour of the majority\u2019s position as well. I prefer, however, to lay the emphasis somewhat differently. It may be wise for our Court to display modesty in performing its role when it comes to establishing the facts. The Court rightly recognises that, in making decisions in so sensitive an area, local authorities and courts are faced with a task that is extremely difficult. Moreover, national authorities will have had the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned, often at the very stage when care measures are being envisaged or immediately after their implementation. There is therefore a need to allow them a certain margin of appreciation in deciding how best to deal with the cases before them, and it is accordingly not the Court\u2019s task to substitute itself for the domestic authorities but to review, in the light of the Convention, the decisions taken and assessments made by those authorities. I observe that there is no indication that the possibilities of reunification have been progressively diminished or destroyed, as the majority feared would be the foreseeable consequence of the domestic approach. On the contrary, the reality shows a different course of events: visiting rights were established after December 2013 and there is a possibility of a reunification in some form in the future. The child is being cared for by an aunt and thus within the wider family. The withdrawal of parental rights is not irreversible either, because reinstatement can be applied for on the ground of an improved situation (Article 70 Family Code of Moldova). Unfortunately, it may be indicative of the applicant\u2019s continuing problems regarding the exercise of parental responsibility that shortly after having given birth to a second child she consented to the child\u2019s adoption.",

In the circumstances of the case the domestic authorities had convincing reasons for giving secondary importance to the unification of the mother and child. A longer period of recovery for the child could be considered justified. On an overall assessment I cannot share the view that, as regards the withdrawal of parental authority, the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 8 of the Convention were violated. On the issue of the restriction of visiting rights, I agree that the decision not to allow any visits for the duration of the court proceedings was disproportionate, dismissing in advance any interim assessment of the possibility of responsible visits.",
