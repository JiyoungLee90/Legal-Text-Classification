This Court is concerned with the supervision of the implementation by Contracting States of their obligations under the Convention. It cannot, and must not, usurp the role of Contracting States whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined therein are respected and protected on a domestic level. The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection. States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see, amongst many authorities, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16\u00a0September 1996, \u00a7 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011IV; Gough v. the United Kingdom, no. 49327/11, \u00a7 137, 28 October 2014; and and Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v.

Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him from the requirement (see also Gough, cited above \u00a7 139; and Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077).",

If funding had been refused, he could have requested reconsideration and the matter would have been referred to the Sheriff Principal, an independent judge. While the applicant referred to counsel\u2019s advice to the effect that in the five years to February 2014, the Board had received ninety-seven applications for legal aid to judicially review its own decisions and had refused all of them, he did not provide details of the specific cases concerned and did not comment on whether legal aid funding was ultimately awarded following a review by the Sheriff. It is noteworthy that in EM, Petitioner, a challenge to a refusal to grant legal aid for the purposes of pursuing judicial review against the Board was successful, with the Sheriff indicating in October 2010 that in his view legal aid ought to be granted (see paragraph 30 above). The decision of the Court of Session in the judicial review proceedings was issued some ten months later, in August 2011. Throughout this same period, the applicant was pursuing his request for legal aid, and it is of some significance that his own instructing solicitors for the appeal before the Court of Session were also the instructing solicitors for the petitioner in EM (see paragraph 14 above).",

The Government did not comment on the likely timetable of such proceedings but in EM, Petitioner it appears that it took around nineteen months for the petitioner\u2019s challenge to the refusal to grant legal aid to be determined (see paragraph 30 above). The Court is accordingly persuaded that, notwithstanding his failure to seek judicial review of the refusal to award legal aid, on account of the potential delay only and in the light of the fact that the proceedings at issue in the present case concerned contact with a child and had already been ongoing for a number of years, in the exceptional circumstances of the case, the applicant was dispensed by reason of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d (see paragraphs 56-57 above) from his normal obligation to exhaust his available domestic remedy, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

At first instance he was granted legal aid and represented by junior counsel and solicitors, in proceedings in which the substantive hearing alone lasted no less than fifty-two non-consecutive court days (see paragraphs 9-11 above). He was likewise granted legal aid for his appeal to the Inner House of the Court of Session, being represented by senior counsel, junior counsel and solicitors (see paragraphs 13-14 above). It was only in relation to his appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom that, on reconsideration following a first refusal, he was denied legal aid by the Scottish Legal Aid Board (see paragraphs 19-20 above). The Board is an independent body charged with acting in the general interest in order to ensure that the limited amount of public money made available to the legal aid scheme is spent fairly and sensibly. When assessing the impact of the negative decision by the Board on the judicial \u201cdetermination\u201d of the family-law right asserted by the applicant, the Court cannot lose sight either of this general interest or of the fact that in the particular case the impugned denial of scarce legal aid funding came after the applicant\u2019s claims had been thoroughly examined by the domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction in proceedings in which the applicant had received legal aid and been represented by highly qualified lawyers.",
