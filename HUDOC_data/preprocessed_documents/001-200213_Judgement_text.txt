The case originated in an application (no. 56483/09) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Ruslan Alekseyevich Aleksandrov (“the applicant”), on 5 October 2009.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna of the Ministry of Justice. On 13 June 2019 the applicant was granted leave to present his own case.
On 30 May 2018 the Government were given notice of the complaint under Article 34 of the Convention concerning the failure of the authorities to provide him with copies of documents from his case file and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1978 and is detained in Berdychiv.
On 25 December 2008 the Court of Appeal of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (“the Crimea Court of Appeal”) convicted the applicant of two counts of rape and one of murder, sentencing him to fifteen years’ imprisonment.
On 21 May 2009 the Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the decision of the Crimea Court of Appeal.
The applicant is serving his sentence at the Berdychiv correctional colony no. 70 in Zhytomyr Region.
On 5 October 2009 the applicant informed the Court of his intention to file an application with the Court.
In a letter dated 10 May 2010, the Court acknowledged the receipt of the application form with attachments and asked the applicant to submit copies of domestic courts’ decisions and other documents relevant to the applicant’s case before 10 August 2010.
Between 2009 and 2013 on numerous occasions the applicant asked the Crimea Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Ukraine to provide him with access to his case file or to send him copies of procedural documents from his case file. He indicated that those documents were requested by the Court.
On 2 February, 11 June, and 7 and 9 July 2009, 10 March, 28 April, 1 and 21 July, 4 August, and 5 November 2010, 16 March and 5 October 2011, and 10 May 2012 the Crimea Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s applications to obtain access to his criminal case file. It explained that the applications had no legal basis, since the applicable law did not provide for the possibility to receive copies of documents from a criminal case file after a conviction had become final.
On 17 February 2012 the applicant sent another application to the Crimea Court of Appeal, asking it to provide documents from his case file which he would then send to the Court.
On 29 February 2012 Judge G. of the Crimea Court of Appeal replied to the above application, explaining that the applicant had received copies of all the documents allowed by law and that if he wished to receive additional copies of procedural documents in order to send them to the Court he should present to the Crimea Court of Appeal a confirmation that documents had been requested by the Court and a list of those documents, with both these texts drafted by an authorised person.
According to the applicant, on 13 March 2012 he lodged a similar application, seeking to obtain access to his case file, with the Crimea Court of Appeal. He attached the Rules of the Court to it.
On 22 March 2012 the Crimea Court of Appeal rejected the application since the proceedings in respect of the applicant had ended.
On 19 November 2012 the applicant applied to the Crimea Court of Appeal to authorise his mother, Ms G., to study his criminal case file.
On 4 December 2012 the Deputy President of the Crimea Court of Appeal rejected the application, as only participants in criminal proceedings had a right of access to the case file.
On 24 June 2013 the applicant applied again to the Crimea Court of Appeal, asking it to send him copies of the documents in his case file, indicating that those documents had been requested by the Court.
On 11 July 2013 Judge T. of the Crimea Court of Appeal replied to the above request, informing him that he had to pay a fee of 46 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) and send the confirmation of payment to the Crimea Court of Appeal after which it would send to the applicant the requested copies of the documents. The applicant did not do so. According to the applicant, he did not have sufficient funds to pay the fee, as he had no income. He had no legal counsel.
