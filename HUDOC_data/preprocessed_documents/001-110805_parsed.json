In both of those meetings it had been agreed that a divergence existed concerning the interpretation of the legal texts governing specific allowances for civil servants. The members of the committee had agreed that the lodging of an appeal in the interests of the law was necessary in order to put an end to the divergence. Taking as a starting-point the findings made by the committee on 13 May 2009, the Prosecutor General had lodged an appeal in the interests of the law which had been allowed by the High Court of Cassation and Justice on 21\u00a0September\u00a02009, thus marking the end of the divergence on the subject.",
