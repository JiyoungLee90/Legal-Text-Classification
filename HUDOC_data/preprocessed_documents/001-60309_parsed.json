It must be satisfied that the limitations applied, do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way, or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see among other authorities, Stubbings and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1996, Reports 1996-IV, p.1502, \u00a7 50).",
