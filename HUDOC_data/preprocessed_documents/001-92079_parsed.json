Nor was this person ever asked to identify the alleged perpetrators by using photographs, an identification parade or the like. Moreover, despite Mr\u00a0Y\u00fcce\u2019s statement to the police that he and Mr \u00c7etin had both been beaten up during their arrest, no criminal investigation appears to have been made concerning the arresting officers. Finally, the prosecutor never sought to secure the testimonies of any other potential witnesses, such as other civilians or detainees present during the arrest or at the police station at the time of the events, in order to establish the exact circumstances in which Harun \u00c7etin had received his injuries, particularly the head trauma noted in the autopsy report. In fact, it appears from the case file that the investigation undertaken by the prosecutor did not go beyond ordering an autopsy and taking the statements of certain other police officers. The Court is of the opinion that the above elements disclose significant defects in the reliability and thoroughness of this part of the investigation.",

The Court accepts that part of the delay in the proceedings stemmed from the absence of Mr Y\u00fcce, both a witness and complainant in the procedure. However, it cannot be said that this in itself justified the overall protracted nature of the proceedings before the national authorities. Rather, it was the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Assize Court\u2019s failure to act with the necessary diligence in conducting the proceedings, coupled with the shortcomings in the pre-trial investigation, that unnecessarily prolonged the case. In this connection, the Court observes that during the thirtythree hearings, held at irregular intervals with substantial delays, between 8 April 1994 and 24 February 2006, the first-instance court only focused on obtaining Mr Y\u00fcce\u2019s testimony and undertook no other investigative measures to elucidate the facts of the case. During this time the accused police officers were only heard once (see paragraph 15 above). It was not until the case was quashed by the Court of Cassation, within a reasonable time, for insufficient investigation and remitted, that the assize court decided on 21 November 2007 to request the medical records of the deceased and hear some other persons as witnesses, i.e. more than fourteen years after the events. In such circumstances, it cannot be held that the assize court has acted with sufficient promptness and reasonable expedition in a case where a person died after receiving a life threatening head trauma while in police custody.",
