In assessing the admissibility ratione valoris, the Supreme Court relied on section 40(3) of the Civil Procedure Act, which states that the court shall, by the latest at the preparatory hearing or, if no preparatory hearing has been held, at the main hearing before the examination of the merits, quickly and in an appropriate manner verify the accuracy of the value specified if it is obvious that the value of the subject matter of the dispute indicated by the claimant is too high or too low (see\u00a0paragraph 18 above).",

It further notes that the first-instance court failed to adopt a separate decision on the value of the subject matter of the dispute. However, in its reasoning on the merits of the case, the first-instance court stated that it had assessed the costs of the proceedings, inter alia, according to the value of the dispute indicated by the claimant at the hearing on 6 April 2005 (see paragraph 13 above). The second-instance court upheld the first-instance court\u2019s conclusions in their entirety (see paragraph 16 above). It follows that both the first and the second-instance courts accepted the value of the claim indicated by the claimant at the hearing on 6 April 2005. Moreover, they obliged him to pay court fees and costs of proceedings calculated according to that significantly higher value (see paragraphs 12-15 above).",

In the present case, the Supreme Court, although aware of all the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case and the alleged error made by the lower courts, interpreted relevant procedural rules on the value of the subject matter of the dispute in an excessively formalistic manner, thus placing the burden of the lower courts\u2019 errors on the applicant who at that point apparently had no further opportunity to challenge the court fees and costs of proceedings imposed on her. By placing the burden of errors made by the lower courts at the expense of the applicant, the Supreme Court acted contrary to the general principle of procedural fairness inherent in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, impinging on her right of access to a court. Consequently, the Government\u2019s argument about the Supreme Court\u2019s longterm, consistent case-law (see paragraph 22 and 32 above) cannot influence the Court\u2019s conclusion.",

The Supreme Court applied section 40(2), which refers to the value indicated by the claimant in the document instituting the proceedings. It found that the conditions for changing that value, set out in section 40(3), had not been fulfilled, and thus refused to base its determination of the value of the subject matter of the dispute on the higher value indicated by M.Z. at the hearing of 6 April 2005. There is, in our opinion, even less reason to criticise the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning as it seems to be in line with its long-standing case law (see the cases mentioned in paragraph 22 of the judgment). We also fail to see how the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation can be regarded as \u201cexcessively formalistic\u201d (see paragraph 40 of the judgment).",

Apart from situations where the interpretation of domestic law by the domestic courts is arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable, the Court should limit itself, as is stated in paragraph 36 of the judgment, to verifying whether the effects of the interpretation adopted are compatible with the Convention. That means, in our case, that the Court should examine whether the inadmissibility of the appeal to the Supreme Court is compatible with the right of access to a court. We find it difficult to accept that the limitation to claims above HRK\u00a0100,000 (approximately EUR 13,000) would not pursue a legitimate aim or would be disproportionate. On this point, we would agree with the Government, which stated that one should look at the proceedings as a whole and, in particular, at the fact that the applicant had been able to have her claim examined, in fact and in law,\u00a0at two levels of jurisdiction (see paragraph 30 of the judgment).",

Greece, no. 38460/97, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2001I), a decision to declare a request by a party to a court inadmissible as being lodged out of time, even though the delay had mainly resulted from the conduct of another court in transferring the request to the competent court (Freitag v. Germany, no. 71440/01, \u00a7 41, 19\u00a0July 2007), a court\u2019s failure to properly serve an order, so that it became final without ever reaching the applicant, and a decision to declare an appeal against another order inadmissible as being lodged out of time, even though the court had made a mistake regarding the date on which the appeal had been lodged (\u0160imecki v. Croatia, no.\u00a015253/10, \u00a7 46, 30 April 2014).

It is true that domestic law did not allow M.Z. to increase the value of the subject matter of the dispute in the course of the proceedings, that the lower courts apparently did not declare M.Z.\u2019s conduct unlawful and instead followed his approach, and that it was only the Supreme Court that noticed that M.Z. had acted in violation of section 40 of the Civil Procedure Act, However, that does not take away the fact that the initial error in the case was committed by the applicant\u2019s predecessor, not a State organ.",
