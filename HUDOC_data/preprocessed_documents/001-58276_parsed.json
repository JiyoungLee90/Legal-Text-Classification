The first applicant maintained that there had been a breach of this provision also on account of a lack of fairness of the proceedings and that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 (right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty).

Furthermore, the limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion. Moreover, the dominant position which the government occupies makes it necessary for it to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of its adversaries. Nevertheless it certainly remains open to the competent State authorities to adopt, in their capacity as guarantors of public order, measures, even of a criminal-law nature, intended to react appropriately and without excess to such remarks (see the Incal v. Turkey judgment of 9\u00a0June\u00a01998, Reports 1998-IV, pp. 1567-68, \u00a7 54).

On the other hand, the Court found that certain aspects of these judges\u2019 status made their independence and impartiality questionable (ibid., p. 1572, \u00a7 68): for example, the fact that they are servicemen who still belong to the army, which in turn takes its orders from the executive; or that they remain subject to military discipline; and the fact that decisions pertaining to their appointment are to a great extent taken by the administrative authorities and the army (see paragraph\u00a028 above).",

On that account they could, irrespective of the fact that they were acquitted in the first round of proceedings, legitimately fear that in the second round the Istanbul National Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicants\u2019 fears as to that court\u2019s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified. The proceedings in the Court of Cassation were not able to dispel these fears since that court did not have full jurisdiction (see the Incal judgment cited above, p. 1573, \u00a7 72 in fine).",

In that connection, I refer to the partly dissenting opinion which I expressed jointly with those eminent judges, Mr Th\u00f3r Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Mr\u00a0Matscher, Mr\u00a0Foighel, Sir John Freeland, Mr Lopes Rocha, Mr\u00a0Wildhaber and Mr\u00a0Gotchev in the case of Incal v. Turkey (judgment of 9\u00a0June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV) and to my individual dissenting opinion in the case of \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey (judgment of 28\u00a0October 1998, Reports 1998-VII). I remain firmly convinced that the presence of a military judge in a court composed of three judges, two of whom are civilian judges, in no way affects the independence and impartiality of the National Security Courts, which are courts of the non-military (ordinary) judicial order whose decisions are subject to review by the Court of Cassation.",
