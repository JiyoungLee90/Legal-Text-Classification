However, the\u00a0Court considers that the total length of the proceedings in the present case cannot be attributed to the inactivity of the administrative authorities or\u00a0of the administrative courts, but rather to a pattern of decisions flawed with various, mostly procedural, shortcomings. These decisions were repeatedly quashed by the authorities at a higher level or by the\u00a0administrative courts and the case was remitted to the local authorities for re-examination. In total, this occurred on nine occasions (see paragraphs 8, 10, 11, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24 and 25 above). Thus, the Court finds that the\u00a0usual remedies to counteract the inactivity of an administrative authority, available in the Code of Administrative Procedure, would not\u00a0have been effective in the present case (see Stevens v.

However, the Court observes that\u00a0the\u00a0proceedings complained of lasted over thirteen years, from 1994 to\u00a02007. Following the entry into force of the 2004 Act, the proceedings were conducted by the administrative courts in two separate periods, from 28\u00a0January\u00a02005 to 17\u00a0January\u00a02006 and from 22\u00a0January\u00a02007 to 15\u00a0October 2007 when the impugned proceedings ended \u2013 thus, for\u00a0periods of about eleven months and eight months, respectively (see\u00a0paragraphs 25-30 above).\u00a0The Court cannot fail to\u00a0notice that these two periods, which occurred shortly before the end of\u00a0the impugned proceedings, were of a relatively short duration in\u00a0comparison to the bulk of\u00a0the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case, which had been conducted either by administrative authorities \u2013 not covered by the provisions of\u00a0the\u00a02004\u00a0Act \u2013 or by administrative courts at a time when no remedy against the excessive length of judicial proceedings had been available in\u00a0domestic law, that is, before the entry into force of\u00a0the\u00a02004\u00a0Act. Moreover, the Court notes, on the basis of the constant interpretation given to the provisions of the 2004 Act by the domestic courts, that a domestic court dealing with a complaint under the 2004 Act would not have been able to take into account the whole period of\u00a0the\u00a0administrative proceedings which began in 1994 and to find a\u00a0violation of the applicant\u2019s right to a trial within a reasonable time. Consequently, the Court considers that, in\u00a0the\u00a0present case, a complaint under the 2004 Act cannot be regarded as\u00a0an\u00a0effective remedy (Pi\u00f3ro and \u0141ukasik v. , no.\u00a08362/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 2\u00a0December\u00a02008; Wypuko\u0142-Pi\u0119tka v.

It held that\u00a0no\u00a0persuasive arguments had been adduced by the Government to show that the\u00a0above-mentioned provisions of the Civil Code could at that time be\u00a0relied on for the purpose of seeking compensation for the excessive length of proceedings or that such an action offered reasonable prospects of\u00a0success (see Ma\u0142asiewicz v.\u00a0Poland, no. 22072/02, \u00a7\u00a7 32-34, 14\u00a0October\u00a02003, and, for administrative proceedings, Boszko\u00a0v. Poland, no.\u00a04054/03, \u00a7\u00a035, 5\u00a0December 2006). The Court sees no grounds on which to depart from those findings in the present case. The Court further recalls that, as it has recently found in its Iskrzyccy v. Poland judgment (Iskrzyccy v. Poland, no.\u00a09261/02, \u00a7\u00a055, 14\u00a0September\u00a02010), the judgment given by the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal on 20\u00a0April\u00a02009 \u2013 the same as the one submitted by the Government in the present case \u2013 was exceptional and did not reflect a well-established practice of the Polish courts.",

Moreover, the Court notes that the Government only briefly outlined the\u00a0two other judgments which it had invoked in their observations, without submitting copies of them or the written grounds thereof. For this reason, the\u00a0Court is unable to examine the factual circumstances surrounding those judgments. From the information provided, it appears that in\u00a0none of\u00a0the\u00a0invoked judgments were the plaintiffs awarded any just satisfaction. The\u00a0above-mentioned considerations lead the Court to conclude that the\u00a0domestic case-law relied on by the Government does not constitute evidence of a sufficiently established judicial practice to show that a claim for\u00a0compensation based on Article 417\u00b9 \u00a7 3 of the Civil Code was an\u00a0effective remedy, and they have thus failed to substantiate their contention (see Boszko v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, in \u00a7\u00a035; Grabi\u0144ski\u00a0v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, in\u00a0\u00a7\u00a074; and Pi\u00f3ro and \u0141ukasik v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, in \u00a7\u00a035).",
