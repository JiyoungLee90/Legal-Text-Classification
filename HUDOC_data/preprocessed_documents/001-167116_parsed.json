Greece, no. 46372/09, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 26 July 2011, and Hutchison\u00a0Reid v. the United Kingdom, no. 50272/99, \u00a7 47, ECHR\u00a02003IV). Moreover, the Court highlights that the notion of \u201clawfulness\u201d in the context of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) of the Convention might have a broader meaning than in national legislation. Lawfulness of detention necessarily presumes a \u201cfair and proper procedure\u201d, including the requirement \u201cthat any measure depriving a person of his [or her] liberty should issue from and be executed by an appropriate authority and should not be arbitrary\u201d (see Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7 45). In this context the domestic proceedings must themselves offer the applicant sufficient protection against a potentially arbitrary deprivation of his or her liberty (see Shtukaturov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a044009/05, \u00a7\u00a0113, 27\u00a0March 2008).",

Russia, no.\u00a026321/03, 22 April 2010) that where the issue of a person\u2019s liberty is at stake, the Contracting States must ensure that their courts remain accessible, even during a holiday period or a weekend, to ensure that urgent matters are dealt with speedily and in full compliance with a procedure prescribed by law (see Bik, cited above, \u00a7 37). The Court sees no reason to depart from that conclusion. Furthermore, the Court notes that in 2011 the Russian Government submitted to the Committee of Ministers a report on the execution of the Bik judgment (cited above) where it expressly mentioned that a duty schedule for weekends and holidays had been introduced in the Russian courts in order to prevent further similar violations (see Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.
