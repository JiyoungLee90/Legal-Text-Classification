Although it appears that the applicant put his time in incarceration to constructive use by taking a number of courses (see paragraph 16 above), the Court considers that no information relating to the applicant\u2019s behaviour following his release has been made available from which it could be deduced that the fears that he constitutes a danger to public order and security for the future have been mitigated (cf.
