The case originated in two applications (nos. 28432/06 and 5665/07) against the Republic of Moldova and Russia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Moldovan nationals, Mr Ion Grama and Mr Mihai Dîrul (“the applicants”), on 28 June 2006 and 16 January 2007 respectively.
The applicants were represented by Mr A. Postică and I. Manole lawyers practising in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr O. Rotari, and the Russian Government were represented by their Agent, Mr G. Matyushkin.
On 02 July 2018 the complaints under Article 13 and under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention were communicated to the respondent Governments and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible.
The Russian Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants were born in 1955 and 1944, respectively, and live in Corjova and Lunga, the Transdniestrian region of Moldova.
They had their cars registered with the authorities of the Republic of Moldova and had Moldovan registration plates on them.
On 17 November 2005 and 21 December 2006 the customs office of the self-proclaimed “Moldovan Republic of Transdniestria” (“MRT”) stopped the applicants and seized their cars on the grounds that they had Moldovan plates and had not been registered with the “MRT” customs authorities and no customs duties had been paid for their temporary use on the territory of the “MRT”. The applicants were obliged to pay fines of some 18 United States dollars (“USD”) and some 9 euros (“EUR”) respectively in order to recover their cars.
The applicants recovered their cars on 16 December 2005 and 27 December 2006, respectively, after having paid the fines.
According to the applicants, they complained to the authorities of Moldova, who did not undertake any action.
The Moldovan Government submitted that only the second applicant informed the Moldovan authorities about the seizure of his car. As a result, the Government informed the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and a criminal investigation was initiated by the Dubăsari District Prosecutor’s Office into that applicant’s complaints.
Reports by inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations, the relevant domestic law and practice of the Republic of Moldova, and other pertinent documents were summarised in Mozer v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia ([GC], no. 11138/10, §§ 61-77, 23 February 2016).
