Thus, the final decision regarding the applicant\u2019s allegations under Article 3 of the Convention is the decision of the Ardahan Assize Court dated 21 December 2007.",

The Government on the other hand did not seek to challenge the veracity of the submissions of the applicant. Nor did they submit to the Court any explanation or documents demonstrating that the decision in question had been served on the applicant or her lawyer. Having regard to the Government\u2019s failure to challenge and refute the applicant\u2019s claims and given that the applicant lodged her application with the Court on 10\u00a0July 2008, that is to say within six months of 21 January 2008, the Court concludes that, with regard to her complaints under Article 3, the applicant complied with the six-month rule. The Court therefore rejects the Government\u2019s submission that the applicant should have introduced her allegations of illtreatment to the Court within six months of the date of the Kars public prosecutor\u2019s decision.",

Whatever the reason given for the intervention of the police and the applicant\u2019s arrest, both measures prevented her from expressing her opinions and disseminating information and, therefore, constituted interference with her rights guaranteed under Article\u00a010 of the Convention.

In this connection, the Court observes that the judicial authorities, in particular the Kars Criminal Court, considered that the applicant and her friends had been required to present their identity cards and the leaflets to the police when asked and their failure to do so had led to a legitimate intervention by the security forces. The Court reiterates that the domestic authorities are better placed to examine and interpret the facts (see Florian Goldstein and S.C. Ring Press SRL v. Romania (dec.), no.\u00a0877/04, 10\u00a0April 2012) and to apply the national legislation. Given that the judicial authorities in the present case provided an acceptable assessment of the facts, the Court does not see any reason to depart from their findings. Thus, it finds that by not having complied with the lawful instructions of the police officers and having resisted the security forces, the applicant and her friends were themselves responsible for their arrest. In other words, the applicant was not arrested for having distributed leaflets or because of the content of the leaflets distributed, but she was arrested as a consequence of her behaviour towards the police officers. As a result, the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression should be regarded as an incidental effect of the police operation and thus as a measure proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",

They did not make any submissions as to the alleged unlawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention. Nor did the applicant lodge an action for compensation for the alleged unlawfulness pursuant to Article\u00a0141 of the Code on Criminal Procedure. In the circumstances of the case, the Court is led to conclude that the applicant\u2019s passivity in bringing her complaints under Article 5 to the attention of the domestic authorities was due to her consideration that these domestic remedies were ineffective. In these circumstances and in the light of the aforementioned case-law, the Court considers that the applicant should have lodged these complaints within six months following the end of her detention in police custody. As the applicant\u2019s detention ended on 21 October 2006 and the application was lodged on 10 July 2008, the Court finds that these complaints were introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

In this context the standards recommended by the CPT and the guidelines set out in \u201cthe Istanbul Protocol\u201d, as also recognized in the Court\u2019s caselaw, are very important (see the cases cited in paragraphs 49 and 57 of the judgment).",

If the police could disperse any demonstration by means of systematic identity checks of the demonstrators, this would amount to the end of freedom of expression in public space. The majority, following the Government\u2019s argument, considered the interest in public order and the prevention of crime to constitute sufficient grounds for the police intervention. This approach is in our view too broad because it gives the police carte blanche when it comes to identity checks. We start from the self-evident maxim that under the rule of law the police are also required to respect fundamental human rights, including freedom of expression. According to the case-law of this Court interference with the exercise of a fundamental human right in the abstract name of public order, without consideration of the necessity of such interference in a democratic society, amounts to a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.",
