It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature, such as time-limits for lodging claims. The Court\u2019s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no.\u00a030544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I; also see Pavle Lon\u010dar v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 15835/08, \u00a7\u00a038, 25 February 2014). In the present case it is clear that the domestic courts duly addressed the applicant\u2019s allegations about the missed time-limit for lodging the civil claim concerning his safety in the prison and his injury (see paragraphs 37, 39 and 40 above, also see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a080). What is more, even assuming that after the incident the applicant had been unwell for some time and had remained in hospital for three months (see paragraph 16 above), it appears that he failed to comply with the applicable domestic rules on prescription, because the three-year time-limit had already been reached in August 2006, thus long before the decision of 7 August 2008 was issued by the prosecutor, and on which the applicant has relied. Lastly, there is no evidence that the applicant\u2019s ability to request State legal aid was in any way restricted.",

Indeed, she made a number of enquiries on behalf of her son (see paragraphs 11, 25, 29 and 31 above).

The standard against which the investigation\u2019s effectiveness is to be assessed may be less exacting in cases such as the present one in which the ill-treatment has not been caused by use of force or similar direct official action.

Thus, the investigation into serious allegations of ill-treatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on.
