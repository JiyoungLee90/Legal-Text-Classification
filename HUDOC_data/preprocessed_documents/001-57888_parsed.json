Consequently, those who opposed this policy through the way in which they practised and the opinions they expressed had good reason to fear that, when hearing a case that concerned them, the union members would not show the impartiality to which everyone was entitled. He maintained, in addition, that the members of the Appeals Board bore a grudge against him personally because of the views he had expressed. In 1981 he had denounced the collusion between the Ordre des m\u00e9decins and the unions and he had joined the \"call of the 300\" medical practitioners angered by the Ordre\u2019s backing of a health care strike organised by the unions. Lastly, he pointed out that the capacity of the disciplinary bodies of the Ordre des m\u00e9decins to conduct proceedings in an objective and impartial manner had been questioned on many occasions by the press, among others, especially in so far as it was possible to be a member of those bodies and a member of the unions\u2019 organs at the same time.",
