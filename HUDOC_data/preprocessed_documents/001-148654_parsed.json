In exceptional circumstances this factor may therefore be taken into account for the purposes of the Convention, in any event in so far as domestic law recognises - as does Article 67a of the Netherlands Code of Criminal Procedure - the notion of disturbance to public order caused by an offence. However, this ground can be regarded as relevant and sufficient only provided that it is based on facts capable of showing that the accused\u2019s release would actually disturb public order. In addition detention will continue to be legitimate only if public order remains actually threatened; its continuation cannot be used to anticipate a custodial sentence. More generally, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence (see Letellier v. France, 26 June 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 207; see also Je\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2000-IX; Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7 81, 26 July 2001; Goral v.

On 14 February 2006 the Haarlem Regional Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention on remand, adopting the reasoning given by the investigating judge as its own (see paragraph 8 above); this order was renewed, periodically, until its order of 7 May 2007 by which the applicant\u2019s detention on remand was suspended. Even so, the latter order found that the grounds for the applicant to be detained on remand still existed; for that reason, it made the applicant\u2019s temporary release from detention subject to conditions designed to prevent him from evading justice or reoffending (see paragraph 12 above).",
