The case originated in an application (no. 10231/02) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Ukrainian nationals, Mr Vasiliy Ivanovich Zamula (the first applicant), Mrs Natalya Ivanovna Zamula (the second applicant) and Ms Maryna Zamula (the third applicant) (hereinafter “the applicants”), on 19 July 2001.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms Valeria Lutkovska, succeeded by Ms Zoryana Bortnovska.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 20 May 2003 the Former Second Section of the Court declared the applicants’ complaints partly inadmissible. It decided to adjourn the examination of the applicants’ complaints regarding the lengthy non-enforcement of a judgment, the unreasonable length of the proceedings in the applicants’ case and the alleged absence of effective domestic remedies for those complaints (Articles 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention) and to communicate these complaints to the respondent Government for observations. The Court also decided to apply Article 29 § 3 of the Convention and to examine the admissibility and merits of the case together.
The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 54A).
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The first applicant was born on 12 January 1952 and currently resides in Yevpatoria, the Crimea. He lodged his application with the Court on behalf of his wife (the second applicant), who died on 25 October 2001, and on behalf of his youngest daughter (the third applicant), born in 1980.
On 31 July 1997 police sergeant B.A.I. of the Shostka City Police Department, while under the influence of alcohol, fatally wounded the applicant’s eldest daughter, Mrs Iryna Yachmeneva (born Zamula).
On 3 March 1998 the  sentenced B.A.I. to 14 years’ imprisonment following his conviction for the murder of the applicant’s daughter, attempted murder of other persons and abuse of power. It also ordered the Shostka District Police Department to pay UAH 65,114.20 to the first applicant and his deceased daughter’s mother (the second applicant), youngest sister (the third applicant) and her former husband Mr Aleksandr Yachmenev.
On 7 April 1998 the Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld this decision.
The execution proceedings commenced on 19 May 1998.
On 15 May 2000 the Shostka City Execution Service informed the first applicant that UAH 1,223.56 were to be paid to the family, but that it was not possible to execute the decision in full. It also informed him that the outstanding debt was UAH 63,805.64, of which UAH 19,405.64 was to be paid to the first applicant and UAH 14,800 to each of the other victims.
In October 2000 the Sumy Regional Department of the Ministry of the Interior (the “Sumy Department”) underwent reorganisation and the Shostka District Department of the Interior was joined to the City Department of the Interior.
On 9 February 2001 the  declared the Shostka City Department of the Ministry of the Interior to be the legal successor to the debt awarded to the applicants by the judgment of 3 March 1998.
On 5 July 2001 the Bailiffs terminated the execution proceedings due to the Shostka City Police Department’s lack of funds. It was noted in the resolution that the writ of execution could be reintroduced for enforcement before 5 July 2004.
On 9 July 2001 the Sumy Regional Department of Justice informed the first applicant of the Police Department’s lack of funds. It also informed him that he could reapply for execution of the judgment of 3 March 1998 within a three-year period.
The second applicant died on 25 October 2001.
On 2 November 2001 the first applicant informed the Court that he was the guardian of Ms Ekaterina Yachmeneva, born in 1995, the child of his murdered daughter, whose father (A.Y.) had been divested of his parental rights.
On 16 July 2003 the Sumy Department informed the applicants that the awards were available for payment and they could receive them after presentation of the writs of execution of the judgment of 3 March 1998.
The first applicant received this letter on 22 July 2003.
On 21 January 2004 the Department of the Ministry of Justice urged the applicants to accept the sums awarded to them by the judgment of 3 March 1998. It mentioned that, in the event that the applicants refused these sums, their further recovery would be impossible and that “further consideration of the case would be discontinued”.
On 18 November 2003 and 22 March 2004 the Ministry of Justice informed the Court that the applicants had failed to reintroduce the execution writs at the State Bailiffs’ Service.
On 18 March 2004 the first applicant informed the Court that he was aware of the expiry of the writs of execution in the case.
On 13 April 2004 the first applicant instituted proceedings in the Yevpatoria City Court, seeking to renew the time-limit for a request to become the heir of his deceased wife. On 15 May 2004 the Yevpatoria City Court allowed his request.
On 23 April 2004 the first applicant reintroduced the execution writs with the Shostka Bailiffs’ Service in order to collect the UAH 15,000 in compensation for moral damage and UAH 5,114.2 in compensation for pecuniary damage. The Shostka Bailiffs’ Service reinitiated the enforcement proceedings in the applicants’ case on the same date.
On 22 June 2004 the first applicant received the full amounts awarded to him and his daughter. The enforcement proceedings with regard to the first applicant and his daughter were terminated on 30 June 2004. The writs of enforcement with regard to the award given to the first applicant’s deceased wife remained with the Bailiffs’ Service, as the Yevpatoria City Court was still considering the first applicant’s request to become the heir of his deceased wife.
On 27 April 2005 the applicant informed the Court that the inheritance proceedings were still pending before the Yevpatoria City Court.
