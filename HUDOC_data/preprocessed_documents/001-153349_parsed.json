She further argued that the applicants had been deprived of effective legal assistance and an objective examination of their case, because of an atmosphere of constant terror reigning in the courtroom. The Court of Appeal had failed to ensure order and it had been impossible to examine evidence and to submit new evidence in an objective and fair manner because of the repeated scuffles and stressful atmosphere. The conflicts, threats of violence, verbal abuse and scuffles had worsened during the last three hearings in the Court of Appeal. The court, however, had failed to take any measures, which precluded her further participation and even made it impossible to make her final pleading which, as a result, she had been forced to submit by post.

Similarly, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see, among other authorities, Aksoy v.

All these facts were known to the investigating authority, including the allegations that he had been ill-treated, even if the latter were not raised directly by him but by the other two applicants and by his lawyer. Taking into account all of the above, as well as the availability of sufficient medical evidence which led this Court to find a substantive violation of Article 3 of the Convention in respect of the second and third applicants, the Court considers, in the particular circumstances of the case, that the authorities were under the obligation to carry out an effective investigation also in respect of the first applicant.",

Considering that the authorities were called upon to investigate the actions of employees of the same prosecutor\u2019s office and their subordinates at the local police department, the Court cannot consider such an investigation to satisfy the requirement of independence and impartiality. It is noteworthy that at no point did the investigating authority provide any explanation as to why it considered the testimony of the police officers credible, and that of the applicants unreliable, despite the strong medical evidence in their favour. The decision refusing the institution of criminal proceedings made generalised conclusions lacking any reasoning (see paragraph 60 above). It therefore appears that the investigating authority, without any justification, gave preference to the evidence provided by the police officers and, in doing so, can be said to have lacked the requisite objectivity and independence.",

No additional medical examinations were ordered nor were the doctors, who had provided those conclusions, or any other medical experts, questioned in this connection. In the case of the third applicant, the investigating authority did not even examine the available medical evidence, such as the findings of the Armenia Medical Centre of 16 July 2004. It therefore appears that no account was taken of this obviously important evidence at any stage of the investigation. Similarly, the relevant doctors were not questioned and no additional medical examinations were ordered in this connection.

As regards the questioning that did take place, the Court observes that on several such occasions those interviewed were simply asked to provide their account of events and no questions whatsoever were put to them. Even on those few occasions when the investigator did ask questions, there was never more than one question of a standard nature and lacking specificity (see paragraph 57 above).

In particular, the courts inaccurately stated that no signs of ill-treatment had been recorded on the second applicant at the time of her admission to the Abovyan detention facility and that she had lodged her first complaint of illtreatment only forty days after her arrest, namely on 21 August 2004 (see paragraph 35 above).

On 27 June 2005 the Court of Appeal informed the lawyer that appropriate security measures had been taken, but she still failed to appear.

The Court further notes that the Government\u2019s argument that Section 98 of the CCP required a written request by the victim appears to be in direct contradiction with the text of that provision, which allowed the authorities to take protective measures of their own motion. Furthermore, it cannot be said that the courts were not aware of the problem, given that the security issues arose in the courtroom. They were therefore in a position to take protective measures under Section 98 of the CCP in order to ensure the proper functioning of the proceedings, which they apparently failed to do.

The Court has already established that the court hearings throughout the entire proceedings, which lasted for about ten months, were held in an atmosphere of constant intimidation and verbal and physical abuse directed against both the applicants and their lawyers. The hearings preceding the hearing of 1 July 2005 were marked by particular violence, including an alleged physical assault on lawyer S., which resulted in her refusal to attend unless security was ensured in the courtroom.

This resulted in the appeal filed by lawyer S. not being admitted on a formal ground without any examination of the allegations raised in that appeal. Those allegations, however, merited closer consideration, given the particular circumstances of the case. Thus, the Court of Cassation can be said to have acted with excessive formalism and lack of due diligence in refusing to admit the appeal filed by lawyer S. allegedly on the first applicant\u2019s behalf, which resulted in a disproportionate limitation on the first applicant\u2019s access to that court.

In both instances, they used force to intimidate the two victims. Both applicants were in a state of vulnerability on account of the fact that they were being held by the police. The factors indicating to us that this was a case of torture rather than of inhuman or degrading treatment are the intent behind the conduct (dolus specialis) and the victims\u2019 vulnerability. The existence of these two factors prevailed over the physical intensity of the pain or suffering (see Nowak M. and McArthur E., The United Nations Convention Against Torture.

Germany ([GC], no.\u00a022978/05, ECHR 2010). Thus, to threaten an individual with torture may constitute at least inhuman treatment (see Campbell and Cosans v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 26) and \u201c[I]n particular, the fear of physical torture may itself constitute mental torture. However, there appears to be broad agreement, and the Court likewise considers, that the classification of whether a given threat of physical torture amounted to psychological torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment depends upon all the circumstances of a given case, including, notably, the severity of the pressure exerted and the intensity of the mental suffering caused\u201d (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 108).",
