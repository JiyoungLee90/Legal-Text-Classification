On 21\u00a0May 1989, while off duty, he was in Gallur (Saragossa) where he joined members of his family and friends to celebrate his niece\u2019s first communion. At about 8.30\u00a0p.m., after a banquet which followed the ceremony and at which he drank, in addition to the wine that accompanied the meal, three glasses of champagne, a cognac and two half-measures of cognac, \u2013 so that his alcohol level was high \u2013 he went with friends to the \u2018Diodon\u2019 caf\u00e9 ..., where he noted the presence of Mr\u00a0Karamo Jarra, a Gambian national, and Mr\u00a0Leonel Pajucides Fal\u00e7ao, a Portuguese national. They were both coloured and had temporary work in a nearby village ... They went to Gallur to enjoy their weekly day off and were in the vicinity of the games room in the caf\u00e9. [The accused] asked them for their identity papers, which they agreed to produce. [They] showed him respectively a work permit ... and an identity card issued by the Portuguese Republic ... The accused, Mr\u00a0Manuel Tejedor Garc\u00eda, who was dressed in plain clothing, did not consider the documents satisfactory and, showing his police identification, drew his revolver ... and fired a shot into the ceiling of the caf\u00e9; approximately twenty people were present and left the premises in a frightened state. He then kicked Mr\u00a0Leonel Pajucides in the testicles after throwing the latter\u2019s identity card to the floor saying that it was \u2018shit\u2019. Pointing his revolver at the two Africans, he forced them to leave the caf\u00e9 with their hands above their heads and took them, using the psychological pressure of the gun, to the guardia civil barracks, where, finally, he handed them over to the officers on duty. Before that, on the way from the caf\u00e9, near to the stairs leading up to the barracks, the accused ... hit Mr\u00a0Karamo Jarra \u2013 who had slightly lowered his arms because of fatigue and in order to negotiate the rough ground \u2013 hard in the mouth with his revolver, cutting his upper and lower lips and causing him to lose two teeth, one of which was picked up by a passer-by at the scene of the assault, which was stained by the victim\u2019s blood. These events provoked the indignation and disapproval of the people present who gathered round the police officer and his prisoners after following them from the caf\u00e9. [They] ultimately formed a group in front of the entrance to the guardia civil barracks, protesting against the events they had just witnessed and noting that the accused came out of the building in an aggressive manner on several occasions.",

The Constitutional Court found that the appeal had no constitutional basis, because the applicant was seeking, by way of amparo, to appeal against the courts\u2019 interpretation that the public prosecutor\u2019s application had been lodged in time. That was an issue of pure law which was not susceptible of constitutional relief. It nevertheless considered the courts\u2019 interpretation to have been justified and consistent with its case-law. Since the exact date of receipt of the case file in the public prosecutor\u2019s office could not be determined, the Supreme Court, and before it the investigating judge, adopted the interpretation which was more favourable to the admissibility of the application on the basis of a broad interpretation of the provisions of the CCP.",
