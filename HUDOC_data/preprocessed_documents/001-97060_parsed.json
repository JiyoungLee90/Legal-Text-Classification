While the use of\u00a0coercive measures against the child is not desirable, the Court reiterates that the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the child lives (see H.N. v. Poland, no.\u00a077710/01, \u00a7 74, 13 September 2005, and P.P. v. , no. 8677/03, \u00a7\u00a092, 8 January 2008). In this connection the Court observes that, while there was no doubt that J. had been removed by the applicant's former husband in March 2006 and that the latter had been avoiding enforcement of\u00a0a final decision granting the applicant custody of J., the domestic authorities nevertheless discontinued the investigation into the allegation of\u00a0abduction and hiding of J. finding that no offence had been committed (see paragraph 12 above).",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that effective respect for family life requires that future relations between parent and child should not be determined by the mere effluxion of time (see P.P., cited above, \u00a7 93, and Sylvester, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069). Moreover, it cannot be said that the responsibility for failure of the relevant decisions or measures can be attributed to the applicant who actively sought their enforcement (see Hokkanen, citied above, \u00a7 60).",
