A certified copy of the BNB\u2019s decision to revoke the licence had to be enclosed with the petition (ibid.). The petition was examined by the competent court at a hearing in the presence of a prosecutor from which the public was excluded (former section 81 of the Banks Act of 1997). The court had no power to make an order for the restructuring of the bank (former section 91 of the Banks Act of 1997). The bank was divested of the right to administer and dispose of its assets (former section 82(6) of the Banks Act of 1997), and, when granting the petition, the court was also required to immediately order the sale of the bank\u2019s assets and the distribution of the proceeds to its creditors (former section 82(7) of the Banks Act of 1997).

The liquidators then submitted the original or the amended list, as appropriate, to the insolvency court for approval.

Striking the application out of the list under such circumstances would undermine the very essence of the right of individual applications by legal persons, as it would encourage governments to deprive such entities of the possibility to pursue an application lodged at a time when they enjoyed legal personality (see, mutatis mutandis, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v.

It has no discretion in this respect (see paragraphs 51 and 54 above). Bearing these circumstances in mind, the Court considers that the applicant bank could maintain, on arguable grounds, that it was allowed to continue to operate as a going concern unless it was indeed insolvent. Its principal contention was that it was solvent, so that there was a genuine and serious dispute over the existence of that right (see, mutatis mutandis, Pudas v.

These measures eventually resulted in its being struck off the register of companies and its ceasing to exist as a legal person (see paragraph 37 above). They were thus decisive as far as its civil rights were concerned. The fact that banks are legal entities and that the banking industry is tightly regulated in view of the important interests at stake, such as those of depositors and of the public at large, is not a sufficient reason for concluding that proceedings in respect of a bank fall outside the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1. To hold otherwise would create an important lacuna in the system of humanrights protection in that area. In a recent judgment, Credit and Industrial Bank v. the Czech Republic, the Court had no doubts that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was applicable to various sets of proceedings concerning the compulsory administration of a bank. The Court further found that the decision to place the bank in compulsory administration affected the rights of the bank itself, not only those of its existing management (see Credit and Industrial Bank v. the Czech Republic, no. 29010/95, \u00a7\u00a7 5667, 21 October 2003).

As a result, the Sofia City Court expressly held that the evidence adduced by the applicant bank and by the prosecutor\u2019s office with a view to challenging the BNB\u2019s findings should not be taken into account, as it was irrelevant to the dispute before it. It further held that the applicant bank\u2019s requests and objections on this point were inadmissible and would not be examined (see paragraph 27 above).

They merely referred to a set of proceedings pending at first instance whose outcome is far from certain, especially if account is taken of the relevant provisions of the State Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988. Section 1(2) of that Act provides that the court hearing an action for compensation against a State body may only examine whether the impugned administrative decision from which the damage flows is null and void. If the alleged defect in the decision leads to it being merely voidable, it must first be invalidated in prior judicial-review proceedings (see paragraph 73 above). This proved impossible in the case of the applicant bank because of the prohibition in section 21(5) of the Banks Act of 1997 (see paragraphs 3841 above). Moreover, as is apparent from the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s reasoning in its final judgment of 30 June 1998, any alleged erroneous finding by the BNB on the issue of the applicant bank\u2019s insolvency would not constitute sufficient grounds for declaring the BNB\u2019s decision null and void (see paragraph 33 in fine above). In addition, as the shareholders of the applicant bank are all juristic persons, they have no claim under the Act (see paragraph 73 above). Finally, the action referred to by the Government is one under the general law of tort, whereas section\u00a08(1) of the State Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988, which appears to have been strictly adhered to by the Bulgarian courts, provides that no claim lies under the general law of tort for damage occasioned in circumstances falling within the ambit of that Act (ibid.). The existence of an alleged judicial remedy must be sufficiently certain, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see I.D., cited above, \u00a7 54). That is not the case here (see, as an example to the contrary, BritishAmerican Tobacco Company Ltd, cited above, pp. 2528, \u00a7\u00a7 7886). That being so, the Court does not consider it necessary to rule on the issue whether an action for compensation brought by a bank\u2019s shareholders could be a sufficient avenue of redress for its inability to seek judicial review of administrative decisions affecting the bank itself.",

However, it is not persuaded that the domestic courts, if need be with the assistance of expert opinion, could not themselves ascertain whether the applicant bank was insolvent or not. The difficulties encountered in this respect could also be overcome through the provision of a right of appeal against the BNB\u2019s decision to an adjudicatory body other than a traditional court integrated within the standard judicial machinery of the country, but which otherwise fully complies with all the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1, or whose decision is subject to review by a judicial body with full jurisdiction which itself provides the safeguards required by that provision. Indeed, as is apparent from the Court\u2019s caselaw, similar systems exist in many States Parties in domains in which special expertise is needed (see, by way of example, Langborger v. Sweden, judgment of 22 June 1989, Series A no.\u00a0155; McMichael v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 24 February 1995, Series A no. 307B; British-American Tobacco Company Ltd, cited above; Bryan v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no.\u00a0335A; and AB Kurt Kellermann v.

It is true that any such proceedings would inevitably have consumed a certain amount of time, but that difficulty could have been addressed through strict timelimits for processing such cases or rules giving them priority. With regard to this concern and to the other potential risks to the stability of the banking system stemming from any delay, the Court refers, mutatis mutandis, to its reasoning in respect of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraphs 13538 below).",

Before the Sofia City Court the applicant bank was represented by the BNBappointed special administrators (see paragraph 25 above). Since the Sofia City Court\u2019s judgment was immediately enforceable (see paragraphs 28 and 64 above), in the ensuing stages of the proceedings the applicant bank was represented by the liquidators appointed by the insolvency court from a panel of qualified persons selected by the BNB (see paragraph 63 above). The liquidators could be struck off the list kept by the BNB and that would automatically result in their discharge by the insolvency court (ibid.). In view of the resulting dependence of the liquidators on the BNB, it is not surprising that they did not lodge any appeal against the Sofia City Court\u2019s judgment or petition for review of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s threemember panel, and that they acted in concert with the BNB throughout the proceedings (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above). If the prosecutor\u2019s office had not acted in support of the applicant bank and had not lodged an appeal and a petition itself, the bank would have been deprived of access to an appellate jurisdiction (see, mutatis mutandis, Credit and Industrial Bank, cited above, \u00a7 72).",

Ireland, judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no.\u00a032, p. 13, \u00a7 24; and Stanford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23\u00a0February 1994, Series A no. 282A, pp. 1011, \u00a7 26) and adduce evidence and arguments with a view to influencing the court\u2019s decision. The litigants\u2019 confidence in the workings of justice is based on, inter alia, the knowledge that they have had the opportunity to express their views (see Pellegrini v. , no. 30882/96, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2001VIII). As it was represented by persons dependent on the other party to the proceedings, the applicant bank was unable, especially when the case was being examined by the Supreme Court of Cassation, to properly state its case and protect its interests. It is true that the prosecutor\u2019s office came to its aid, but that cannot remedy the fact that it was denied the opportunity to present its case before the courts (see, mutatis mutandis, Philis v.  (no. 1), judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 209, pp. 2023, \u00a7\u00a7 5865). The Court notes in this connection that in July 1999 the Supreme Court of Cassation held that the debtor itself, not the liquidator, had standing to appeal against the winding-up order, for reasons similar to those set out above (see paragraph 62 above). However, that did not happen in the instant case.",

Admittedly, the BNB had to be vested with supervisory and enforcement powers, but the inability to seek judicial review of its decision to revoke the licence at any time was disproportionate and did not serve any legitimate public interest. The aim of avoiding harm to the banking system could be achieved through depriving any appeal of suspensive effect and appointing special administrators with immediate effect. Such an arrangement would have the advantage of making it easier to correct mistakes by the BNB. It would also facilitate the relatively seamless resumption of the affected bank\u2019s activity.",

The Court does not consider it necessary to determine this issue, which was the subject of debate between the parties (see paragraphs 22, 23, 125 and 12729 above) and among various domestic authorities (see paragraphs 29, 30 and 42 above), because its power to review compliance with national law is limited and it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 2 August 1984, Series A no.\u00a082, p. 36, \u00a7 79; and Sovtransavto Holding v. Ukraine, no. 48553/99, \u00a7\u00a095, ECHR 2002VII).

Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2000XI). Furthermore, the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measures affecting fundamental human rights be, in certain cases, subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent body competent to review the reasons for the measures and the relevant evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, AlNashif v. Bulgaria, no. 50963/99, \u00a7 123, 20 June 2002). It is true that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 contains no explicit procedural requirements and the absence of judicial review does not amount, in itself, to a violation of that provision (see Fredin (no. 1), cited above, pp. 1617, \u00a7 50). Nevertheless, it implies that any interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must be accompanied by procedural guarantees affording to the individual or entity concerned a reasonable opportunity of presenting their case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by this provision. In ascertaining whether this condition has been satisfied, a comprehensive view must be taken of the applicable judicial and administrative procedures (see AGOSI, cited above, p. 19, \u00a7 55; Hentrich v. France, judgment of 22\u00a0September 1994, Series A no. 296A, p. 21, \u00a7 49; and Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2002IV).",

Nor does the BNB have to take into account the bank\u2019s representations and objections, if any (ibid.). Thus, under the law as it stands at present, a bank is first officially notified of the withdrawal of its licence only after the BNB\u2019s decision has already been taken, as happened in the present case (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). This, combined with the lack of any subsequent possibility for administrative or judicial review of the decision and the view of the courts that examined the winding-up petition that they were bound by the BNB\u2019s determination on the question of insolvency, made it impossible for the applicant bank at any stage to state its objections to the BNB\u2019s findings of fact and mount a reasoned challenge to the BNB\u2019s conclusion that it was insolvent. Furthermore, the BNB\u2019s decision had serious and farreaching consequences for the bank, which automatically ceased to operate as a going concern and was placed in compulsory liquidation, with all the resulting negative effects such a measure had. An act entailing such grave consequences may only be legitimate if it is adopted after, or is subject to verification in, some sort of proceedings that afford a reasonable opportunity to the bank to present its case to the competent authorities with a view to effectively challenging the revocation of its licence. However, the relevant provisions of domestic law expressly preclude such a possibility and, as a result, such proceedings were not available in the case at hand.",

Poland (dec.), no. 30417/96, \u00a7 85, ECHR 2002X (extracts)) and that in certain situations \u2013 especially in the context of a banking crisis such as the one facing Bulgaria in 199697 (see paragraph 45 above) \u2013 there may be a paramount need to act expeditiously and without advance notice in order to avoid irreparable harm to the bank, its depositors and other creditors, or the banking and financial system as a whole. However, section 21(5) of the Banks Act of 1997, which is still in force, precludes any sort of procedure in all cases, regardless of whether dispatch is important or not (see paragraph 53 above). By contrast, section 56(4) of the repealed Banks and Credit Business Act of 1992, provided that when revoking a bank\u2019s licence the BNB could dispense with apprising the bank of the commencement of the procedure and with examining its representations and objections only in exigent and urgent cases (ibid.). There is no indication that the situation in the present case was one where time was of the essence. Despite the fact that the revocation of the applicant bank\u2019s licence took place during a banking crisis, it does not appear that it was a matter of such urgency that any delay occasioned by some sort of formal procedure would have been unduly prejudicial. In particular, the Court notes that by the time its licence was withdrawn the applicant bank\u2019s operations had been restricted and a special administrator had been overseeing its activities for more than six months (see paragraph 13 above). Those measures must have significantly reduced the risk of a further dissipation of its assets pending the outcome of such a procedure.",

Moreover, such a procedure could have been confidential and closed to the public. The procedure could also have been expedited, so as to avoid the damaging consequences of any undue delay. It could also be contemplated that, if the case was considered urgent, the BNB could have provisionally suspended the bank\u2019s licence pending the examination of the bank\u2019s objections and representations before taking its final decision. This could have also been achieved through, for instance, an internal administrative appeal.",
