In the area of exhaustion of domestic remedies there is a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Basic v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a029800/96, \u00a7\u00a033, 30 January 2001).",

Austria, no. 5455/06, \u00a7 38, 6 March 2012). In the second place the Court observes that before it the applicant only complained about the length of criminal proceedings against him (see paragraph 6 \u2013 27 above) and not about the length of the administrative proceedings, which only concerned preliminary questions in the tax proceedings and took place during the time when the criminal proceedings were pending. In this connection the Court also observes that the Vienna Court of Appeal already held on 27 November 2009 that the court\u2019s and the public prosecutor\u2019s inactivity was not justified and amounted to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 19 above) because the public prosecutor had not made sufficient efforts in order to accelerate the submission of the final report and to close the investigative phase. The Government argued that an applicant who complains about the length of criminal proceedings should not only take steps to accelerate these proceedings, but also any kind of other proceedings which might concern preliminary or related issues. However, the Court is not persuaded that the mentioned remedies relied on by the Government were effective. Moreover, the Court considers in the concrete circumstances of the present case, that the above mentioned measures would overstretch the duties incumbent on applicants pursuant to Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. This is all the more so, as the applicant in the proceedings before the criminal courts and while the case was pending before the public prosecutor, on two occasions unsuccessfully requested discontinuation of the criminal proceedings against him (see paragraphs 1213 and 1718 above; see also mutatis mutandis, Pfeifenberger v.\u00a0Austria, no. 6379/08, \u00a7 32, 4 October 2011, and Hall, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038, with further reference).",

However, these proceedings only began on 2\u00a0August 2010, when the public prosecutor issued a bill of indictment against the applicant on the suspicion of tax evasion (see paragraph 21 above) and ended on 31\u00a0August 2012, when the applicant had been acquitted of all charges (see paragraph 27 above). As regards the period of preliminary investigation up to the time when the public prosecutor preferred an indictment against the applicant, which lasted from 28\u00a0November 2001 to 2 August 2010, the applicant could not make a request under section 91 of the ACA as this provision does not apply to delays caused by the public prosecutor (see Schweighofer and Others v.\u00a0Austria, nos. 35673/97, 35674/97, 36082/97 and 37579/97, \u00a7 33, 9\u00a0October 2001) being applicable only to proceedings before a \u201ccourt\u201d (see paragraph 29 above). Accordingly, during a substantial period he did not have at his disposal an effective remedy in respect of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, as required by Article 13 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Donner v. Austria, no. 32407/04, \u00a7 45, 22 February 2007).",
