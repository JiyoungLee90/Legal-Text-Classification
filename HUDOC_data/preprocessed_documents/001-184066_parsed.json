The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The three rules are not distinct in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. They should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule. They must comply with the principle of lawfulness and pursue a legitimate aim by means reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised. The requisite balance will not be struck where the person concerned bears an individual and excessive burden. The Court also reiterates that in the area of land development and town planning, the Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in order to implement their town and country planning policies. Nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review the Court must determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant\u2019s right of property (see Ayangil and Others v.

The applicants then failed to meet that condition. As regards the second condition, to pay the communal charges, it is a statutory condition, and the applicants indeed failed to meet it too.",

It was only after the Commercial Court\u2019s judgment became final that the Agency calculated the charges. However, by that time the relevant bodies had long rejected the request for the building permit on account of lack of payment, and, in addition, the DUP had been changed and no longer provided for the constructions initially planned there by the applicants.",
