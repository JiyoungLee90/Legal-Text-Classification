Nevertheless, they disagreed whether these conditions had amounted to degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. The applicant maintained, in particular, that four square metres of personal space had been insufficient to avoid overcrowding, and that it was aggravated by other factors, such as inadequate ventilation and lighting, incomplete separation of the lavatory from the living space and the daily one-hour limit on outdoor exercise per day.

It further notes that the applicant made no health complaints to the members of the public commission for the monitoring of detention facilities who visited him on 28\u00a0November 2012 and 11 January 2013. Accordingly, as regards myopia and asthma, it finds no evidence to support the allegations that the gravity and urgency of these health issues had called for immediate measures. Therefore no conclusions may be drawn from the fact that the investigator\u2019s request of 3\u00a0October 2012 was not followed up. When the applicant later required emergency help, he received it promptly. In particular, on 3 September 2013 an ambulance was called because the applicant had a hypertension crisis, and he was placed in the prison medical ward for long-term monitoring of this condition. Nothing in the case file suggests that those measures were insufficient in that situation.",

First, they contested the overall time of the transfer and the associated procedures. According to the Government, on hearing days the applicant would be woken up at 6 a.m. and would arrive back at the remand prisons at 9.30\u00a0p.m., and thus would be allowed eight hours of sleep every day. However, the Court notes the applicant\u2019s allegations that after the arrival at the remand prison the detainees would have to wait in the assembly section for up to two hours to go through security checks. The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s assertion that the prison assembly time did not exceed 30\u00a0minutes, but finds that this is not supported by evidence, unlike the applicant\u2019s claims, which were corroborated by witness statements. Moreover, the Government did not specify the time allowed for a meal and personal hygiene after the applicant arrived back in the cell. Apart from those basic necessities, the applicant also pointed out the need to prepare for the next day\u2019s court hearing.

On the basis of all the evidence before it the Court finds it established that the length of the applicant\u2019s journey sometimes exceeded five hours. Moreover, even assuming that the Government\u2019s submissions were accurate, this duration could not be considered negligible for a journey in cramped and generally poor conditions, given that the applicants had to endure it twice a day for three or four consecutive days a week.",

Even though he was unable to specify the size of the vans and the number of inmates carried in them, the description of the seating arrangements is sufficient for the Court to accept that the detainees were transported in cramped conditions. Moreover, on certain occasions the applicant was transported in vans divided into tight singleoccupancy compartments, transport arrangements already found by the Court incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention (see M.S. v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07477). It also considers it established that these vans lacked adequate ventilation, heating and cooling systems, and that there was no opportunity to use the toilet.

The Court observes that the acts imputed to the applicant included chanting anti-government slogans during the dispersal of the assembly and throwing an unidentified round yellow object in the direction of the police cordon; the object hit police officer F. causing no injury. The Court has previously examined a number of cases where the demonstrators had engaged in acts of violence and found that the demonstrations in questions had been within the scope of Article 11 of the Convention on the basis that the organisers of these assemblies had not expressed violent intentions and there were no grounds to believe that the assemblies were not meant to be peaceful. The Court found that the applicants in those cases enjoyed the protection of Article 11 of the Convention and examined whether the measures taken against them were justified under the second paragraph of this provision. In one of these cases it found a violation of Article 11 of the Convention on account of a disproportionate sentence imposed on the applicant for attending a demonstration and throwing stones at the security forces (see G\u00fclc\u00fc v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 17526/10, \u00a7\u00a7 91-97, 19 January 2016).

Only the first of those two claims is supported by evidence: the police had indeed intercepted several attempts to bring tents to Bolotnaya Square.

The march leaders spent about 45 minutes peacefully waiting for the confusion about the placement of the cordon to be resolved, to no avail. Above all, whatever the organisers\u2019 intentions were, they made no call for violence and showed no signs that they had been prepared for it. The security screening at the entrances to the assembly venue, which was rather thorough, did not detect the presence of weapons or other objectionable equipment carried by the protesters, apart from a handful of tents, possibly prohibited but inherently harmless items. The round yellow object tossed by the applicant in the instant case remained unidentified but appeared, by all accounts, innocuous (compare with Primov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 158-59, where the protesters carried iron rods, wooden sticks, knives and firearms). The fact that the applicant was chanting political slogans like \u201cOne for all and all for one!\u201d or \u201cUnited, we are invincible!\u201d cannot be taken as evidence that he had violent intentions.",

He insisted that the assembly as a whole had remained peaceful while the police had used excessive force against the protesters, which led to some isolated clashes; in any event, there had been no disorder of a scale required to fall under this provision. The Government, on the contrary, alleged that the clashes had been the product of a premeditated and organised plot by the assembly leaders, and only the timely and efficient intervention by the police had prevented the escalation of violence to extreme and devastating consequences.",

Under these provisions he was sentenced to two years and three months\u2019 imprisonment for attending an authorised public assembly, chanting anti-government slogans, and throwing an unidentified small round object which hit a police officer on the shoulder and caused him pain. It is noteworthy that the sentence under Article 318 for using violence against a public official, namely for throwing the yellow object, that of nine months\u2019 imprisonment, although already a severe one, was significantly more lenient than the partly concurrent twenty-one-month sentence for participation in mass disorder.",

In any event, the physical damage caused by the yellow object to officer\u00a0F. was limited to short-term pain. Regard being had to other acts imputed to the applicant, it turns out that the applicant\u2019s staying at the site of the rally and chanting anti-government slogans accounted for a staggering oneandahalf-year addition to his prison term. These acts, unlike tossing the yellow object, were peaceful and constituted protest, a form of expression protected by Article 10 of the Convention (see Taranenko, cited above, \u00a7 70, and the cases cited therein). If the domestic courts were to take into account that the applicant had committed those acts in connection with the exercise of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, they should have considered it a mitigating factor.
