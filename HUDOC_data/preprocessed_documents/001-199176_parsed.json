The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 98, and Beyeler v.\u00a0Italy\u00a0[GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2000-I).",

As a result of such an approach, the applicants were not awarded full compensation for the unlawful demolition of their property. No satisfactory explanation was provided for the approach followed or for the level of compensation achieved. Contrary to the Government\u2019s submissions, such a serious omission cannot be balanced out either by comparing the respective final awards and the initial price paid by applicants for their shares in the building and the plot of land on which the building was located (compare paragraphs 39, 8 and 24 above), or by considering that the applicants retained their title to the plot of land (measuring 154\u00a0sq. m.) on which the building had been located. The Court particularly notes that the possibility of the further use of that land appears to have been somewhat limited as per the explanation given by the Architecture Service of the City Hall that only the underground side could be used (see paragraph\u00a022 above). Moreover, the importance, or even the meaning, of that fact does not appear to have been given any meaningful consideration save for merely noting it.",

Having regard to the Court\u2019s findings and the reported significant increase in the value of real estate in Tbilisi between 2003 and 2007 (see paragraph\u00a08 above), the Government\u2019s objection that the applicants had not suffered a significant disadvantage must also be dismissed.",

Therefore, the Court does not discern a causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage claimed in respect of loss of income. By contrast, the Court notes that a finding of a violation of the Convention or its Protocols by the Court is a ground for re-opening of the civil proceedings and review of the domestic judgments in the light of the Convention principles established by the Court, as provided in the Georgian Civil Procedure Code (see paragraph\u00a033 above). The Court considers that a reopening of the civil proceedings and review of the matter in the light of the principles it has identified in this judgment would be the most appropriate means of affording reparation to the applicants (see Vulakh and Others v. Russia, no. 33468/03, \u00a7\u00a054, 10 January 2012, and Gu\u0163\u0103 Tudor Teodorescu v. Romania, no. 33751/05, \u00a7\u00a057, 5 April 2016) in the particular circumstances of the case where there is a discrepancy between what the applicants have claimed before the domestic courts and before this Court and, additionally, given the insufficiency of the information available to the Court.
