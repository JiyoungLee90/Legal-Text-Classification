Unlike the lay assessors in the latter case, the jurors in Mr Holm\u2019s case had no direct interest in the outcome of the case, nor could the SAP be said to have had any such interest. Moreover, it was not contended that the jurors in question had a direct influence on or interest in the defendant company.

It was also possible for the parties to appeal to the Court of Appeal against decisions by the District Court on requests for disqualification, and the applicant, albeit unsuccessfully, availed himself of this remedy (see paragraph 10 above).

In this regard, the Court observes the following. Firstly, the defendants could opt for a trial by jury, despite the fact that the applicant did not wish to have one; secondly, an affirmative answer by the jury as to whether the impugned statements in the book constituted an offence required the votes of a special majority of six out of nine jurors (see paragraphs 10 and 15 above). Lastly, the jury had the final say in the event of an acquittal; had the verdict been against the defendants the issue would have been the subject of further review by the District Court judges (see paragraphs 13, 15 and 16 above). It thus appears that the applicant as a private prosecutor was placed in a less favourable position than the defence. However, these features, most of which are typical of a criminal trial involving a jury and which were designed to enhance freedom of the press, do not as such constitute a legitimate reason to fear a lack of independence and impartiality on the part of the jurors.",

Moreover, the removal of all members of the jury who could be said, for the sake of argument, to be prejudiced against Holm could possibly have justified the defendants in arguing that the jury was thereby prejudiced against them. On that hypothesis, therefore, either the jury system had to be abolished or a new system had to be devised.",

The specific circumstances in the Holm case do not lead us to a different opinion.
