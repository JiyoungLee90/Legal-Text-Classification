The Russian authorities had failed to provide her with the protection and to prevent further assaults by her ex-husband. Through her repeated complaints, the police officers had been made aware of ongoing assaults and of the high risk of recurring violence. They had not offered her any measures of protection due to insufficiency of Russian legislation which does not provide for measures capable of ensuring the safety of victims of domestic violence, such as restraining orders. The police had allowed P. to abuse her with impunity and taken no meaningful steps to investigate her criminal complaints and secure the evidence. They had not summoned or interviewed any witnesses, including those whom she had identified, even after the prosecutor had directed the police to do so. The police\u2019s subsequent decisions declining institution of criminal proceedings had reproduced in substance their previous decisions which had been quashed by the prosecutor. They had not opened a criminal case even where her complaints concerned publicly-prosecutable offences, such as threats of violence (Article 119 of the Criminal Code), \u201ctormenting\u201d (Article 117) and a deprivation of liberty (Article 127). The applicant emphasised that a private-prosecution procedure was inadequate to fulfil the State\u2019s obligation under Article 3 to prosecute and punish acts of domestic violence. It placed an unbearable and discriminatory burden on the victim requiring her to act as a prosecutor, to obtain evidence, to summon and question witnesses, and to prove the abuser\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It also required the victim to be present at every hearing, reliving the same traumatic situation over and over. Her failure to attend would have been treated as a withdrawal of criminal charges, causing the case to be dismissed. She had attended twenty-three hearings within one year before she had accepted to settle the case which had become extremely prolonged, expensive and time-consuming. She had given birth to her second child and had lived in fear for her safety. The official statistics demonstrated that private-prosecution cases were four times more likely to be discontinued in comparison to publicprosecution cases. The applicant also pointed to the international consensus on the issue that private prosecution in domestic violence cases was contrary to the requirements of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.",

They had found no evidence of force being used against her. They had told the applicant to apply to a court with her allegations of death threats and battery, the offences under Articles 119 and 116 of the Criminal Code. She had instituted private-prosecution proceedings for battery only in 2014. The private-prosecution mechanism provided the required protection against acts of domestic violence because an independent and impartial authority was called upon to evaluate evidence.

His threats made her fear for her safety; she had moved flats without disclosing her new address to P. She could not however avoid seeing P. because he was the father of their son. Their meetings led to further assaults (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above).

Acts of domestic violence do not constitute a separate offence under Russian law or feature as an aggravating form of any other offence. The Russian law does not contain any penalty-enhancing provisions relating to acts of domestic violence or make a distinction between domestic violence and violence committed by strangers. The existing criminal-law provisions are not capable of adequately encompassing the various aspects of domestic violence. They leave many of its forms, such as psychological or economic abuse or controlling or coercive behaviour, outside the scope of criminal-law protection. They also require actual bodily injuries to be of a certain degree of gravity to be characterised as a publicly prosecutable offence, leaving the prosecution of lesser charges to the private initiative of the victim. The possibility to bring private prosecution proceedings is however insufficient in the context of domestic violence, as such proceedings require time and resources and put an excessive burden on the victim of domestic violence. Lengthy delays in private-prosecution proceedings and a significantly lower likelihood of securing the abuser\u2019s conviction undermine the victims\u2019 access to justice (see, in a factually similar situation, Barsova v.\u00a0Russia [Committee], no.\u00a020289/10, \u00a7 37, 22\u00a0October 2019, and Volodina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 81-84 and 123).",

They did not take statements from witnesses whose contact details the applicant had provided or carry out a medical assessment of her injuries (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). Without citing any relevant legal authority, the police investigators raised arbitrarily the bar for evidence required to launch criminal proceedings, claiming that threats of death should be physical rather than verbal in order to be prosecutable (see paragraphs 5, 8, 9 and 11 above). The Court, however, reiterates that threats are a form of psychological violence and a vulnerable victim may experience fear regardless of the objective nature of such intimidating conduct.

However, the police officers did not take any additional investigative steps and issued further decisions declining to initiate criminal proceedings; the wording of those decisions reproduced in essence the text of previous decisions (see paragraphs 8, 10 and 11 above). A judicial challenge against the police\u2019s refusal to investigate did not bring relief to the applicant. Even after a court held that the failure to eliminate the defects which the supervising prosecutors had identified had breached the applicant\u2019s rights, the police investigators made no attempts to remedy those defects (see paragraph 13 above). As it happened, the police officers pronounced the matter closed referring to the same judicial decisions by which the courts had refused to carry out a substantive review of the adequacy of investigation on the grounds that the previous police decisions had already been set aside by prosecutors (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above). In these circumstances, the Court finds that any further judicial appeal against identical police decisions would be devoid of any practical purpose.

Relying on the expert reports dated 2006, 2010 and 2015 and on recommendations by UN treaty bodies to the Russian authorities, the applicant maintained that throughout the years in which experts had been pointing to rampant domestic violence in Russia, there had been no major positive developments in the protection of victims of abuse.",

Violence against women, including domestic violence, is a form of discrimination against women. The State\u2019s failure to protect women against domestic violence breaches their right to equal protection of the law, irrespective of whether such failure is intentional or not (see Opuz, \u00a7\u00a7 185-91, and Volodina, \u00a7\u00a7 109-10, both cited above).",

By tolerating for many years a climate which was conducive to domestic violence, the Russian authorities have failed to create conditions for substantive gender equality that would enable women to live free from fear of ill-treatment or attacks on their physical integrity and to benefit from the equal protection of the law (ibid., \u00a7 132).",
