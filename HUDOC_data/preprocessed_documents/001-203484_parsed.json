They considered that the compensation awarded was ridiculous and that, even assuming it had to be considered as agricultural land, it had to attract higher compensation in the light of other factors such as the locality and the price of adjacent property. Furthermore, it had not been fair that compensation proceedings had started only forty years later and yet they were being compensated on the basis of a declaration of 1961, because in their case (unlike others) no new declaration (accompanied by a new valuation) had been issued in breach of their rights under Article 6 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1. They asked the Court of Appeal to revoke the valuation of the experts subject to, if necessary, a declaration as to the characterisation of the land and the criteria to be used; to quash the LAB\u2019s decision and refer it back, and in the alternative, to vary the LAB\u2019s decision augmenting the compensation awarded.",

Alternatively, it is possible to consider that in the present case the same judges performed different functions in the same proceedings (compare Peru\u0161 v.

In the latter case, it is necessary to examine whether the link between the substantive issues determined is so close as to cast doubt on the impartiality of the judges (see, mutatis mutandis, Warsicka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040). The time which elapsed between the two participations, and the extent to which the judge was involved in the proceedings may also be taken into consideration (see Peru\u0161, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037). Whether the judges were called on to review their own decisions, and thus whether they had erred in their earlier decisions, is also a relevant factor (see, for example, Driza v.

San Marino, no.\u00a050956/16, \u00a7 145, 2 May 2019). In the Court\u2019s view they also concerned the same substantive issues, at least in so far as these concerned the designation of the applicants\u2019 land as agricultural and the method of calculation by the experts, impacting the LAB\u2019s decision, including the lack of consideration of the passage of time, forty years, and the unfairness of the situation in itself and in comparison to others (compare the two applications at paragraphs 10 and 15 above). Indeed the Court of Appeal expressed itself on the matter, in so far as it considered the related pleas as a point of law, but not in so far as it considered them a point of fact (see paragraphs 12-14 above). Later, the Constitutional Court upheld the classification of the experts considering that it had been binding, and examined the compensation due on that basis, augmenting it in view of the delay in payment and then proceeded to find that the applicants had not suffered a breach of their rights. Thus, even if it had to be considered that the issues decided by the two courts were not exactly the same, the issues examined by both courts were, nevertheless, intrinsically linked (see, a contrario, Central Mediterranean Development Corporation Limited v. Malta (no. 2), no.\u00a018544/08, \u00a7 35, 22 November 2011).",

The amount of EUR 270,000, which no domestic court has in fact disapproved as not reflecting the correct amount based on the 2003 value, is ten times the amount that the Court eventually awarded the applicants.",

This is the time at which both parties first had the possibility of starting negotiations regarding the compensation issue, as well as the time when the applicants were able to request compensation before the domestic courts. It is to be emphasised that the applicants were not only deprived of their property in 1961 on a compulsory basis, they were also deprived of their right to submit in court proceedings any claim for compensation for their land over a period of 42 years, up to the date when the \u201cnotice to treat\u201d was sent to them, i.e. 14 January 2003 (see paragraph 2 above). Regarding the latter, it is to be reiterated that the Constitutional Court found that there had been a violation of Article 6 of the Convention. As the time of the notice to treat in 2003 was the point at which the applicants were ultimately able to claim compensation, any earlier date than that \u2013 at worst 17\u00a0March 1961, dating back 42 years earlier \u2013 should be excluded as being irrelevant and unfair for assessing that compensation. As is indicated in paragraph\u00a029 of the judgment, before 2002 the relevant date for assessing compensation was the date of the \u201cnotice to treat\u201d. Had the notice to treat been sent to the applicants in 2002 or earlier, when the relevant date for assessing compensation was the date of the notice to treat and when their land was no longer agricultural but already developable, they would have benefited from a much higher amount in compensation. It was neither their action nor their choice that led to the notice to treat being sent to them 42 years after the declaration of acquisition, nor was it their action or choice that led to the notice to treat not being sent to them any time up to 2002, before which the relevant time for assessing compensation would have been far more beneficial to them.",

This delay had the effect of reducing considerably the amount of compensation, as stated above. The respondent State, since it decided in 1961 that the applicants\u2019 land was needed in the public interest and proceeded with the compulsory acquisition with the Governor\u2019s declaration on 17 March 1961, should have been ready to start negotiations with the applicants for the amount due to them immediately or within a reasonable time. The fact that this did not happen until 14\u00a0January 2003, 42 years later, is far from being immediate or a reasonable time after the Governor\u2019s declaration on the expropriation. The timing decided by the respondent State to send the \u201cnotice to treat\u201d to the applicants, immediately after the Law had changed in 2002, with regard to the relevant date for assessing the value and status of the property in question, thus no longer the date of the notice to treat but going back to the date of the Governor\u2019s declaration (see paragraph 9 above), cannot escape my attention and my impression is that the timing for such decision may not be accidental.

And this could be a reason why the applicants did not challenge the validity of the compulsory acquisition of their property, if they had so wished. The applicants had obtained no compensation for about 60\u00a0years and the matter was still pending. They had lost possession of their land and the State had immediately taken possession of it and had built a school on it in 1993, without any requisition order or rent to be paid to the applicants and without, to date, the State obtaining ownership (since the compensation issue is still pending). The applicants were stripped of all their rights as owners, which they should have retained in a democratic State, a member State of the Council of Europe.

Furthermore, contrary to the majority\u2019s view, it is clear that the applicants did contest that 1961 was the relevant time for assessing the status of the expropriated land and its value, since their very argument about discrimination under Article\u00a014 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 relied on the fact that the owners of other similar expropriated properties had been awarded higher compensation on the basis of a change in categorisation after expropriation (see paragraphs 19 and 82).",
