However, the Court also held that the effectiveness of a remedy to accelerate proceedings may depend on whether it has a significant effect on the length of the proceedings as a whole (see Holzinger, cited above, \u00a7 22). Thus, where proceedings include a substantial period during which there is no remedy to accelerate proceedings, a request under Section 91 cannot be considered an effective remedy (see mutatis mutandis, Holzinger (no. 2) v. Austria, no. 28898/95, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22).",
