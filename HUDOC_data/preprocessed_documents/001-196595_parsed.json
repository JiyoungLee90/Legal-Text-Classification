However, its obligation, under Article 1 of the Convention, to secure to everyone within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention, was limited to that of taking the diplomatic, economic, judicial and other measures that were both in its power and in accordance with international law (see Ila\u015fcu and Others, cited above, \u00a7 333; Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0109; and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7 100).

The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until July 2010, the \u201cMRT\u201d was only able to continue to exist, and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region, because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Ivan\u0163oc and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116-20; Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012122; and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110). The Court concluded in Mozer that the \u201cMRT\u201d\u2018s high level of dependency on Russian support provided a strong indication that the Russian Federation continued to exercise effective control and a decisive influence over the Transdniestrian authorities and that, therefore, the applicants fell within that State\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention (see Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0110-11).",

For a measure constituting control of use to be justified, it must be lawful (see Katsaros v.\u00a0Greece, no. 51473/99, \u00a7 43, 6\u00a0June 2002; Herrmann v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a09300/07, \u00a7\u00a074, 26\u00a0June 2012; Centro\u00a0Europa 7 S.R.L. and Di Stefano v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, \u00a7 187, ECHR\u00a02012) and \u201cin accordance with the general interest\u201d.

Therefore, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision, there must be a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 of the Convention varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention, but the remedy must in any event be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the State (Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0207; and Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 16483/12, \u00a7\u00a0268, 15\u00a0December 2016; and De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, \u00a7\u00a0179, 23\u00a0February 2017). However, Article 13 of the Convention requires that a remedy be available in domestic law only in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0207; and De Tommaso, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0180).",
