For those reasons, the legal status of the corpse was unique. There were no provisions setting out explicitly a duty to respect corpses and human remains; however, it was universally accepted as an axiomatic moral duty, arising also from some legal norms. Those norms concerned, in particular, the provisions on protection of personal rights such as the right to respect for the memory of a deceased person (kult osoby zmar\u0142ej) and the right to a grave (prawo do grobu), provisions of medical law and other laws. Those provisions, as well as their judicial interpretation, were permeated with respect for the dead, and allowed interference with a corpse only in exceptional circumstances, clearly prescribed by statute.",

In the case of P\u0142oski v. Poland (no.\u00a026761/95, \u00a7 32, 12 November 2002) a refusal to allow the applicant, a prisoner, to attend the funeral of his close relatives was found to constitute an interference with the right to respect for his private and family life. In the case of Elli Poluhas D\u00f6dsbo v. Sweden (no.\u00a061564/00, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2006I) the Court found that the refusal to transfer an urn containing the ashes of the applicant\u2019s husband could also be seen as falling within the ambit of Article\u00a08, without however stating whether the interference found related to the concept of private life or family life. In the case of HadriVionnet (cited above, \u00a7 52) the Court decided that the possibility for the applicant to be present at the funeral of her stillborn child, along with the related transfer and ceremonial arrangements, was also capable of falling within the ambit of Article 8. In the case of Sabanchiyeva and Others v. Russia (no.\u00a038450/05, \u00a7 122-23, ECHR 2013 (extracts)) the Court accepted that the refusal to return the bodies of the applicants\u2019 relatives, alleged terrorists, and their burial in an unspecified location had amounted to interference with the relatives\u2019 \u201cprivate life\u201d and \u201cfamily life\u201d. In the cases of Petrova v.\u00a0Latvia (no. 4605/05, \u00a7 77, 24 June 2014) and Elberte (cited above, \u00a7 89) the Court recognised that the removal of a deceased relative\u2019s organs or tissues without consent came within the scope of the \u201cprivate life\u201d of the surviving family members. In the case of Lozovyye v. Russia (no. 4587/09, \u00a7\u00a034, 24\u00a0April 2018) the Court held that the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their private and family life had been affected by the failure of the State to inform them of their son\u2019s death before he had been buried.",

The Court, in paragraph\u00a0121 of the judgment, consequently also refers to the obligations under Article 2 of the Convention as support for an argument that \u201cthe State authorities are required to find a due balance\u201d between the requirements of an investigation under Article 2 and the protection of the right to respect for private and family life of the affected individuals under Article 8. While both do so under the heading related to the lawfulness of the interference, it seems to me clear that, in fact, the need for a balance only arises at the later stage (if one gets there) when the Court is considering whether a particular interference with the rights under Article 8 \u00a7 1 are \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d and/or proportionate. Neither the need for a balance generally nor any obligations on the Polish State arising under Article 2 are either required or, in this case, relevant to answering the question whether the relevant Polish law complied with the requirements of the rule of law and whether it provided sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness so as to be \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d.",

In fact, frequently, the exhumation of a body will be a necessary part of an effective investigation within the meaning of the State\u2019s procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention and, as a matter of principle, Article 8 does not provide family members with an unconditional right to prevent the authorities from carrying out such an exhumation in the appropriate circumstances.",
