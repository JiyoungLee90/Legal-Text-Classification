As this is a sensitive area of ethical judgment, the balance to be struck between the parties must primarily be a matter for Parliament ... Parliament has taken the view that no one should have the power to override the need for a genetic parent\u2019s consent. The wisdom of not having such a power is, in my judgment, illustrated by the facts of this case. The personal circumstances of the parties are different from what they were at the outset of treatment, and it would be difficult for a court to judge whether the effect of [J.\u2019s] withdrawal of his consent on [the applicant] is greater than the effect that the invalidation of that withdrawal of consent would have on [J.]. The court has no point of reference by which to make that sort of evaluation. The fact is that each person has a right to be protected against interference with their private life. That is an aspect of the principle of self-determination or personal autonomy. It cannot be said that the interference with [J.\u2019s] right is justified on the ground that interference is necessary to protect [the applicant\u2019s] right, because her right is likewise qualified in the same way by his right. They must have equivalent rights, even though the exact extent of their rights under Article 8 has not been identified.",

It went on, however, to recognise the potential problems arising from the possibility of prolonged storage of human embryos, and recommended that a couple should be permitted to store embryos for their own future use for a maximum of ten years, after which time the right of use or disposal should pass to the storage authority (paragraph 10.10). It further recommended that where, as a result, for example, of marital breakdown, a couple failed to agree how the shared embryo should be used, the right to determine the use or disposal of the embryo should pass to the storage authority (paragraph 10.13). Consistent with its view that there should be no right of ownership in a human embryo (paragraph 10.11), the Committee did not consider that one party to the disagreement should be able to require use of the embryo against the wishes of the other.",

While the pressing nature of the applicant\u2019s medical condition had required that she and J. reach a decision about the fertilisation of her eggs without as much time for reflection and advice as might ordinarily be desired, it was undisputed that it was explained to them both that either was free to withdraw consent at any time before the resulting embryo was implanted in the applicant\u2019s uterus. As in Pretty v. the United Kingdom (no. 2346/02, ECHR 2002-III) and Odi\u00e8vre v. France ([GC], no. 42326/98, ECHR 2003-III), strong policy considerations underlay the decision of the legislature to favour a clear or \u201cbright line\u201d rule which would serve both to produce legal certainty and to maintain public confidence in the law in a sensitive field. Like the national courts, the Chamber did not find, therefore, that the absence of a power to override a genetic parent\u2019s withdrawal of consent, even in the exceptional circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case, was such as to upset the fair balance required by Article 8 or to exceed the wide margin of appreciation afforded to the State.",

There was no necessity for legislation which failed to recognise that exceptional situations, requiring different treatment, might arise. This was a conflict primarily between the respective rights of two private individuals, rather than between the State and an individual, and the proper way to determine a conflict between individuals was by recourse to a court for judicial assessment of the respective positions.

All the decisions from the  appeared either to apply, or at least to recognise, a test whereby there was a balance of rights and/or interests in the embryos. Moreover, only one of these cases was decided on the basis of a conflict between public policy and private rights, and the case-law therefore supported the applicant\u2019s contention that there was no public interest at stake. As for the position within the Council of Europe, the applicant pointed out that the Chamber appeared to have relied on material which was not available to the parties, although she accepted that there was no consensus in Europe as to whether, in the general run of cases, the man\u2019s consent could be revoked either at any time before implantation, or only up to the point of fertilisation.

Where, however, there is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues, the margin will be wider (see X, Y and Z v. the United Kingdom, 22 April 1997, \u00a7 44, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II; Frett\u00e9 v.

In the event that a couple failed to agree how the shared embryo should be used, the right to determine the use or disposal of the embryo should pass to the \u201cstorage authority\u201d. The subsequent Green Paper specifically asked interested members of the public what should happen where there was no agreement between a couple as to the use or disposal of an embryo, and the 1987 White Paper noted that those respondents who agreed that storage should be permitted were broadly in favour of the Committee\u2019s recommendations, but that some rejected the idea that the \u201cstorage authority\u201d should be empowered to decide the embryo\u2019s fate in the event of conflict between the donors. The government therefore proposed \u201cthat the law should be based on the clear principle that the donor\u2019s wishes are paramount during the period in which embryos or gametes may be stored; and that after the expiry of this period, they may only be used by the licence holder for other purposes if the donor\u2019s consent has been given to this\u201d. The White Paper also set out the detail of the proposals on consent in a form which, after further consultation, was adopted by the legislature in Schedule\u00a03 to the 1990 Act (see paragraphs 29-33 above).",

Considering that it was more appropriate to analyse the case as one concerning positive obligations, the Court stated that the principal issue was whether the legislative provisions as applied in the present case struck a fair balance between the competing public and private interests involved (paragraph 76). Moreover, the Court considered that since the use of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment gave rise to sensitive moral and ethical issues against a background of fast-moving medical and scientific developments, and since the questions raised by the case touched on areas where there was no clear common ground amongst member States, the margin of appreciation to be afforded to the respondent State had to be a wide one (paragraph\u00a081). This margin of appreciation must, according to the Court, in principle extend both to the State\u2019s decision whether or not to enact legislation governing the use of IVF treatment and, having intervened, to the detailed rules it lay down in order to achieve a balance between the competing public and private interests (paragraph 82).",

Where the effect of the legislation is such that, on the one hand, it provides a woman with the right to take a decision to have a genetically related child but, on the other hand, effectively deprives a woman from ever again being in this position, it inflicts in our view such a disproportionate moral and physical burden on a woman that it can hardly be compatible with Article 8 and the very purposes of the Convention protecting human dignity and autonomy.",

However, even this comparison does not illustrate the whole complexity of the instant case. It is recognised by those international institutions whose specific mandate is to focus on the rights of women that it is justified and necessary to address \u201cthe health rights of women from the perspective of women\u2019s needs and interests [in view of] distinctive features and factors that differ for women in comparison to men, such as: (a) biological factors ... such as their ... reproductive function ... (CEDAW General Recommendation No. 24 (20th session, 1999))\u201d. A woman is in a different situation as concerns the birth of a child, including where the legislation allows for artificial fertilisation methods. We believe therefore that the proper approach in the instant case was that adopted under Article 14 in the case of Thlimmenos v. Greece, which recognised that different situations require different treatment. We see the circumstances of the applicant in this light not least because of the excessive physical and emotional burden and effects caused by her condition, and it is on this basis that we voted for a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8.",
