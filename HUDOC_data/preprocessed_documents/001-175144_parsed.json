However, it notes that the authorities were not obliged to satisfy the applicants\u2019 request for an additional opinion if they did not consider it necessary (see Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a024014/05, \u00a7 180, 14\u00a0April 2015).

In Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy the Grand Chamber found that \u201cif the infringement of the right to life or to personal integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. In the specific sphere of medical negligence the obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and for the publication of the decision, to be obtained. Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged\u201d. In that case the Court also noted various procedural shortcomings in the criminal investigation, as a result of which the criminal proceedings instituted against the doctor concerned had become time-barred. However, since the applicants were also entitled to issue proceedings in the civil courts and had done so, the positive obligations arising under Article 2 were satisfied. In that connection, the Court reiterated that where a relative of a deceased person accepts compensation in settlement of a civil claim based on medical negligence he or she is in principle no longer able to claim\u00a0to be a victim, and found it unnecessary to examine whether the fact that a time-bar had prevented the doctor being prosecuted for the alleged offence was compatible with Article 2. Therefore, having joined an objection on the applicants\u2019 victim status to the merits of the case, the Court found no violation of Article 2, basing its finding precisely on the lack of victim status. The same approach, we believe, should have been taken here.",

In its decision in Kolaczyk and Kwiatkowski v. Poland (no. 34215/11, 22 October 2013), the Court found that \u201cthe action for damages in the civil courts was an effective remedy that enabled the applicants to obtain redress ... Therefore it is not necessary to assess the effectiveness of the criminal investigation carried out in the present case. There is no doubt that the procedural obligation under Article 2 was complied with in the present case\u201d.",
