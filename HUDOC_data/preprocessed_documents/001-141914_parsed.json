An appeal by the prosecution on points of law against this decision was allowed on 28 June 2004 by the Craiova Court of Appeal. The court of appeal held that pre-trial detention continued to be justified for all the defendants because of the high number of offences involved, the severity of the punishment provided by law for these offences, and the fact that the defendants had rendered the investigation more difficult by requesting expert reports as well as submitting documents in their defence for the first time before the court and not during the investigation phase.",

He further mentioned that he was a respected person in his local community, with a family and three minor children for whom he was responsible. He made numerous requests to the courts for his pre-trial detention to be replaced with a prohibition on leaving the town.

Hence, the decisions issued by the domestic courts for a period of seven months used the same stereotypical reasoning, based on the seriousness of the charges against the applicant and his co-defendants and the implied danger to public order, to justify their detention. In this respect the Court considers that the systematic reference to the seriousness of the offences cannot replace the provision of substantial reasoning for the prolongation of the applicant\u2019s detention, a reasoning based on facts connected to the applicant\u2019s personality which would justify the existence of an actual threat to public order, or the provision of any other reason as provided in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Lauruc v. Romania, no. 34236/03, \u00a7\u00a082, 23 April 2013). Therefore, the Court notes that the domestic courts did not offer any explanation as to why the applicant\u2019s release would have a negative impact on public order.",

The Court observes that no analysis was made by the domestic courts of how these new facts related to the individuals on trial, and specifically to the applicant.",

The Court reiterates that the danger of the accused\u2019s hindering the proper conduct of the proceedings cannot be relied upon in abstracto; it must be supported by factual evidence such as factors relating to the person\u2019s character, his morals, home, occupation, assets, family ties (see Trzaska v. Poland, no. 25792/94, \u00a7 65, 11 July 2000, and Becciev v. Moldova, no. 9190/03, \u00a7 59, 4 October 2005). In addition, the possibility of obtaining guarantees may have to be used to offset any risk of absconding (see Neumeister v. Austria, 27 June 1968, \u00a7\u00a010, Series A no. 8). The Court notes, on the basis of the documents available in the current case file, that the domestic courts made no such assessment of the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances, and no factual evidence was put before them that he might try to avoid trial or to hider the recovery of the financial losses caused by the crimes.",

The Court notes that these are elements of the right of defence in a criminal trial and cannot be relied upon to justify an accused\u2019s pre-trial detention (see Tiron v. Romania, no.\u00a017689/03, \u00a7 43, 7 April 2009, and \u0162urcan v. Moldova, no. 39835/05, \u00a7\u00a051, 23 October 2007).",

He referred to the fact that there was not enough evidence from which to infer a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences, that he was a respected person in his community, he had a family and three children and there was no proof that if released he would pose a danger to public order. However, the Court observes that the domestic courts devoted no consideration to any of these arguments in their relevant decisions (see paragraph 16 above). They limited themselves to repeating in an abstract way the formal grounds for detention provided by law. These grounds were cited without any attempt to show how they applied to the applicant\u2019s case. In this respect the Court observes again that such an approach is not compatible with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999-II, and Lauruc, cited above, \u00a7 83).",
