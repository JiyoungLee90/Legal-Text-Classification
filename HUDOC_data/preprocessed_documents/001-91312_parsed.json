In such circumstances, and in particular in the absence of any proof to confirm the very fact of the detention, even assuming that the remedy referred to by the Government was accessible to the applicant, it is more than questionable whether a court complaint about the unacknowledged detention of the applicant\u2019s son by the authorities would have had any prospects of success. Moreover, the Government have not demonstrated that the remedy indicated by them would have been capable of providing redress in the applicant\u2019s situation \u2013 in other words, that the applicant\u2019s recourse to this remedy would have led to the release of Adam Ayubov, and to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Musayeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069, or Kukayev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a078).

The investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see O\u011fur v.  [GC], no.\u00a021594/93, \u00a7\u00a088, ECHR 1999III). In particular, there must be an implicit requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition (see Ya\u015fa, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102-04, and Mahmut Kaya v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022535/93, ECHR 2000-III, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0106-07). It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the next of kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see Shanaghan\u00a0v. the , no.\u00a037715/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a091-92, 4\u00a0May 2001).",

In this respect, the Court is sceptical about the Government\u2019s argument that the possible implication of the  special police forces in the incident of 19 January 2000 had been verified and that no such involvement had been established. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the authorities\u2019 steps in this connection were at best formalistic, since as can be ascertained from the Government\u2019s submissions they were confined to sending an enquiry in 2005, which was five years after the events in question, and receiving a reply to the effect that \u201cthere had been personnel of the Novosibirsk OMON in the territory of the Chechen Republic on 19\u00a0January 2000\u201d. It does not appear, and the Government did not provide any documentary evidence or information to that end, that any fair attempts were made to find out whether any units of the federal armed forces or security agencies had been stationed in the vicinity of the Ayubov family\u2019s domicile and if so which units, or to find any witnesses among military personnel, as suggested by the applicant\u2019s wife (see paragraph 73 above).",

Moreover, the Government have not demonstrated that this remedy would have been capable of providing redress in the applicant\u2019s situation \u2013 in other words, that it would have rectified the shortcomings in the investigation and would have led to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the abduction of his son. The Court thus considers that in the circumstances of the case it has not been established with sufficient certainty that the remedy advanced by the Government would have been effective within the meaning of the Convention.

In that context, it has repeatedly stressed that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. To minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5 (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104).",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",

They submitted that Adam Ayubov\u2019s relatives had been granted the status of victim and had received reasoned replies to all their requests made in the context of the investigation. Also, the applicant, and after his death his other son, were recognised as civil claimants in the criminal proceedings which were instituted, inter alia, in connection with the destruction of the Ayubovs\u2019 property, and therefore they could have made a civil claim for compensation for the damage inflicted. In the Government\u2019s submission, Adam Ayubov\u2019s relatives could also have lodged a court complaint against the actions of the investigating authorities, in accordance with Article\u00a0125 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, or if the applicant or Adam Ayubov\u2019s other relatives had considered that any action or omission of public officials had caused them damage, they could have sought compensation for that damage in court by virtue of relevant provisions of the Russian Civil Code. In support of this argument, the Government referred to a decision of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Karachayevo-Cherkessia dated 19 October 2004, by which a plaintiff had been awarded a certain amount in respect of non-pecuniary damage inflicted by the unlawful actions of a prosecutor\u2019s office, and a decision of the Kanavinskiy District Court of Nizhniy Novgorod dated 28 February 2006 by which a plaintiff had been awarded a certain amount in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the unlawful actions of police officers.

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article\u00a013 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by acts or omissions by the authorities of the respondent State (see Aksoy, cited above, \u00a7 95).",

Thus, he had an arguable claim for the purpose of Article 13 of the Convention.

The Court also takes note of the applicant\u2019s argument that under national procedural law a civil claim would have been stayed pending the results of the investigation. In such circumstances, it does not appear that the remedy advanced by the Government would have had any prospects of success or would have provided the applicant with any redress. The Court therefore dismisses the Government\u2019s preliminary objection in its relevant part and finds that the applicant did not have any effective domestic remedy in respect of the alleged infringement of his property rights.

Russia, no. 5108/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a062-63, 17\u00a0January 2008). For these reasons, the Court considers the Government\u2019s explanations concerning the disclosure of the case file insufficient to justify withholding the key information requested by the Court.",

It further finds that there is a direct causal link between the violation of Article 2 in respect of Adam Ayubov and the loss by his mother of the financial support which he could have provided for her. The Court cannot, however, take into account the claim of the applicant\u2019s wife in respect of Adam Ayubov\u2019s other relatives since they are not applicants in the present case (see Kaplanova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a07653/02, \u00a7\u00a0144, 29 April 2008). The Court is further not convinced that the amount claimed is reasonable, given in particular that Adam Ayubov had not been formally employed at the time of his disappearance, and that the allegation of his mother that he earned USD\u00a01,500 monthly is unsubstantiated. On the other hand, the Court would not exclude that Adam Ayubov had some earnings and that his mother could have benefited from a certain share of them.
