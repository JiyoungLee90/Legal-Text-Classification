The case originated in an application (no. 43715/05) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Yelena Aleksandrovna Tulskaya (“the applicant”), on 27 October 2005.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Ms V. Milinchuk, former Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 16 January 2007 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Borisoglebsk, a town in the Voronezh Region.
On 8 December 1999 the Borisoglebsk District Court awarded the applicant 1,563.08 Russian roubles (RUB) in arrears of child benefits against the Regional Authority. This judgment became binding on 18 December 1999 but was not enforced immediately.
On 25 November 2005 bailiffs credited the judgment debt to the applicant’s account. Unaware of this, on 19 March 2007 the Regional Authority mistakenly paid to the applicant another RUB 3,126 (the judgment debt adjusted for the cost of living).
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months. Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.
