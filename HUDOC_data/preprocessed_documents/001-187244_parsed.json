In other words, the trial court did not assess the quality of the evidence and whether the circumstances in which it was obtained during the applicant\u2019s twenty-two days\u2019 detention cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. This is all the more problematic, given that not only the applicant, but also the overwhelming majority of the co-defendants who had confessed to their crimes when giving statements to the police denied those confessions during the trial, alleging that they had been ill-treated. The Court finds it significant that thirty other co-defendants who gave incriminating statements to the police rejected the accusations against themselves in their statements to the trial court. Hence, whilst the applicant failed to provide any tangible evidence in support of his ill-treatment allegations during the preliminary investigation stage, the fact that most of the co-defendants also confessed to their crimes during the same period, and subsequently denied them, alleging coercion, raises a prima facie case, and thus reasonable doubts as to the reliability and accuracy of such evidence (see Shabelnik v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a016404/03, \u00a7 59, 19 February 2009).",
