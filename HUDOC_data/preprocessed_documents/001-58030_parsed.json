Those present really did have the opportunity for hours on each occasion. If they so desired, those present had several chances to put questions to a witness. Unlike what normally happens at court hearings, everyone was able to follow the entire transcription of the statements and then still obtain clarifications and additions.

The persons facing me wore serious expressions. The unidentified witnesses were clearly quite aware of the serious nature of the oath or pledge they had given and of the very great interests at stake, especially for the accused persons involved. The calm, quiet manner in which, for example, BRZ03 and BRZ08 related their experiences in Leende (in which connection I expressly leave it to the Court of Appeal to decide whether these accused persons were the perpetrators) was impressive and certainly gave no indication of malice towards the accused. All the witnesses manifested a certain degree of wariness, which, in view of their desire to remain anonymous and the sometimes rather forceful manner of questioning on the part of [two of the defence lawyers] in particular, did not bother me.",

The witness Koene was wary in his answers, which I find understandable in view of the barrage of questions - which were not always formulated equally clearly. It must not be forgotten that a witness who is being questioned on oath about a multitude of events that occurred some years previously should not be reproached for failing, in his answers to those questions, to keep up with the tempo of the rather forceful questioning to which [the two lawyers] in particular subjected him on 8\u00a0November 1990, together and in tandem. Furthermore, I can imagine that a witness may be somewhat annoyed if he is repeatedly asked the same question, especially if he has already replied under oath on the day before. The witness Koene kept a cool head, and in so doing demonstrated a certain quality. As far as I can judge at the present time, I regard him as a reliable witness. Nor do I think that he can be regarded as a reluctant witness, if only by reason of his extensive statements in the records of 7 November and 8 November 1990.",

It defined these stricter requirements in the following rule: such a statement must have been taken down by a judge who (a) is aware of the identity of the witness, and (b) has expressed, in the official record of the hearing of such a witness, his reasoned opinion as to the reliability of the witness and as to the reasons for the wish of the witness to remain anonymous, and (c) has provided the defence with some opportunity to put questions or have questions put to the witness. On the other hand, according to the same judgment, a written document containing the statement of an anonymous witness may be used in evidence if (a) the defence has not at any stage of the proceedings asked to be allowed to question the witness concerned, and (b) the conviction is based to a significant extent on other evidence not derived from anonymous sources, and (c) the trial court makes it clear that it has made use of the statement of the anonymous witness with caution and circumspection.",

However, the Court of Appeal did not base its acceptance of the wish of the witnesses to remain anonymous on this reason, but on the fear of the witnesses for their lives and safety and those of their families (see paragraph 26 of the present judgment), which is a ground provided for in Article 226a of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

Be that as it may, taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I am of the opinion that the right of the defence to examine the witnesses was not limited to such an extent that the defence was not given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question the witnesses, as required by Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) (see the L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 21, para. 47).

The applicants and their counsel were able to hear the interrogation by the investigating judge and to ask questions of their own. In these respects, as was also observed by the Commission, the present case differs from the cases of Kostovski (Kostovski v. the Netherlands judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 166, p. 20, para. 42), Windisch (Windisch v.

In that respect, it is also of relevance that the interrogations before the investigating judge did not take place in a pre-trial phase but during a suspension of the trial before the Court of Appeal and pursuant to an order of the Court of Appeal; they formed part of the trial. In the Kostovski case, where the Court emphasised the importance of the possibility for the trial judge to observe the witness, only one of the witnesses was heard by a judge, who was, however, unaware of the identity of the person concerned (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 43).",

However, I also take note of the opinion of the Court of Appeal that this would have been too risky because disclosure of the identity of the witnesses could not have been excluded. I would have preferred it if the Court of Appeal had given concrete arguments for that opinion. On the other hand, I lack the expertise - as, I assume, do my colleagues in the Court - to judge whether its fear was justified or not. Then again, one may well wonder whether the defence would have been in a better position to observe the witnesses\u2019 demeanour and test their reliability had they appeared in disguise, given the fact that an effective disguise may also substantially disguise the sound and intonation of the voice and the body language of the person concerned. A national court may in general be considered to be in a better position to judge such a complex and factual issue than is our Court, which should substitute its judgment for that of the national court only if the latter\u2019s judgment is unreasonable.

Given these reasoned opinions of both the investigating judge and the Court of Appeal, the latter of which was reviewed by the Supreme Court, the Government were not called upon to give an explanation of their own, as held by the majority (see paragraph 60 of the judgment); nor in my opinion would the Government have been in a position to do so.",

The \"general duty of obedience to the State\u2019s executive authorities\" (see paragraph 56 of the judgment) owed by policemen cannot imply that their lives and safety and those of their families are any less worthy of protection. Therefore I cannot agree with the majority that, for the sole reason that in the present case members of the police force were involved, the case has to be distinguished from that of Doorson as far as the balancing of the interests of the defence against those of witnesses is concerned.",

The police may have made a mistake in his case by revealing his identity, but in any case later events do not automatically and retrospectively invalidate a reasonable assessment of a risk. One can hardly blame a witness who expresses serious fears for not waiting until something serious happens to him or any other witness; the only criterion for the national court to consider is the reasonableness of the fear.",

I fail to see why policemen should be under a special duty to give evidence in open court (see paragraph 56 of the judgment) since this is a general civic duty prescribed by law. And even if one may agree that the use of policemen as anonymous witnesses \"should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances\" (ibid.), one may argue on the other hand that their anonymity should meet with fewer objections from the point of view of the defence, because their statements are statements by sworn professionals, whose identity and investigative competence can easily be checked by the investigating judge.",

Reference is made in that context to the explanatory memorandum of the Act of 11 November 1993 in which the Netherlands Government indicate that in their opinion that interest can be sufficiently protected by less far-reaching restrictions on the rights of the defence. However, in my opinion that issue is of only minor importance in the present case, since the Court of Appeal stated in its judgment that, of the arguments advanced by the witnesses for claiming anonymity, it considered the argument concerning the personal safety of these witnesses and their families to be \"decisive\" (see paragraph 26 of the judgment).",

Nor are they always without limitations in normal situations, where the identity of the witnesses is known to the defence. The fact that certain questions were not answered by witnesses and that this was accepted by the investigating judge may be open to criticism but this would in all probability also have occurred had the witnesses been interrogated in open court in some form of disguise. It may therefore be questioned whether it was necessary and proportionate to refuse to answer certain questions put by the defence in order to protect the anonymity of the witnesses and the secrecy of the police tactics. However, this question has to be answered primarily by the competent domestic court, and indeed it was answered in the affirmative by the investigating judge, and after his decision was challenged by the defence before the Court of Appeal, by the latter as well. On the whole, in my opinion, neither the limitations necessitated by the situation nor those accepted by the investigating judge were such as to warrant the finding that there was no \"adequate and proper opportunity to question the witnesses\" as required by the Court in its Kostovski judgment (loc. cit., p. 20, para. 41). The handicaps under which the defence laboured were, therefore, sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see the Kostovski judgment previously cited, p. 21, para. 43, and the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 472, para. 76).",

Finally, although the statements of the anonymous witnesses were an essential part of the evidence, it cannot be said that the convictions were based solely on these statements. Whether they were based on these statements \"to a decisive extent\", as the majority holds (paragraph 63 of the judgment), is hard to say. I share the opinion expressed by the Delegate of the Commission at the Court\u2019s hearing that this criterion, laid down in the Doorson judgment (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76), is difficult to apply, because if the testimony of anonymous witnesses is used by the court as part of the evidence, that will always be because the court considers it a \"decisive\" part of that evidence, making the proof complete or at least sufficient. Here again, the Court\u2019s finding that \"as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them\" (paragraph 50 of the present judgment) should prevail. Moreover, as already mentioned (see paragraph 3 (h) above), in this respect the facts of the case would not seem to differ substantially from those of the Doorson case.",
