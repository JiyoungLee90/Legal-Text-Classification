The case originated in an application (no. 26521/05) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Mrs Mariana Suciu Werle (“the applicant”), on
The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr R. H. Radu.
On 31 August 2006, the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1927 and lives in Cornu.
In 1950, the real estate made up of two apartments and the appurtenant land situated in Bucharest, Regina Maria blvd. nos. 36-38, the property of the applicant's parents, was seized by the State under Decree no. 92/1950 on nationalisation. The applicant continued to live in a flat situated in building no. 38 as a tenant of the State.
On 15 January 1996 the applicant claimed restitutio in integrum of building no. 38 and compensation for building no. 36. On 15 June 2000, the Bucharest Town Council rejected her demand. The applicant contested the decision before the courts.
On 2 March 2001, the Bucharest District Court upheld the applicant's action by a final judgment, declaring void the decision of the Town Council and ordering the administrative authorities to return to the applicant the real estate no. 38, made of three buildings and appurtenant land of 208 m².
In 2001, on an unknown date, the applicant claimed from the administrative authorities the restitution in kind of 450 m² of land appurtenant to buildings nos. 36 and 38. By a decision of 12 July 2002, the Bucharest Town Council allowed the application and granted restitutio in integrum of the appurtenant land of 314 m² for no. 36 and 136 m² for no. 38.
In spite of obtaining judicial recognition of her property right, the applicant was not able to recover possession of flats nos. 1 and 2 of building no. 38 because on 30 September 1996 the State had sold them to the tenants, under Law no. 112/1995, together with the land appurtenant to each flat.
On 6 February 2002, the applicant requested the court to find that the sale by the State was null and void. She considered that the State did not have a right of property, that it had not observed the legal provisions of Law no. 112/1995 and that the purchasers were in bad faith.
On 1 February 2005, the Bucharest Court of Appeal, by a final decision, dismissed the request for the rescission of the sale contracts on the ground that the State had complied with the provisions of Law no. 112/1995 and that the tenants had made the purchase in good faith.
The relevant legal provisions and jurisprudence are described in the judgments Străin and Others v. Romania (no. 57001/00, §§ 19-26, 21 July 2005), Păduraru v. Romania (no. 63252/00, §§ 38-53, 1 December 2005), Porteanu v. Romania (no. 4596/03, §§ 23-25, 16 February 2006), and Radu v. Romania (no. 13309/03, §§ 18-20, 20 July 2006).
