Furthermore, the Federal Bar Association pointed out that, if a lawyer revealed the names of his clients, he or she could be held criminally liable under Article 203 \u00a7 1 (3) of the Criminal Code, and could have to face a term of imprisonment of up to one year or a fine for the disclosure of confidential information.",

Germany, no.\u00a041604/98, \u00a7 44, ECHR\u00a02005IV, with further references). Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the need for an interference, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision embracing both legislation and decisions applying it (see, among many other authorities, Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, \u00a7 232, ECHR 2015). The exceptions provided for in Article 8 \u00a7 2 are to be interpreted narrowly, and the need for them in a given case must be convincingly established (see Cr\u00e9mieux v. France, 25\u00a0February 1993, \u00a7 38, Series A no.\u00a0256B).",

Moreover, the Court has previously acknowledged the importance of specific procedural guarantees when it comes to protecting the confidentiality of exchanges between lawyer and client and of legal professional privilege (see Michaud cited above, \u00a7\u00a0130). It has emphasised that, subject to strict supervision, it is possible to impose certain obligations on lawyers concerning their relations with their clients, for example in the event that there is plausible evidence of the lawyer\u2019s involvement in a crime and in the context of the fight against money-laundering. The Court has further elaborated that the Convention does not prevent domestic law allowing for searches of a lawyer\u2019s offices as long as proper safeguards are provided, for example the presence of a representative (or president) of a bar association (see Andr\u00e9 and Another v. France, no. 18603/03, 24 July 2008, and Roemen and Schmit v.

It agrees with the applicant that the information submitted by the bank provided the public prosecutor and the police with a complete picture of his professional activity for the time in question, and moreover with information about his clients. It also considers that the interference was made more serious by the fact that excerpts of the information were included in the case file and made available to other people. The fact that only fifty-three transactions were considered relevant and included in the case file, and that the Regional Court restricted access to the relevant parts of the case file later on, could not redress the already ongoing interference, but only limit it from becoming more serious. In sum, the Court concludes that the requests for information were only limited in relation to the period in question, but otherwise concerned all information concerning the bank account and banking transactions of the applicant. It will therefore examine whether the shortcomings in the limitation of the requests for information were offset by sufficient procedural safeguards capable of protecting the applicant against any abuse or arbitrariness (see, mutatis mutandis, Robathin v. Austria, no.\u00a030457/06, \u00a7 47, 3 July 2012).",

The Court therefore concludes that the threshold for interference under Article 161 of the CCP is relatively low and that the provision does not provide particular safeguards.",

Consequently, the Court is doubtful whether the bank acted entirely voluntarily. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that the storage or collection of data relating to the \u201cprivate life\u201d of an individual constitutes interference for the purposes of Article 8, irrespective of who is the owner of the medium on which the information is held (see, mutatis mutandis, M.N. and Others v.

Since the applicant and the third party contested this interpretation of Article 53a of the CCP, the Court finds it necessary to reiterate that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation, and that the Court\u2019s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see M.N. and Others v. San Marino, cited above, \u00a7 80, with further references). However, the Court finds that the national authorities\u2019 interpretation of Article 53a of the CCP had no effect in the present case, as the national authorities and courts concluded that Article\u00a0160a \u00a7 4 of the CCP allowed investigative measures against the applicant. Consequently, possible safeguards under Article 53a of the CCP would also have been suspended.",

According to the Government, with reference to the discussions during the legislative procedure, Article 160a \u00a7 4 of the CCP does not require there to be an official investigation against a lawyer before the protection of the professional confidentiality of lawyers is suspended. According to the national authorities and courts, the transfer of fees from the applicant\u2019s client\u2019s fianc\u00e9e to the applicant, and the suspicion that money stemming from illegal activities had been transferred to the fianc\u00e9e\u2019s bank account, sufficiently substantiated a suspicion against the applicant.

In so far as the Government submitted that the applicant could have the measures reviewed by a court under the analogous application of Article 98 \u00a7 2 of the CCP, the Court reiterates that a subsequent judicial review can offer sufficient protection if a review procedure at an earlier stage would jeopardise the purpose of an investigation or surveillance. However, the effectiveness of a subsequent judicial review is inextricably linked to the question of subsequent notification about the surveillance measures. There is, in principle, little scope for recourse to the courts by an individual unless he or she is advised of the measures taken without his or her knowledge and thus able to challenge the legality of such measures retrospectively (see Roman\u00a0Zakharov, cited above, \u00a7 234; Klass and Others v. Germany, 6\u00a0September 1978, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 28; Weber and Saravia v. Germany, no. 54934/00, \u00a7\u00a0135, 29 June 2006; and Uzun v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072). In that regard, the Court observes that the public prosecutor asked the bank not to reveal his information requests to the applicant, that the applicant was not informed about the inspection of his professional bank account by the public prosecutor, and that he only learned of the investigative measures concerning his own bank account from the case file. The Court concludes that, even though there was no legal requirement to notify the applicant, by coincidence he learnt of the investigative measures and had access to a retrospective judicial review of the prosecutorial requests for information.",
