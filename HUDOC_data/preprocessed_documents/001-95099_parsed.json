It found that the applicants were not entitled to participate in the proceedings as the task of the court in charge of the commercial register had been to decide on the rights of the company, not on theirs. It noted that that court had the applicants' arguments in their action to set aside at its disposal and had taken them into consideration before delivering the impugned decision, whilst reviewing the lawfulness of the resolution as a preliminary question. It held that the power to stay the proceedings was still available to that court under the law as it stood at the relevant time. The  dismissed the applicants' second claim according to which that decision amounted to other interference by public authority into their right to access to a court. Referring to Article 220h of the CC, it found the application of Article 131 of the CC in conformity with constitutional law. In this regard, the court pointed to procedural safeguards enshrined in Articles 131, 220h, 220k, 2201 and 220p of the CC which were available to the applicants, and emphasised the aim of the regulation providing for legal certainty and expeditious transformation of companies. As for the applicants' challenge to the law providing for the winding-up and the transfer on the ground of insufficient protection of the rights of minority shareholders, the court did not examine it since it went beyond the scope of that court's review defined by the applicants' constitutional appeal contesting the decision in which the court in charge of the commercial register had approved the registration of the winding-up and the transfer at the commercial register, but not any decisions adopted in other proceedings available to the complaining minority shareholders.",

As for the applicants' plea of invalidity of the asset transfer contract, namely the insufficient number of experts commissioned for the expert report on the compensation and the determination of the decisive day (rozhodn\u00fd den), the court expressed the view that the validity of the asset transfer contract must have been examined as a preliminary question by the court approving the registration of the transfer into the commercial register. At the same time, having reviewed the contract, the Municipal Court found that the determination of decisive day complied with the CC. Having interpreted relevant provisions of the CC, the court further found that the law did not require that more experts be commissioned for the purposes of assessing the compensation to be paid by the main shareholders to the applicants. Finally, the court examined and dismissed the applicants' claims that the compensation had not been properly determined as unfounded or reviewable only by a court reviewing the compensation in separate proceedings.",

It is for the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time; that is to say, that the remedy was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a024888/94, \u00a7 57, ECHR 1999-IX). The Court has recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2007-XII). The Court further reiterates that where a suggested remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, for example in the light of settled domestic case law, the fact that the applicant did not use it is not a bar to admissibility (Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, decision of 23 September 2003, \u00a7 34).",

In particular, although the Constitutional Court was formally dealing with challenges to decisions to register asset transfers, in each case it made comprehensive findings that the legislation on regulation of actions to set aside was compatible with the Constitution, as extensive procedural safeguards were contained in the CC. Those safeguards included, in its view, the possibility of an action for compensation under Articles 131, 220h, 220(k), 2201 and 220p of the CC. Moreover, the  subsequently took the same approach in its decision III. \u00daS 527/04 of 25 May 2005, and on 23\u00a0May\u00a02007 the Supreme Court applied those principles in a decision dealing directly with applications to set aside general meeting resolutions once the transfer had been registered. Furthermore, as to application no.\u00a05344/05, the Plenary Constitutional Court did deal in the set-aside proceedings with the first applicant's complaint of denial of access to a\u00a0court, when it refused the Ostrava Regional Court's request to strike down as unconstitutional the provisions of the Commercial Code preventing the first applicant from having his case decided on the merits (see paragraphs 33 and 36 above).

As stated in the Court's case-law, \u201cit would be illusory if a\u00a0's domestic legal system allowed an individual to bring a\u00a0civil action before a court without securing that the case would be determined by a final decision in the judicial proceedings. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants - proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious - without guaranteeing the parties to have their civil disputes finally determined\u201d (Petkoski, cited above, and Multiplex v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 58112/00, \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 45, 10 July 2003).",

His access to a court was therefore limited in a manner similar to that in application no. 28464/04. Having found that the alternative legal avenues referred to by the Government did not constitute an effective legal remedy within the meaning of Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention and did not adequately mitigate such a limitation (see paragraphs 101 and 105 above), the Court finds that no reasons that would render that limitation proportionate to the legitimate aims of furthering stability in the business community by preventing abusive challenges to general meeting resolutions were established.",

In the context of civil rights that are not to be exercised individually but collectively together with other shareholders in the same position and under the obligation to reach a majority vote, access to court cannot be understood as a purely individual right to challenge and suspend every decision. This would at the same time grant every single shareholder a\u00a0veto right against majority decisions. Thus the scope of shareholders' voting rights is defined within the limits of judicial control attached to them.",

Domestic law neither provides for any right to set aside majority resolutions nor to suspend their execution after registration. Minority shareholders are clearly excluded from these rights. Thus they cannot claim to have such right on arguable grounds. Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention is not applicable (see Associazone Nazionale, referred to above).",

In the course of their scrutiny the courts will have to examine whether the totality of restrictions, including those on access to court, can be deemed necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest (under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1).
