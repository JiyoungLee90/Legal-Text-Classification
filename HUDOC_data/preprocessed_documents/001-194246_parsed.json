The domestic courts then acknowledged that his detention had been unlawful and awarded him 20,000 Russian roubles (about 500\u00a0euros (EUR)). Having regard to the short duration of Mr Kostyrin\u2019s detention, the Court considers that the amount awarded to him was not manifestly unreasonable in comparison to what the Court would have awarded in a similar case (see Fortalnov and Others v. Russia, nos. 7077/06 and 12\u00a0others, 26 June 2018).

The administrative offence report stated that he had been escorted to the police station for the purpose of drawing up an administrative offence report. Article 27.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences provides that a suspected offender could be escorted to a police station for the purpose of drawing up an administrative offence report only if such a report could not be drawn up at the place where the offence had been discovered. The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s assertion that in the applicant\u2019s case it was impossible because he did not have identity documents because that assertion is refuted by the documents in the case file. Indeed, none of the official documents mentions the alleged lack of identity documents or explain why it was not possible to draw the administrative report on the spot. The police report states that the applicant was brought to the police station after his identity documents had been checked; the administrative offence report indicates the applicant\u2019s passport details; and the release certificate mentions that the applicant\u2019s driving license was given back to him upon release.
