It has found that no effective remedies existed in Russia for applicants who have complained of an ongoing deterioration in their health as a result of a lack of proper medical care while in detention (see, among other authorities, Koryak v. Russia, no.\u00a024877/10, \u00a7 95, 13 November 2012; Dirdizov\u00a0v. Russia, no. 41461/10, \u00a7\u00a091, 27\u00a0November 2012; and Reshetnyak\u00a0v. Russia, no. 56027/10, \u00a7\u00a080, 8\u00a0January 2013). However, when applicants have complained of the detention authorities\u2019 failure to provide them with adequate medical services, but at the time of the complaint were no longer in the situation complained of, the Court has stressed that a civil claim for damages would have been capable of providing redress in respect of that complaint, and would have offered reasonable prospects of success \n(see Buzychkin\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia, no. 68337/01, \u00a7 83, 14 October 2008; Shchebetov\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia, no. 21731/02, \u00a7\u00a7 89-92, 10 April 2012; and Gadamauri and Kadyrbekov v. Russia, no. 41550/02, \u00a7 34, 5 July 2011). Given that the applicant\u2019s complaint of inadequate medical assistance relates to his period of detention in the IVS that ended on 16\u00a0December 2004 (see paragraph 7 above), and to his detention in the SIZO-type facilities (the latest period of which ended on 27 July 2005 \u2013 \nsee paragraph\u00a029 above), his situation in the present case falls into the latter category.",

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Mente\u015f and Others v.

Firstly, they submitted that it had been open to the applicant to lodge a complaint with a prosecutor\u2019s office. To demonstrate the effectiveness of that remedy, they referred to an example in the Kaluga region, where the local prosecutor\u2019s office had in 2006 declared 13.1% of complaints about inadequate conditions of detention wellfounded, a proportion which had risen to 18% in the first half of 2007. They also submitted, without providing any further details, that in two\u00a0detention facilities in the Vladimir and Khabarovsk regions, material conditions of detention had been improved following complaints to prosecutor\u2019s offices. Secondly, the Government argued that it had been open to the applicant to institute civil proceedings before the domestic courts in relation to the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the conditions of detention, as, in their submission, that avenue of recourse constituted an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention. To illustrate their point, the Government stated that an unspecified number of individuals had successfully sought damages in the courts of the Perm region and Kazan. They further referred to the case of Mr\u00a0S., who had been awarded RUB 250,000 by a domestic court for nonpecuniary damage, and to that of Mr D. \u2013 already cited in connection with their plea of nonexhaustion. Lastly, the Government stated that the applicant had failed to properly bring his civil claims in connection with the conditions of detention in the IVS. Referring to the Court\u2019s case-law \n(see Whiteside v. the United Kingdom, Commission decision of 7 March 1994, application no.\u00a020357/92, Decisions and Reports 76, p. 80), they pointed out that a mere doubt on the applicant\u2019s part as to the prospects of success was not sufficient to exempt him from submitting his claim to any of the aforementioned national authorities with jurisdiction in such matters.",

The documents provided by the Government are either irrelevant (as they relate to periods of time which followed the applicant\u2019s detention), or give rise to serious doubts as to their reliability. For example, the Court is not prepared to attach any evidential value to the handwritten statements of the officers of the Novocherkassk detention facility \u2013 which, albeit undated, appear to have been drafted after 2005 \u2013 as it is highly implausible that the officers would \u201ccertainly remember\u201d the numbers of all fifteen cells in which one particular detainee had been kept (see paragraph 24 above).",
