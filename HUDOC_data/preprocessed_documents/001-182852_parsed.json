Subsequently, in McCann v. the United Kingdom (no. 19009/04, \u00a7\u00a050, ECHR 2008), the Court held that the reasoning in the case of Connors was not confined to cases involving the eviction of Roma or to cases where the applicant had sought to challenge the law itself rather than its application in his particular case, and further held as follows:",

Therefore, the only interests that were at stake were those of the local authorities. However, the domestic courts did not weigh those interests against the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her home. Once they had found that the housing allocation order on the basis of which the applicant had moved in the flat had been null and void, they gave that aspect paramount importance, without seeking to weigh it against the applicant\u2019s arguments. The national courts thus failed to balance the competing rights and therefore to determine the proportionality of the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her home.",
