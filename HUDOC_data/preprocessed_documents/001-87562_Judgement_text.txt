The case originated in an application (no. 37354/03) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals, Mr Mikhail Anatolyevich Limasov and Ms Yelena Aleksandrovna Limasova (“the applicants”), on 29 October 2003.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev and Mrs V. Milinchuk, the Representatives of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 15 November 2005 and 17 October 2006 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning non-enforcement and supervisory review of binding judgments to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants are husband and wife. They were born in 1965 and live in Novokuznetsk.
In 1993 both applicants subscribed to a State savings scheme for buying cars. The State failed to provide the cars, and the applicants had to sue the Government.
On 1 April 2003 the Ust-Yansk District Court of Yakutia gave two judgments and awarded the ﬁrst applicant 90,610.72 Russian roubles (“RUB”), and the second applicant RUB 108,654.15. These judgments became binding on 30 April 2003, but were not enforced immediately. On the Government's request, on 14 October 2004 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of Yakutia quashed the judgments and dismissed the applicants' claims on the ground that the district court had misinterpreted material laws.
In 2005 the ﬁrst applicant again sued the Government for the undelivered car's price.
On 13 May 2005 the district court awarded the first applicant RUB 108,757.91. This judgment became binding on 24 May 2005. On the Government's request, on 18 May 2006 the presidium quashed the judgment and dismissed the ﬁrst applicant's claims on the ground that the district court had misinterpreted material laws.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months. Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.
