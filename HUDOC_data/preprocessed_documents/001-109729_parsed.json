In the present case, the Court notes that it has found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention only in respect of the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention and declared inadmissible all the other complaints. It also notes that the applicant made no claim for costs and expenses as part of his first application, which was the only one where the parties had been asked to comment on the complaint under Article 3 (see paragraph 4 above). Accordingly, the Court makes no award for legal costs. At the same time, regard being had to the information in its possession, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant the sum of EUR 100 for incidental costs and expenses.",
