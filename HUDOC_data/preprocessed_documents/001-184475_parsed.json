It held that the applicant\u2019s inadmissible civil claim brought in the context of the criminal proceedings could not have interrupted the running of the relevant limitation period, which was five years. Only a claim brought in accordance with the relevant procedural requirements and subsequently found to be well-founded could have had such an effect. In addition, even if the running of the limitation period could be considered to have been interrupted by the applicant\u2019s bringing her claim in the context of the criminal proceedings, that interruption had been retroactively invalidated by the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 8 March 2006 finding that the claim was inadmissible and discontinuing the proceedings. Accordingly, the running of the limitation period \u2013 which had started in 1997 because the perpetrator\u2019s identity had been known immediately after the accident in which the applicant\u2019s daughter had died \u2013 had never been validly interrupted. The applicant\u2019s claim for damages, brought ten years later, was time-barred. The applicant had brought her claim before a tribunal, namely the criminal court, which had been barred from examining it; this meant that this tribunal had had to transfer the claim to the civil courts with jurisdiction, but this had not been done.",

However, after the proceedings had been discontinued, in the absence of recognition of the applicant\u2019s right to receive damages, the time-limit had to be considered to have never been interrupted.

On other occasions it was held that under section 115(1)(g) of the Obligations and Contracts Act time stopped running only when the victim brought a claim for damages, whether in the context of criminal proceedings or in separate civil proceedings.

The 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, applicable at the time, stated expressly that any civil claim had to be brought before the commencement of the examination of the case by the court of first instance, and the domestic case-law reiterated that requirement (see paragraph 22 above). While, indeed, there is also case-law accepting that in situations where the case has been sent back to the prosecution authorities the victims of the respective offence can validly lodge a civil claim after the case reaches once again the courts (see paragraph 23 above), it is scarce, and the parties have not specified whether the national courts have reached such conclusions on any constant basis. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicant should have been aware, in 2001 when she brought her civil action in the criminal proceedings only after a remittal of the case, that, at the least, she ran a risk to have that action declared inadmissible.

Such an approach limits the right of access to court in an excessive manner and does not correspond to the standards developed by the Court. Rather than focusing on this initial episode, the majority should have analysed the reasonableness of the choice of avenue made by the applicant when she did file her claim and the adequacy of the reaction of the national courts.

There are a number of reasons for this, and this position has been stated expressly by the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraph 25 of the judgment). As to the issue whether the victim of a criminal offence could file a claim after the case had been sent back to the investigation stage, the existing domestic case-law at the time suggested that the victim could do so (see paragraph 23 of the judgment). No case-law existed at the relevant time taking the opposite position, namely that the victim could not file a civil claim after the case had been sent back to the investigation stage. Finally, there was conflicting case-law of the domestic courts as to whether pending criminal proceedings, without a claim for damages being filed, stopped the running of the five-year limitation period (see paragraph 25 of the judgment).",

Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21\u00a0February 1975, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 18). The right of access to a court also includes the right to obtain a determination of the dispute by a court (see Kuti\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 48778/99, \u00a7 25, ECHR 2002II). This \u201cright to a court\u201d may be relied on by anyone who considers that an interference with the exercise of his or her civil rights is unlawful and complains that he or she has not had the possibility of submitting that claim to a tribunal meeting the requirements of Article 6 (see Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 76943/11, \u00a7 85, ECHR 2016 (extracts)). The right of access to a court is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations. Nevertheless, the limitations applied must not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired (ibid., \u00a7 89). Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Sabeh El Leil v. France [GC], no. 34869/05, \u00a7 47, 29 June 2011, and Cordova v. Italy, no.\u00a040877/98, \u00a7\u00a054, ECHR 2003-I).",

It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see, for example, Nejdet Sahin and Perihan Sahin v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, \u00a7 49, 20 October 2011).

The applicant still had a valid claim under national law, and taking into account the fact that she always had another procedural avenue available, such failure could by no means be interpreted as a waiver of her claim. When the criminal proceedings were brought before the Regional Court for a second time, the five-year period under section 110 of the Obligations and Contracts Act (see paragraph 29 of the judgment) had not yet expired. In view of the advantages of the criminal route, the applicant\u2019s choice in 2001 to attempt to have her claim examined by the criminal courts was justified, and we see no reason to hold it against her. As it was open to the applicant to bring a claim for damages either in the criminal proceedings or in separate civil proceedings, the question before this Court was not whether she should have taken another procedural route that was available to her, but whether her choice to bring such a claim before the criminal courts was a reasonable one.",

First, under the domestic legal system there were clear advantages to using the criminal procedure.

We consider it crucial from the perspective of the clarity and foreseeability of the domestic law that there was nothing to indicate to the applicant that her choice of avenue was a problematic one. At the time, no case-law of the domestic courts existed suggesting that they might refuse civil claims for examination after the case had been sent back to the preliminary investigation stage (see paragraph 23 of the judgment). In line with the existing case-law at the time, the trial court accepted the applicant\u2019s claim, considered it on the merits and granted it.",

Although such evolution of the case-law is not in itself problematic from the perspective of the Convention, it nevertheless happened after the applicant had filed her claim, and the manner in which the domestic courts handled the applicant\u2019s claim after that was excessively formalistic. Even though the applicant filed her claim in 2001, less than five years after her daughter\u2019s death, that is, within the relevant time-limit, that claim was eventually declared inadmissible precisely for being filed out of time. This was the result of both the reversal of the domestic case-law and the manner in which the domestic courts treated the claim, accepting it at first for consideration in the criminal proceedings, and eventually declaring it inadmissible at a point in time when the five-year time-limit had already expired. The decision of the Regional Court to accept the applicant\u2019s claim for examination in the criminal proceedings was later considered by the higher courts to be an error. The applicant, however, had no remedy against this error and against the fact that it resulted in the time-limit for her claim expiring. Had the Regional Court refused to admit the applicant\u2019s claim for consideration, or possibly transferred it to the civil courts following the procedure under Article 93 \u00a7\u00a01 of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 28 of the judgment), this would have allowed the applicant to bring her claim before the civil courts in due time. However, once the claim was accepted for examination in the criminal proceedings she was prevented under Article 95 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Code of Civil Procedure from bringing the same claim before the civil courts (see paragraph 26 of the judgment).",

However, this fact was not taken into account by the civil courts when they declared the applicant\u2019s claim time-barred, nor was the fact that before 2006 the applicant could justifiably have believed, since the national courts regularly accepted it to be the case (see paragraph 31 of the judgment), that the running of the limitation period had ceased with the mere opening of the criminal proceedings. The Court has recently held that a restriction on access to a court would be disproportionate where the inadmissibility of a remedy is the result of attribution of a mistake to an applicant for which he or she is not objectively responsible (see Zubac v.
