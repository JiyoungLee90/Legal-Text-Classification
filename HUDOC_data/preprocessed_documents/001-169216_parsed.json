The Government emphasised that the applicant had been provided with a divorce certificate on 6 February 2009, but that he and his new female partner had applied to have their marriage registered almost half a year later. The Government concluded that the applicant lacked victim status in respect of his complaint.",

This does not, however, mean that persons in detention cannot, or only very exceptionally can, exercise their right to marry. As the Court has repeatedly held, a prisoner continues to enjoy fundamental human rights and freedoms that are not contrary to the sense of deprivation of liberty, and every additional limitation should be justified by the authorities (see Jaremowicz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051 and Frasik v.
