The investigation file contained documents, including the order of 30 May 1986 remanding him in custody and the record of the accused\u2019s interrogation of 14 November 1986 (see paragraphs 10 and 14 above), which referred to the necessity of or the request for confrontations. Secondly, the accused could have hoped to refute at the trial the statements of two of his co-accused, Mrs Bentaieb and Mr Hamdi Pacha, who had been committed for trial with him and duly summoned; they did not, however, appear at the hearing and were convicted in absentia (see paragraph 18 above). Thirdly, throughout the trial Mr Sa\u00efdi continued to deny the accusations made against him (see the same paragraph), thereby seeking to cast doubt on the credibility of the persons who had made them.

This is particularly so where the defence\u2019s failure to call witnesses in the Criminal Court and the decision not to have recourse to Article 513 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would appear to have been a tactic adopted by the accused, who reserved the possibility of invoking Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention for the proceedings in the Court of Cassation. Even though some of the depositions of the witnesses did not have a decisive influence on the Court of Appeal\u2019s assessment of the applicant\u2019s guilt, it would have been prudent in proceedings involving serious offences and heavy sentences to organise a confrontation with the prosecution witnesses, even if this was not expressly requested by the defence in that it did not call witnesses in the Criminal Court or seek to invoke Article 513 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the Court of Appeal.",
