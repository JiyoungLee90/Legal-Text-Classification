The Committee\u2019s French-language rapporteur, National Councillor Comby, explained that there was a discrepancy between the German and French versions, pointing out that the wording was obviously referring to any genocide and not only the Holocaust (BO/CN [Official Gazette/National Council] 1992 II 2675 et seq.). The National Council nevertheless adopted the Committee\u2019s proposal as it stood (BO/CN 1992 II 2676). Before the Council of States, the proposal by the latter\u2019s Legal Affairs Committee to maintain the wording of Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code approved by the National Council was set against a proposal by Mr K\u00fcchler, which did not, however, call into question the phrase \u2018or who on the same grounds denies, grossly trivialises or seeks to justify genocide or other crimes against humanity\u2019 (BO/CE [Official Gazette/Council of States] 1993 96; as to the scope of this proposal, see ATF [Judgments of the Swiss Federal Court] 123 IV 202, point 3c, p. 208, and Poncet, ibid.). That proposal was adopted without any more detailed reference being made to denial of the Armenian genocide during the debate. During the elimination of divergences, the National Council\u2019s Legal Affairs Committee proposed, through Mr Comby, that the amendments inserted by the Council of States be adopted, with the exception of the fourth paragraph, where the Committee proposed the wording \u2018a genocide\u2019, by way of reference to any that might occur. The French-language rapporteur observed that some people had mentioned massacres of Kurds or other populations, for example Armenians, and that all these genocides should be covered (BO/CN 1993 I 1075 et seq.). Further brief comments were made in relation to the definition of genocide and how a Turkish citizen might refer to the Armenian tragedy, and it was also observed that the Committee did not intend the provision to apply to one particular genocide alone but to all genocides, for example in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BO/CN 1993 I 1077; statement by Ms\u00a0Grendelmeier). The National Council ultimately adopted the following wording of paragraph 4: \u2018... or any other means, violates the human dignity of a person or group of persons on the grounds of their race, ethnic origin or religion, or who on the same grounds denies, grossly trivialises or seeks to justify a genocide...\u2019 (BO/CN 1993 I 1080). In the subsequent parliamentary proceedings, the Council of States maintained its position, adopting the wording \u2018a genocide\u2019 (\u2018un g\u00e9nocide\u2019) as a simple editorial amendment in the French version, and the National Council eventually endorsed the Council of States\u2019 decision, without any further reference being made to denial of the Armenian genocide (BO/CN 1993 I 1300, 1451; BO/CE 1993 452, 579).",

In its case-law, however, the Federal Court has held that Holocaust denial objectively constitutes the factual element of the offence provided for in Article\u00a0261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code since it concerns a historical fact that is generally acknowledged as established (ATF 129 IV 95, point 3.4.4, pp. 104 et seq.), although the judgment in question makes no reference to the historical intention of the legislature. Similarly, many authors have viewed the Holocaust as a matter of common knowledge for the criminal courts (Vest, Delikte gegen den \u00f6ffentlichen Frieden, note 93, p. 157), as an indisputable historical fact (Rom, op. cit., p.\u00a0140), or as a classification (\u2018genocide\u2019) that is beyond doubt (Niggli, Discrimination raciale, note\u00a0972, p. 259, who simply notes that this genocide was what prompted the introduction of the provision in question; to similar effect, see Guyaz, op. cit., p. 305). Only a few voices have referred to the intention of the legislature to recognise it as a historical fact (see, for example, Ulrich Weder, Schweizerisches Strafgesetzbuch, Kommentar (ed. Andreas Donatsch), Z\u00fcrich 2006, Art. 261 bis \u00a7 4, p. 327; Chaix/Bertossa, op. cit., p.\u00a0184).",

The fact that Holocaust denial constitutes a criminal offence under Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code therefore stems less from the legislature\u2019s specific intention to outlaw negationism and revisionism when it formulated this rule of criminal law than from the observation that there is a very general consensus on this matter, to which the legislature undoubtedly had regard. Nor is there, accordingly, any reason to determine whether the legislature was guided by any such intention regarding the Armenian genocide (contrast Niggli, Rassendiskriminierung, 2nd ed., Z\u00fcrich 2007, note 1445 et seq., pp.\u00a0447 et seq.). Indeed, it should be noted in this connection that while certain aspects of the wording prompted fierce discussion among the members of parliament, the categorisation of the events of 1915 did not give rise to any debate in this context, and was ultimately mentioned by only two speakers in justifying the adoption of a French version of Article 261 bis \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code that did not allow an excessively restrictive interpretation of the text, which did not follow from the German version.",

Hence there is no need for the courts to have recourse to the work of historians on this matter (Chaix/Bertossa, ibid.; unreported judgment 6S.698/2001, point 2.1). As a further consequence, the basis thus determined for the criminalisation of Holocaust denial dictates the method which the courts must adopt in considering the denial of other genocides.

Thus, as well as relying on the existence of political recognition, this line of argument notes the existence in practice of a broad consensus within the community, which is reflected in the political declarations and is itself based on a wide academic consensus as to the classification of the events of 1915 as genocide. It may also be noted, in the same vein, that during the debate leading to the official recognition of the Armenian genocide by the National Council, reference was made to the international research published under the title Der V\u00f6lkermord an den Armeniern und die Shoah (BO/CN 2003 2017; statement by Mr Lang). Lastly, the Armenian genocide is portrayed as one of the \u2018classic\u2019 examples in general literature on international criminal law, or on genocide research (see Marcel Alexander Niggli, Rassendiskriminierung, note 1418 et seq., p. 440, and the numerous references cited therein; see also note 1441, p. 446, and references).",

The mere observation that certain States refuse to declare in the international arena that they condemn Holocaust denial is manifestly insufficient to cast doubt on the existence of a very general consensus that the acts in question amount to genocide. Consensus does not mean unanimity.

This attitude of openness to dialogue cannot be construed as denial of the existence of a genocide and there is nothing to suggest that the support expressed by the Federal Council in 2001 for the setting up of an international commission of inquiry did not stem from the same approach.

It follows that denial of the Armenian genocide \u2013 or the representation of the Armenian people as the aggressor, as put forward by the appellant \u2013 in itself constitutes a threat to the identity of the members of this community (Schleiminger, op. cit., Article 261 bis of the Criminal Code, note\u00a065 and reference to Niggli). The Criminal Court, which found that there had been motives linked to racism, likewise ruled out that the approach pursued by the appellant pertained to historical debate. These findings of fact, about which the appellant raised no complaint (section 106(2) of the Federal Court Act), are binding on the Federal Court (section 105(1) of the Federal Court Act). They provide sufficient evidence of the existence of motives which, above and beyond nationalism, can only be viewed as racial, or ethnic, discrimination.

Furthermore, he was aware that genocide denial was a criminal offence and stated that he would never change his position, even if a neutral panel should one day conclude that the Armenian genocide did indeed take place (Criminal Court judgment, point II, p. 17). It can be inferred from these aspects that the appellant was not unaware that by describing the Armenian genocide as an \u2018international lie\u2019 and by explicitly denying that the events of 1915 amounted to genocide, he was liable to face a criminal penalty in Switzerland. The appellant cannot therefore draw any favourable inferences from the lack of foreseeability of the law he cites. These considerations, moreover, support the conclusion that the appellant is in essence seeking, by means of provocation, to have his assertions confirmed by the Swiss judicial authorities, to the detriment of the members of the Armenian community, for whom this question plays a central role in their identity. The applicant\u2019s conviction is thus intended to protect the human dignity of members of the Armenian community, who identify themselves through the memory of the 1915 genocide. Criminalisation of genocide denial is, lastly, a means of preventing genocides for the purposes of Article I of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, opened for signature in New York on 9\u00a0December 1948 and approved by the Federal Assembly on 9 March 2000 (RS 0.311.11).",

Thus it is legitimate to charge these crimes in relation to the same set of facts.

Such restrictions must be constructed with care: while it may be permissible to protect voters from forms of expression that constitute intimidation or coercion, such restrictions must not impede political debate, including, for example, calls for the boycotting of a non-compulsory vote. The term \u2018others\u2019 relates to other persons individually or as members of a community.

Spanish legislation refers generically to the denial of acts with the proven purpose of fully or partially eliminating an ethnic, racial or religious group. The perpetrator faces a sentence of one to two years\u2019 imprisonment. In France and Luxembourg, the legislation refers to denial of crimes against humanity, as defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, annexed to the London Agreement of 8 August 1945 ... This limitation of the substantive scope of the offence of denial of crimes against humanity is offset in Luxembourg by the fact that there is a special provision concerning denial of crimes of genocide. Denial of such crimes is punishable by the same sentences [imprisonment from eight days to six months and/or a fine ranging from 251 to 25,000 euros] as denial of crimes against humanity but the definition of genocide used for these purposes is that of the Luxembourg Law of 8 August 1985, which is general and abstract, not being limited to acts committed during the Second World War. The limited scope of the relevant provisions in France has been criticised and it should be noted in this connection that a Bill aimed at criminalising denial of the existence of the Armenian genocide was approved at its first reading by the National Assembly on 12 October 2006. Accordingly, it appears that only Luxembourg and Spain criminalise denial of crimes of genocide in their legislation, generically and without restricting themselves to particular episodes in history. In addition, denial of crimes against humanity in general is not currently a criminal offence in any country.",

In Austria, anyone who, acting in such a way that his or her position may be known by a large number of people, denies or severely trivialises genocide or other crimes against humanity committed by the National Socialist regime is punishable by up to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Following the same approach, Belgian law punishes by imprisonment for between eight days and one year anyone who denies or grossly trivialises, seeks to justify or approves of the genocide committed by the German National Socialist regime.",

The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has referred to the criminal offence of exposing others to hatred or contempt, as provided for in the Canadian Human Rights Act, as a basis for condemning the content of a negationist website. The position of the judges in the United States is less settled, since that country affords extremely strict protection of freedom of expression, for historical and cultural reasons.

Norwegian law punishes anyone who makes an official statement that is discriminatory or hateful. This definition could conceivably apply to negationism. The Supreme Court has not yet had occasion to rule on this issue. In other countries, for example Denmark and Sweden, the trial courts have taken a position, having agreed to review whether the provisions of criminal law concerning discriminatory or hateful statements may be applied to cases of negationism, although they have not found them to be applicable in the cases before them. In Finland, the political authorities have expressed the view that such provisions are not applicable to negationism. Lastly, neither United Kingdom law nor Irish law deals with negationism.\u201d",

Where the conduct being punished necessarily involved direct incitement to violence against certain groups or contempt towards the victims of crimes of genocide, Parliament had expressly provided for penalties linked to the notion of condoning genocide, specifically in Article 615 of the Criminal Code, which criminalised incitement, conspiracy and encouragement to commit genocide (la provocaci\u00f3n, la conspiraci\u00f3n y la proposici\u00f3n). The fact that the penalty provided for in Article 607.2 was less severe than the one for condoning genocide meant that it could not have been Parliament\u2019s intention to introduce an aggravated penalty.",

It stated that simply disseminating conclusions as to the existence or otherwise of specific acts, without making any value judgments about them or about their illegality, fell within the scope of academic freedom, as enshrined in paragraph (b) of Article 20.1 of the Constitution. It pointed out that that freedom was afforded enhanced protection under the Constitution in relation to freedom of expression or freedom of information. Lastly, it stated that this position was justified by the needs of historical research, which was by definition subject to controversy and dispute since it was built around assertions and value judgments from which it was impossible to derive the objective truth with absolute certainty.",

Thus, in the case of Garaudy v. France ((dec.), no. 65831/01, ECHR 2003-IX (extracts)), which concerned, inter alia, the conviction for denial of crimes against humanity of the author of a book that systematically disputed such crimes perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jewish community, the Court found the applicant\u2019s Article 10 complaint incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention. It based that conclusion on the finding that the main content and general tenor of the applicant\u2019s book, and thus its \u201caim\u201d, were markedly revisionist and therefore ran counter to the fundamental values of the Convention, namely justice and peace, and inferred from that observation that he had attempted to deflect Article 10 from its real purpose by using his right to freedom of expression for ends which were contrary to the text and spirit of the Convention. The Court reached the same conclusion in Norwood v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no.\u00a023131/03, ECHR 2004-XI) and Pavel Ivanov v. Russia ((dec.), no.\u00a035222/04, 20\u00a0February 2007), which concerned the use of freedom of expression for Islamophobic and anti-Semitic purposes respectively.",

It notes in this connection that incitement to hatred does not necessarily require a call for specific acts of violence or other offences. Personal attacks by means of insults, ridicule or defamation directed at certain specified sectors or groups of the population, or incitement to discrimination, are sufficient for the authorities to make it a priority to combat racist discourse when faced with irresponsible use of freedom of expression that undermines the dignity, or even the safety, of these population groups or sectors. Political speeches that stir up hatred based on religious, ethnic or cultural prejudices represent a threat to social peace and political stability in democratic States (see F\u00e9ret v.

Firstly, the underlying message the applicant had sought to convey through the humorous yet controversial medium of a cartoon \u2013 namely the destruction of American imperialism \u2013 was not aimed at destroying fundamental rights and could not be equated with remarks directed against the Convention\u2019s underlying values, for example remarks characterised by racism, anti-Semitism (see Garaudy, cited above, and Pavel Ivanov, cited above) or Islamophobia (see Norwood, cited above). Secondly, although the domestic courts had found the applicant guilty of condoning terrorism, the Court considered that the drawing in question and its accompanying caption did not constitute such an unequivocal attempt to justify an act of terrorism as to exclude them from the protection of freedom of the press enshrined in Article 10 (see Leroy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a027). Lastly, the insult to the memory of the victims of the attacks of 11 September 2001 through the publication in issue had to be examined in the light of the right protected by Article 10, which was not an absolute right; the Court had already examined the content of similar statements from the standpoint of that Article (see Kern v.\u00a0Germany (dec.), no. 26870/04, 29 May 2007).",

The Court considers that the rejection of the legal characterisation of the events of 1915 was not in itself sufficient to amount to incitement of hatred towards the Armenian people. In any event, the applicant has never been prosecuted or punished for incitement to hatred, which is a separate offence under the first paragraph of Article 261 bis of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 14 above). Nor does it appear that the applicant has expressed contempt towards the victims of the events in question. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicant has not abused his right to engage in open discussion of matters including those which are sensitive and likely to cause offence. The free exercise of this right is one of the fundamental aspects of freedom of expression and distinguishes a democratic, tolerant and pluralist society from a totalitarian or dictatorial regime.",

It nevertheless takes the view that in the particular circumstances of the case the criminal penalty was foreseeable for the applicant, who, as a doctor of laws and a well-informed political figure, might have suspected that he could face criminal penalties by making speeches of this kind in Switzerland, following the Swiss National Council\u2019s recognition in 2002 of the existence of the Armenian genocide (see paragraph 16 above). Furthermore, the applicant himself acknowledged that he had been aware of the provision of Swiss law punishing public denial of genocide, adding that \u201che would never change his position, even if a neutral panel should one day conclude that the Armenian genocide did indeed take place\u201d (see point 6 of the Federal Court\u2019s judgment).

To that end, the courts had not only relied on political declarations of recognition, but had also found that the authorities issuing such declarations had formed their views on the basis of expert opinions or reports acknowledged as being cogently argued and substantiated. The courts had also examined whether there had been a broad consensus within the community and, if so, whether that consensus was itself based on a broad academic consensus as to whether the events of 1915 to 1917 were to be categorised as genocide. They had also observed that in the general literature on international criminal law, and more specifically on genocide research, the Armenian genocide was itself portrayed as one of the \u201cclassic\u201d examples (see point 4.2 of the Federal Court judgment in paragraph 13 above). Accordingly, the cantonal courts could not be criticised for having described the deportations and massacres occurring between 1915 and 1917 as genocide and a clearly established historical fact, and nor could the Federal Court for having found that the conclusion that there was a general consensus to this effect was not arbitrary and that this finding was not at odds with the Federal Council\u2019s openness to dialogue in advocating the setting up of a panel of historians (Federal Court judgment, points 4.4 to 4.6).",

The Government acknowledge the strength of feeling about this terrible episode of history and recognise the massacres of 1915-16 as a tragedy.

Pointing out that combating all forms of intolerance was an integral part of human-rights protection, the Court held that it was crucially important that in their speeches politicians should avoid making comments liable to foster intolerance (\u00a7 64).",

The Court concluded, contrary to the arguments put forward by the Turkish Government, that these assertions, which were in no way directed at \u201cthe Turks\u201d, could not be treated as amounting to hate speech (ibid., \u00a7 128).",

The Court agrees, and would point out that there are differing views even among the various political bodies in Switzerland: whereas the National Council \u2013 the lower house of the Federal Parliament \u2013 has officially recognised the Armenian genocide, the Federal Council has repeatedly refused to do so (see points 4.2 and 4.5 of the Federal Court judgment in paragraph 13 above). In addition, it appears that to date, only about twenty States (out of more than 190 in the world) have officially recognised the Armenian genocide. In some countries, as in Switzerland, recognition has not come from the Government but only from Parliament or one of its chambers (see in this connection the declaration of 24 April 2013 by certain members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, paragraph\u00a029 above).",

According to the case-law of the ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (see paragraphs 21-23 above), for the crime of genocide to be made out, it is not sufficient for the members of a particular group to be targeted because they belong to that group, but the acts in question must at the same time be perpetrated with intent to destroy the group as such in whole or in part (dolus specialis). Genocide is therefore a very narrow legal concept which, moreover, is difficult to prove.

It considers that the decision of the Constitutional Council provides a clear illustration that there is in principle no contradiction between official recognition of certain events as genocide and the unconstitutionality of imposing criminal sanctions on anyone who questions the official view. Moreover, other States that have recognised the Armenian genocide \u2013 in the vast majority of cases, through their parliaments \u2013 have not deemed it necessary to pass laws introducing criminal sanctions, being mindful that one of the main aims of freedom of expression is to protect minority views which may contribute to debate on questions of general interest that are not entirely settled.",

Examining the period in question in the light of earlier massacres (for example, the Hamidian massacres), we are convinced that there is sufficient evidence (a terribly legalistic word in the present context) to show that Armenian citizens of the Ottoman Empire were subjected to a State policy that resulted in the death and suffering of hundreds of thousands of people (estimates range from 600,000 to 1,500,000) and brought Armenians as a distinct community to the verge of extinction. It is true that the specific factors which triggered those events remain contested.

That reaction was followed by political and diplomatic acknowledgment of the atrocities, such as by the US Senate Concurrent Resolution (with the House of Representatives concurring) of 9 February 1916, which referred to the \u201cuntold suffering\u201d and \u201cterrible plight\u201d of thousands of Armenians, and the 1919 Report of the Commission on Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties, which concluded that the Ottoman Empire\u2019s treatment of Armenians in its territory breached \u201cthe established laws and customs of war and the elementary laws of humanity\u201d, and declared that Ottoman officials responsible for such acts were liable to prosecution. Subsequently, Articles 226, 227 and 230 of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres signed between Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Armenia, Belgium, Greece, the Hejaz, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Serb-Croat-Slovene State, Czechoslovakia and Turkey on 10 August 1920, enshrined the right of the Allied Powers to bring before military tribunals persons accused of having committed acts in violation of the laws and customs of war, \u201cnotwithstanding any proceedings or prosecution before a tribunal in Turkey\u201d, as well as the obligation of the Turkish State to deliver those responsible for \u201cmassacres committed during the continuance of the state of war on territory which formed part of the Turkish Empire on August 1, 1914\u201d to stand trial. The fact that the Treaty of S\u00e8vres did not enter into force does not invalidate the conclusion that the above-mentioned provisions corresponded to the standard of customary international law at the relevant time, in so far as they acknowledged an international crime entailing individual responsibility. Even if the principle of criminal liability did not prevail in the subsequent negotiations that led to the Lausanne Treaty, the historical fact itself of the occurrence of the \u201cmassacres\u201d as the result of the Ottoman Empire\u2019s policy in breach of the \u201claws of humanity\u201d was acknowledged by the signatory parties to the Treaty of S\u00e8vres in compliance with the Joint Declaration of 24 May 1915. Indeed, Article 230 of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres constitutes the irrefutable precedent of Article 6 (c) of the Nuremberg Charter and Article 5 (c) of the Tokyo Charter, referring to \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d as they were understood since at least the beginning of the twentieth century.",

As a matter of fact, the distinction between mere denial and trivialising or justifying is artificial in linguistic terms and can be easily circumvented by a sophisticated speaker, through euphemistic and elaborate speech, as in the present case, where the denial of genocide was associated with justification of the Turkish \u201creaction\u201d to alleged Armenian \u201cattacks\u201d. Furthermore, and this is the essential point, the distinguo is ethically unsustainable, because the denial as much as the justification of genocide humiliates the victims and their families, offends the memory of the massacred people, exculpates those responsible for the massacres, and thus constitutes a serious incitement to hatred and discrimination and, to that extent, paves the way to discriminatory and violent acts against those who belong to the victimised people.

The argument is also misplaced if it implies that memorial laws encroach on the competence of judges and are therefore an ultra vires act of the legislative power, in breach of the principle of the separation of powers. And here again it is misplaced for the clear reason that the legal characterisation of an act as genocide does not presuppose the imputation of that act to a specific person or group of persons, which is the task of the judiciary. This conclusion is a fortiori valid for any official statement made by other branches of the State, such as the State President or the government, in the exercise of their constitutional powers.

The same must apply to Armenians. The suffering of an Armenian under the genocidal Ottoman State policy is not worth less than the suffering of a Jewish person under the genocidal Nazi State policy.

The applicant\u2019s statements did not objectively contribute to any public and democratic debate concerning the issue at stake; on the contrary, they were a serious incitement to intolerance and hatred towards a vulnerable minority. In fact, the applicant did not present or discuss any evidence relating to the scope and purpose of the atrocities, and even acknowledged that he would never recognise genocide even if a neutral scientific commission were to establish its existence.",

They were unable to find any scientific, historical or political purpose for his speech. By acting as he did, the applicant repeatedly and consciously scorned the existing legal framework of a foreign country to which he had travelled with the predetermined purpose of pronouncing the aforementioned statement and thus defying the national law. In seeking to whitewash the Ottoman regime by denying and justifying its genocidal policy, the applicant\u2019s statements laid the foundations for more intolerance, discrimination and violence.",

The Court is bound by the established fact that the applicant acted with a \u201cracist\u201d motive, and cannot change that fact. And this fact is crucial. It shows that the applicant intended not only to deny the existence of the Armenian genocide, but also to accuse the victims and the world of falsifying history, to depict Armenians as aggressors and to justify the Ottoman genocidal policy as an act of self-defence, to diminish the magnitude of the atrocities and sufferings caused to the Armenian people by the Turkish State and to defame and insult the Armenian people in Switzerland and throughout the world through comments that were deliberately hateful and \u201cracist\u201d. The expressions \u201cmensonge international\u201d, \u201chistorische L\u00fcge\u201d and \u201cimperialistische L\u00fcge\u201d (international/historical/imperialistic lie) used by the applicant clearly overstep the permissible limits of freedom of expression, since they equate the victims to liars.

Moreover, the criminal-policy aims pursued by the courts of the respondent State through the punishment of denial of the Armenian genocide \u2013 such as the prevention of public disorder in the face of the applicant\u2019s \u201cprovocation\u201d, to use the expression of the Federal Court, and the protection of the dignity and honour of the victims and the Armenian people in general \u2013 are relevant factors for restricting freedom of expression under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. Assessing the weight of all the relevant factors for the test of proportionality, the balancing act clearly favours considering the purpose of the State interference to the detriment of the circumstantial element of space. Thus, the reasons on which the impugned conviction was based were both relevant and sufficient and the State interference did correspond to a pressing social need.",

He was not sentenced to a prison term, although the crime was punishable by three years\u2019 imprisonment. He was neither detained nor imprisoned in Switzerland.

However, they are not forgotten by the authors of this dissent.
