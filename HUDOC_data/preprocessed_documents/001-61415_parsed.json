In this instance circumstances call for a global assessment so that the Court does not deem it necessary to consider these questions in detail (see, among other authorities, Obermeier v. Austria, judgment of 28 June 1990, Series\u00a0A\u00a0no.\u00a0179, pp.\u00a02324, \u00a7\u00a072; Olstowski v. Poland, no.\u00a034052/96, \u00a7\u00a086, 15\u00a0November 2001).",
