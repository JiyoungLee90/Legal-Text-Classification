The Court is aware that this situation was sensitive for a country that was in war and also accepts that during the war and at the beginning of the county\u2019s independence the State authorities were faced with a difficult situation which was aggravated by the fact that the perpetrators of the crimes subject to the present application appear to have been those same persons who were entrusted with the duty to protect citizens from such crimes, to conduct preliminary enquiries and carry out the initial fact findings, namely some highly-ranked officials of the Sisak police. The facts of the case indeed suggest that the very Head of that police and his deputies were the instigators of the atrocities committed (see paragraphs 26-30 above).",

However, the Code of Criminal Procedure allows for an urgent investigation against unknown perpetrators (see Article 185 of the Code of Criminal Procedure cited in paragraph 37 above). The difference between a police enquiry and an investigation is that in the former, statements given to the police amount only to informal statements and cannot be used as evidence in criminal proceedings. An investigation, however, is conducted by an investigating judge and statements given before him or her amount to valid evidence. An investigating judge may, moreover, punish a witness who refuses to give his or her statement or refuses to tell all he or she knows about the relevant facts (see Article 243 of the Code of Criminal Procedure cited in paragraph\u00a037 above).",

Some of them were direct eyewitnesses. A unanimous Chamber found that the authorities had failed to take appropriate steps in order to bring those responsible to justice (see Jeli\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 89-95). In the present case, however, the police have followed numerous leads, updating witness statements, looking for witnesses and tracking down as far as possible the names of potential suspects which have been mentioned by witnesses. Inevitably, given that more than twenty years have elapsed since the events, some of the witnesses and two out of three potential suspects have died in the meantime (compare G\u00fcrtekin and Others v. Cyprus (dec.), nos.\u00a060441/13 et al., \u00a7 25, 11 March 2014).",

(see paragraph 8 of the judgment). In February 2003 D.M., another Croatian soldier, confirmed the presence of V.H. at the crime scene and also identified M.B. as the commander of the unit of the Croatian army whose members had been involved in the beating of V.B. (see paragraph 13 of the judgment). Several other Croatian soldiers confirmed that M.B. had indeed been in command (see paragraph 15 of the judgment). In January 2009 a Croatian soldier, S.\u0160., told the police that he had heard that V.H. and M.S. had beaten V.B. (see paragraph 21 of the judgment).",

However, when interviewed again by the police in 2003 Vl.P. could not name any of the persons present at the crime scene at the critical time (see paragraph 17 of the judgment). Vl.P. died in 2009 (see paragraph 23 of the judgment), while S.\u0160., the only other witness implicating M.S. during his interview in 2009, had no direct knowledge about the beating of V.B. but had only later heard that M.S. and V.H. had beaten him (see paragraph 21 of the judgment).

(see, in this regard, G\u00fcrtekin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 20). This leads us to conclude that the present case is not comparable to Jeli\u0107, but rather to the whole line of cases emphasising that Article 2 cannot be interpreted such as to impose a requirement on the authorities to initiate a prosecution irrespective of the evidence which is available. Bearing in mind the presumption of innocence, a prosecution on such a serious charge as involvement in war crimes should never be embarked upon lightly and irrespective of the standard of evidence required. The impact on a defendant who thus comes under the weight of the criminal justice system is considerable, as he or she is held up to public obloquy, with all the attendant repercussions on his or her reputation and private, family and professional life.

This public document, which the Government did not supply to the Court, sets out a systematic approach to solving the problem of the large number of pending war-crime cases. An order of priority was assigned to each case at national and regional levels, taking into consideration the seriousness of the offence, the number of victims and the degree of sensitivity, with the aim of systematically investigating the crimes in which the perpetrators had not been identified. Cases against those in command in the Sisak area were assigned national priority, and as a consequence V.M. was convicted. Meanwhile investigations into all war crimes have been continuing.",

It should be reiterated, in this connection, that the standard of expedition in such historical cases is very different from the standard applicable in respect of recent incidents, where time is often of the essence in preserving vital evidence at a scene and questioning witnesses while their memories are fresh and detailed (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey, [GC], nos. 16064/90 et al., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a019192, 18 September 2009; G\u00fcrtekin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22; Mujkanovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 41; Fazli\u0107\u00a0and Others, cited above, \u00a7 39; \u0160eremet, cited above, \u00a7 37; Muratspahi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 33; Demirovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 34; Zuban and Hamidovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 34; and \u017deraji\u0107 and Gojkovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 32). Nevertheless, many war criminals have already been brought to justice in Croatia. The prosecuting authorities, by 31\u00a0December 2012, had opened investigations in respect of a total of 3,436 alleged perpetrators and there had been 557 convictions (see paragraphs 38 and 64 of the judgment).",

During that period, the domestic authorities questioned more than 100 persons, issued indictments against three and finally convicted one of them. That being the case, the criminal investigation can be considered to have been conducted with reasonable promptness and expedition (compare for example Mujkanovi\u0107, cited above).",

However, we do not consider this factor sufficient in itself to conclude that the domestic criminal investigation was not independent at the material time. The fact that the efforts of that same police force resulted in the indictment of its former Deputy, who was subsequently convicted on the basis of the evidence collected by that same force (see paragraph 2 above), strongly indicates that the Sisak police had acted independently of its former heads, at least since 2002 (the time under consideration in this judgment).",
