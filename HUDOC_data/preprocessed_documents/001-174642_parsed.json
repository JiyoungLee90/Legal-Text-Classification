Furthermore, notwithstanding the generally worded allegations that the applicant had depended on his family for the provision of the relevant medical treatment, the applicant did not dispute the fact that the anti-TB treatment within the scope of the DOTS programme had been entirely conducted at the expense of the State. Therefore, it appears that the only issue which remains to be addressed in the current case is whether the treatment provided to the applicant was delayed and whether this in itself amounted to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see Jirs\u00e1k v.\u00a0the\u00a0Czech Republic, no. 8968/08, \u00a7 81, 5 April 2012, with further references therein).

The Government on their part asserted that the applicant had voiced his medical complaints only in January 2007 (see paragraph 21 above). According to the applicant\u2019s medical file, upon his transfer to the prison hospital, he claimed that he had started suffering from the relevant symptoms on 11 January 2007 (see paragraph 21 above). In the absence of any other evidence, the Court considers that the applicant voiced his medical complaints for the first time in January 2007. In such circumstances, the applicant\u2019s transfer to the prison hospital on 28 January 2007, albeit not immediate, cannot be considered to have been particularly delayed. The applicant had not yet been diagnosed with TB. Moreover, in response to his complaint he was immediately seen by a prison doctor and given basic anti-inflammatory medicine (see paragraph 23 above).",

Georgia, no. 23204/07, \u00a7\u00a7 10305, 3 March 2009; see also, Poghosyan v. Georgia, no. 9870/07, \u00a7\u00a069, 3 February 2009, and, mutatis mutandis, Jeladze, cited above, \u00a7 44). In the present case the applicant did not have a screening test for TB during the initial two and a half years of his detention. However, as is apparent from the case file, the applicant never voiced any TB-related ailments in the period concerned (compare Ildani, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, where despite his diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and reiterated requests for a proper medical check-up, the applicant was provided with TB examination only after a fifteen-month delay); nor did he complain about being placed in a cell with an inmate ill with TB (compare Vasyukov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a02974/05, \u00a7 68, 5 April 2011). The moment he raised his complaints, adequate medical examination was conducted followed by a diagnosis of TB.
