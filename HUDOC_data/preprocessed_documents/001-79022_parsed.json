However, with more particular reference to the specific category of cases involving the deportation of non-nationals, the Court has consistently held that an applicant cannot claim to be the \u201cvictim\u201d of a deportation measure if the measure is not enforceable (see Vijayanathan and Pusparajah, cited above, \u00a7 46; see also Pellumbi v.

However, it does not consider that their situation was substantially more uncertain than that of the applicants in most similar cases (see, in particular, the decisions in Pan\u010denko, Mikheyeva and Fjodorova and Others, cited above).

In the Court\u2019s view, this demonstrates that returning to  one day was an option they were prepared to consider. What is more, the applicants were undoubtedly aware that their conduct \u2013 for which, moreover, they were subsequently ordered to pay a fine \u2013 was in breach of the Latvian legislation of the time.

The Chamber accepted the Government\u2019s explanation that the main focus of the interview had been the allegation that Directorate officials had acted in a corrupt manner, rather than the proceedings brought by the applicants in Strasbourg. The Chamber also noted that the police officer in question had asked the first applicant several questions concerning her application, the relevance of which the Chamber failed to discern.

It appears also that the interview was in accordance with the national legislation, which authorises the security police to investigate corruption offences and to gather information from the individuals concerned (see paragraph 58 above). Accordingly, the Court accepts the Government\u2019s explanation that the main focus of the interview was the allegation that Directorate officials had acted in a corrupt manner, rather than the proceedings being pursued by the applicants before the Court (see, conversely, Fedotova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 49-50).",

Unlike the Government, who argued that the questions were justified by the requirements of the investigation, the Court has serious doubts as to their necessity and relevance, and has difficulty discerning a connection between acts of corruption allegedly committed by unidentified third parties and the present application. In that connection the Court reiterates that, even if a government has reason to believe that in a particular case the right of individual petition is being abused, the appropriate course of action is for that government to alert the Court and inform it of its misgivings (see Tanr\u0131kulu, cited above, \u00a7 131, and Orhan v. , no. 25656/94, \u00a7 409, 18 June 2002).

There is nothing in the case file to indicate that the Latvian authorities attempted to summon the applicant a second time (see, conversely, Ergi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 26-28 and 105).

On the contrary, the applicant\u2019s refusal to disclose the names of the allegedly corrupt officials was respected and did not entail any legal consequences for her. Furthermore, assuming the record of the conversation written by the first applicant to be accurate, the Court observes that the language used by the police officer was polite and did not contain any expressions, references or insinuations of a threatening or even a dissuasive nature (see, conversely, Petra, cited above, \u00a7 44).",
