In this respect, the Court notes that on 9 September 2005 the applicants claimed 20,917 sq. m and 41,834 sq. m of forest land respectively (see paragraph 12 above) and that those lands represented the areas to which they were entitled out of the total area which belonged to N.M., according to their inheritance quota of one-twelfth and two-twelfths respectively.
