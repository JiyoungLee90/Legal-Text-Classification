For all legal purposes, most of these entities were set up as entirely independent from the applicant, i.e. as belonging and being controlled by third persons, although their sole activity consisted of commissioning the applicant company to buy crude oil on their behalf from the company\u2019s own oil-producing subsidiaries and either putting it up for sale on the domestic market or abroad, or first handing it over to the company\u2019s own oil-processing plants and then selling it. There were no real cash transactions between the applicant company, its oil-processing and oil-producing subsidiaries and the trading entities, and the company\u2019s own promissory notes and mutual offsetting were used instead. All the money thus accumulated from sales was then transferred unilaterally to the \u201cFund for Financial Support of the Production Development of OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya YUKOS\u201d, a commercial entity founded, owned and run by the applicant company. Since at all relevant times the applicant company took part in all of the transactions of the trading companies, but acted as the companies\u2019 agent and never as an owner of the goods produced and processed by its own subsidiaries and since the compensation paid by the trading entities for its services was negligible, the applicant company\u2019s real turnover was never reflected in any tax documents and, consequently, in its tax returns.

In addition, under Law no. 1992-1 of 6\u00a0December 1991 \u201cOn value-added tax\u201d, in order to claim a refund of the VAT paid during export operations a taxpayer had to justify the claim in accordance with a special procedure and the applicant company had failed to apply for a refund either in 2000 or at any later date. As to the argument that the Ministry\u2019s claim was time-barred, the court refuted it with reference to Article\u00a0\u00a0113 of the Tax Code and Decision no. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of 21 July 2001. The court held that the rules on limitation periods were inapplicable in the case at issue as the applicant company had acted in bad faith. In response to the company\u2019s argument that the interdependency within the meaning of Article 20 of the Tax Code was only relevant for the purposes of price correction under Article 40 of the Code, the court observed that the interdependency of the sham companies and the applicant company was one of the circumstances on the basis of which the tax authorities had proved that the tax offence had been committed by the applicant company in bad faith.",

As a result of the initial stages of the merger, the applicant company acquired 92% of Sibneft: 20% of these shares were bought for cash, whilst 57.5% were exchanged for 17.2% of the applicant company\u2019s newly issued shares and 14.5% were swapped for 8.8% of the applicant company\u2019s existing shares.

In February 2004 the owners of Sibneft sued the applicant company in this connection, demanding cancellation of the operation whereby the applicant had issued 17.2% of shares. Among other things, on 14\u00a0February 2004 they obtained an attachment order in respect of the Sibneft shares remaining in the possession of the applicant company pending the proceedings. On 1 March 2004 the City Court decided to cancel the issue of 17.2% shares by the applicant company. The Government submitted that it was clear from the above-mentioned account that on 22 April 2004, the date on which the applicant company first made the offer of Sibneft shares, the owners of Sibneft already anticipated suing the applicant company again, this time demanding back the 57.5% of Sibneft shares swapped for the cancelled 17.2% of the applicant company\u2019s shares.

They argued that, under the applicable domestic law, the seizure should be made first in respect of the cash-flow and then, under section 46 (5) of the Enforcement Proceedings, it would be open to the bailiffs to assess and seize the assets depending on their liquidity. They countered the applicant company\u2019s arguments by saying that the latter\u2019s references were invalid in that they related to the other stage of enforcement proceedings (the collection of debt and not the seizure as such). Furthermore, they argued that Ruling no. 4 of the Plenum of the  was inapplicable since, in the case of Yuganskneftegas, the State had transferred only 38% of the shares and not a controlling block. With regard to the offer of Sibneft stock, the Ministry and bailiffs argued that the applicant company\u2019s rights in respect of these shares had been contested in separate sets of court proceedings and it was therefore risky to accept them as a payment. Lastly, they informed the court that the applicant company had recently hidden the shareholder registers of its three major subsidiaries, OAO Yuganskneftegas, OAO Samaraneftegas and OAO Tomskneft, which, in their view, demonstrated the risk of possible asset-stripping by the applicant company.",

In respect of the company\u2019s request to recalculate automatically the export VAT on operations conducted by the sham entities in the course of these proceedings, the court noted the request was unsubstantiated and also lodged out of time. In particular, the company had failed to submit a proper claim with monthly calculations and evidence that the goods in question had indeed been exported. The court also addressed the applicant company\u2019s argument that Article\u00a075\u00a0(3) of the Tax Code prevented the authorities from levying the interest surcharges. It noted that the provision in question only applied to cases in which the sole reason for the taxpayer\u2019s inability to pay tax debts was the seizure of its assets and cash funds. On the facts, the applicant company was unable to pay because it had insufficient funds and not because its assets were frozen. The court concluded that the applicant company\u2019s argument was unfounded. The court also reduced the amount of additional taxes to be paid to RUB 86,221,835,476.37 (EUR 2,399,884,085) and the amount of fines to RUB 68,918,264,491 (EUR 1,918,259,397). The amount of interest surcharges was reduced accordingly. The exact figure of the interest surcharges to be paid by the applicant is unclear.",

It alleged that the disclosure did not occur until 17 May 2004, when the Ministry filed 24,000 pages of documents, and continued on 18 May 2004 with approximately 45,000 further pages and a further 2,000 pages late on 20 May 2004, i.e. on the eve of the first-instance hearing. The company conceded that its representatives had indeed been given access to all these materials, both prior to the hearings and during the trial, but submitted that the manner and time for such access had been so unsatisfactory that it was of no practical use. It also argued that it had been unable effectively to access the court\u2019s filed documents during the first-instance hearings except during the lunch breaks. Overall, the company insisted that it had had insufficient time to prepare its defence and familiarise itself with the evidence before the court and that it had not had an opportunity to take cognisance of and comment on all of the evidence adduced or observations filed, nor to express its views on every document in the file, contrary to Article 6. It referred to the Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain and Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 v. Czech Republic cases. In their post-admissibility observations the company submitted that the Ministry had had sufficient time to disclose the evidence, as the relevant documents had been in the possession of the Ministry and that the Ministry could have disclosed them at any point from 8\u00a0December 2003 (some six months before the beginning of the hearing). It further noted that the documents filed by the Ministry had been in complete disorder and had been stored in nineteen plastic crates (ten of them containing six thousand pages each and nine more containing some four thousand pages each) and simply could not be studied properly over such a short period. The documents were kept in a room measuring three to four square metres and containing two chairs, a desk and one window. A request for additional space had been turned down. The above-mentioned conditions were reflected in a record dated 18 May 2004, drawn up by the applicant company\u2019s counsel. The Ministry\u2019s representative had refused to sign it and stated that he disagreed with its contents. More generally, the applicant company criticised the Ministry for bringing an action against it before the expiry of the grace period and argued that the first instance proceedings had been unfair because its lawyers could not obtain from the Ministry answers to all the questions they wished to ask in the hearings and that it was under the impression that the first-instance court had pronounced judgment without having studied all the evidence.",

It submitted that the domestic courts had failed to address the question of whether the abridgement of time had affected its substantive right to a fair hearing and that, equally, it did not rely on Article 267 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, referred to by the respondent Government. Also, the rule in Article 267 requiring an appeal to be determined within one month is not respected in practice by the Russian courts; failure to comply with this requirement, even for a whole year, has no consequences for the proceedings. There was, according to the applicant company, no evidence of any particular urgency in listing or resolving the appeal: neither the Ministry, nor the co-appellant, OOO \u2018YUKOS\u2019 Moscow, sought expedition when their appeals were lodged and the co-appellant did not oppose the applicant company\u2019s applications to adjourn the appeal hearing. In response to the Government\u2019s criticism suggesting that the company\u2019s appeal was misaddressed by the omission of part of the postal code from the envelope, the applicant stated that no evidence had been provided of any mistake in this respect and that, after all, the appeal had been received by the court and the tax authorities. In any event, the court had made no criticism of the company in relation to the exercise of this appeal. Overall, the abridgement of the appeal period was a serious interference with the company\u2019s right to prepare for the appeal hearings, which failed to cure but rather accentuated the unfairness of the first-instance proceedings, and no substantive reason has been offered as to why this acceleration was lawful, necessary or consistent with the requirements of a fair trial.",

In the company\u2019s view, such a valid appeal was strictly dependent on filing of the reasons by the appeal court. The appeal decision had become subject to immediate forcible execution, the company had become liable for an additional surcharge of 7% of the total liability and the opportunity to exercise an effective appeal against these measures had been circumvented.",

The applicant company had at least 37 days to prepare its defence from the date of the filing of the suit, which, in view of the above time-limit, had not been unreasonable. Furthermore, the applicant company first became aware of the Ministry\u2019s arguments on 29 December 2003, when the Ministry issued the report indicating the applicant company\u2019s large tax liability and by 12 January 2004 the company had also filed its objections to the report under Article\u00a0100\u00a0(5) of the Tax Code. Moreover, the principal arguments contained in these objections remained unchanged throughout the proceedings. It could not be said therefore that the applicant company was unprepared to state its case, since it was well aware of the Ministry\u2019s arguments five months prior to the beginning of the court proceedings. In addition, the Government pointed out that the applicant company\u2019s lawyers were given an opportunity to study the evidence both in court and at the Ministry\u2019s premises throughout May, June and July 2004. According to the documents submitted by the Government, counsel for the applicant company availed themselves of this opportunity at least on two occasions, on 18 and 19 May 2004 respectively. Lastly, the Government argued that the applicant company\u2019s arguments about insufficient time for the preparation of the case had been carefully examined and eventually dismissed by the domestic courts as unfounded. In their post-admissibility observations the Government also submitted that the proceedings before commercial courts in Russia were generally conducted without serious delays (referring, for instance, to the lack of any cases against  on account of length of proceedings before the commercial courts). They further argued that in its submissions the applicant company had asserted generalities and had never mentioned any specific documents to which they had not had proper access. The evidence in question had been documents which were well known to the applicant company, as the Ministry had requested these documents from it during the on-site inspection (the Government relied on Article 101 (2) 4 of the Tax Code in this respect) and that the documents had been itemised in a register dated 17\u00a0May 2004 no.\u00a014-3-02/22-13-1 and had been copies of original documentation reflecting the relations between the applicant company and its sham entities. In addition, the Government argued that any number of the company\u2019s lawyers could have come to study the evidence and that the applicant company had apparently felt no need to do so, since it had been represented by eight lawyers in the first-instance proceedings and only two to four of them had studied the documents. Overall, the Government suggested that the dispute was more legal rather than factual, so that the crux of the applicant company\u2019s objections concerned the interpretation of the domestic law rather than controversy about the particular circumstances of the tax evasion. In addition, the Government argued that the appeal hearing constituted a de novo examination of the case and that by then the applicant company had had a perfectly adequate opportunity to review the documentary record.

The applicant company had brought appeal proceedings against the first-instance judgment of 26 May 2004: the possibility of review on both points of fact and law had been expressly provided for by Russian law (Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure) and the company had used it. Under Article 267 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, which requires an appeal court to examine the appeals by the parties within a month of the date on which they were filed, the Appeal Court had to examine the case within a month of 1 June 2004, which was the date on which one party to the case, OOO \u2018YUKOS\u2019 Moskva, first lodged an appeal brief, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant company lodged its appeal on 17 June 2004. The appeal hearings, which represented a full re-trial of the case within the meaning of Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, started on 18 June and lasted eight days, that is, until 29 June 2004, which was in line with the above rule. In addition, the applicant company deliberately delayed the examination of the case by dispatching the appeal brief to an erroneous address. Lastly, the Government underlined that the appeal decision had not been final and had been appealed against by the applicant company both in cassation instance and by way of supervisory review. The Government submitted that the fact that the reasoned copy of the Appeal Court decision of 29 June 2004 had been produced on 9 July 2004 did not affect the fairness of the proceedings as, in any event, it was open to the applicant company to lodge its cassation appeal within a two-month time-limit from the date of delivery of the appeal decision on 29 June 2004, even in the absence of the reasoned copy of the decision. The applicant company had lodged its cassation appeal on 6 July 2004 in the absence of the reasoned copy of the appeal decision. The cassation appeal was accepted for consideration and on 17 September 2004 its full version was examined and dismissed by the Circuit Court.",

The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will get a real opportunity to comment on them (see Brandstetter v.\u00a0Austria, 28\u00a0August 1991, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 67, Series A no. 211; Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain, 23\u00a0June 1993, \u00a7 67, Series A no. 262; mutatis mutandis, Milatov\u00e1 and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 61811/00, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2005V and, a fortiori, Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 and Others v. the , no. 35376/97, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45, 3\u00a0March\u00a02000). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 3 (b) guarantees \u201cadequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence\u201d and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on the accused\u2019s behalf may comprise everything which is \u201cnecessary\u201d to prepare the trial. The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the possibility to put all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings (see Can v. Austria, no.\u00a09300/81, \u00a7 53, Commission\u2019s report of 12\u00a0July 1984, Series\u00a0A no. 96, and Moiseyev\u00a0v.\u00a0, no. 62936/00, \u00a7\u00a0220, 9\u00a0October\u00a02008). The facilities which should be enjoyed by everyone charged with a criminal offence include the opportunity to acquaint himself, for the purposes of preparing his defence, with the results of investigations carried out throughout the proceedings (see C.G.P. v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29835/96, 15 January 1997, and Galstyan v.

It is clear to the Court that in order to provide the applicant company with an adversarial trial and \u201cadequate time and facilities for the preparation of [its] defence\u201d the applicant company should have been given an adequate opportunity to study the entirety of these documents and, more generally, to prepare for the hearings of the merits of the case on reasonable terms.",

As regards the Government\u2019s reference to the applicant company\u2019s conduct during the proceedings and its argument that the company had no real need to study that evidence, the Court finds that it was incumbent on the trial court in the situation at hand to ensure that the applicant company had a sufficiently long period of time during which it could study such a voluminous case file and prepare for the trial hearings and it was up to the applicant company to use this time as it wished. As regards the Government\u2019s argument that the trial court was simply doing its best to comply with the two-month time-limit set out in Article 215 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure for examination of cases of this category, the Court is of the view that even though it is no doubt important to conduct proceedings at good speed, this should not be done at the expense of the procedural rights of one of the parties, especially given the relatively short overall duration of the proceedings for a case of such magnitude and complexity.",

In this respect, the Court observes that the immediate enforcement of the appeal decision did not prevent the company from lodging its cassation appeal and whilst Article 6 provides an applicant with the right of access to court, it does not guarantee, as such, the right to an automatic stay of enforcement of an unfavourable court decision. The Court would underline that the applicant company in the present case had access to courts of two levels of jurisdiction before any enforcement measures were taken and that the enforcement of the appeal decision of 29\u00a0June 2004 did not make it impossible for the applicant company to exercise its right to appeal in cassation, or to pursue further proceedings by way of supervisory review or before the Constitutional Court. The applicant company lodged its cassation appeal and additional submissions on the basis of the reasoned copy of the appeal decision of 29 June 2004 on 7 July 2004 (see paragraph 67). The appeal was accepted for consideration, and on 17\u00a0September 2004 its full version was examined and dismissed by the Circuit Court (see paragraph 70). Not only the cassation appeal, but also the request to stay the enforcement of the appeal decision of 29 June 2004 were examined by the domestic courts at two instances and eventually dismissed as unfounded (see paragraphs 127-129).",

Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7\u00a058, ECHR 1999II). This means that the interference should be in compliance with the domestic law and that the law itself be of sufficient quality to enable an applicant to foresee the consequence of his or her conduct. As regards the compliance with the domestic law, the Court has limited power in this respect since it is a matter which primarily lies within the competence of the domestic courts (see H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson\u00a0v.\u00a0Sweden, 21 February 1990, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 171A, and, mutatis mutandis, Tre Trakt\u00f6rer AB v. Sweden, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 159). As regards the quality of the law, the Court\u2019s task is to verify whether the applicable provisions of domestic law were sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable (see Hentrich v. France, 22 September 1994, \u00a7\u00a042, Series A no. 296-A, and Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1986, \u00a7\u00a042, Series A no. 110). In so far as the tax sphere is concerned, the Court\u2019s well-established position is that States may be afforded some degree of additional deference and latitude in the exercise of their fiscal functions under the lawfulness test (see National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom, 23 October 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 75-83, Reports 1997VII) and that, in view of the complexity of the relevant field of regulation, corporate entities, as opposed to individual taxpayers, may be required to act with additional caution and diligence by consulting competent specialists in this sphere (see \u0160pa\u010dek, s.r.o.,\u00a0v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a026449/95, \u00a7\u00a059, 9 November 1999).",

In response to the argument raised by the applicant company during the court proceedings, the lower courts decided that the rules on a statutory time-bar were inapplicable because the applicant company had been acting in bad faith (see paragraph 49). Thereafter the supervisory review instance decided that such an interpretation of the rules on the statutory time-limits had not been in line with the existing legislation and case-law (see paragraph 80) and referred the issue to the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court, which, in turn, referred it to the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 81).",

While it prohibits, in particular, extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused\u2019s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with appropriate legal assistance, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see Co\u00ebme and Others v.

The Court has acknowledged in its case-law that however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances.

As regards the attribution of tax liabilities, the applicant company considered that Russian law contained no provisions that permitted piercing of the corporate veil in order to hold one company liable for the actions of another, whether the latter was a subsidiary, an affiliate or a separate entity. The company claimed that the legal theories used by the Ministry in its tax assessment cases had been unprecedented and it referred to legal remedies that could have been used by the Ministry in this situation but had not been employed. In particular, the applicant company argued that the authorities should have applied the anti-transfer pricing mechanism of Articles 20 and 40 of the Tax Code or that the courts should have invalidated individual transactions by the trading companies so as to make either them or the applicant company\u2019s subsidiaries liable for the allegedly underpaid tax. The applicant company considered that in any event, under the applicable domestic law, the authorities could not have held it directly liable for the actions of the trading companies. Furthermore, the company relied on Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code to justify the unilateral transfers of cash from the trading companies to the applicant company\u2019s Fund.

Lastly, the applicant company considered that the Government\u2019s explanations in this connection and in particular its reference to Articles 168, 169 and 170 of the Civil Code could not justify the authorities\u2019 actions in the tax assessment proceedings, since these provisions had not been relied upon by the domestic courts.",

In addition, the Government referred to an \u201cinternal\u201d opinion by the audit company PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which specifically mentioned various problems with the applicant company\u2019s \u201ctax optimisation\u201d scheme, including the Fund used by the company for receiving the money generated by the sham entities, and mentioned by the  in its decision of 29\u00a0June 2004. This was in breach of the Russian legislation, as money could only be transferred from one independent commercial entity to another independent commercial entity in exchange or payment for services or goods (Article 575 of the Civil Code). In addition, the company misled the public in its reports and financial statements. For example, in February 2004 in its report for nine months of the year 2003 under the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles standards, the company accounted for the difference between the nominal profit tax rate and the actual rate by its use of affiliate companies registered in foreign tax havens. This statement was not true since, as established by the domestic courts, the applicant company used sham entities located in domestic tax havens. The widespread use of promissory notes was also mentioned by the auditor as being non-compliant with the legislation in force.

In an interview with the Raschyot magazine of 30\u00a0January 2001, he stated that, as time passed, any widely replicated optimisation scheme became known to the tax authorities and they started fighting it.

In such instances the court would rule that the location of the organisation was  and not Kalmykiya. The scheme would be ruined and the company be forced to pay in . However, there could be more subtle schemes, where everything was arranged in such a way that the director, accountant and some staff were in Kalmykiya and there was an account in a Kalmyk bank, [and] thus the organisation would appear to have an actual presence there. Certainly, business would be conducted in  but through another company, so that the entire profit went through appropriate contracts to Kalmykiya.

These companies, with no assets, employees or operations of their own, were nominally owned and managed by third parties, although in reality they were set up and run by the applicant company itself. In essence, the applicant company\u2019s oil-producing subsidiaries sold the extracted oil to the letter-box companies at a fraction of the market price. The letter-box companies, acting in cascade, then sold the oil either abroad, this time at market price or to the applicant company\u2019s refineries and subsequently re-bought it at a reduced price and re-sold it at the market price. Thus, the letter-box companies accumulated most of the applicant company\u2019s profits. Since they were registered in domestic low-tax areas, they enabled the applicant company to pay substantially lower taxes in respect of these profits. Subsequently, the letter-box companies transferred the accumulated profits unilaterally to the applicant company as gifts. The Court observes that substantial tax reductions were only possible through the mixed use and simultaneous application of at least two different techniques. The applicant company used the method of transfer pricing, which consisted of selling the goods from its production division to its marketing companies at intentionally lowered prices and the use of sham entities registered in the domestic regions with low taxation levels and nominally owned and run by third persons (see paragraphs 14-18, 48, 62-63 for a more detailed description).",

This being so, the Court cannot accept the applicant company\u2019s argument that the letter-box entities had been entitled to the tax exemptions in questions. For the same reason, the Court dismisses the applicant company\u2019s argument that all the constituent members of the Yukos group had made regular tax declarations and had applied regularly for tax refunds and that the authorities were thus aware of the functioning of the arrangement. The tax authorities may have had access to scattered pieces of information about the functioning of separate parts of the arrangement, located across the country, but, given the scale and fraudulent character of the arrangement, they certainly could not have been aware of the arrangement in its entirety on the sole basis on the tax declarations and requests for tax refunds made by the trading companies, the applicant company and its subsidiaries.",

In this connection, the Court finds relevant the warning given by the company\u2019s auditor about the implications of the use of the company\u2019s special fund during the year 2002 (see paragraphs 206-209) and is not persuaded by the applicant company\u2019s reference to case no.

This was made clear not only by Article\u00a010\u00a0(3) of the Civil Code relied on by the domestic courts in the Tax Assessment proceedings, but also by other relevant and applicable statutory provisions which were available to the applicant company and other taxpayers at the time. Thus, Article 45 (2) 3 of the Tax Code explicitly provided the domestic courts with the power to change the legal characterisation of transactions and also the legal characterisation of the status and activity of the taxpayer, whilst section 7 of the Law on the Tax Authorities of the Russian Federation granted the right to contest such transactions to the tax authorities (see paragraph 393). In addition, the case-law referred to by the Government indicated that the power to re-characterise or to cancel bad faith activities of companies existed and had been used by the domestic courts in diverse contexts and with varying consequences for the parties concerned since as early as 1997 (see paragraphs 382-393 and paragraphs 428-468).

On the facts, the former provision only applied to cases where the taxpayer was unable to pay the tax debt solely due to the seizure of its assets and cash funds (see paragraph 402).

The applicant company could have had the injunction lifted had it provided adequate counter-security, which it failed to do, or liquidated some of its foreign assets not covered by the injunction. The Government maintained that instead of selling its foreign assets to meet its tax debts the applicant company simply stripped them away, which in itself proved that the company\u2019s complaint about the injunction was unsubstantiated.

The company could still dispose of cash added to its frozen accounts after 30\u00a0June 2004 and could use its non-seized accounts abroad. The funds in these accounts had been far lower than the company\u2019s then liabilities.

The first three offers, made on 22 April, 2 July and 13-14 July 2004, all involved various portions of shares of OAO Sibneft, allegedly owned by the applicant company. All three offers were rejected, not only because the company\u2019s ownership of these shares had been contested in various unrelated proceedings by third persons, but also because the offers had been made in violation of injunctions issued by the courts in the above-mentioned unrelated proceedings. In fact, the sale of shares that did belong to the applicant company (some 20%) would have been insufficient to cover the company\u2019s then debt, even in part, let alone satisfy the Ministry\u2019s upcoming claims for the years 2001-2003. It was a minority stake of uncertain value and any such value was in any event insufficient to satisfy the company\u2019s tax arrears. As regards the fourth offer, dated 9\u00a0August 2004, it involved 20% of OAO Sibneft and a farrago of shares in fifteen companies (some of them subsidiaries, some of them minority stakes and all of uncertain liquidity).

Under section 54 (2) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, the sale of the applicant company\u2019s property was made by a specialised organisation pursuant to the terms of commission and the relevant legislation. On 18\u00a0November 2004 the bailiffs decided to sell 43 shares (76.8%) of OAO Yuganskneftegaz at auction. The Government noted that OAO Yuganskneftegaz was itself the debtor in mandatory payments to the budget totalling RUB 102.09 billion, so that the above arrears inevitably affected the price of the auctioned shares, as defined by the valuation institution and the results of the auction. The date of the auction and invitation to participate in the open auction were published in the mass media in due time. The auction itself was open, both with regard to its participants and to the form of submissions of price bids. Bids were received between 19\u00a0November and 18\u00a0December 2004. On 19 December 2004 the open auction took place. The winner of the auction was recognised as OOO Baykalfinancegrup, which offered RUB\u00a0260,753,447,303.18 for the shares in question. The auction itself was public. The mass media representatives provided extensive media coverage. The results were published in the mass media and broadcast. With regard to the proportionality of the sale, the sum of 260.5 billion roubles generated as a result of the sale did not, however, cover the arrears of OAO Yukos entirely. The Government also underlined that the subsequent bankruptcy was not caused by the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, but had been initiated by a consortium of foreign banks and that the representatives of the applicant company had allegedly acknowledged that the company had been in good financial condition even despite the sale of OAO Yuganksneftegaz.

Nonetheless, the Court is of the view that, notwithstanding these constraints, the bailiffs still had a decisive freedom of choice, the exercise of which could either keep the company afloat or eventually lead to its demise. Although the Court, in principle, does not find the choice of OAO Yuganskneftegaz entirely unreasonable, especially in view of the overall amount of the tax-related debt and the pending as well as probable claims against the company, it is of the view that before definitively selecting for sale the asset that was the company\u2019s only hope of survival, the authorities should have given very serious consideration to other options, especially those that could mitigate the damage to the applicant company\u2019s structure. This was particularly so since all of the company\u2019s domestic assets had been attached by previous court orders (see paragraph ), and were readily available, the company itself did not seem to have objected to their sale (see paragraph ) and there had been virtually no risk of the company seriously opposing these actions.",

The applicant company was subjected to a 7% enforcement fee in connection with the entire amount of its tax-related liability, which constituted an additional hefty sum of over RUB 43 billion (EUR 1.16 billion), the payment of which could not be suspended or rescheduled (see paragraphs -). This was a flat-rate fee which the authorities apparently refused to reduce, and these sums had to be paid even before the company could begin repaying the main body of the debt (see paragraph ). The fee was by its nature unrelated to the actual amount of the enforcement expenses borne by the bailiffs. Whilst the Court may accept that there is nothing wrong as a matter of principle with requiring a debtor to pay for the expenses relating to the enforcement of a debt or to threaten a debtor with a sanction to incite his or her voluntary compliance with enforcement writs, in the circumstances of the case the resulting sum was completely out of proportion to the amount of the enforcement expenses which could have possibly been expected to be borne or had actually been borne by the bailiffs. Because of its rigid application, instead of inciting voluntary compliance, it contributed very seriously to the applicant company\u2019s demise.",

Admittedly, this rigidity may have resulted at least in part from the relevant requirements of the domestic law (see paragraphs 471, 481 and 489). Nevertheless, the Court finds that in the circumstances of the case such lack of flexibility had a negative overall effect on the conduct of the enforcement proceedings against the applicant company.",

Despite the fact that it found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention on account of the speed with which the courts had conducted the proceedings in the 2000 Tax Assessment case and a violation of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the interference by the Constitutional Court with the outcome of the 2000 Tax Assessment case in the part relating to penalties, the Court rejected the applicant company\u2019s claims that the company\u2019s debt had been recognised as a result of an unforeseeable, unlawful and arbitrary interpretation of the domestic law (see paragraphs  and 616). The Court also recognised the right of the State to enforce, as such, the court judgments, but reached conclusions concerning the handling of the enforcement proceedings by the domestic authorities which lead to the finding of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In view of these findings, the Court will proceed on the assumption that the company\u2019s debt in the enforcement proceedings resulted from legitimate actions by the respondent Government to counter the company\u2019s tax evasion and the burden of proof would accordingly rest on the applicant company to substantiate its allegations.",

At the moment when the events under consideration occurred, Latvian criminal legislation did not contain any explicit provisions regarding military crimes; moreover, it stipulated general and special limitation periods for criminal liability. Those limitation periods had expired long before the beginning of the criminal proceedings against Kononov. In 1993 the provisions on limitation periods were abolished by a Latvian legislative act. Nevertheless, the ECHR held that serviceman Kononov, who, unlike the applicant in the present case, had no real opportunity to apply to consult legal advisers, relying on a combination of various international conventions and legal customs (including certain that were not officially promulgated) could have foreseen that his conduct might be qualified as a military crime. In this the ECHR was also not troubled by the fact that the limitation period set out in national legislation for any type of crime at the time when Kononov committed the alleged offence (1944) had expired several decades before Kononov was brought to trial in 2000 (see Kononov v.

Thus, after the disposal of OAO YNG stocks the funds raised were still insufficient to settle the tax and penalties debt owed to the State budget. The reacquisition (redemption) price was assessed by an independent international appraiser (Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, the investment branch of Dresdner Bank AG), and on the basis of the auction itself. As noted by the Court, before the enforcement proceedings were initiated, the company was probably in a state of pre-insolvency (\u00a7 649), which is proved, particularly, by the fact that the company informed the US Bankruptcy Court of its intention to file a voluntary petition for bankruptcy long before the auction (\u00a7 252). It appears from the case-file that a certain amount of assets was being rapidly transferred abroad. In such circumstances it cannot be ruled out that further procrastination and/or a decision to seize less liquid assets would have significantly reduced the Government\u2019s chances of obtaining payment of the taxes and penalties. The only possible alternative, which was offered by the company itself, was to dispose of OAO Sibneft stocks instead of the stocks in OAO YNG.

Indeed, the  in its Judgment \u2116 13-P of 30 July 2001 (\u00a7\u00a0485), clearly stated that the enforcement fee is a type of administrative penalty and is not designed for compensation of enforcement expenses.

It is also worth considering that it was not the business assets of OAO YNG that were disposed of in the auction in question, but a controlling block of stocks.

A substitution of the controlling stakeholder is not a legal ground for amendment or termination of commercial contracts, unless the latter explicitly provides otherwise. The case-file does not contain any reliable evidence that OAO YNG breached or failed to perform any of its contractual obligations to Yukos, and the latter made no claims to that effect.",

An exception is made for cases in which the rigidity of the liability imposed on the applicant verges toward a criminal sanction.

A brief overview of the relevant \u201cfor and against\u201d practice is set out in the joint partly dissenting opinion of Judges Costa, Cabral Barreto and Mularoni, joined by judge Caflisch, in the case of Jussila v.

In both of those cases the judgments were delivered on the basis of applications from physical persons, not a commercial company. In both Finland and the United Kingdom (and in many other European countries), unlike as in , criminal liability of legal entities is not excluded. Although the Convention\u2019s protection extends to the rights of legal entities, one of the four named criteria is qualification of the tax violation as a criminal offence under national legislation.

The Court considered that, inasmuch as the parties in both cases were not identical the cases were substantially different (see \u00a7 526 of the judgment). Such a formal approach in the case at hand can hardly be accepted. In its arguments, the Court refers to a series of benchmarks developed in the ECHR\u2019s case-law to distinguish different cases depending on the substantive nature of their respective similarities and divergences (the parties to the dispute, the substance and legal grounds of the redress sought, etc. - \u00a7 521). Yet in distinguishing between the cases under examination, the Court applied only the criterion of the parties to the respective proceedings. In this case, however, that criterion alone is insufficient to conclude that the cases are substantially distinct, irrespective of the fact that the legal entities acting as applicants in the two sets of proceedings are not formally identical.",
