Yet, the mere fact that neither the applicant nor his counsel had had the opportunity to cross-examine R.K. did not automatically constitute a breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention. It was decisive whether the proceedings in their entirety, including the manner in which evidence had been taken and assessed, had been fair. Where the lack of an opportunity to cross-examine a witness had been a result of procedural errors imputable on the judiciary, as in the present case, the Court found a breach of the Convention where the conviction had been based to a decisive extent on the evidence of the untested witness. A conviction could thus only be based on untested evidence where it was corroborated by other significant factors independent of that evidence. In the present case, the applicant\u2019s conviction could be based on R.K.\u2019s statements as reported by the investigating judge, for they were corroborated by other significant factors independent of them.",

It concludes that the criminal proceedings against the applicant, viewed in their entirety, were not rendered unfair by the admission as evidence of the statement by the untested witness R.K., as reported by the investigating judge.",
