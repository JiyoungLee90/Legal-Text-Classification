The Constitutional Court held that such an extension was only possible if there still existed \u201csufficient grounds to believe\u201d that the accused might abscond during the investigation or trial, reoffend or otherwise obstruct the establishment of the truth, as provided by Article 97 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In so far as the challenged provision did not set a specific time-limit for holding the defendant in custody while he studied the case file, the Constitutional Court considered that it allowed for the possibility of determining such a time-limit for each particular case, depending on its specific features, on condition that the grounds for detention established in Article\u00a097 had been sufficiently confirmed. The court concluded that the challenged provision could not be interpreted as providing for superfluous or unlimited detention. Neither did it deprive the defendant and his counsel of the right to challenge before a higher court the lawfulness and validity of the extension order, as well as to make an application for lifting or altering the custodial measure.",

It relied on Article 109 \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The parties disagreed on whether such repeated extensions were permitted under the applicable provisions of the domestic law. The Court has already examined a similar situation in the Korchuganova v.\u00a0Russia case, in which it had regard to the interpretation given by the Russian Constitutional Court of the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u00a7 51, case cited above). The Court noted that, according to the Constitutional Court\u2019s binding clarifications of 13 June 1996 and 25 December 1998 (cited in paragraphs 41 and 42 above), in the absence of an express legal provision for repeated extensions of detention on the ground that the defendant has not finished studying the file, the granting of such repeated applications for extension of the defendant\u2019s detention was not permitted by law and incompatible with the guarantee against arbitrary detention. The restrictive interpretation adopted by the Constitutional Court is consonant with the requirements of Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see, among others, Sherstobitov v. Russia, no.\u00a016266/03, \u00a7 113, 10 June 2010; Shukhardin v. Russia, no. 65734/01, \u00a7\u00a067, 28 June 2007; Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no. 55669/00, \u00a7 79, 2 March 2006; and Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 142).",

The adoption of a new Code of Criminal Procedure in 2003 did not affect the validity or applicability of the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law and the text of new Article 109 closely followed that of the former Article 97. The Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 19\u00a0March 2009, to which the Government referred, did not alter the Constitutional Court\u2019s position [...]. The courts of general jurisdiction in the instant case, and the Government in their submissions before the Court, adopted an extensive interpretation of Article 109, claiming that, in the absence of an express prohibition on multiple extensions on the same ground, the competent court should remain free to grant as many extensions as it considered appropriate in the circumstances of the case. However, neither the domestic courts nor the Government were able to show that the new Article 109 contained an express provision for repeated extensions of the detention period for this purpose. It follows that their extensive interpretation of this provision sat ill with the restrictive interpretation adopted by the  and was incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 of the Convention.

The domestic court took into consideration the gravity and the nature of the charges against the defendants, the reasonableness of the suspicion justifying the placement of each defendant in custody, the risks of the defendants interfering with the course of the proceedings by absconding, exerting pressure on victims and witnesses and reoffending. The court also took into account the time each defendant had already spent in custody, personal data in respect of each defendant, and the possibility of applying a more lenient preventive measure. The existence of the risk that the applicant would put pressure on witnesses and victims was demonstrated by reference to statements by prosecution witness Yezh. and co-defendant S., the application of safety measures in respect of certain witnesses, questioning of certain witnesses under pseudonyms and in conditions keeping them invisible to the applicant and co-defendants, the fact that the defendants breached the court order during the questioning of certain prosecution witnesses and that during the trial some witnesses changed their testimony in respect of the applicant and two other co-defendants. As regards the risk of absconding and reoffending, the domestic court relied on the fact that criminal proceedings were instituted against other suspected members of the criminal group who had not yet been found and arrested, and that the applicant and other detained co-defendants had not been working anywhere for a long time before their arrest. The domestic court further referred to the big volume of the case involving multiple episodes and numerous participants.

It reiterates in this respect that in cases involving numerous defendants, collecting evidence is often a difficult task, as it is necessary to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the co-suspects (see Yudayev v. , no. 40258/03, \u00a7\u00a072, 15\u00a0January 2009).

To this end, when extending the applicant\u2019s detention pending the study of the case material the domestic court should have on each occasion verified whether any further detention for that purpose continued to be reasonable.
