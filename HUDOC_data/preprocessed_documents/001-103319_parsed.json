However, what may be regarded as \"reasonable\" will depend upon all the circumstances of the particular case (see Fox,\u00a0Campbell and Hartley, cited above, \u00a7\u00a032). The Court further reiterates that facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction, or even the bringing of a charge which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 29 November 1988, Series\u00a0A no. 145-B, p. 29, \u00a7 53, and Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300-A, p. 27, \u00a7 55.",

The Court further notes that this \u201cinvestigative information\u201d was corroborated by S.F.'s criminal complaint, which would have been sufficient of itself to justify the applicant's arrest under national law. In this connection, the Court recalls that in Labita v.  [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2000IV, it recognised that a suspect may validly be detained at the beginning of proceedings on the basis of statements made by an informer (pentiti). Similarly, the Court found in O'Hara v. the , no. 37555/97, ECHR 2001X that information passed on at a police briefing by informers who identified the applicant as one of a number of persons suspected of involvement in a specific terrorist event was sufficient to raise a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed a criminal offence. The Court therefore considers that there was sufficiently specific information in the present case to raise a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed an offence. Accordingly, this part of the applicant's application must be declared inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

Italy, no. 44955/98, \u00a7\u00a024, ECHR 2001-IX). However, this was in cases where the period of detention was not laid down by statute but ended as a result of a court order. The Court has been stricter in cases where the authorities were under a statutory requirement to release the applicant after a fixed period of time as in the present case. The Court thus found in K.-F. v. Germany (judgment of 27\u00a0November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p.\u00a02675, \u00a7\u00a071) that a delay of 45\u00a0minutes in releasing an applicant, when the statutory maximum period of detention was twelve hours, was in breach of Article 5 of the Convention. The Court held that since the maximum period of detention was known in advance, the authorities responsible for the detention were under a duty to take all necessary precautions to ensure that the permitted duration was not exceeded.",

As the investigating judge did not order the applicant's detention before 4 p.m., the applicant's detention had no legal basis between 12.15 p.m. and 4 p.m. The Court notes however that the prosecution lodged their request to remand the applicant in custody within the required time-limit. The Court further observes that the applicant was required to attend, and attended, the remand hearing from 12.45 p.m. until 4 p.m. before the investigating judge. The applicant was therefore only materially affected by the delay in release between 12.15 p.m. and 12.45\u00a0p.m., i.e. 30 minutes. In these circumstances, where the application for an extension had been lodged within the relevant time-limit, the hearing was imminent and there was only a short delay during which the detention had no legal basis, the Court considers that the present case can be distinguished from K.-F. v. , cited above.

It is true that the domestic courts considered whether the applicant had a permanent address in Moldova and that there was conflicting evidence on this issue.
