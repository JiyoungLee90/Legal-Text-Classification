It was not disputed that the period of fifteen days had begun to run 17\u00a0July 2003, when the registry of the Ciocana District Court had informed the public prosecutor\u2019s office that the reasoned judgment had been filed with the registry.

Even assuming that the preferential treatment accorded to the public prosecutor was justified in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the Court would highlight the lack of any regulations or judicial practice limiting the use of such an extension. The Court observes that in the Platakou judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045-48), concerning an administrative dispute, it held that the fact that time ceased to run against the State during the period of the judicial vacation contravened the principle of equality of arms. Having regard to what was at stake for the applicant in the appeal in the present case and reiterating that in the sphere of criminal law the requirements of a \u201cfair hearing\u201d are stricter (see, mutatis mutandis, Dombo\u00a0Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27\u00a0October 1993, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 274), the Court finds that the suspension of the time allowed for appealing, on the grounds that the prosecutor dealing with the case was on leave, cannot be accepted as compatible with the principle of equality of arms.",
