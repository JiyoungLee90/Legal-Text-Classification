At the same time the Court has observed that the press must not overstep certain bounds, particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others (see Tammer v. Estonia, no. 41205/98, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2001I, and Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7 49, ECHR 1999VI).",

The electronic network, serving billions of users worldwide, is not and potentially will never be subject to the same regulations and control. The risk of harm posed by content and communications on the Internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms, particularly the right to respect for private life, is certainly higher than that posed by the press. Therefore, the policies governing reproduction of material from the printed media and the Internet may differ. The latter undeniably have to be adjusted according to technology\u2019s specific features in order to secure the protection and promotion of the rights and freedoms concerned (see Editorial Board of Pravoye Delo and Shtekel v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a033014/05, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR 2011 (extracts)).",

The Court stressed the substantial contribution made by Internet archives to preserving and making available news and information. Such archives constitute an important source for education and historical research, particularly as they are readily accessible to the public and are generally free. While the primary function of the press in a democracy is to act as a \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d, it has a valuable secondary role in maintaining and making available to the public archives containing news which has previously been reported (see Times Newspapers Ltd, cited above, \u00a7\u00a027). The maintenance of Internet archives is a critical aspect of this role.",

The Court was of the view that such an obligation in respect of an Internet archive managed by a publisher of a newspaper itself was not excessive. The Court also noted with approval that the domestic courts had not suggested that potentially defamatory articles should be removed from archives altogether (see Times Newspapers, cited above, \u00a7 47).",

The Court accepts that it is not the role of judicial authorities to engage in rewriting history by ordering the removal from the public domain of all traces of publications which have in the past been found, by final judicial decisions, to amount to unjustified attacks on individual reputations.

The Court is therefore satisfied that the domestic courts were aware of the significance which publications available to the general public on the Internet could have for the effective protection of individual rights.
