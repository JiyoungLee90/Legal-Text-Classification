The Court finds no reason to depart from its existing case-law in this regard. It further observes that, as an example of the relevant domestic case-law regarding Article 6.272 of the Civil Code, the Government relied on the decision of the Supreme Court of 6\u00a0February 2007.

The Government further contended that this possibility for the applicants to obtain compensation for the premises at issue ensured a reasonable balance between the interests of the applicants and the public and had been approved by the courts at three levels of jurisdiction. They alleged that the delay in paying the applicants the compensation for the disputed premises had resulted from the complexities of the restitution process and the related legal disputes.

In this connection the Court recalls its finding at paragraph 44\u00a0above and its previous case-law to the effect that, when a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 is found, the Court\u00a0usually considers it unnecessary to determine\u00a0the complaint based on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1\u00a0in addition\u00a0(see, among many authorities, Mahieu v.

Moreover, the state of uncertainty in which applicants might find themselves as a result of delays attributable to the authorities is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State\u2019s conduct (see Almeida Garrett, Mascarenhas Falc\u00e3o and Others v. Portugal, nos. 29813/96 and 30229/96, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2000I, and Broniowski v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a031443/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0151 and 185, ECHR 2004V).

The Court is not insensitive to the complexities inherent in the restitution process. However, in the present case the hindrance to the peaceful enjoyment of their property is mainly attributable to the respondent State, since the Court has already found that the related civil proceedings breached the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement (see paragraph 44 above). What is more, the applicants have not been fully paid for their property to date, given that they will not receive the final balance of compensation before 2010. In the Court\u2019s view, the overall length of the restitution proceedings thus upset the balance which had to be struck between the general interest in securing the disputed premises for public needs and the applicants\u2019 personal interest in the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions.
