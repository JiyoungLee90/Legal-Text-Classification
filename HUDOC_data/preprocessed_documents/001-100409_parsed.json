It\u00a0analysed relevant case-law of the administrative courts and noted that the\u00a0manner in which\u00a0the beginning of the time-limit for lodging cassation appeals\u00a0was determined had led to divergent results. It held\u00a0that it was necessary to determine that moment in a manner compatible with the effective access to the highest administrative court and equal for\u00a0parties represented by lawyers appointed under the legal-aid scheme\u00a0and by privately hired lawyers. The court held that the time-limit for a legally-aided party started to run only on the day when a legal-aid lawyer had a genuine possibility of lodging the cassation appeal; not when he or she was informed of having been assigned to the case. The court was of the view that the latter approach was far too rigorous and rendered the effective enjoyment of legal assistance granted under the legal-aid system illusory. In any event, the cassation appeal had to be lodged within thirty days from the day on which the party was informed of the appointment of the legal-aid lawyer (I FZ 569/06 of 8 December 2006; I FZ 667/06 of 15 January 2007; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2007; II FZ 177/08 of 25 June 2008; II OZ 513/08 of 27 May 2008; I OZ 376/08 of 13 June 2008; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2009; II OZ 1093/09 of 9 December 2009; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2009).",
