Lithuania, nos. 40828/12 and 6 others, \u00a7\u00a7 84-88 and 9394, 8\u00a0December 2015). It notes that in the first applicant\u2019s case the Lithuanian courts admitted a violation of domestic legal norms setting out specific aspects pertinent to the conditions of detention. It considers that even though the applicant was awarded EUR 3,000 (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above), that amount, whilst apparently consistent with Lithuanian case-law, is inconsistent with the amounts that the Court awards in similar cases. The Court thus considers that the first applicant retains his victim status under Article 34 of the Convention.",
