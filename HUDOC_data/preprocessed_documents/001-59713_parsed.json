The Reich Insurance Act, applying to workers, and the Employees\u2019 Pension Act, applying to employees, together with the reform legislation, namely the Workers\u2019 Pension (Reform) Act (Arbeiterrentenversicherungs-Neuregelungsgesetz) and the Employees\u2019 Pension (Reform) Act (Angestelltenversicherungs-Neuregelungsgesetz), formed the basis of the general old age insurance system (gesetzliche Rentenversicherung der Arbeiter und Angestellten). A widow is entitled to a survivor\u2019s pension after the death of her insured husband, and a widower is entitled to a survivor\u2019s pension after the death of his insured wife. Moreover, pursuant to the new legislation, a survivor\u2019s earned income or income in lieu of earned income is taken into account. According to the explanatory report, the latter rule was justified on account of the maintenance function of a survivor\u2019s pension (60% of the spouses\u2019 last income). The reform only concerned pension cases having occurred as from 1 January 1986. Furthermore, for a transitional period until 31\u00a0December 1988, spouses could opt for the old regime if they had been married before 1 January 1986 and if they were both older than 50 years at that time. Subsequent reform legislation, including a uniform pension regime for workers and employees, did not affect the substance of the above legislation concerning a survivor\u2019s pension.",
