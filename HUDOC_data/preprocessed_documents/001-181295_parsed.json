As can be seen from the minutes of the meeting, the applicant company\u2019s attorneys acknowledged the use of hidden camera in the above-mentioned incidents. They argued that such use had been justified owing to A.C. being a public figure and that it had served the public interest, as proven by the fact that the report had resulted in A.C.\u2019s being dismissed from the parliamentary group of the political party for which he had been elected as parliamentary deputy. In their view, that had been the result not only of A.C.\u2019s gambling activities, but also of the fact that he had tried to negotiate with the applicant company\u2019s reporters to present the incident differently. The applicant company\u2019s attorneys further argued that the use of a hidden camera had been exceptional and had been resorted to following the receipt of information that could not have been verified otherwise, as nobody would have believed the journalists\u2019 allegations if they had reported on the issue without broadcasting the images. It can also be seen from the minutes that the members of the National Radio and Television Council expressed their disagreement regarding the use of a hidden camera, arguing that if anyone were able to use a hidden camera by claiming that there was an overriding public interest in doing so, then all citizens \u2013 especially if they were public figures \u2013 would be exposed to the possibility of being subject to pressure and extortion. They furthermore stressed that nobody would ever forbid journalists to report on a certain issue; however the means used raised an issue, as the use of hidden camera could be accepted only in respect of a national security issue or for the prevention of a serious crime or other similar situations. They also noted that there were two separate issues in the instant case; on the one hand the use of a hidden camera and on the other hand the entrapment of A.C.",

It additionally referred to the Court\u2019s case-law in respect of Article 10 and on Article 8, with specific reference to case-law concerning the protection of a person\u2019s image (see Von Hannover v.\u00a0Germany, no. 59320/00, ECHR 2004VI; Sch\u00fcssel v.

                                "content": "13.\u00a0\u00a0The Supreme Administrative Court laid down the conditions under which it is legitimate to broadcast an image that has been filmed with the method of hidden camera, by making a distinction between reporting on specific news, whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means, and the broadcasting of the relevant, secretly recorded image. According to that reasoning, recording by secret means an image which has as its main or only subject a specific person constitutes in principle a violation of that person\u2019s right to his own image, which is protected by Articles 9 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution and 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, as a specific aspect of the right to respect for one\u2019s private life. Consequently, the broadcasting on television of news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means cannot, in principle, be considered as constituting the legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, given that the disseminated news has been received under circumstances which constitute a violation of an individual\u2019s right to his own image. Nevertheless, in certain cases it may be considered justified to broadcast such news, on account of its contribution to a debate of general interest and taking into account the secretly recorded person\u2019s position or standing. However, even when broadcasting of the news is considered a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, this does not automatically render legitimate the broadcasting of the relevant, secretly recorded images, as that constitutes a much more intense [\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2] limitation of the constitutionally protected right of that person to his own image than the simple transmission of news. In the domestic court\u2019s view, broadcasting of a secretly recorded image can only be justified if the legitimate (for the reasons mentioned above) broadcasting of such news is completely impossible or particularly difficult without broadcasting the image that was recorded by hidden means and which constitutes the source of the news.",

The domestic court stressed that from the text of the decision and from the minutes of the meeting of the National Radio and Television Council it derived that the sanction was imposed to the applicant company solely and exclusively on account of the broadcast of the images that had been recorded by hidden means and not on account of the transmission of the news, whose source had been the secretly recorded images. As far as the broadcasting of the images was concerned, the applicant company had not disputed that the images had been recorded by secret means and had not claimed that broadcasting of the news was absolutely impossible or extremely difficult without broadcasting the relevant images. Therefore, the applicant company\u2019s allegation that it had broadcast the impugned images for reasons of journalistic interest and of public interest was dismissed.",

Given that, pursuant to Articles 2 \u00a7 1, 15 \u00a7 2 and 25\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Constitution, the protection of human dignity is absolute, the broadcasting of such news is always forbidden, irrespective of whether such a broadcast includes the image in question.

According to the first one, in view of the fact that the National Radio and Television Council had considered that the broadcasting of news that had been recorded by secret means had constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, the same considerations should be extended to the broadcasting of the relevant image. The reason for this was the special nature of television, in comparison with the other media, owing to which the broadcasting of the image went hand-in-hand with broadcasting the news itself. Therefore, the application for annulment should have been allowed, given that the National Radio and Television Council\u2019s decision had been based solely on the fact that the image of A.C. had been recorded by hidden means, without considering whether broadcasting news whose source was the above images constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information.",

A person\u2019s right to his own image was susceptible to limitations that varied according to that person\u2019s position and the space in which the recording in question had taken place. For individuals, protection against the recording of their image without their consent was absolute, irrespective of whether it took place in a public or private space, unless the recording was not directed to them or the recording of the image took place with a view to the prevention of crimes in public space. For public figures, however, protection was less absolute. In particular, public figures, such as politicians, were exposed to publicity and sometimes they even pursued it. As a result, there was a legitimate expectation on the part of the media and of the public to impart and receive information regarding their public activities. For these persons, there was an absolute protection of their image in their private space and in public spaces in which they shared private or family moments. When, however, public figures were in public spaces but not under the conditions described above, or acted in a way that was of interest to the public (such as in cases in which they engaged in behaviour contrary to what their public role entailed or contrary to the image they projected towards the public), then the right to receive and impart information could justify the recording of that person without his consent and the broadcasting of the relevant images by the media. In this regard, the dissenting judges argued that it would be inconceivable to equate radio with television, as they did not operate on the same way; therefore, it would not be possible for a television show to simply announce the news without broadcasting the relevant images, as would be the case on the radio. In respect of legitimately recorded images, when there is a balance between transparency and the right to receive information on the one hand and the protection of a person\u2019s image on the other hand, the presumption should be that the recorded image could be broadcast without consent. In view of the above, the four judges considered that the application for annulment should be allowed, taking into account especially the fact that A.C. was a public figure, that the recording of his image had taken place in a public space (that is to say in a gambling arcade), and that the broadcasting of the relevant images had served the purpose of informing the public of behaviour on the part of a member of Parliament that did not meet the requirements of his position. Therefore, the television channel\u2019s decision to broadcast the image as a part of the television shows, which otherwise could be considered unfounded or even defamatory, had not breached the proportionality principle.",

Therefore his participation in gambling games had been a matter of public interest in the light of A.C.\u2019s public role and could have affected his duties as a member of parliament and as chairman of the parliamentary committee on electronic gambling. Viewers had had the right to learn the truth about an elected deputy. In any event, electronic gambling had been a matter of general interest in Greece at the time as many citizens had been financially destroyed owing to their participation in similar games. That had been the reason why the two television shows had prepared the broadcasts in question. In view of the above, the broadcasting of videos that had been filmed by the use of a hidden camera had been necessary, and A.C.\u2019s right to private life had been outweighed by the applicant company\u2019s right to impart information concerning a matter of public interest.

In addition, the images on all three videos, as well as the filmed conversations of A.C. with journalists on the second and third videos, had breached criminal law and in particular Article 370A \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, the applicant company had been aware that it had breached all the above-mentioned provisions of domestic legislation by filming and broadcasting the impugned videos. In the Government\u2019s view, the applicant company had not advanced any argument as to why the broadcasting of the videos had been necessary and why it had not been sufficient to merely broadcast the news without showing the videos that had been recorded in violation of A.C.\u2019s right to his own image. The videos had not contributed to a public debate but had merely satisfied the public\u2019s curiosity and had been used as a means of securing higher ratings for the programmes; this could not have been considered a legitimate reason for violating A.C.\u2019s right to his own image. In view of the above, the National Radio and Television Council \u2013 which considered that the applicant company could have broadcast the news but not the videos that had been the source of the news and had consequently imposed sanctions on the applicant company \u2013 had not erred but had struck a fair balance between the rights protected under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention. Referring to the Court\u2019s case-law (B\u00e9dat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, \u00a7\u00a7 72-73, ECHR 2016), the Government argued that the sanction imposed had constituted an exercise of the positive obligation arising from Article 8 in order to effectively protect A.C.\u2019s right to his own image. In addition, it had been in accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law, which made clear that the wide protection afforded to the press did not mean that journalists were not obliged to respect national legislation and the Code on Journalistic Ethics. The alleged interference had addressed a pressing social need \u2013 namely that in a democratic society dialogue should be conducted without the use of means which harmed the reputation and image of individuals unless such means contributing to a public debate.",

Because of their direct, continuous contact with the realities of the country, a State\u2019s courts are in a better position than an international court to determine how, at a given time, the right balance can be struck. For this reason, in matters under Article 10 of the Convention, the Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity and scope of any interference in the freedom of expression protected by that Article in particular when a balance has to be struck between conflicting private interests (see, among other authorities, Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos.\u00a028955/06, 28957/06, 28959/06 and 28964/06, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2011). However, this margin goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it \u2013 even those delivered by an independent court. In exercising its supervisory function, the Court\u2019s task is not to take the place of the national courts, but rather to review, in the light of the case as a whole, whether the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provisions of the Convention relied on. If the balance struck by the national judicial authorities is unsatisfactory, in particular because the importance or the scope of one of the fundamental rights at stake was not duly considered, the margin of appreciation accorded to the decisions of the national courts will be a narrow one (see Aksu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 4149/04 and 41029/04, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2012). Where, however, the exercise of striking a balance between two conflicting rights was undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 104107, and Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 90-92).",

The extent to which an individual has a public profile or is well-known influences the protection that may be afforded to his or her private life. Thus, the Court has acknowledged on numerous occasions that the public was entitled to be informed about certain aspects of the private life of public figures (see, inter alia, Karhuvaara and\u00a0Iltalehti v.

Thus, the fact that an individual belongs to the category of public figures cannot in any way, even in the case of persons exercising official functions, authorise the media to violate the professional and ethical principles which must govern their actions, or legitimise intrusions into private life (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s, cited above, \u00a7 122).",

The domestic authorities ought therefore to have considered the extent to which this prominence and those public functions were capable of influencing the protection which could be afforded to his private life (ibid., \u00a7 124). The Court notes that the domestic authorities did not explicitly address this point. In fact, the National Radio and Television Council in its decision made no reference to A.C.\u2019s public functions but merely referred to the relevant legislative provisions which provide the general protection of the right to private life and one\u2019s right to one\u2019s own image. The Supreme Administrative Court, however, stated that an exception could be made to the principle of the protection of private life whenever the facts disclosed could give rise to a debate on account of their impact, in the light of the status or position of the person concerned (see paragraph 14 above), although it drew no conclusion from that consideration in so far as broadcasting the impugned videos was concerned. Nevertheless, the Court considers that it can be derived from the domestic authorities\u2019\u00a0conclusions, notably that the news whose source was the videos that had been recorded with a hidden camera could legitimately be broadcast, those authorities took into account A.C.\u2019s public functions (see Von Hannover v.

This is corroborated by the fact that all three videos were focused on A.C. and his reaction to the first video, which showed him entering a gambling arcade and gambling on electronic machines.

It will be recalled in this connection that paragraph 2 of Article 10 does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression, even with respect to media coverage of matters of serious public concern. In particular, and notwithstanding the vital role played by the media in a democratic society, journalists cannot, in principle, be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that, as journalists, Article 10 affords them a cast-iron defence (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Stoll, cited above, \u00a7 102; Bladet Troms\u00f8 and\u00a0Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7 65; and Monnat v.

Nevertheless, the fact that the first video was filmed in a public space in which anyone could have taken a photograph or \u2013 as in the instant case \u2013 filmed a video of the member of the Parliament is a factor that should have been taken into consideration by the domestic authorities when assessing the journalists\u2019 conduct. The Court has previously considered in cases falling under the scope of Article 8, albeit in a different context, that on occasions when people knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which are or may be recorded or reported in a public manner, a person\u2019s reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although not necessarily conclusive, factor (see P.G. and J.H. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, \u00a7 57, ECHR\u00a02001IX).",

From the minutes of the meeting it can also be seen that the Council attached significant weight to the \u201centrapment\u201d of A.C. (see \u00a7 7 above). The same considerations apply to the Supreme Administrative Court which, without questioning the legitimacy of broadcasting news whose source had consisted of the impugned videos, ruled that the applicant company had acted in breach of the Code on Journalistic Ethics, which provided for the use of direct and legitimate means when one exercised the right to impart information (compare Tierbefreier e.V. v.

The Supreme Administrative Court emphasised the fact that the applicant company had not put forward any argument as to why it had been necessary to broadcast the videos that had been filmed without the knowledge and consent of A.C. In the Court\u2019s view, the domestic authorities\u2019 conclusion that the applicant company overstepped the limits of responsible journalism is not unreasonable, at least in so far as the second and third videos are concerned. In this connection, the Court attaches some weight to the fact that the applicant company had already been sanctioned for the same offence in the past. However, as regards the first video, the Court considers that the domestic authorities failed to take into consideration in their assessment the fact that it was filmed in a public place, an element which, in the Court\u2019s view, weakens the legitimacy of any expectation of privacy A.C. might have had when he entered the gambling arcade.",

The Supreme Administrative Court upheld the relevant sanctions, considering that they were proportionate and that the lack of specific details regarding the number of viewers or the size of the investment the applicant company had made did not have any impact on the proportionality of the sanctions.
