In May 2002, when the roadworks were completed, the applicant\u2019s house was flooded for the first time (see paragraph 11 above). According to the judgments of the domestic courts in 2007, 2008 and 2013, the flooding occurred due to the failure of the local authorities to properly maintain both the nearby road and the water collection system underneath it and to carry out the associated repairs (see paragraphs 12, 19 and 24 above). In May 2009, that is to say more than two years after they had been ordered to do so by the Industrialnyy District Court in March 2007, the municipal authorities allegedly cleaned the drainage pipe for the first time (see paragraph 15 above). However, the flooding of the applicant\u2019s house continued and the forensic expert determined in 2013 that the drainage pipe had not in fact been installed in 2009 or properly maintained as the authorities had claimed (see paragraph 24 above).",
