It referred to the conclusions of the experts but said that it would not take into account the reports drawn up by the expert who had been disqualified (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 25 above). Based on those conclusions, the court found that the precise location of the suspected metastasis had not been fully established before the operation. It went on to say that the allegation that Dr K.M. had removed parts of the applicant\u2019s fourth and fifth left ribs without her consent was baseless, since the written consent form that she had signed before the operation, following an explanation on the proposed procedure, had not specified the rib to be operated upon. The court further held, with reference to the expert opinions, that Dr K.M. had not erred by removing parts of the fourth and fifth left ribs, as he had observed on them tissue which he had suspected to be cancerous. The fact that the histological test had later showed otherwise had not retrospectively rendered his assessment flawed. Nor had he erred by inspecting the applicant\u2019s lungs by palpation \u2013 that was standard practice in that type of operation. Furthermore, the evidence did not categorically prove that the applicant still had a metastasis in her sixth left rib, especially bearing in mind the lack of other metastases after the operation. In particular, the experts were agreed that the medical imaging results submitted by the applicant could not be conclusive on that point in the absence of a fresh histological test. Lastly, the court found that it had not been proved that the applicant\u2019s sixth rib had been fractured in the course of the operation and that, in any event, such a fracture was a habitual risk in that sort of operation.",

It said that it could not follow the opinion of Dr V.T. on this point (see paragraph 33 above) because, even though the question whether it had been advisable to operate in such circumstances could be debated theoretically, the medical team treating the applicant had been faced with an exigently practical situation: the medical imaging tests had showed the presence of a suspected isolated tumour whose exact location was uncertain, and there had been for this reason only one course of action: localise the tumour using the methods of surgical diagnostics and immediately remove it. The court agreed with the experts\u2019 conclusions that the operating team had not erred by removing parts of the applicant\u2019s fourth and fifth ribs on the basis of their suspicion that they contained cancerous tissue, even though that had turned out not to be the case.

For instance, the authorities must take sufficient care to ensure the independence, both formal and de facto, of the experts involved in the proceedings and the objectivity of their findings, since these are likely to carry crucial weight in the ensuing legal assessment of the highly complex issues of medical negligence (see Baji\u0107 v.

A further requirement is that the experts examine carefully all relevant points and set out in enough detail the reasons for their conclusions (see Baldovin v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a011385/05, \u00a7 23, 7 June 2011, and Altu\u011f and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 32086/07, \u00a7\u00a7 78-81, 30 June 2015), and that the courts or other authorities dealing with the case then scrutinise properly those conclusions (see Csoma, \u00a7 56, and Altu\u011f and Others, \u00a7 82, both cited above). A system in which an opinion given by a specialised institution is automatically regarded as conclusive evidence which precludes further expert examination of the relevant issues falls afoul of this requirement (see Eugenia Laz\u0103r v.\u00a0Romania, no. 32146/05, \u00a7\u00a7 76-80, 16 February 2010; Baldovin, cited above, \u00a7 24; and Csoma, cited above, \u00a7 61).",

In other High Contracting Parties, such claims, if directed against public hospitals, are examined under rules governing the liability of public authorities for damage (see Draon v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 1513/03, \u00a7 37 and 47-48, 6 October 2005, and Byrzykowski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 11562/05, \u00a7 77, 27 June 2006).

It should further be borne in mind that in discharging their positive obligations towards the alleged victims of medical malpractice, the authorities must also have regard to counter-considerations, such as the risk of unjustifiably exposing medical practitioners to liability, which can compromise their professional morale and induce them to practise, often to the detriment of their patients, what has come to be known as \u201cdefensive medicine\u201d.",

Hungary (no. 34418/04, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 35, 29 January 2008), in the face of an almost identical submission, the Court held that it was normal for the expert opinions in such cases to be given by medical practitioners.

It is not for this Court, which is not a court of appeal from the national courts, to gainsay that court\u2019s findings on these points (see Yard\u0131mc\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 59).",

On the contrary, the surgeon appears to have repeatedly given her assurances in that respect (see paragraph 9 above), which the evidence obtained in the ensuing proceedings proved to be untenable.
