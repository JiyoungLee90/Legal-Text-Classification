It also goes without saying that freedom of expression is secured to lawyers too, who are certainly entitled to comment in public on the administration of justice, but their criticism must not overstep certain bounds. In that connection, account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interests involved, which include the public\u2019s right to receive information about questions arising from judicial decisions, the requirements of the proper administration of justice and the dignity of the legal profession (see the Casado Coca judgment cited above, p. 21, \u00a7 55, and the De Haes and Gijsels judgment cited above, pp. 233\u201334, \u00a7 37). Because of their direct, continuous contact with their members, the Bar authorities and a country\u2019s courts are in a better position than an international court to determine how, at a given time, the right balance can be struck. That is why they have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of an interference in this area, but this margin is subject to European supervision as regards both the relevant rules and the decisions applying them (see the Casado Coca judgment cited above, pp.\u00a020\u201321, \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 55).",

In addition to the general nature, the seriousness and the tone of the applicant\u2019s assertions, the Court notes that he first held a press conference, claiming that this was his last resort, and only afterwards lodged an appeal before the Lucerne Court of Appeal, which was partly successful. He also omitted to apply to the other supervisory body for the district authority, the public prosecutor\u2019s office, whose ineffectiveness he did not attempt to establish except by means of mere assertions. Having regard also to the modest amount of the fine imposed on the applicant, the Court considers that the authorities did not go beyond their margin of appreciation in punishing Mr Sch\u00f6pfer. There has accordingly been no breach of Article 10.",

In order to express his dissatisfaction he held a press conference at which he apparently stated, among other assertions, that at the Hochdorf district authority offices the laws of the canton and human rights had been flagrantly breached for years.

The applicant\u2019s role was not that of a politician but a legal expert promoting changes in criminal law, who got involved in conflict with local civil servants. Furthermore, he was involved in a concrete case and on top of that he was influenced by the wife of his client. In such a situation he might have had grounds to believe her although her allegations were denied by civil servants. Thus the applicant found himself in exceptional circumstances and his reaction might have been improper due to such circumstances, which however could also be considered to justify his behaviour. At the same time he was engaged in a legislative fight for his principles. The applicant considered that he could not rely on the remedies available in his efforts to get appointed as an ex officio lawyer for his client. Therefore he did not act on purpose in a political way. His statements to the press seem partly right and partly wrong. Furthermore, those originating from the press were authored by the press and the applicant therefore cannot be held responsible for everything that was included in them.",
