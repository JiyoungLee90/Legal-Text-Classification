The delegation\u2019s findings during the 2013 visit clearly indicate that the adoption/entry into force of the new CCP and other recent measures had contributed to the eradication of massive, severe, overcrowding in the establishments visited. The Ukrainian authorities should be commended for this. However, overcrowding remains an issue for many inmates who still enjoy an extremely limited amount of living space (i.e. far lower than 4 m\u00b2 per inmate) in cells which were often found to be in a poor condition. In addition, the bulk of remand prisoners were confined to such cells for at least 23 hours a day, with no meaningful out-of-cell activities on offer and little incentive to take daily outdoor exercise. In addition, few of them had opportunities to maintain contacts with their relatives. This situation was aggravated for a number of prisoners who were still being held in such a situation for several years under the former CCP. In short, the cumulative effect of these conditions and restrictions could well be considered, for many inmates, as a form of inhuman and degrading treatment.",

Indeed, there were signs of negative trends in that respect. Conditions of detention in pre-trial detention facilities were of particular concern. That situation could be explained by the lack of a real vision of the situation in penal institutions. There was no systematic approach to introducing changes in this field and, as a result, controversial decisions were being adopted by the authorities. In the vast majority of the facilities visited, adequate material conditions of detention were not created because the facilities were underfunded. Breaches of the domestic standards on the personal space for detainees and prisoners were repeatedly confirmed. Some cells were often left unoccupied because they required major repairs. The vast majority of SIZO multi-occupancy cells remained in a neglected state; they were covered with mould; there was no proper access to fresh air or artificial ventilation, and natural light or artificial lighting was insufficient. The equipment in the cells did not fully comply with the relevant domestic standards. In most cases, the bedding was old and worn out; some prisoners were not provided with any at all.

Only between 2015 and the first quarter of 2017 had the number of persons held in prisons decreased by a factor of 1.4 (from 57,396 to 41,800 persons), whereas the number held in SIZOs had increased by a factor of 1.2 (from 16,035 to 18,821 persons). Chronic underfunding of the penal system by the State had led to systemic problems of inappropriate conditions of detention in SIZOs, requiring complex decisions and adequate funding.",

It provides for preventive and compensatory remedies in respect of inappropriate treatment of convicted and detained persons, and sets out the types of remedy and the procedure for their application and for the execution of relevant decisions. Preventive remedies are defined as actions aimed at ending or preventing prohibited treatment. They include, inter alia, an obligation on the part of the relevant officials to change the detention facility or cell in which a detained or convicted person is being held; to make repairs to the cell, to equip or disinfect it, or to stop using it; to provide adequate food, and so on. Compensatory remedies are defined as actions aimed at compensating victims of prohibited treatment. They include monetary compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage inflicted on such victims. The draft law also introduces the institution of post-sentencing judge, who deals with applications for preventive and compensatory remedies and for the adoption of binding decisions in this respect. Thus, applications for preventive remedies should be examined within three working days, but in certain circumstances within a period of up to one month. The judge is obliged to visit in person the relevant detention facility and to conduct an anonymous interview with a detainee who made an application. Upon the latter\u2019s wish, participation of a defender is ensured during the interview. Decisions on the application of preventive measures should immediately be complied with by the relevant authorities or persons. Failure to comply with them entails disciplinary or criminal liability.",

The exercise yard measuring 11.5 square metres for cells nos. 661 and 655 could not be considered reasonable for a detainee who spent twenty-three hours per day in such cells.

In assessing evidence, the Court has adopted the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, among others, Nachova and Others v.

The Court is mindful of the objective difficulties experienced by the applicants in collecting evidence to substantiate their claims about the conditions of their detention. Owing to the restrictions imposed by the prison regime, detainees cannot realistically be expected to be able to furnish photographs of their cell or give precise measurements of its dimensions, temperature or luminosity. Nevertheless, an applicant must provide an elaborate and consistent account of the conditions of his or her detention mentioning the specific elements, such as for instance the dates of his or her transfer between facilities, which would enable the Court to determine that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded or inadmissible on any other grounds. Only a credible and reasonably detailed description of the allegedly degrading conditions of detention constitutes a prima facie case of ill-treatment and serves as a basis for giving notice of the complaint to the respondent Government.",

It follows that, after the Court has given notice of the applicant\u2019s complaint to the Government, the burden is on the latter to collect and produce relevant documents.

The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim.\u00a0While ill-treatment that attains this minimum usually involves actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering, even in the absence of these, where treatment humiliates or debases an individual, showing a lack of respect for or diminishing his or her human dignity, or arouses feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking an individual\u2019s moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition of Article 3 (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a013940, and Neshkov and Others v.

Croatia [GC] no. 7334/13, \u00a7\u00a0104, 20\u00a0October 2016).\u00a0Thus, when a detainee has less than 3 square metres of personal space in multi-occupancy accommodation, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article\u00a03 arises. The burden of proof is then on the respondent Government, who could, however, rebut that presumption by demonstrating that there were factors capable of adequately compensating for the scarce allocation of personal space. The strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 will normally be capable of being rebutted only if the following factors are cumulatively met: (1) the reductions in the required minimum personal space of 3 square metres are short, occasional and minor; (2) such reductions are accompanied by sufficient freedom of movement outside the cell and adequate out-of-cell activities; and (3) the applicant is confined in what is, when viewed generally, an appropriate detention facility, and there are no other aggravating aspects of the conditions of his or her detention. When the personal space is between 3 and 4 square metres, the space factor remains a weighty factor in the assessment of the adequacy of conditions of detention. In such instances a violation of Article 3 will be found if that factor is coupled with other aspects of inappropriate physical conditions of detention, in particular, access to outdoor exercise, natural light or air, availability of ventilation, adequacy of room temperature, the possibility of using the toilet in private, and compliance with basic sanitary and hygiene requirements (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 138-39; see also Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 149-159; Neshkov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0233243; and Varga and Others v.\u00a0Hungary, nos. 14097/12 and 5 others, \u00a7\u00a7 75-78, 10 March 2015).",

Ukraine (no. 2), no. 29334/11, \u00a7 155, 11 June 2015, with further references).\u00a0Moreover, it has recently summarised the principles concerning conditions of transfer. Thus, assessment of whether there has been a breach of Article 3 cannot be reduced to a purely numerical calculation of the space available to a detainee during the transfer. Only a comprehensive approach to the particular circumstances of the case can provide an accurate picture of the reality for the person being transported.\u00a0Nevertheless, a strong presumption of a violation arises when detainees are transported in vehicles offering less than 0.5 square metres of personal space. The low height of the ceiling, especially of single-prisoner cubicles, which forces prisoners to stoop, may exacerbate physical suffering and fatigue. Inadequate protection from outside temperatures, when prisoner cells are not sufficiently heated or ventilated, will constitute an aggravating factor.\u00a0The above presumption is capable of being rebutted only in the case of a short or occasional transfer. By contrast, the pernicious effects of overcrowding must be taken to increase with longer duration and greater frequency of transfers, making the applicant\u2019s case of a violation stronger (see Tomov and Others v.

The space factor is therefore a weighty factor in the assessment of the adequacy of the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention in those cells (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 139).\u00a0His situation was further aggravated by the fact that he was held in the cells for twenty-three hours a day and his access to outdoor exercise was limited to a one-hour walk. The exercise yard measuring 11.5 square metres was only 3.8 square metres larger than the cells themselves (see paragraph 17 above) and was apparently used by other detainees at the same time. As such, in the Court\u2019s view, it was too small to give him a genuine opportunity to exercise (see similarly Trepashkin v. Russia (no. 2), no. 14248/05, \u00a7 118, 16\u00a0December 2010). The Court thus notes that the space factor was coupled with the fact that the applicant had to spend almost all the time inside the cells for a period of one year and ten months. The applicant\u2019s situation is comparable with other cases (see, for instance, Istv\u00e1n G\u00e1bor Kov\u00e1cs v.

In the Court\u2019s view, none of those periods could be used, in terms of the length of each of them, to rebut the strong presumption of a violation of Article\u00a03 (see\u00a0Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 151-52, where even a shorter period of twentyseven days could not be used to rebut such a presumption). Furthermore, there were several other non-consecutive periods, ranging from one to fourteen days, during each of which the applicant also had 2.6\u00a0square metres of personal space. Although these non-consecutive periods were short, in the Court\u2019s view such reductions in personal space below 3 square metres should be considered as part of a longer, continuous situation of the applicant\u2019s detention in cell no. 911 (see, similarly, Gaspari, cited above, \u00a7\u00a057). In any event, those conditions were not compensated for by other factors (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 138, and Nikitin and Others v.\u00a0Estonia, nos. 23226/16 and 6 others, \u00a7 179, 29 January 2019).

He also stated that between three and seven detainees had usually been held in the holding cells. Neither in his initial submissions nor in his subsequent observations did the applicant, whose duty it is to provide an elaborate and reasonably detailed account of the alleged events (see\u00a0Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 122), specify the sizes of the cells in the other vans. Nor did he say with how many detainees and on how many occasions he had personally been transferred in various prison vans and held in the court\u2019s holding cells.

The Court also notes the abstract and impersonal language employed by the applicant in his initial submissions (see paragraphs 22 and 25 above).

However, he failed to elaborate on how and to what extent what was described in his generally couched statements affected his individual situation.

With respect to Article 3 complaints concerning conditions of detention, two types of relief are possible: improvement in such conditions, and compensation for damage sustained as a result of them. For a person held in such conditions, a remedy capable of rapidly bringing the ongoing violation to an end is of the greatest value. However, once such a person has been released or placed in conditions meeting the requirements of Article 3, he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for any breach that has already occurred. Thus, in the case of Domj\u00e1n v. Hungary ((dec.), no. 5433/17, \u00a7 25, 14\u00a0November 2017), which was a response to the Varga and Others pilot judgment (cited above), the Court noted that two pre-conditions had been set in the relevant domestic law for the use of the compensatory remedy: first, the previous use of the preventive remedy if the number of days spent in inadequate conditions of detention exceeded thirty (where inadequate conditions of detention existed over a longer period of time, a further complaint did not need to be lodged within three months); and second, compliance with the six-month time-limit running from the day on which the inadequate conditions of detention had ceased to exist or, for those who had already been released at the date of entry into force of the new law, from a particular date set by the law. The Court concluded that neither of those two conditions seemed to be unreasonable obstacles to the accessibility of the remedy. Accordingly, preventive and compensatory remedies might be complementary to be considered effective (see Ananyev and Others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09698 and 214, and Neshkov and Others, \u00a7 181, both cited above; see also Varga and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 48-49, and Ulemek v.

However, where an effective preventive remedy has been established, the applicants in detention, as a rule, cannot be dispensed from the obligation to use it. In other words, before bringing their complaints to the Court, they are first required to use properly the available and effective preventive remedy and then, if appropriate, the relevant compensatory remedy. If the use of an otherwise available and effective preventive remedy is futile in view of the brevity of an applicant\u2019s stay in inadequate conditions of detention, the only viable option would be a compensatory remedy allowing for a possibility to obtain redress for the past placement in such conditions. This period may depend on many factors related to the manner of operation of the domestic system of remedies and the nature of the alleged inadequacy of an applicant\u2019s conditions of detention. In any event, the compensatory remedy in this context should normally be used within six months of the end of the allegedly inadequate conditions of detention. This is, of course, without prejudice to the possibility that the domestic law provides for different arrangements in the use of remedies or for a longer statutory time-limit for the use of a compensatory remedy, in which case the use of that remedy is determined by the relevant domestic arrangements and time-limits (see Ulemek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 82-83 and 8690).",

In addition, the procedural rules governing the examination of claims for compensation must conform to the principle of fairness enshrined in Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, including the reasonable-time requirement, and the rules governing costs must not place an excessive burden on the detainee where his or her claim is justified. Lastly, a detainee should not be required to establish that specific officials have engaged in unlawful conduct, since poor conditions of detention are not necessarily due to failings of individual officials, but are often the product of more wide-ranging factors (see\u00a0Ananyev and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 228-29, and Neshkov and Others, \u00a7 184, both cited above).",

In the context of compensatory remedies, monetary compensation should be accessible to any current or former detainee who has been held in inhuman or degrading conditions and has made an application to this effect. A finding that the conditions fell short of the requirements of Article 3 gives rise to a strong presumption that they have caused non-pecuniary damage to the detainee. The domestic rules and practice governing the operation of the remedy must reflect that presumption, rather than make the award of compensation dependent on the detainee\u2019s ability to prove the existence of non-pecuniary damage in the form of emotional distress. Lastly, detainees must be able to avail themselves of remedies without having to fear that they will incur punishment or negative consequences for doing so (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 188-91).",

Thus, as early as 2006 it held that a complaint lodged with a prosecutor, in accordance with the Pre-trail Detention Act or the Prosecutors Act, was not an effective and accessible remedy, given that the prosecution\u2019s status under domestic law and its particular \u201caccusatorial\u201d role in the investigation of criminal cases did not offer adequate safeguards for an independent and impartial review of a complaint. Moreover, such a complaint could not lead to preventive or compensatory redress. The Court also held that the problems relating to conditions of detention did not concern an individual situation but were of a structural nature (see Koval v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 65550/01, \u00a7 95, 19\u00a0October 2006). It has since rejected similar references made by the Government in a number of other cases (see,\u00a0for instance, Yakovenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a015825/06, \u00a7 75, 25 October 2007; Koktysh v.

In performing that task, a prosecutor may demand that the relevant officials eliminate any breaches and the causes and conditions which have contributed to them (see paragraphs 58-59 above).\u00a0Even though the prosecutor undeniably has the power to play an important role in securing appropriate conditions of detention, a complaint to a prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy also because of the procedural shortcomings. Thus, such a complaint is not based on a detainee\u2019s personal right to obtain redress, and there is no requirement for such a complaint to be examined with his or her participation or for the prosecutor to ensure such participation (including an opportunity to comment on submissions by the governor of the detention facility requested by the prosecutor, to put questions and to make additional submissions). The matter would be dealt with entirely between the prosecutor and the relevant facility, and the detainee would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the prosecutor had dealt with his or her complaint (see, similarly, Ananyev and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 104 and 216, and Neshkov and Others, \u00a7 212, both cited above).",

The project stakeholders found that neither the existing mechanisms for alleged victims of ill-treatment to make complaints, nor the authorities\u2019 response to them, met the principles of independence and impartiality, promptness, sufficient involvement of the victim and transparency of civil control. In 2015 the project \u201cFurther Support for the Prison Reform in Ukraine\u201d was launched. It focused on improving the rehabilitation approach to the execution of criminal sentences and on strengthening procedures and practices for prison inspection and the handling of complaints raised by detained and convicted persons. One of the results of co-operation with the Council of Europe was also the preparation of a prison management booklet, a code of conduct for prison personnel and a handbook on the penal system and human rights, and development of standards for the assessment of performance by penal institutions.

Violations have been found with respect to a wide range of establishments in various regions of Ukraine.

Indeed, according to the Court\u2019s case management database, around 120 prima facie meritorious applications against Ukraine featuring conditions-of-detention complaints, are currently pending before the Court. The above figure, taken on its own, is indicative of the existence of a recurrent structural problem (see Ananyev and Others, \u00a7\u00a0184, and Varga and Others, \u00a7 98, both cited above). Moreover, the identification of a systemic problem that justifies the application of the pilot-judgment procedure is not necessarily linked only to the number of pending applications; the potential inflow of future similar applications is also an important factor (see Neshkov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 270). In this connection, the Court observes that as of 1 April 2019 the number of persons held in pre-trial detention facilities in Ukraine stood at 20,346 (see paragraph 76 above). As noted in a number of international and domestic reports (see paragraphs 28-33, 44, 46 and 48-50 above), many of those persons have been kept in overcrowded and otherwise inadequate conditions.

In Ignatov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a052-53) it further held that, despite the adoption in 2012 of the new CCP, breaches of Article 5 were recurrent in the case-law concerning Ukraine and considered that the most appropriate way to address them was to bring the reform of legislation and/or practice forward to ensure that domestic criminal procedure complied with Article\u00a05.",

Yet, those numbers are still higher than in 2013, 2014 and 2016, which suggests that the reduction in such applications is not stable and constant. The Court also notes that the number of requests rejected by courts doubled in 2018 as compared with 2012. It welcomes the steps taken by the Ukrainian courts to subject the requests for detention to a stricter scrutiny, which has ultimately led to the reduction of the number of persons in respect of whom detention requests are granted. Nevertheless, it notes that despite the steps taken by the courts, the number of persons held in Ukrainian SIZOs increased in 2019 as compared with 2015-17 (see\u00a0paragraphs 74-76 above), which may be explained by the increased recourse to extension orders or by other reasons (see paragraph 33 above). Whatever the reason for the increase in overcrowding in SIZOs, the Court would reiterate that Ukrainian prosecutors and other law-enforcement officers should be encouraged to further decrease the number of requests they make for initial detention and for its extension, except in the most serious cases. Prosecutors and judges should also be encouraged to use alternatives to detention as widely as possible.",

Although implementation of those measures may require substantial financial resources, a lack of resources cannot in principle justify conditions of detention that amount to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. It is incumbent on the respondent State to organise its penal system in such a way as to ensure compliance with that provision, regardless of any difficulties (see Neshkov and Others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027778, and Varga and Others, \u00a7 103 with further references, both cited above).",

While suggesting possible ways of dealing with some of the problems, the Court considers that to issue specific instructions on these points would be to exceed its judicial function. However, the position in relation to the general measures required to redress the systemic problem underlying the breach of Article 13 of the Convention found in the present case is different. The Court\u2019s findings under this provision require specific changes in Ukrainian legislation that will enable any person in the applicant\u2019s position to complain of a breach of Article\u00a03 resulting from poor detention conditions and obtain adequate relief for any such breach at domestic level. The Court has already identified the shortcomings in Ukrainian law and set out the Convention principles that should guide the authorities in setting up the domestic remedies required by Article 13 in this context (see paragraphs 112-125 above). The respondent State is certainly free, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, to choose the means to discharge its duty under Article 46 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Ananyev and Others, \u00a7 213, and Neshkov and Others, \u00a7\u00a0280, both cited above).

Such a remedy is particularly important in view of the principle of subsidiarity, so that aggrieved persons are not forced to submit to the Court complaints that require the finding of basic facts and the fixing of pecuniary compensation, both of which should be the domain of the domestic courts (see Ananyev and Others, \u00a7 221, with further references, and Neshkov and Others, \u00a7 285, both cited above).

As to the elements relevant for assessing the extent of the damage, the time spent by a detainee in conditions which are found to be in breach of Article 3 of the Convention is the most important factor (ibid., \u00a7 172). Lastly, a compensatory remedy must operate retrospectively, in the sense of providing redress in respect of breaches of Article 3 that pre-date its introduction, both in cases where the impugned situation has already come to an end with the detainee\u2019s release or in another way, and in cases where the detainee continues to be held in the conditions in issue (ibid., \u00a7 289).",

In paragraph\u00a0113 of the judgment the majority stated that for the purposes of the exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 35 of the Convention an applicant is required to exhaust an existing and effective preventive remedy, before being able to seek a monetary award through a compensatory remedy. This statement of principle is not relevant for the specific findings of the present judgment, as no effective preventive remedy exists in Ukraine. It is, however, a new development in the case law of the Court, which follows a somewhat similar obiter dictum in a recent Croatian case (see Ulemek v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 21613/16, \u00a7 86-87, 31 October 2019).

In other words, before bringing their complaints to the Court, they are first required to use properly the available and effective preventive remedy and then, if appropriate, the relevant compensatory remedy. If the use of an otherwise available and effective preventive remedy is futile in view of the brevity of an applicant\u2019s stay in inadequate conditions of detention, the only viable option would be a compensatory remedy allowing for a possibility to obtain redress for the past placement in such conditions. This period may depend on many factors related to the manner of operation of the domestic system of remedies and the nature of the alleged inadequacy of an applicant\u2019s conditions of detention. In any event, the compensatory remedy in this context should normally be used within six months of the end of the allegedly inadequate conditions of detention.\u201d",

Putting an end to a violation of Article 3, an absolute right, should clearly have priority. However, it is quite a leap from saying that the preventive remedy is extremely important, to making it a mandatory first remedy on which the possibility of seeking compensation depends. Trying to impose on both Governments and applicants a preference for the preventive remedy through our admissibility requirements is not without risks. My concern is that in trying to impose such a preference for the preventive remedy, the Court will confuse its case-law on admissibility and risk creating a procedural labyrinth for both the Governments, in designing the domestic remedies, and for the applicants in exhausting them.",

How long it took the applicant to complain, how long it took the authorities to react, whether the inhuman prison conditions are a systemic problem or not and what the available alternatives were for terminating a particular applicant\u2019s detention in inhuman conditions will all be relevant questions. The Court could decide whether, in a given case, waiting one, two or three months, before moving a person detained in inhuman conditions to another facility is acceptable or not. Then it could assess whether the specific domestic system refusing or allowing a claim for compensation, and the point at which the claim is determined, are compatible or incompatible with the Convention. Making such a decision in the abstract, however, is far more problematic.",

Malta [GC], [GC], no. 25642/94, ECHR 1999, \u00a7 39) and that it is for the applicant to select the remedy that is most appropriate in his or her case (see O\u2019Keeffe v. Ireland [GC], no.\u00a035810/09, ECHR 2014 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0110-111, and Nicolae Virgiliu T\u0103nase v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 41720/13, 25\u00a0June 2019 \u00a7 176). Giving priority to the preventive remedy, and taking the logic of the Court\u2019s case law on exhaustion of domestic remedies into account, would risk creating an unintended result - undermining the domestic compensation remedies. Both in individual cases and particularly in cases of systemic problems with prison conditions, the preventive remedy may not provide relief, even after a certain period of time. The Court having relegated the compensatory remedy to a subsidiary role, the result will be that the compensatory remedy will either be ineffective, as it cannot put a stop to the inhuman conditions, or duplicatory, or both. Thus, the Court will become the \u201cfirst instance\u201d for claims of inhuman prison conditions. Rather than strengthening the domestic remedies, it might find itself in a position of undermining a working compensation system at the domestic level, in violation of the principle of subsidiarity.",
