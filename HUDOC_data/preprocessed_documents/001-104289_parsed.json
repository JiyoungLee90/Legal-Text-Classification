While the applicant did not present, and indeed was not in a position to present, any direct independent evidence capable of confirming his allegation that his injuries were caused by the Ukrainian police officers, the Court considers that, viewed cumulatively, the medical evidence, the applicant\u2019s statements, the undisputed fact of his detention at Lviv police station and the lack of any plausible alternative explanation as to the origin of the applicant\u2019s injuries, give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the injuries were caused by the police.",

The minimum standards of effectiveness defined by the Court\u2019s case-law also include the requirements that the investigation must be independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny, and that the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness (see, for example, Isayeva and Others v.

The Court reiterates that the applicant is required to take sufficient steps to bring his complaints to the attention of the relevant domestic authorities and to challenge the alleged ineffectiveness of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Yaremenko v. , no. 32092/02, \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 66, 12 June 2008). In the instant case, however, it does not appear that the applicant\u2019s allegations were investigated, although under domestic law the relevant law-enforcement bodies are obliged to institute criminal proceedings in every case where evidence of a crime has been discovered and to take all necessary measures prescribed by law to establish that a crime has been committed and to identify and punish the offenders (see paragraph 24 above). Taking into account the specific circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that as the applicant had lodged his complaint and provided medical documents confirming the ill-treatment, the applicant had unequivocally raised his complaint with the Ukrainian authorities. The Court therefore rejects the Government\u2019s contentions that the applicant should make further representations to the relevant prosecutor\u2019s office under Article 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

Therefore the absence of any outcome of the main criminal proceedings also prevented the applicant from having effective recourse to these remedies, since in practice a civil claim for compensation would not be examined prior to a final determination of the facts in criminal proceedings (see Afanasyev v. , no. 38722/02, \u00a7 77, 5 April 2005)",

Furthermore, when a person is arrested with a view to extradition, the information given may be even less complete. However, this information should be provided to the detained in an adequate manner, so that the person knows why he has been deprived of his liberty (see Kaboulov v. , no. 41015/04, \u00a7\u00a7 143-144, 19 November 2009, with further references).",
