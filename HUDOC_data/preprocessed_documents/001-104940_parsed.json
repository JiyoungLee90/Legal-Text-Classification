Within the Convention system it has long been recognised that the right under Article\u00a03 not to be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic society. It is an absolute right, permitting of no exception in any circumstances (see Al-Adsani v. the  [GC], no. 35763/97, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2001XI). The Court also recalls that where an individual makes a credible assertion that he has suffered treatment infringing Article 3 at the hands of the police or other similar agents of the State, that provision, read in conjunction with the State\u2019s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to \u201csecure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in ... [the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. Such an investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Labita v.  [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2000IV).\u00a0According to the established case-law, this means that the domestic judicial authorities must on no account be prepared to let the physical or psychological suffering inflicted go unpunished. This is essential for maintaining the public\u2019s confidence in, and support for, the rule of law and for preventing any appearance of the authorities\u2019 tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts (see Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 65). The Court also recalls that when an agent of the State is accused of crimes that violate Article 3, any ensuing criminal proceedings and sentencing must not be time-barred and the granting of amnesty or pardon should not be permissible (see, mutatis mutandis, Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman v. , no. 32446/96, \u00a7 55, 2 November 2004).",
