On this basis the applicants claimed that at the time it was paid the award of RUR 89,522 was sufficient to pay for only 10.9 square metres, while the forfeited house measured 78.3 square metres. As for the social housing they received, they maintained that even in combination with the above award it was insufficient because of its unsatisfactory quality and size, and in any event they did not own it.

In any event, the Court observes that the amount which he had supposedly failed to receive (RUR\u00a013,600) would only be a fraction of the alleged losses. In the Court's view, the applicant's claims in this respect were not prima facie unreasonable or unsubstantiated. In particular, it sees no reason for the courts to disregard the court-commissioned expert evaluation of 9 August 2000, which estimated the value of the transferred house at RUR 245,000. Indeed, this evaluation was neither contested before the domestic courts, nor superseded by an alternative estimate.
