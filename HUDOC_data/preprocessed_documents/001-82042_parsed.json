During the subsequent proceedings the charges against the applicant were still brought under Article 168 \u00a7 2. The Court further observes that, as of October 1984, the Turkish National Assembly did not render any decision authorising the enforcement of a death penalty. It therefore concludes that, in the circumstances of the case, the enforcement of the death penalty against the applicant was illusory and that the applicant cannot be considered to have suffered ever-present and mounting anguish at the prospect of being executed, exposing him to treatment going beyond the threshold set by Article 3 of the Convention (see Osman v. Turkey (dec.), no. 4415/02,  6 October 2005; \u00c7\u0131nar v. Turkey, no. 17864/91, Commission decision of 5\u00a0September 1994, Decisions and Reports 79-A/B, p.5; Sertkaya v.
