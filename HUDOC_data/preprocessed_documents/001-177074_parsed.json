In the context of complaints relating to conditions of detention, as long as the applicant stays within the same type of detention facility, and provided the material conditions have remained substantially the same, it matters not that he or she was transferred between cells or wings within the same remand prison, from one remand prison to another within the same region or even to a remand prison in a different region (see Ananyev, cited above, \u00a7 77, with further references). Nevertheless, the Court reiterates that a significant change in the detention regime, even where it occurs within the same facility, has been held to put an end to the \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d, and the six-month time-limit would thus be calculated from that date: this would be the case, for instance, where the applicant has moved from a communal cell to solitary confinement or from an ordinary cell to the hospital wing (ibid., with further references).",

The applicant\u2019s sole complaint about the initial period of her detention concerned her placement in a cell together with adult inmates. That situation ended with the applicant\u2019s transfer to the juvenile female offenders\u2019 section of that prison. The complaints relating to her subsequent placement in that section concerned the material conditions of her detention in a cell which she shared only with juveniles, and her request to defer the sentence until the construction of a separate detention facility for juveniles. In the light of the above principles, the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaints and in view of the change of her detention regime, the Court does not find any special circumstances which would enable it to construe the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention as a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, Zakharin and Others v. Russia, no. 22458/04, \u00a7 115, 12 November 2015) rather than as two distinct periods. Consequently, the applicant\u2019s complaint about the initial period of her detention in a prison for adults, in a cell together with adult inmates, was submitted more than two years after the situation had come to an end. It follows that the complaint was introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

The assessment of this minimum is a relative one and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, inter alia, Bouyid\u00a0v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], no.\u00a023380/09, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2015, with further references, and Jalloh v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR\u00a02006IX).",

Insofar as the applicant complained about the authorities\u2019 refusal to release her pending the construction of a separate detention facility, the Court reiterates that Article\u00a03 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as laying down a general obligation to release a detainee (see, mutatis mutandis, Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a093). Furthermore, the Convention does not prohibit the States from subjecting convicted juveniles to imprisonment (see, mutatis mutandis, T.\u00a0v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a024724/94, \u00a7 97, 16 December 1999). The Court observes that both the domestic legislation in force at the material time (see paragraph 37 above) and the pertinent international documents (see paragraphs 42-45 above) allow for a certain degree of latitude relating to the manner in which the separation of juvenile and adult offenders is to be effectuated, including the placement of juvenile offenders in separate parts of institutions normally designed for adult inmates. In this connection, contrary to the applicant\u2019s complaint, her placement in the section for juvenile offenders does not, in and of itself, raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, D.G. v. Ireland, no. 39474/98, \u00a7\u00a097, ECHR 2002III, and contrast with G\u00fcve\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 70337/01, \u00a7\u00a098, ECHR 2009 (extracts)). The Court will therefore assess whether the conditions of detention at the juvenile female offenders\u2019 section, taken as a whole, complied with the State\u2019s obligation under Article 3 of the Convention to ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing him with the requisite medical assistance (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a094).",

Similarly, the claim concerning a malfunctioning washbasin causing humidity in the cell appears to have been a one-off, temporary problem (see paragraph 31 above). Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s complaint regarding the insufficiency of personal space in a cell measuring approximately 12-15 square metres and shared by a maximum of three juveniles, including the applicant, which thus entitled her to at least 4\u00a0square metres of personal space, does not raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (compare with Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106). In assessing the overall conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention, the Court takes note of the fact that, as it further transpires from the case file, the juvenile offenders\u2019 section offered an opportunity to freely consult the psychologist present on the premises, to shower freely (see paragraph 34 above), and to continue her education (see paragraph 35 above).",

However, the reasons for the judgment clearly indicate that the appellate court assessed, in the light of the relevant domestic law, the substantive findings contained in the reports. In particular, the Court of Appeal considered the respective reports concluding that the relevant findings were speculative (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above) and thus of no evidentiary value within the meaning of Article 371 \u00a7\u00a06 of the Code (see paragraph 40 above). Accordingly, the Court does not consider that the appellate court\u2019s reasoning to dismiss the two alternative forensic reports was of such an inconclusive nature as to disturb the overall fairness of the proceedings (compare again with Moreira Ferreira, cited above, \u00a7\u00a084, and see also Bochan v.

The Court observes that the Supreme Court of Georgia, unlike the lower courts, does not carry out a full review of a case, such as the assessment of facts and evidence relied on by the former, and the scope of its consideration is limited to specific legal matters (see paragraph\u00a041 above). In such circumstances, the Court does not consider that the cassation court\u2019s decision not to admit the appeal was disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Furthermore, as far as the reasoning of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision is concerned, the Court reiterates that where a cassation court refuses to accept a case because the legal grounds for it have not been made out, very limited reasoning may satisfy the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see Tchaghiashvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a034; Marini v.\u00a0Albania, no.\u00a03738/02, \u00a7\u00a0106, 18 December 2007; and Jaczk\u00f3 v.
