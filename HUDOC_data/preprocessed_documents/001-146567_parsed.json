A district court judge confirmed the validity of the searchandseizure operation within 24 hours of its having taken place. A number of computers and black boxes, the latter referred to in the searchand-seizure reports as \u201ccomputer systems\u201d, as well as one folder of paper documents, were seized in the presence of certifying witnesses during the operation.

They had not witnessed any physical force being used against any employee. Some of the VRPD officers had seen in the first office several women \u2013 none of whom bore any sign of injury \u2013 sitting on chairs guarded by two masked officers; in the entrance hall leading to the second office they had seen several company employees, some wearing handcuffs. While the VRPD officers had been waiting for the entrance doors to the offices to be opened, they had thought it likely that the company employees would delete most if not all of the information sought to be collected during the operation. All the employees had been calm and, at times, the officers had let them smoke outside the building before asking them to return inside to wait until the conclusion of the search-and-seizure operation. After officers had brought in another woman called A.G., acting as the manager of the company, ten computer systems were seized in her presence and in the presence of several certifying witnesses.

The conclusion of the medical expert was that the burns on her back were of first to second degree and it was plausible that they had been sustained from not less than four strikes with an electroshock baton at the time and in the circumstances described by the applicant. Mr Kosev had a jaw injury, injuries to both arms, an injury and an open wound in the abdominal area and six reddish strips on his abdomen. Mr Tsekov had three long bruises around his left armpit which could have been the result of pressure applied with non-sharp, hard objects, possibly squeezing by hands. The medical expert concluded that the bruises and injuries could have been caused by blows with or against a blunt object, and that the injuries described above had caused the second, third and fifth applicant pain and suffering, and the second applicant also temporary non-life-threatening health disorder.",

Upon appeal by the applicants, on 24 November 2008 the Varna Appellate Military Prosecutor returned the case with instructions that further acts be carried out (see paragraph 38 below, third sentence). More specifically, he observed that the file did not contain any documents showing that criminal proceedings had been opened against the applicants. Likewise, there was no information in the file showing that a search-and-seizure operation had been carried out and that it had been authorised by a judge. No information on file showed either that evidence had actually been found on the premises searched, or that there had been reasonable suspicion that evidence could have been found there. The prosecutor held that the scant assertions of several police officers who had been heard during the preliminary inquiry were not sufficient to establish the circumstances as recorded in the refusal to open criminal proceedings of 7 October 2008. Consequently, additional investigative acts had to be carried out. The higher prosecutor asked, in particular, that copies be collected of the orders for opening criminal proceedings on suspicion of violating intellectual property laws and for bringing charges on those grounds, as well as records of the search-and-seizure operation and \u201cother documents of importance for the inquiry\u201d.

She found that a special police operation aimed at gaining access to the offices of the company and seizing unlicensed software had been carried out on 18 June 2008. The initial information available had been that the company had connections with organised criminal groups and that its main activity was the collecting and disseminating of unlicensed software. Officers from CSCOC had been in charge of the operation; masked officers from CSCOC Sector \u201cOperational Intervention\u201d (\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u201c\u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u201d) and officers from different units of the Varna Regional Police Directorate, had taken part in the operation. Following a preparatory briefing session, at around 3.30 in the afternoon the officers had tried to enter the office premises of the company. Someone on the inside had locked the front door; following this, the company\u2019s employees had gone to their computers and started deleting data sought by the police. The employees had not complied with several orders by the police officers to open the doors. Acting upon the instructions to enter the company\u2019s premises rapidly and to establish full control over all individuals there without giving them the opportunity to erase data or to obstruct the seizure of computers, the CSCOC officers had cut the entrance door lock to the building, thus breaking into the premises. They had then ordered all the individuals found there to lie on the floor and refrain from touching the computer equipment. However, the company\u2019s employees had disobeyed the orders and, using different pretexts, had remained instead in front of their work stations, acting so as to delete information from the company\u2019s computers. The officers had used physical force, electroshock batons and handcuffs in respect of some of the employees to overcome their resistance and prevent them from touching the computers located on the premises. During the operation, some employees had been knocked over. Those findings had been corroborated by the statements of all persons, civilians and police officers, collected during the inquiry, as well as by documents submitted by the Varna Regional Police Directorate. The prosecutor further found, on the basis of medical reports, that some complainants (without naming them) had sustained injuries during the operation and that they could not identify the officers who had caused the injuries as the latter had been wearing masks. The prosecutor concluded that it had been established unequivocally during the inquiry that the injuries sustained by the civilians during the police operation of 18 June 2008 had been the result of the use of force and auxiliary means for restraint by police officers in order to overcome the complainants\u2019 resistance and to prevent them from destroying crucial evidence for the ongoing criminal proceedings. The officers had not exceeded their statutory right under section 72 of the Ministry of Interior Act to use force, as they had been faced with refusals to obey their orders. The material collected during the inquiry had shown that the searchandseizure operation had been carried out in accordance with the instructions of the supervising prosecutor and had been approved by a judge. The prosecutor concluded that the police officers involved had not committed a criminal offence.",

In the former, the weapon fires projectiles which attach to the person targeted at a short distance from each other, and an electrical discharge is generated. In the great majority of cases, this discharge provokes generalised muscular contraction which induces temporary paralysis and causes the person concerned to fall to the ground. In contrast, when the \u2018contact\u2019 mode is used, electrodes on the end of the weapon produce an electrical arc and when they are brought into contact with the person targeted the electrodes cause very intense, localised pain, with the possibility of burns to the skin. The CPT has strong reservations concerning this latter mode of use. Indeed, properly trained law enforcement officials will have many other control techniques available to them when they are in touching distance of a person who has to be brought under control.\u201d",

In that statement Amnesty International called on all governments and law enforcement agencies to either cease using Tasers and similar devices pending the results of thorough, independent studies, or limit their use to situations where officers would otherwise be justified in resorting to deadly force where no lesser alternatives are available. Strict guidelines and monitoring should govern all such use. The degree of tolerable risk involving Tasers, as with all weapons and restraint devices, must be weighed against the threat posed and ... the vast majority of people who have died after being struck by Tasers have been unarmed men who did not pose a threat of death or serious injury when they were electroshocked.

If the authorities could confine their reaction to such incidents solely to the payment of compensation, while not doing enough to identify and punish those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity.

Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV). Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions, and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 of the Convention, even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see Assenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 93; Van der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2003-II; Poltoratskiy v. Ukraine, no. 38812/97, \u00a7\u00a0130, ECHR 2003-V). In order to fall within the scope of Article 3, illtreatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see A, B and C v.\u00a0Ireland [GC], no. 25579/05, \u00a7 164, ECHR 2010-...; Hristozov and Others v.

Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, \u00a7\u00a063, 12 April 2007). When a person is confronted by the police or other State agents, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by the person\u2019s own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the rights set forth in Article 3 of the Convention (see Kop v. Turkey, no. , \u00a7 27, 20 October 2009; Rachwalski and Ferenc v. Poland, no. 47709/99, \u00a7 59, 28 July 2009; Timtik\u00a0v. Turkey, no. 12503/06, \u00a7 47, 9 November 2010). Such a strict proportionality approach has been accepted by the Court also in respect of situations in which an individual was already under the full control of the police (see, among others, Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, \u00a7\u00a7 68-78, ECHR 2000-XII; Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, \u00a7 30, Series A no.\u00a0269; Milan v. France, no. 7549/03, 24 January 2008, \u00a7 68). The Court attaches particular importance also to the type of injuries sustained and the circumstances in which force was used (see G\u00fczel \u015eahin and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. , \u00a7 50, 21 December 2006; Timtik v.

In addition, the forensic medical reports showed that the second, third and fifth applicants had been physically injured and, in particular, had sustained numerous bruises, abrasions and burns (see paragraph 22 above). Having regard to those injuries, as well as to the medical conclusions that they had caused the second, third and fifth applicants pain, suffering and temporary nonlifethreatening health disorders, the Court finds that the treatment and injuries were sufficiently serious to reach the minimum level of severity required for a complaint to pass the threshold of Article 3.",

The burden of proof rests on the authorities. They must account for the applicants\u2019 injuries by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of the circumstances in which they were caused. This is so in view of the fact that the authorities did not dispute that the injuries had been caused by the CSCOC officers and also taking into account the contents of the medical certificates of 19 June 2008, and the consistent description of the events by the second, third and fifth applicants.",

At the end of this preliminary inquiry the prosecutors decided not to prosecute the police officers, and so not to carry out a full investigation (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above), on the ground that the used force was permitted by the law and was exercised in order to overcome the applicants\u2019 failure to abide by the police orders. The position of both the prosecution and the Government in their observations to the Court was that the police had not exceeded their statutory right under section 72 of the Ministry of Interior Act to use force as they had faced refusals to obey their orders.",

The Court further notes that, while victims should be able to participate effectively in the investigation (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, no. 7511/13, \u00a7 480, 24 July 2014; Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a055721/07, \u00a7 167), the applicants were not involved during the inquiry because they could only effectively participate once a full investigation had been opened and legal rights had been granted to them (see paragraph 39 above). In addition, the Court is not convinced that a plausible explanation was provided during the inquiry of the circumstances in which the second, third and fifth applicants sustained their injuries during the police operation on 18 June 2008. In particular, the investigating authorities did not seek to establish whether there were video cameras in the company\u2019s offices as suggested by the employees (see paragraph 17 above) and, if so, whether they had been recording at the time of the operation to provide an objective picture of the events. Furthermore, the investigating authorities heard no independent witnesses; instead, they collected statements solely of police officers and employees present at the scene, but not of the certifying witnesses who had been called in during the operation to assist with the seizure of the computer equipment (see paragraph 9 above).",

                                                "content": "73.\u00a0\u00a0Although the terms of reference of the inquiry included the question who among the officers had used physical force and against whom of the employees (see paragraph 25 above), this was not determined. The questioning of the CSCOC police officers took place in Sofia by delegation at the request of the Varna investigation authorities (see paragraph 19 above). Taken together with the fact that at the time of the operation the CSCOC officers wore masks and had no identification signs, this made it impossible for the applicants to identify those directly involved in the use of force. This was also noted by the prosecutor (see paragraph 28 above). However, no further questions were posed and no further attempts were made with a view to clarifying their individual role in the events. The Court recalls that the investigation must be capable of leading to the identification of those responsible with a view to their punishment (see Stoev and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 41717/09, \u00a7 42, 11 March 2014; Nikolay Dimitrov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no , \u00a7 68, 27 September 2007, and Biser Kostov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no , \u00a7 78, 10 January 2012). In this connection the Court notes that it has earlier held that, where the circumstances are such that the authorities are obliged to deploy masked officers to effect an arrest, those officers should be required to visibly display some anonymous means of identification \u2013 for example a number or letter, thus allowing for their identification and questioning in the event of challenges to the manner in which the operation was conducted (see Hristovi v. Bulgaria, no. 42697/05, \u00a7 92, 11 October 2011). The Court further notes that the authorities did not establish whether specifically the second, third and fifth applicants disobeyed the CSCOC officers\u2019 orders and, if so, how exactly, or whether the officers themselves sustained any injuries as a result of the employees\u2019 disobedience and opposition. The Court finds it unsatisfactory and particularly striking that the prosecution authorities could conclude, without supporting evidence other than statements of police officers involved in the operation, that the employees actively had disobeyed the officers\u2019 orders in a manner which required the use of physical force. To make such an assumption runs contrary to the principle under Article 3 that, when the police confront an individual, recourse by them to physical force which had not been made strictly necessary by the individual\u2019s own conduct is in principle an infringement of his or her rights (see Assenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 104; Ka\u00e7ak and Ebin\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 54916/08, \u00a7 42, 7 January 2014).",

Similarly, the authorities have not tried to evaluate whether the manner in which the CSCOC officers treated the applicants, had been strictly necessary to the latter\u2019s conduct. The Court observes that even if some officers may have been under the impression, as they claimed, that the employees would attack them so as to justify the use of the electroshock weapons, the prosecution authorities did not attempt to establish whether such an attack had been attempted, or indeed intended, and whether those officers had clearly warned the people to whom electroshock discharges had been applied before applying them.",

The Court observes that electroshock discharges applied in contact mode (known also as \u201cdrive-stun\u201d mode) are known to cause intense pain and temporary incapacitation (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). It further notes that at the time of the facts Bulgarian law lacked any specific provisions about the use of electroshock devices by the police and did not lay down any instructions for their usage (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of the use of tear gas, Abdullah Ya\u015fa and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a044827/08, \u00a7 48, 16 July 2013; \u0130zci v. Turkey, no. 42606/05, \u00a7 64, 23 July 2013). The Regulations of the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior on the use of auxiliary means of restraint by police officers were issued in 2011, circumscribing the use of electroshock weapons to a limited number of situations (see paragraph 36 above) and following a warning. As the regulations were issued almost three years after the events, they were not applicable at the time of the operation.",

In that regard the Court observes that section 72 of the Ministry of Interior Act, as applicable at the time, allowed the use of force only as a last resort. Furthermore, section 73 of the same Act specified that the police could use force and auxiliary means for restraint only after giving a warning and had to discontinue it as soon as the objective for which it was being used was attained (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above). The Court further points out with respect to the use of electroshock weapons that the CPT, it its 20th General Report (see paragraph 41 above), expressed strong reservations in particular in respect of the use of electrical discharge weapons used in contact mode, as the ones that allegedly have been used on the second and third applicants. The Court, like the CPT, considers that properly trained law enforcement officers have many other control techniques available to them when they are in touching distance of a person who has to be brought under their control.",

Consequently, the Government have not furnished convincing arguments to justify the degree of force used against the second, third and fifth applicants (see, mutatis mutandis, Zelilof, cited above, \u00a7 51; Mustafa Aldemir v. Turkey, no. 53087/07, \u00a7\u00a7 49-51, 2 July 2013; Ka\u00e7ak and Ebin\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 54916/08, \u00a7 41, 7 January 2014). The Court is therefore satisfied that during the police operation of 18 June 2008 the police subjected the second, third and fifth applicants to treatment incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention and that the authorities failed to carry out an effective official investigation into the applicants\u2019 allegations to this effect. There has, therefore, been a violation of both the substantive and the procedural aspects of Article 3.",
