The Government and the Commission had mistakenly inferred from the preparatory work to this Article (Nytt juridisk arkiv II 1943, p.91) that the rule therein should be distinguished from the criminal law; this merely provided a description of the overlap between Article 5 and the relevant rules of the \"Penal Code\"(\"allm\u00e4nna strafflagen\")in force at the material time. The correct distinction was that between the general criminal law, embodied in the Penal Code, and the special criminal law, found in other statutes; Article 5 belonged to the latter category. He also pointed to certain commentaries by legal authors describing Article 5 offences as being of a criminal character. Moreover, the statutory provision governing which court had jurisdiction in such matters and laying down that these may be examined without there being any prosecution were to be found in \"Part II\" of the Code of Judicial Procedure, entitled \"On the procedure in criminal cases\" (see paragraph 21 above). In his submission, the applicable procedure was but a slightly modified version of the ordinary criminal procedure, though the national courts in the case had by error followed the rules in the 1946 Act on the Handling of Court Matters which did not apply to questions of punishment (see paragraph 21 above). The applicant in addition placed emphasis on the possibility of converting fines imposed under Article 5 into a term of imprisonment (see paragraph 24 above). Consequently, in his view, Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention was applicable to the criminal proceedings in which he was fined.",

                                        "content": "On the other hand, there are also a number of factors going the other way. As the Government and the Commission pointed out, when such conduct as described in Article 5 occurs, it is for the court sitting in the particular case to examine of its own motion and without the involvement of the public prosecutor whether there has been an offence under that Article (see paragraph 21 above). Moreover, the said Article 5 deals only with offences against the good order of court proceedings, whilst improper behaviour of a more serious character may be considered a criminal offence under the relevant rules of the Penal Code. The proceedings relating to the fines imposed on the applicant were based on the 1946 Act on the Handling of Court Matters (see paragraph 21 above); although the applicability of this Act is contested by the applicant, the Court cannot in this regard substitute its own views for those of the Swedish courts (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van der Leer v. the Netherlands judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 170-A, p. 12, para. 22; and the Margareta and Roger Andersson v. Sweden judgment of 25 February 1992, Series A no. 226-A, pp. 27-28, para. 82). Furthermore, unlike fines under the ordinary criminal law, the fines imposed under Article 5 were not income-based (see paragraph 20 above). Although this is not decisive, since in many criminal systems fines are not necessarily based on earnings, it is an indication that under Swedish law the fines in question are not viewed as an ordinary criminal-law sanction. Finally, in contrast to such sanction, the fines at issue were not entered on the police register.",

Rules enabling a court to sanction disorderly conduct in proceedings before it are a common feature of legal systems of the Contracting States. Such rules and sanctions derive from the indispensable power of a court to ensure the proper and orderly functioning of its own proceedings. Measures ordered by courts under such rules are more akin to the exercise of disciplinary powers than to the imposition of a punishment for commission of a criminal offence. It is, of course, open to States to bring what are considered to be more serious examples of disorderly conduct within the sphere of criminal law, but that has not been shown to be the case in the present instance as regards the fines imposed upon the applicant (see paragraph 33 above).",
