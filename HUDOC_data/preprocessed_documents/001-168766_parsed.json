It has already found that a detention order that mentions no grounds or time-limit for the application of a custodial measure cannot afford the applicant the adequate protection from arbitrariness which is an essential element of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Khudoyorov v.

The appeal court considered that defect to be a serious breach of the domestic law. The Court reiterates that the expressions \u201clawful\u201d and \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 essentially refer back to national law and state the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0124). Since the Russian court acknowledged that the order had been defective under the domestic law, the Court considers that the failure to specify a time-limit amounted to a \u201cgross and obvious irregularity\u201d in the order rendering the ensuing period of the applicant\u2019s detention unlawful (see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a011364/03, \u00a7 84, 9 July 2009).",
