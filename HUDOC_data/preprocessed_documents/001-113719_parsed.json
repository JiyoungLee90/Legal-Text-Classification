There were cancelled stamps in his passport certifying his exits from and entries to , and also stamps which were not authentic, according to an expert opinion of 4 February 2011. Two pages of his passport were missing. According to the FMS, the applicant\u2019s lengthy fouryear stay in Russia without returning to Kyrgyzstan, where his family had been living, had apparently shown that he had been avoiding entering his country because he was wanted by the law-enforcement bodies, and the fact that he had applied for asylum six months after the June 2010 events meant that he had not felt himself to be in any danger. The FMS found that the applicant had come to and stayed in  not because he wished to receive asylum but in order to find employment and improve his financial situation. He was not therefore eligible for refugee status.",

The report further describes the ongoing practice of arbitrary detention and torture and continued discriminatory patterns based on ethnic grounds. In this context, it highlights institutional shortcomings, lack of capacity and, in some instances, lack of political will to take necessary measures.\u201d It notes that ten months after the signature of the memorandums of understanding between prosecutors and human rights organisations in Osh Province, Osh City and Jalal-Abad Province setting out mechanisms for regular dialogue and cooperation on the prevention and prosecution for torture within the framework of public councils, little substantial progress has been made, due in part to the lack of trust on the part of human rights NGOs in the prosecutorial authorities and the overall lack of strategic engagement by all parties, posing challenges to the effective functioning of the public councils. As regards the installation of closed circuit television cameras in the temporary police detention centres in Jalal-Abad, the report notes that while they \u201ccan be an additional measure to prevent torture, it is not a panacea for the human rights violations observed in detention centres, given the potential ease with which the system can be bypassed or disabled.\u201d The report also stated as follows on the minorities\u2019 issue:",

The regional court\u2019s decision can be appealed against before the Russian Supreme Court within seven days of its delivery (Article 463 \u00a7 9).",

The problem must be viewed against the background of the rise of ethnonationalism in the politics of , particularly in the south, the growing inter-ethnic tensions between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks, continued discriminatory practices faced by Uzbeks at the institutional level and underrepresentation of Uzbeks in, inter alia, law-enforcement bodies and the judiciary.
