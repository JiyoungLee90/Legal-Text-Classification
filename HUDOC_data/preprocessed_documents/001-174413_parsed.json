Furthermore, it is to be noted that the Solicitor General initially acted upon the request of the association, which had not been a party to the restitution proceedings, and in his request he relied on new evidence provided by the association (see paragraphs 11-12 above). In view of the fact that the interests of third parties can be an important consideration when deciding on the reopening of proceedings which have become final, the Court considers it important that the acceptance of the Solicitor General\u2019s request by the Appeal Commission and the quashing of the final restitution decision was aimed at the protection of the rights of third parties (compare Protsenko v. Russia, no. 13151/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a032 and 33, 31 July 2008).",

Acting on the notice of the association, the Solicitor General argued that the land should not have been restored to the applicant\u2019s possession since it had been developed building land and the applicant\u2019s predecessor had obtained compensation (see paragraph 12 above). The applicant\u2019s observations submitted in reply did not go beyond these grounds (see paragraph 13 above). The Administrative Court, on the other hand, found that there was a legal obstacle to the enforcement of the restitution order, given that the land in question was situated on the lakeshore and it was to be considered, accordingly to be \u201cof general interest\u201d (see paragraph 17 above). Such property, as provided by section 10 of the Restitution Act, cannot be restored into possession but compensation should be awarded (see paragraph 37 above).",

In so doing the Administrative Court advanced reasons of a substantial and compelling character that justify the extraordinary quashing of the final restitution order (compare Vikentijevik, cited above, \u00a7 72).",

The reasons for its inactivity remain unclear. However, the Court is of the opinion that the \u201cmanifest omission\u201d of the Solicitor General in the ordinary restitution proceedings cannot be interpreted, in the present case, as a bar to the impugned intervention, the aim of which was to correct fundamental errors. To consider otherwise would be contrary to the principle of the proper administration of justice. Given the particular circumstances of the case, the Court is not convinced that the errors of the Restitution Commission could be neutralised or corrected by any other means than those applied therein (compare Vikentijevik, cited above, \u00a7 74).",
