The case originated in an application (no. 50636/09) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Ms Marija Božić (“the applicant”), on 24 August 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mrs M. Trninić, a lawyer practising in Slavonski Brod. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Štefica Stažnik.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that she had been deprived of her pension.
On 24 January 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born on 18 November 1940 and lives in Lipovača, Croatia.
In the period between 1 January 1980 and 30 November 1992 the applicant was insured by the Croatian Pension Fund (Hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje) as an agricultural entrepreneur. She lived in Klokočevik, near Slavonski Brod.
In November 1992 the applicant left Klokočevik and moved to Lipovača, part of the so-called “Serbian Independent Region of Krajina”, a self-proclaimed entity established on the territory of Croatia. She stopped contributing to the Croatian Pension Fund.
On 6 April 1998 the Slavonski Brod Office of the Croatian Pension Fund (Hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje, Područna služba u Slavonskom Brodu) accepted a payment by the applicant of 4,978 Croatian kunas (HRK) in respect of pension contributions for the period from 30 November 1992 to 31 December 1994. It issued a certificate of payment, which read as follows:
“This is to confirm that on 6 April 1998 the person contracted to pay contributions, BOŽIĆ MARIJA, made a full payment of the contributions due to the [pension fund]. This certificate ... serves as evidence of the registration of the pension-qualifying period in the central register, and may not be used for other purposes.
For the insured person the [period concerned is from] 1 January 1980 [to] 31 December 1994.
FOR THE REGISTRATION OF THE PENSION-QUALIFYING PERIOD”
On 21 November 2000 the Slavonski Brod Office of the Croatian Pension Fund accepted another payment by the applicant of HRK 11,663 in respect of pension contributions for the period from 1 January 1995 to 31 May 2000, and issued a certificate in that respect.
On 22 November 2000 the applicant, having met the age criteria applicable at the time, asked the Croatian Pension Fund to grant her pension.
On 12 April 2002 the Slavonski Brod Office of the Croatian Pension Fund decided of its own motion that the applicant had ceased to have the status of an insured person as of 30 November 1992, when she had wound up her agricultural activities.
On 22 April 2002 the Slavonski Brod Office of the Croatian Pension Fund further decided to refuse the applicant’s request to grant her pension. It found that the applicant’s pension-qualifying period amounted to twelve years and eleven months, namely the period from January 1980 to November 1992, which was insufficient to obtain a pension. The applicant did not appeal against that decision. Instead, in April 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal against the first decision of the Slavonski Brod Office of the Croatian Pension Fund (see paragraph 11 above), arguing, inter alia, that she had followed the instructions of the Croatian Pension Fund and had paid sufficient pension contributions to qualify for a pension.
On 13 May 2002 the Central Office of the Croatian Pension Fund (Hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje, Središnja služba) dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision concerning her status, without referring to the applicant’s contribution payments. The applicant lodged an action in the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske) against that decision, reiterating her previous arguments.
On 28 September 2006 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s action as without merit. The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows:
“It is not clear from the file whether the applicant continued to pursue the agricultural activity on the occupied territory, and even if she did, she would have been insured as an agricultural entrepreneur with the competent bodies operating on the occupied territory. Hence, the applicant should have submitted a request for recognition of the pension-qualifying period pursuant to the ... Validation Act ...
Since the administrative action itself reveals that the plaintiff left the territory where she had been living and working as an agricultural entrepreneur, which was the ground for her pension insurance, the defendant body correctly established the relevant facts and applied the relevant law when dismissing the plaintiff’s appeal against the decision of the first-instance administrative body, which had found that the applicant had lost the status of an insured person because she had failed to meet the statutory conditions for it.
The plaintiff’s objection that she had paid pension contributions based on the request of the Croatian Pension Fund has no influence on the correctness of the impugned decision because she left her residence where she had had the status of an agricultural entrepreneur.”
The applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) against that judgment, reiterating her previous arguments and invoking, inter alia, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
On 8 April 2009 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint as without merit, endorsing the reasoning of the lower authorities. The relevant part of that decision read as follows:
“As regards the alleged violation of the constitutionally guaranteed right of ownership (Article 48 § 1 of the Constitution) and the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention ...), the Constitutional Court finds that the above-mentioned rights of the applicant have not and could not have been violated by the impugned acts terminating her status as an insured person – agricultural entrepreneur.”
That decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 22 April 2009.
On 23 January 2012 the applicant instituted administrative proceedings with the Vukovar Office of the Croatian Pension Fund (Hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje, Područna služba u Vukovaru). She requested, inter alia, that her request for a pension be reconsidered in the light of her contributions between 1980 and 2000, that the pension-qualifying period from 1 December 1992 to 31 December 1994 be formally validated (see paragraph 29 below), and that she be paid a pension as of 19 November 2000.
On 22 March 2012 the Vukovar Office of the Croatian Pension Fund rendered two decisions. First, it refused the applicant’s request for a pension, repeating the arguments of the Slavonski Brod Office of the Croatian Pension Fund (see paragraph 11 above). Secondly, it refused the applicant’s request for validation of the pension-qualifying period from 1 December 1992 to 31 December 1994, arguing that she had failed to prove her status as an agricultural entrepreneur on the territory of the Republic of Croatia that had been under the United Nations authority (corresponding to the “Serbian Independent Region of Krajina”). The applicant appealed against both decisions.
On 12 December 2012 the Central Office of the Croatian Pension Fund accepted the applicant’s appeal against the first decision. It annulled the decision and decided that the period from 1 January 1980 to 31 May 2000 should be deemed as the applicant’s agricultural entrepreneur pension-qualifying period (mirovinski staž individualnog poljoprivrednika), thereby recognising the supplementary contributions paid by her. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:
“The appeal is accepted and the decision of the ... Vukovar Office ... of 22 March 2012 is hereby annulled.
Marija Božić, born on 18 November 1940, was insured for the purposes of a pension as an agricultural entrepreneur from 1 January 1980 to 31 May 2000.
...
As it is not disputed that the Slavonski Brod Office of the Croatian Pension Fund calculated the due amount of the applicant’s pension contributions on 21 November 2000, for the period from 1 January 1980 to 31 May 2000, and that the applicant paid those contributions on the same day to the Slavonski Brod Office, which in return issued a certificate, it has been decided as stated in the operative part of this decision.”
On 13 December 2012 the Central Office of the Croatian Pension Fund accepted the applicant’s appeal against the second decision, annulled it but held that the issue covered by the Vukovar Office’s second decision of 22 March 2012 had already been settled in its decision of 12 December 2012.
In view of the above decisions of the Central Office of the Croatian Pension Fund, the applicant returned to the Vukovar Office of the Croatian Pension Fund with a request for a pension. On 21 March 2013 the Vukovar Office of the Croatian Pension Fund decided that the applicant had the right to a pension as of 1 August 2011. In setting that date it relied on section 32(3) of the Pension Insurance Act (see paragraph 28 below) and took 24 January 2012 (see paragraph 17 above) as the date on which the applicant had submitted her request. That decision was served on the applicant on 26 March 2013 and on the applicant’s representative on 23 May 2013.
The Pension and Disability Insurance for Agricultural Entrepreneurs Act (Zakon o mirovinskom i invalidskom osiguranju individualnih poljoprivrednika, Official Gazette nos. 26/1983, 57/1983, 47/1986, 40/1990 and 96/1993) regulated the pension insurance of agricultural entrepreneurs until 31 December 1998, when the Act was repealed. It provided agricultural entrepreneurs with the opportunity to pay for any missing pension-qualifying period (dokup staža) if they had been agricultural entrepreneurs between 1 October 1960 and 1 January 1980 and had not met the threshold for an old-age pension (sixty years of age and a fifteen-year pension-qualifying period (mirovinski staž)). Requests for such payments should have been made by 31 December 1995.
 23.  Section 62(1) in conjunction with section 11(4) of that Act provided that agricultural entrepreneurs would lose their status of pension-insured persons if, inter alia, they wound up their agricultural activities.
The opportunity to pay for any missing years was created for workers in 1990, with the enactment of the Employment Relations Act (Zakon o radnim odnosima, Official Gazette nos. 19/1990, 28/1990 (corrigendum), 19/1992, 25/1992 (consolidated text), 26/1993 and 29/1994), which came into force on 11 May 1990. This Act was repealed when the new Employment Act (Zakon o radu, Official Gazette no. 38/1995) came into force on 1 January 1996. Under the new Act it was no longer possible for most categories of pension-insured persons to pay for any missing years. Subsequently, it was possible to pay the higher pension amount (dokup mirovine), but only if the insured person was eligible for early retirement or an old-age pension.
The Pension Insurance Act (Zakon o mirovinskom osiguranju, Official Gazette nos. 102/1998, 127/2000, 59/2001, 109/2001, 147/2002, 117/2003, 30/2004, 177/2004, 92/2005, 79/2007, 35/2008, 40/2010, 121/2010, 130/2010 – consolidated version, 61/2011, 114/2011, 76/2012 and 112/2013) came into force on 1 January 1999 and regulates the pension insurance of, inter alia, agricultural entrepreneurs. Over the years it has been amended on numerous occasions.
In 2000, when the applicant submitted her pension request, section 30 provided that women would be entitled to an old-age pension when they reached sixty years of age and had paid fifteen years’ worth of contributions.
Section 31 provided that women would be entitled to early retirement when they reached fifty-five years of age and had paid thirty years’ worth of contributions.
The relevant part of section 32 reads as follows:
“1.  The insured person shall have the right to an old-age or early-retirement pension from the date when the conditions for retirement have been met. The right to a pension can be acquired after the insurance has been terminated.
An application for an old-age or early-retirement pension can be lodged two months before the termination of the insurance at the earliest.
When the right to an old-age or early-retirement pension is being acquired following the application of the insured person after termination of the insurance, the insured person has the right to a pension from the first day after the termination of the insurance if the application has been lodged within six months from the date of the termination of the insurance. If the application was lodged after the aforementioned deadline, the insured person has the right to a pension from the first day of the month following the lodging and application and for the preceding six months.”
Section 1 of the Validation Act (Zakon o konvalidaciji, Official Gazette no. 104/97) provides that all individual acts and decisions issued by various bodies or legal persons exercising public authority in matters of a judicial or administrative nature in the parts of the Republic of Croatia that were under the protection and authority of the United Nations must be validated by that Act, in accordance with the Constitution, the Constitutional Act on human rights and freedoms and the rights of ethnic and national communities or minorities in Croatia, and other statutes.
Section 4 of the Ordinance on the Validation Procedure of Pension Scheme Decisions (Pravilnik o postupku konvalidiranja odluka i pojedinačnih akata iz područja mirovinskog osiguranja, Official Gazette no. 53/08) provides, inter alia, that the pension-qualifying period for agricultural entrepreneurs will be validated if they were insured with pension insurance bodies operating in the parts of the Republic of Croatia that were under the protection and authority of the United Nations.
