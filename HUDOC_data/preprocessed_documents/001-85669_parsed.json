It attached importance to the serious nature of those offences and the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant.

It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present one concerning organised criminal groups, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other coaccused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is in the nature of things often particularly high.
