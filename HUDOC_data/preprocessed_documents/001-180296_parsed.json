In view of the problems caused by the noise, the City Council resolved on 22\u00a0December 1983 not to permit any more licensed premises to open in the area. However, the resolution was never implemented and new licences were granted.

The Court therefore finds that there was a causal link between the violation of the Convention and the pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant. He is therefore entitled to an award under that head. In addition, the authorities\u2019 failure to take action undeniably caused the applicant non-pecuniary damage for which he should also receive compensation. Ruling on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41, the Court awards the applicant the amount of EUR 7,000 to cover both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.
