However, at the material time the real estate had been sold to V. (see paragraphs 18 \u2013 21 above). Moreover, even assuming there had been no involvement of V.'s property interests, the outcome of the enforcement proceedings would be unknown as it would be dependant on many factors, including the success of the public auction. The Court further notes that the applicant company failed to submit any estimations of the price for which the real estate could be reasonably sold at the relevant time. In view of the above, the Court considers that the claim for pecuniary damage is unsubstantiated.\u00a0It therefore rejects the claim.",
