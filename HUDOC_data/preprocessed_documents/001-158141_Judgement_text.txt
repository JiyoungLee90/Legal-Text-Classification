The case originated in an application (no. 37927/12) against the Republic of Slovenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Luka Arapović (“the applicant”), on 11 June 2012.
The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs N. Pintar Gosenca, State Attorney.
On 13 November 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
.  The Government submitted a unilateral declaration which did not offer sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights as defined in Article 37 § 1 the Convention had been fulfilled (see Prencipe v. Monaco, no. 43376/06, §§ 62-63, 16 July 2009). The Court was therefore required to continue the examination of the case.
The applicant was born in 1985 and lives in Ljubljana.
He was detained in the remand section of Ljubljana prison from 1 June 2011 to 16 July 2012.
He was held in cell no. 82 measuring 16.37 square metres (not including a separate 1.82 square metres sanitary facility). For two hundred and twelve days he was held therein with four other inmates with 3.27 square metres of personal space and for nine days he was held therein with five other inmates with 2.73 square metres of personal space. For one hundred and ninety days he shared the cell with two or three other inmates with more than 4 square metres of personal space.
The cell for six detainees, where the applicant was held, was equipped with three bunk beds with a total of six sleeping places, one large and one small table, six chairs and a set of cupboards for each of the detainees. Detainees could freely open or close windows in cells. On 14 November 2011 the sixth bed was removed.
As regards the general characteristics of the cells in the remand section of Ljubljana prison, material conditions inside the cells and sanitary conditions, see the judgment in Mandić and Jović v. Slovenia, nos. 5774/10 and 5985/10, §§ 10 to 23, 20 October 2011.
As to the out-of-cell time in the remand section, the Court found in the aforementioned judgment that detainees in the remand section were confined to their cells day and night, save for two hours of daily outdoor exercise, and an additional two hours per week in a recreation room (see Mandić and Jović, cited above, § 78). According to the information supplied by the Government in the present case, on 9 February 2011 the time spent outdoors was extended to two hours and a half per day and in November 2011 the outside yard was covered by a roof.
As regards the cell temperature, the data provided by the Government showed that the average temperature in the cells in the late afternoon (5-5.30 p.m.) in July and August 2011 had been approximately 27oC, exceeding 30oC on ten days and in the second half of June and the first half of July 2012 it had been 30oC, exceeding 30oC on twelve days.
