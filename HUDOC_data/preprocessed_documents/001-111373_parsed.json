It contended that the provisions in question were of a legal nature and had been introduced by an authority which had no law-making powers.

This was the direct result of the wording of the former Article 1770 octies, according to which it was the revised tax assessment alone that triggered the application of the penalty. Contrary to what the Government said concerning the powers of the administrative authorities, the tax inspectors had no choice but to apply the penalty in question. The only way to avoid such automatic application was if the penalty was cancelled or a compromise was reached (Article L. 247 of the Code of Tax Procedure), which the authorities accepted only at their discretion and subject to the taxpayer promising not to take legal action.

In reply to the Government\u2019s argument that there was no point in giving the courts the power to vary the fine, the applicant company pointed out that it had been the victim of certain salesmen who had undertaken (some in writing) to opt for the ordinary capital-gains scheme, but had failed to honour their commitment, which had obliged the authorities to increase its taxes as the purchaser, even though it had acted in good faith.

According to the established case-law of the Conseil d\u2019Etat, while their hands were tied when it came to establishing and collecting taxes in compliance with the legal rules, they were not when it came to tax penalties (see, for administrative sanctions, CE 8 January 1971, Sieur Gallon, Recueil Lebon, p. 21, and for tax penalties, CE 1 October 1979, Association pour l\u2019unification du christianisme mondial, RJF 11/99, p. 837). Furthermore, the tax authorities had the power to vary or cancel a fine to allow for exceptional situations, as provided for in Article L. 247 of the Code of Tax Procedure. Also, the taxpayer had the possibility to apply for judicial review of an administrative refusal to cancel a fine.",

It was true that if the court discharged the taxpayer from liability for unpaid tax, the penalties automatically followed suit, but they could be reduced or cancelled even if the unpaid tax remained due. The Government pointed out that the taxpayer could challenge the fines on the grounds of the procedure followed in imposing them, or their lawfulness. The court ruled separately on the penalties and verified that the legal requirements had been complied with. In particular it examined the notions of \u201cbad faith\u201d (mauvaise foi in French, now called manquement d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 or \u201cwilful disregard\u201d) and \u201cdeception\u201d (man\u0153uvres frauduleuses), which incurred different levels of penalty. There were numerous examples where the penalty for lack of good faith had been reduced or cancelled regardless of whether or not the tax owed was upheld. Where infringements of the tax on works of art under the General Tax Code were concerned, the number of actions was too small to tell whether the courts would adopt a strictly objective approach to the facts or take the circumstances of the error into account.",

Firstly, they pointed out that the law itself provided for the sanctions to be proportionate to the misconduct, in so far as the fine was a percentage of the unpaid tax and its level was relatively moderate, as it had been reduced from 100% to 25% of the unpaid amount by the order of 7 December 2005, and that reduction had been applied to the applicant company in the course of the proceedings. The Government pointed out that the Court had already had occasion to find that this approach met the requirements of Article 6, and cited Malige v. France (23\u00a0September 1998, \u00a7 49, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VII), and the Commission\u2019s decision in Taddei v. France (no.\u00a036118/97, Commission decision of 29 June 1998, Decisions and Reports 94-B, p. 108). They added that in the present case the Conseil d\u2019Etat had based itself on the Malige judgment in finding that Article 6 had not been violated, after having reviewed the proportionality of the fine, which was the only penalty provided for in respect of the tax on works of art. The Government referred in this connection to the points system for driving licences, where each breach of the Road Traffic Code led to the loss of a specific number of points.",

The points system for driving licences which the Court endorsed in Malige, where a fixed number of points was removed for each type of offence, fell into the same category. In matters of tax penalties the law generally provided either for a small scale of different rates of fine for each type of offence, or for a single rate. The situation differed from the sanctions imposed in the economic field by independent administrative authorities, in the interests of \u201cdecriminalisation\u201d, such mechanisms being marked by a potential form of punishment that, although infrequent, was intended to be exemplary, and by texts that provided for high maximum fines coupled with the possibility of reducing them.",

In French law the tax courts were judicial bodies with full jurisdiction, which meant that they checked not only the facts but also the law, and that they had the power to set aside administrative decisions, but also to determine the amount of tax due or the penalty to be applied in accordance with and within the limits of the law. Where penalties were concerned, the courts verified the existence of the offence, then upheld the penalty if the offence was established, or cancelled it if it was not. They could also apply a lower rate where they considered appropriate (in respect of penalties for bad faith, for example), or agree to change one penalty for another at the request of the administrative authorities if certain conditions were met.",
