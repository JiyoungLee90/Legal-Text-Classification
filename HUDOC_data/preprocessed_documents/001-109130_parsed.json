While originally the injuries were classified as grievous, the experts later reclassified them as being of medium severity. Their consequences were described as follows: lasting health deterioration, namely, a cerebral cicatrix, liquor hypertension syndrome, right-side sensory and motor impairment, and a convulsive disorder, which all together had led to the loss by the applicant of thirty per cent of his general working capacity and fifty per cent of his professional working capacity. The last forensic medical examination, which was conducted between 5 May and 14 June 2007, established that the applicant\u2019s disability was a direct result of the injuries sustained by him in October 1999.",

Having regard to the reasons for these remittals, and given the investigators\u2019 disregard for the instructions of the higher-level prosecutors, which seemed to be a regular practice (see paragraph 21 above), the Court considers that such remittals disclose serious deficiencies in the investigation being a structural problem in Ukraine (see Aleksandr Smirnov v.

As can be seen from the case-file materials, Mr Kristenko represented the applicant throughout the proceedings before the Court and is therefore entitled to seek payment of his fees under the contract. Accordingly, the Court considers those fees to have been \u201cactually incurred\u201d (see Tebieti M\u00fchafize Cemiyyeti and Israfilov v. Azerbaijan, no. 37083/03, \u00a7 106, 8 October 2009). However, the Court considers that the claim is excessive and awards it in part, in the amount of EUR 2,000, less EUR 850 as the sum received by way of legal aid, and plus any value-added tax that may be chargeable to the applicant.",
