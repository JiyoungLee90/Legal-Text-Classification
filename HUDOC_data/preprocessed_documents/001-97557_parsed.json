In particular, the Court has held that the absence of any grounds given by judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time is incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see also Nakhmanovich v.

However, the Court reiterates in this respect that the authorities cannot justify continuing detention by a mere reference to such risks; they must refer to specific facts concerning the applicant's behaviour, his personal circumstances, and so on (see Vlasov, cited above, \u00a7 108). Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005).",

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v. France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 273-B, and Toth v. Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series A no. 224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee and Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v. the United Kingdom, no. 50272/99, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2003-IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.
