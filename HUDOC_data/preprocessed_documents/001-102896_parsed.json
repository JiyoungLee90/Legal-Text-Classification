It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. The Court has previously had before it cases in which it has found that there has been treatment which could only be described as torture (see Aksoy, cited above, \u00a7 64; Ayd\u0131n v. Turkey, 25 September 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84, Reports\u00a01997VI; Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 105, ECHR\u00a01999V, and, more recently, Maslova and Nalbandov v.

The acts complained of were such as to arouse in the applicant feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him and possibly breaking his physical and moral resistance. In any event in respect of persons deprived of their liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by their own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 99).",

In particular, the applicant submitted that he had been severely beaten and subjected to other forms of ill-treatment which caused injuries and other serious health problems, this not being refuted by the Government.

To minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5 (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.

More importantly, the Court cannot but observe that the applicant's submissions concerning those contacts are very vague and confusing. He was able neither to indicate particular dates when the contacts had allegedly taken place, nor to give any further details concerning them, this being even more striking given his extremely detailed and consistent submissions concerning the circumstances of his ill-treatment and detention, as examined by the Court above. It is also noted that, although, in his submission, some of the alleged incidents were witnessed by third persons, including his relatives, no evidence, such as statements from those persons, was adduced to confirm his allegations. Lastly, the Court finds it surprising that, although his statements referring to the alleged intimidation had been made in 2005 and 2006, it was only two years later that he brought the issue to its attention, which fact also does not add to the overall credibility of his submissions.",
