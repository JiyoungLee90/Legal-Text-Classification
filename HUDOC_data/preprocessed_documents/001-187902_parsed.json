Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV). In that connection, the Court refers to its finding made in the context of a complaint under Article 13 of the Convention, that in the context of Turkish administrative law as in force at the material time there were no domestic remedies whereby claimants could increase the initial amount of their claims in the course of the proceedings (see Ok\u00e7u v.\u00a0Turkey, no 39515/03, \u00a7\u00a7 27-32 and 64, 21 July 2009).

The Court finds that this principle applies in the present case as well. Consequently, it considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be the reopening of the proceedings, to be held in accordance with the requirements of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, should the applicant so request. On the other hand, the Court considers that the applicant must have suffered distress and frustration in view of the violation found. It therefore awards him EUR\u00a02,500 on account of non-pecuniary damage.",

Romania [GC], no.\u00a076943/11, \u00a7 187, 29 November 2016). In the present case, the applicant has not substantiated his claim for costs and expenses.
