She argued in particular that the refusal of the Director of the National Security Service to grant her security clearance had resulted in her automatic dismissal.

However, the legal framework excluded such scrutiny. Although the applicant acknowledged that considerations relating to national security could in some cases justify restrictions on the right of access to a court, she had been placed in a position whereby no justification could be found for the lack of competence of the courts to examine the grounds on which she had been refused access to classified information, which had inevitably resulted in the termination of her employment contract.",

The applicant\u2019s complaint concerned in essence a right that could not be seen as a \u201ccivil\u201d right. In particular, the right to be granted access to security clearance involves the exercise of powers conferred by public law and depends on the special duty of trust and loyalty that is required of public servants such as the applicant towards their employer. Therefore, that right could not have an effect on questions relating to the applicant\u2019s pecuniary interests under her employment contract. Moreover, the lack of access to a court in the present case was in conformity with the criteria of the Court\u2019s case-law: it was provided for explicitly by the domestic law (see paragraph 18 above) and was justified on objective grounds given the State\u2019s duty to protect national security. The applicant had been an employee of the National Security Service and had been \u2013 given the high level of sensitivity of the information accessible within this institution \u2013 required to have security clearance. That requirement had applied not only to the applicant but to all persons employed in similar positions.

One of those guarantees being that the \u201ctribunal\u201d dealing with the case must have jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before it (see, among other authorities, Terra Woningen B.V. v. the Netherlands, 17 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a052, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI; Putter v.

However, it appears that at no stage of those proceedings did the courts concern themselves with determining whether there had existed a basis for refusing the applicant security clearance, even though that refusal had rendered her dismissal inevitable (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above). The applicant was not informed of the factual circumstances taken into account when deciding that security clearance would be refused; nor could she argue that the information on which that decision was based was correct or incorrect, complete or incomplete, and reliable or unreliable. The conclusion of the courts that they were bound by the formal refusal to grant access to classified information and that they could not scrutinise it in any way was in conformity with the applicable domestic law (see paragraph 18 above). This Court, for its part, finds that in their exclusive reliance on that refusal in the applicant\u2019s case the domestic courts refused independently to scrutinise a point which was crucial for the determination of the case, and thus deprived themselves of jurisdiction to examine the dispute before them (see, mutatis mutandis, I.D. v. Bulgaria, no. 43578/98, \u00a7 50, 28 April 2005, and Fazliyski, cited above, \u00a7 59). The Court considers at the same time that the refusal to provide security clearance to the applicant and the preceding security check were part of the standard internal procedure of the applicant\u2019s employer, the National Security Service which is part of the executive branch. Thus, it could not be said that this body safeguarded the guarantees of Article 6. The Court must therefore examine whether the refusal of the National Security Service was itself subject to direct review by a court (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, \u00a7 104; Obermeier, cited above \u00a7 70; I.D., cited above, \u00a7 53; and Fazliyski, cited above, \u00a7 61).

The company\u2019s application for judicial review was dismissed. The Court found that the judicial review proceedings in the case had never led to a full scrutiny of the factual basis of the certificate; such scrutiny could have affirmed that the decision to refuse the contract was indeed \u201can act done for the safeguarding of national security or the protection of public safety or public order\u201d. The Court considered that it should be assessed whether there existed a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the concerns for the protection of national security invoked by the authorities and the impact which the means they employed to this end had had on the company\u2019s right of access to a court. The Court found that the conclusive nature of the certificate \u2013 that is to say there could be no independent judicial scrutiny of the facts grounding its issuance \u2013 constituted a disproportionate restriction on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court (see Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 76-79).",
