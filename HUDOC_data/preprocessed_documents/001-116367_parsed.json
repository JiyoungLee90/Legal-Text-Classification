It follows that while the Court acknowledges the role of the national courts in the choice of appropriate sanctions for ill-treatment by State agents, it must retain its supervisory function and intervene in cases of manifest disproportion between the gravity of the act and the punishment imposed, especially when the case is not in the hands of an impartial tribunal.",

It is for each State to equip itself with legal instruments which are adequate and sufficient to ensure the fulfilment of positive obligations imposed upon the State. The Court\u2019s only task is to examine whether the measures applied by the authorities in the present case were adequate and sufficient (see Ruianu\u00a0v.\u00a0Romania, no. 34647/97, \u00a7\u00a066, 17\u00a0June\u00a02003). In cases such as the present one, which necessitate actions by a debtor who is a private person, the State, as the depository of public authority, has to act diligently in order to assist a creditor with the execution of a judgment (see Fociac\u00a0v.\u00a0Romania, no. 2577/02, \u00a7 70, 3\u00a0February\u00a02005).",
