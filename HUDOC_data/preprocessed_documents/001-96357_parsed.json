The cell had a window thirty centimetres wide and forty centimetres long. The cell was lit by a small bulb. In the absence of artificial ventilation in the cell it was hard to breathe owing to the thick smoke and the humidity. The cell was swarming with insects. There was no heating in winter. There was no lavatory pan or wash-bowl. Inmates used a bucket as a lavatory pan. They were allowed to clean the bucket twice a day: early in the morning and at about 6 p.m. There was no shower room in the detention unit. Inmates were provided with food once a day.

Relying on colour photographs of the cells, the applicant submitted that the windows were covered with metal blinds which blocked access to natural light and air. In certain cells the windows were not glazed and inmates used plastic film or blankets to cover them in winter. It was impossible to take a shower as inmates were given only fifteen minutes and two to three men had to use one shower head at the same time. That situation was further aggravated by the fact that inmates could only take a shower once every two weeks. Inmates had to wash and dry their laundry indoors, creating excessive humidity in the cells. They were also allowed to smoke in the cells. The lavatory pan was separated from the living area by a small partition. At no time did inmates have complete privacy. No toiletries were provided. The food was of poor quality and in scarce supply. The applicant further argued that medical assistance had been unavailable.",

It is especially difficult in a case where personal suffering, whether physical or mental, is the subject of the claim. There is no standard by which pain and suffering, physical discomfort and mental distress and anguish can be measured in terms of money. The Court does not doubt that the domestic courts in the present case, with every desire to be just and eminently reasonable, attempted to assess the cumulative effect which the conditions of detention had had on the applicant\u2019s well-being (see, mutatis mutandis, Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2001-II) and to determine the level of physical suffering, emotional distress, anxiety or other harmful effects sustained by the applicant by reason of his detention in those conditions (see Nardone v. Italy (dec.), no. 34368/02, 25\u00a0November 2004). However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the amount of RUB 1,500 awarded for more than three months of detention, that is, a rate of RUB 14.5 per day, was substantially lower than what it generally awards in comparable Russian cases (see, for example, Labzov v. Russia, no. 62208/00, 16 June 2005, and Kantyrev v. Russia, no. 37213/02, 21 June 2007).",

However, the Court has also stressed that when awarding compensation for non-pecuniary damage the domestic courts have to justify their decision by giving sufficient reasons (see Scordino (no.\u00a01), cited above, \u00a7 204).",

The Court accepts that, applying the compensatory principle, national courts might make an award taking into account the motives and conduct of the defendant and making due allowance for the circumstances in which the wrong was committed. However, it reiterates its finding made in a number of cases that financial or logistical difficulties, as well as the lack of a positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant, may not be cited by the domestic authorities as circumstances relieving them of their obligation to organise the State\u2019s penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees (see, among other authorities, Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7 63, 1 June 2006). The same logic applies to domestic courts\u2019 reasoning in awarding damages when entertaining actions against a State in respect of its tortious conduct. The Court finds it anomalous for the domestic courts to decrease the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant for a wrong committed by the State by referring to the latter\u2019s lack of funds. It considers that in circumstances such as those under consideration the means available to the State should not be accepted as mitigating its conduct, and are thus irrelevant in assessing damages under the compensatory criterion. Furthermore, the Court is of the opinion that the domestic courts, as the custodians of individual rights and freedoms, should have felt it their duty to mark their disapproval of the State\u2019s wrongful conduct to the extent of awarding an adequate and sufficient quantum of damages to the applicant, taking into account the fundamental importance of the right of which they had found a breach in the present case, even if they considered that breach to have been an inadvertent rather than an intended consequence of the State\u2019s conduct. As a corollary this would have conveyed the message that the State may not set individual rights and freedoms at nought or circumvent them with impunity.",

As the second condition \u2013 appropriate and sufficient redress \u2013 has not been fulfilled, the Court finds that the applicant in the instant case may still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d of a breach of his rights under Article 3 of the Convention on account of his detention in the Neman town detention unit.\u00a0Accordingly, this objection by the Government must be dismissed.",

Despite the fact that the applicant in that case was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim had been largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been \u201can important part of the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of the case and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings\u201d (see Kovalev v.

In the present case the applicant\u2019s requests for leave to appear were denied precisely on the ground that the domestic law did not make provision for convicted persons to be brought from correctional colonies to the place where their civil claim was being heard. The Court reiterates that Article 6 of the Convention does not guarantee the right to personal presence before a civil court but rather a more general right to present one\u2019s case effectively before the court and to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side. Article 6 \u00a7 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a068416/01, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, ECHR 2005-II).",

Given the obvious difficulties involved in transporting convicted persons from one location to another, the Court can in principle accept that in cases where the claim is not based on the plaintiff\u2019s personal experiences, as in the above-mentioned Kovalev case, representation of the detainee by an advocate would not be in breach of the principle of equality of arms.",

In such a situation the only possibility for him was to appoint a relative, friend or acquaintance to represent him in the proceedings. However, as is clear from the domestic courts\u2019 judgments, after the courts had refused the applicant leave to appear they did not consider how to secure his effective participation in the proceedings. They did not inquire whether the applicant was able to designate a representative and in particular whether, having regard to the time which he had already spent in detention, he still had a person willing to represent him before the domestic courts and, if so, whether he had been able to contact that person and give him authority to act. Moreover, it appears that on a number of occasions in the three sets of proceedings the applicant did not learn that he had been refused leave to attend the hearing until after the hearing had taken place (see paragraphs 24 and 35 above) or until he received a copy of the judgment in which his claim was dismissed on the merits (see paragraphs 26, 28, 38, 41, 48 and 50 above).

The Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant\u2019s claims in those two sets of proceedings were, to a large extent, based on his personal experience. In such circumstances, the Court is not convinced that even the representative\u2019s appearance before the courts could have secured the effective, proper and satisfactory presentation of the applicant\u2019s case. The Court finds that the applicant\u2019s testimony describing the conditions of his detention, of which only the applicant himself had first-hand knowledge, would have constituted an indispensable part of the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of the case (see Kovalev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037, and, by contrast, Kozlov v. Russia, no. 30782/03, 17 September 2009). Only the applicant himself could describe the conditions and answer the judges\u2019 questions, if any. The Court\u2019s finding to this effect is supported by the \u2019s decision of 20 August 2003 authorising the applicant\u2019s transfer to the courthouse (see paragraph 22 above). In particular, the  reasoned that it was necessary to hear evidence from the applicant in person. However, the Court considers it odd that despite a direct order from the  requiring the applicant to be brought to the hearing, the management of the correctional colony refused to comply, relying on their own assessment of the domestic legal norms (see paragraph 23 above). Even more striking is the fact that following the colony management\u2019s refusal to ensure the applicant\u2019s presence, the Town Court, having failed to take any steps to discipline the management, cited its refusal in response to the applicant\u2019s subsequent request to be brought to a hearing (see paragraph 24 above).",

It also observes that the \u2019s decision was final. The Court further accepts the applicant\u2019s assertion that the legal issues in his criminal case were of particular complexity, involving determination of the constituent elements of a number of aggravated criminal offences, assessment of the degree of liability of several co-defendants, including their level of personal culpability, establishment of a variety of mitigating and aggravating circumstances and examination of the negative of the defences raised. The Court also attributes particular weight to the fact that the applicant did not himself formulate the grounds for his appeal (see paragraph 15 above). The Court is therefore of the view that without the services of a legal practitioner the applicant was not in a position to articulate the arguments raised in the appeal statement and could not competently address the court on the legal issues involved, and thus was unable to defend himself effectively (see Maxwell v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 300C, with further references). Of even greater relevance, however, is the fact that the applicant had been sentenced to nine years\u2019 imprisonment.
