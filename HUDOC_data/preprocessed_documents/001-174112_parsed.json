In such cases the parents retained joint custody unless the court, upon request, awarded sole custody to one parent in accordance with the child\u2019s best interests. In contrast, parental authority over a child born out of wedlock was attributed to the mother, unless both parents consented to make a request for joint custody. In the absence of the mother\u2019s consent, Austrian law at the relevant time did not provide for a judicial examination as to whether the attribution of joint custody would serve the best interest of the child, nor did it allow for an examination, in the event that joint custody was against the child\u2019s interests, of whether the child\u2019s interests were better served by awarding sole custody to the mother or to the father. Thus, a father\u2019s only possibility to obtain custody of the child would be a request for sole custody, but custody could only be awarded to him if the mother endangered the child\u2019s well-being (Sporer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 77-78). The Court concluded in that case that there were no sufficient reasons to justify a different treatment for fathers of children born out of wedlock who had never obtained joint custody, and found a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention (Sporer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08889).",
