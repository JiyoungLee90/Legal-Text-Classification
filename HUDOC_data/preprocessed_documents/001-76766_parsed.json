There was no reason why he should have to pay towards the NHS for a longer period than women, which obligation had no objective connection with the state pension age. The recent increase in deductions from the NI Fund for NHS funding purposes was manipulating NICs as a general taxation source which aggravated the existing inequality. As the NI Fund was not in fact self-financing but could be topped up by money from general taxation, it could not be said that changes in contributions would prejudice the equilibrium of the scheme. If women were required to pay, it would in fact boost the amount of funds. Any differences in entitlement were a consequence only of the way in which the Government had chosen to structure the benefit system.",

Even if the Government could justify discrimination in relation to contributions to the social security system, there was no inextricable link between the funding of the NHS and the actual, or notional, working life of an individual. In particular there was no good reason why men between 60 and 64 should contribute to the NHS but that women of the age were exempt. While there was a factual link of sorts between work and contributions, they pointed out that individuals not in work, or who had caring responsibilities could also pay or be credited with contributions. He also pointed out that employers continued to pay NICs on behalf of employees regardless of whether they had reached the state pension age.

This applies to systems of taxation or contributions which must inevitably differentiate between groups of tax-payers and the implementation of which unavoidably creates marginal situations. A Government may often have to strike a balance between the need to raise revenue and reflecting other social objectives in taxation policies. The national authorities are obviously in a better position than the Court to assess those needs and requirements, which in the present case involve complex concerns about the financing of pensions and the national health service which impact on the community as a whole.

Similarly, in this case, the applicant\u2019s obligation to pay NICs was linked to the date at which he was eligible to obtain his state pension. Much argument has been devoted by the parties to the nature of NICs, in particular the extent to which they fund benefits, including the pension and thus are logically and necessarily linked to the date at which a person received his or her pension and whether the element paid towards the NHS is a form of general taxation without such linkage. In Stec, the REA was found to be a benefit designed to compensate a person for financial loss as a result of their inability to work due to ill-health or incapacity and thus connected to employment and working life. The Court would note that in the present case, the applicants have accepted that there was clearly a factual link between work and contributions since most people making such contributions did so by virtue of their earnings as employees or because they were employees. The use of the state pension age as a cut-off point for contributions made, the Government argued, the scheme easy to understand and to administer. As in Stec, the Court accepts that such questions of administrative economy and coherence are generally matters falling within the margin of appreciation referred to above (\u00a7 57). The fact that over time an increasing percentage of the NI fund has been diverted to the NHS and that there are exceptions to the general position (as in voluntary contributions and the ongoing contributions of employers regardless of age) does not render the policy choice manifestly unreasonable. While it is true that women who continue to work over their pension age do not have to pay NICs, the same also applies to men who work over their pension age.",

This change, must, by its very nature, have been gradual, and it would be difficult or impossible to pinpoint any particular moment when the unfairness to men caused by differential pensionable ages began to outweigh the need to correct the disadvantaged position of women. Certain indications are available to the Court. Thus, in the 1993 White Paper, the Government asserted that the number of women in paid employment had increased significantly, so that whereas in 1967 only 37% of employees were women, the proportion had increased to 50% in 1992. In addition, various reforms to the way in which pension entitlement was assessed had been introduced in 1977 and 1978, to the benefit of women who spent long periods out of paid employment. As of 1986, it was unlawful for an employer to have different retirement ages for men and women (see paragraph 33 above).",

However, as the Court has observed, the development of parity in the working lives of men and women has been a gradual process, and one which the national authorities are better placed to assess (see paragraph 52 above). Moreover, it is significant that many of the other Contracting States still maintain a difference in the ages at which men and women become eligible for the State retirement pension (see paragraph 37 above).
