It principally concerned the actions and omissions of the director of the Medical Department in the management of the transfers of inmates to the prison hospital. The report mentioned the applicant, in brief, and only with respect to one transfer. In particular, it noted that an inmate L.Ts. (see paragraph 10 above) was assessed by the medical commission of the Ministry on 12 January 2005. He was diagnosed with organic personal disorder with periodic episodes of decline. The commission noted that the inmate had been receiving treatment for a mental illness since 2002 and had a second-degree disability status. He had further suffered a head trauma on 8\u00a0January 2005. However the commission did not recommend his transfer to the prison hospital. According to the report, the same inmate was reassessed on 21 January 2005 by the applicant who, noting his medical history described above, wrote in the commission\u2019s journal that the inmate needed to be supervised in a psychiatric ward, and prescribed him certain medication. Subsequently, despite the fact that the members of the medical commission did not agree with the applicant\u2019s assessment, \u201cthe director of the Medical Department bypassed the commission and decided \u2013 unilaterally \u2013 to transfer L.Ts. to the prison hospital based on [the applicant\u2019s] medical conclusion [in the journal] ... and in doing so he violated ... all the relevant rules concerning the prisoners\u2019 transfers to the medical establishment.\u201d",

According to the applicant, the drafting of recommendations on inmates\u2019 mental health had been part of the agreement of 4 October 2003 (see paragraph 7 above) and that all of her conclusions had been based on verifiable medical documents readily available in inmates\u2019 medical files.

Therefore, the Minister\u2019s accusations, even assuming that the Court were to accept the classification of the statements as value judgments, lacked a sufficient factual basis. Yet the domestic judicial authorities considered that the Minister had made an effort to verify the information before making his statements by commissioning an internal investigation on the matter (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above).",
