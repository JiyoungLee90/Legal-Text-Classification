The court noted that the applicant had not obstructed the proceedings against him in any way since his release from detention, that the evidence against him was contradictory and that his family life had suffered serious disruption on account of a measure which could not be maintained forever. It also held that to allow the applicant to travel to Germany would not create a risk of his evading, because he could be re-arrested and extradited.

Such a measure was envisaged by the Code of Criminal Procedure. It was not mandatory but at the discretion of the prosecuting authorities, if they felt that there was a risk that the accused might flee abroad. It was not absolute either, because the accused could be granted permission to travel on specific occasions, if he or she made such a request. The prosecuting authorities' refusal to grant such permission was subject to judicial review. In carrying out that review the court had to have regard to the reasons given by the prosecuting authorities and the grounds relied on by the accused, taking into account the risk of flight abroad. Thus, a refusal to grant permission would be unlawful if the accused wished to travel abroad for medical treatment or on business. In the latter case, a refusal would have to be subjected to very close scrutiny, because it could cause the accused pecuniary damage. The applicant had been prohibited from travelling abroad because he had been prosecuted for murder, had sought to evade justice and had been extradited from Germany. His case was therefore different from Gochev v. Bulgaria (no. 34383/03, 26 November 2009) and Baumann v. France (no. 33592/96, ECHR 2001V (extracts)).

Indeed, he had been allowed to travel to Germany once and had returned to  in time for the next scheduled hearing in his trial. However, only one of his many requests for permission to travel abroad had been granted. In refusing his other requests, the courts had relied on flawed arguments, such as the possibility for his family to settle in Bulgaria, and the possibility for him to support them in Germany on the very low salary that he could expect to earn in Bulgaria. The refusals which followed his return from Germany in the autumn of 2003 in time for the next trial hearing were particularly hard to explain.",

Therefore, no ratione temporis issue arises, because Protocol No. 4 entered into force in respect of Bulgaria on 4 November 2000 (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Hajibeyli v.

On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from  (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas \u2013 with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) \u2013 the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, \u00a7 66, 3 November 2005). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs\u00a033 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 2631, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v. Italy, no. 19675/06, \u00a7\u00a7 19 and 49, 20 April 2010). Moreover, when the  Court of Appeal reimposed the ban on 27 June 2007, it did not give any reasons for its decision (see paragraph 40 above).",

As can be seen from the bulk of their rulings, they were essentially content to rely on the justification that the applicant stood accused of a serious offence carrying a severe penalty and he had been extradited from Germany. With two notable exceptions \u2013 the decisions of 26 August 2003 and 28 February 2005 \u2013 they treated as irrelevant, or did not even mention, many of his arguments that had a direct bearing on the justification for the measure (see paragraphs\u00a02637 above). An analogy may be drawn with the Court's caselaw under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, where the national courts' failure to address such arguments when examining requests for release from pretrial detention is regarded as highly problematic (see, among other authorities, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 61, ECHR 1999II, and Bochev v. Bulgaria, no. 73481/01, \u00a7\u00a7 64 and 65, 13 November 2008). In the Court's view, the domestic courts' stance stripped the remedy of its effectiveness.",

However, it remained open to the applicant to ask the same court to lift the ban (see paragraph 46 above), which he did successfully in March 2008 (see paragraph 41 above). There is nothing to suggest that an earlier application would have been less likely to succeed. Given that in certain circumstances the aggregate of remedies provided by national law may satisfy the requirements of Article 13 (see Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, \u00a7 77, Series A no. 116, and Glas Nadezhda EOOD and Elenkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 14134/02, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2007XI), the Court concludes that the applicant did have an effective remedy against that ban.",
