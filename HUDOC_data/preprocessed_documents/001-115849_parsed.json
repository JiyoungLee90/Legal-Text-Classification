Therefore, whoever is the beneficiary under the social security system, i.e. whether it is the worker or the child, State Parties are under the obligation to secure through unilateral measures the actual payment of family benefits to all children residing on their territory. In other words, imposing an obligation of residence of the child concerned on the territory of the State is compatible with Article 12 \u00a7 4 and its Appendix. However since not all countries apply such a system, States applying the \u2018child residence requirement\u2019 are under the obligation, in order to secure equal treatment within the meaning of Article 12 \u00a7 4, to conclude within a reasonable period of time bilateral or multilateral agreements with those States which apply a different entitlement principle. The Committee therefore asks the next report to indicate whether such agreements exist with the following countries: Albania, Armenia, Georgia and , or, if not, whether it is envisaged to conclude them and in what time delay.",

The Committee recalls that in its previous conclusion (Conclusion XVII-1, p. 36) it found the situation in conformity as regards retention of accrued benefits also for nationals of other States Parties which are currently uncovered by any agreement.
