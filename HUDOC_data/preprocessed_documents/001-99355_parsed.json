As to the applicant's complaint about the legality of his detention on remand, the Court notes that the grievance was brought out of time. The applicant was convicted at first instance on 3 April 2001, whilst he complained about it in his application form of 1 February 2002, which is more than six months later. Lastly, the applicant's complaints about the alleged wiretapping of his telephone (see paragraph 7), the confiscation of his personal property (see paragraph 11) and the alleged interference with his correspondence (see paragraphs 55 and 56) have not been made out and in any event the applicant failed to raise these grievances before the competent domestic authorities, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.
