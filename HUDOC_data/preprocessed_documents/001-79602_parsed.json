This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected to exhaust domestic remedies (see \u0130lhan, cited above, \u00a7 59).",

The investigation which he initiated of his own motion after the incident was only against the deceased and the four people who had fled after the clash. Within the context of that investigation, the public prosecutor charged the accused with belonging to a terrorist organisation. The second investigation, which was initiated following receipt of the applicants' petition, focused solely on the allegation that the bodies of Seyit K\u00fclek\u00e7i and Do\u011fan Altun had been mutilated (see paragraphs 13-15 above). At no stage did the public prosecutor investigate whether the force used by the security forces was justified in the circumstances of the case. Yet, the post-mortem examination revealed that the deceased had received several bullets in various parts of their bodies and had sustained numerous wounds (see paragraph 10\u00a0above). Moreover, the public prosecutor was under a duty, imposed by Article\u00a0153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to investigate whether an offence had been committed (see \u0130lhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 63).",

Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, \u00a7\u00a7 146-147).",

The deliberate or intended use of lethal force is only one factor, however, to be taken into account in assessing its necessity. Any use of force must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed from that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims (see McCann and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 148-49, and McKerr, cited above, \u00a7 110).",

Turkey, no. 22492/93, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2000-III).

In the latter connection, security forces should not be left in a vacuum when performing their duties, whether in the context of a prepared operation or a spontaneous chase of a person perceived to be dangerous: a legal and administrative framework should define the limited circumstances in which law-enforcement officials may use force and firearms, in the light of established international standards (see Makaratzis, cited above, \u00a7 59).",

In this respect the Convention bears a strong resemblance to the Basic Law, putting human dignity at the centre.
