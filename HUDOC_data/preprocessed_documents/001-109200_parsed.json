Moreover, in the judgment of Kharchenko v. Ukraine (no. 40107/02, \u00a7\u00a7 98 and 101, 10 February 2011), the Court held that the situation where there are periods of detention not covered by any court order or the court orders made during the trial stage fix no time-limits for further detention, is a recurrent problem of structural nature in Ukraine.

Turkey, judgment of 8 July 1999, Reports 1999-IV, \u00a7\u00a0127). In the present case, the applicant did not submit documents indicating what employment contract had been concluded, for what duration and why it was terminated in October 2004. The mere indication of his pre-detention salary is not sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that the applicant would have earned the claimed salary, had he not been unlawfully detained. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s unlawful detention started after about fourteen months since that contract may have been terminated or suspended, which renders a causal link between the alleged damage and the violation found to be even more speculative. The applicant\u2019s claim should therefore be rejected. As regards the expenditure on additional food, the Court notes that the issue of the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention was not considered in the present case. It therefore rejects these claims (see, mutatis mutandis, Molodorych v. , no. 2161/02, \u00a7 119-122, 28 October 2010).",

Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, \u00a7 62, ECHR\u00a01999-VIII). In the instant case, which is not particularly complex, the applicant furnished no contract concluded with the lawyer, or any other documents specifying the lawyers tasks, remuneration and what services had been actually performed. Nor were documents proving the payment for the services provided. Nevertheless, the Court can not overlook the fact that the lawyer concerned filed observations and handled correspondence with the Court after the application had been communicated to the Government. Regard being had to the Court\u2019s case-law and the information in its possession, the Court awards the amount of EUR 200 for costs and expenses to be paid into the representatives\u2019 bank account, as identified by the applicant (see mutatis mutandis, Romanchenko v. Ukraine, no. 5596/03, \u00a7\u00a038, 22 November 2005).",
