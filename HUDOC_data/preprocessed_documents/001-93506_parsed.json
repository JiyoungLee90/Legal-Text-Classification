Ibragim B. knew the radio callsigns for all three servicemen. Shortly after 2 p.m. Ibragim B. arrived at checkpoint no.\u00a01 and saw Khasan Yusupov and his brother, in the latter\u2019s car. They had been waiting for the two other servicemen, who had not been released from the prosecutor\u2019s office. They tried to reach A.M. and A.A. by radio but there was no response. The witness asked his brother to inform him by radio once the servicemen had come out, and then went to . At about 3 p.m. Ibragim B. himself called Khasan Yusupov, who said that they were still waiting. There was no radio contact after that. The witness thought his brother and three servicemen had returned to Achkhoy-Martan. On the following day Ibragim B. learnt that the four men had disappeared. On 17 November 2002 his house in Achkhoy-Martan had been searched by investigators from the military prosecutor\u2019s office in Khankala, without any documents. The investigators looked for weapons but did not find anything. The witness ordered three servicemen from his office to follow the two UAZ cars with the investigators and thus learnt that they had returned to Khankala. The witness stated that he had informed the military commander of the district and of  about the disappearances. One military prosecutor from Khankala confirmed to him orally that he had authorised the search at his house in Achkhoy-Martan; however this search was unrelated to the disappearance. The witness also alleged that some time later he had met Saykhudi B. from Borzoy, who had told him that between 21\u00a0and 23 November 2002 he had been detained in the cellar of the criminal police department of the UGA in Khankala together with Khasan Yusupov. The latter told him that the four men who had come to Khankala on the summons of a military prosecutor had been detained and then separated. He stated that Khasan Yusupov had been questioned about his contacts and that he had asked Saykhudi to transfer the information about his detention to the district military commander\u2019s office. Ibragim B. stated that he had asked Saykhudi B. to testify in person at the military prosecutor\u2019s office; however the latter refused. Finally, Ibragim B. stated that at some point, under pressure from the military commander\u2019s office, the premises of the criminal police in Khankala had been inspected, but no traces of his brother or of the three other men had been found.

It thus transpires that at latest by December 2002 the law enforcement authorities and the district military commander\u2019s office were aware of the incident. The military prosecutor\u2019s office opened an investigation into possible desertion in December (or even November) 2002. However, judging from the documents reviewed by the Court, no significant steps were taken within that round of investigation. It does not appear that the applicants or any other relatives of the missing men had been questioned. It also does not appear that the military prosecutors had taken any steps to verify whether the three men had indeed left the guarded area of the military compound or to establish what had happened to them after they had allegedly done so.",

Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the disappearance in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. Within days following the submissions of the relatives\u2019 complaints to the law enforcement authorities in November 2003, the first applicant and other relative of the missing men were questioned and granted victim status. As to the timing of their submissions, it does not appear that the relatives had been called to give witness statements prior to November and December 2003, even though the authorities must have been aware of the disappearance of the four men at the latest in December 2002. Since they were not questioned or summoned to give information prior to these dates, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s argument that they were responsible for the delay in conveying important information and for the ensuing difficulties encountered by the district prosecutor\u2019s office. The Court is also struck by the fact that the relatives were asked for descriptions and photographs of the missing men only in March 2005 (see paragraph 45).",

Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this respect that while the adjourning or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the decisions to adjourn were made without the necessary investigative steps being taken, which led to periods of inactivity and thus unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the delay in the opening of the investigation and the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted.
