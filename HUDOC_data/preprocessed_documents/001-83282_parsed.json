As to her requests for an expert valuation of the property, the Court notes that it is for the national courts to assess in each and every situation whether such requests are justified and necessary for the proper administration of justice (see Graberska\u00a0v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a06924/03, \u00a7\u00a060, 14\u00a0June 2007).
