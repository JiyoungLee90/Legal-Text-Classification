Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see also Seton, cited above, \u00a7 59).",

The courts must have shown that they were aware that the statements of the absent witness carried less weight. The Court has taken into account, in that context, whether the domestic courts provided detailed reasoning as to why they considered that evidence to be reliable, while having regard also to the other evidence available. An additional safeguard may be to show, at the trial hearing, a video recording of the absent witness\u2019s questioning at the investigation stage in order to allow the court, prosecution and defence to observe the witness\u2019s demeanour under questioning and to form their own impression of his or her reliability. Furthermore, in assessing the counterbalancing factors in place, the Court examines: (a) whether there was corroborative evidence at the trial supporting the untested witness statement; (b) whether the applicant or her defence counsel had been given an opportunity to question the witness during the investigation stage; (c) whether the defence was offered the possibility to put its own questions to the witness indirectly, for instance in writing, in the course of the trial; and (d) whether the defendant was afforded the opportunity to give his/her own version of the events and to cast doubt on the credibility of the absent witness (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 126-31, with further references).",

The Court considers this argument to be misguided. Thus, it is in contradiction with the Government\u2019s submission that on 20 November 2009 the impugned preventive measure had ceased to apply. Had that been obvious, there would have been no reason for the applicant to apply to the investigator with such requests in the first place.",

More specifically, the Court observes that under the domestic legislation in force, once the criminal proceedings against the applicant had been discontinued owing to the absence of the constituent elements of a crime in her actions, she could claim compensation from the State in respect of any \u201cprocedural actions restricting her rights\u201d (see paragraphs 63 and 64 above). The applicant used that opportunity and succeeded in initiating compensation proceedings. She did not allege that any redress would have been insufficient if the courts had found in her favour within those proceedings. The mere fact that the applicant\u2019s claim failed cannot raise an issue under Article 13. In so far as she contended that her arguments had not been duly addressed, the Court considers that the Government, in stating that she had failed to duly substantiate her claim, had a point. Thus, there is no evidence in the case file refuting the Government\u2019s argument that she only sent the investigator\u2019s letter of 22 June 2012 (proving the restrictions on her right to liberty of movement \u2013 see paragraph\u00a045 above) to the cassation-level court, but not to the first-instance or appellate court. Furthermore, the applicant only mentioned that issue for the first time in her appeal, without giving any details, and did not raise it before the first-instance court at all. Although the applicant mentioned the page number of the case file where that document could be found (see paragraph 54 above), this fact alone is not sufficient to consider that she was referring to the civil, rather than the criminal, file. Thus, the letter in question was not among the enclosures to her claim or appeal (see paragraphs 51 and 54 above). In any event, the applicant failed to submit any factual details as to how and when exactly her rights had been restricted. Accordingly, the Court cannot reproach the Ukrainian courts for the way they examined the applicant\u2019s claim.",

The rule is an indispensable part of the functioning of the Convention system of subsidiary protection (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], nos. 17153/11 and 29 others, \u00a7 69, 25\u00a0March 2014). States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system, and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 70, with further references).",
