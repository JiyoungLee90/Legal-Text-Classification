It does not appear therefore that there was an intervention by the police in the exercise of her right to freedom of expression. As regards the subsequent prosecution of the second applicant, she was accused of an offence of an administrative nature (rather than of a criminal offence stricto sensu); that prosecution resulted in the discontinuation of the proceedings. The trial, which lasted from March until May 2011, was thus not overly long. The second applicant was not deprived of her liberty after the demonstration or during the trial; neither did she face other restrictions on her rights (compare D\u00f6ner and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a029994/02, \u00a7 88, 7 March 2017). The domestic courts acknowledged a violation of the second applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression on account of her unlawful prosecution for an offence of an administrative nature, and awarded her compensation for non-pecuniary damage of EUR\u00a0250. Even assuming that there was an \u201cinterference\u201d and that the second applicant can still claim to be the victim of a breach of Article 10 of the Convention on account of the mere fact of being prosecuted, which lasted some time, albeit without incurring any other adverse consequences in connection with the prosecution (compare Dilipak v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a029680/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a044-51, 15 September 2015, and \u00c7\u00f6lge\u00e7en and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos.\u00a050124/07 and 7 others, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40, 12\u00a0December 2017), the Court considers that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

Turkey, no.\u00a034364/08, \u00a7 67, 20 October 2015, and the cases cited therein). In the present case the first applicant staged a solo demonstration holding a banner demanding a fair trial for two wellknown figures. The first applicant\u2019s demonstration was not interrupted. He thereby exercised, without hindrance, his right to freedom to \u201cimpart information and ideas\u201d and \u201cto hold opinions\u201d. However, his later being taken to the police station and prosecuted for an administrative offence were both related to his having expressed opinions and disseminated information, and therefore constituted \u201cinterference\u201d with his rights guaranteed under Article\u00a010 of the Convention. The fact that the prosecution for an administrative offence resulted in the discontinuation of the administrative proceedings against the first applicant does not alter that finding.",

The Court has no doubt that the domestic courts in the present case attempted, in good faith and to the best of their ability, to assess the level of suffering, distress, anxiety or other harmful effects sustained by the applicant. It reiterates that such an assessment should be carried out in a manner consistent with the domestic legal requirements and take into account the standard of living in the country concerned, even if that results in awards of amounts that are lower than those fixed by the Court in similar cases (see\u00a0Cocchiarella v.

The award was by no means comparable to what could be awarded under Article 41 of the Convention either under Article 5 \u00a7 1 or Article 10 of the Convention (see Scordino v.\u00a0Italy (no. 1), \u00a7\u00a7 181 and 202; Novikova and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 222-25 and 231, both cited above; Tsvetkova and Others v.

The Court further observes that although the domestic courts accepted that there had been no need to take the first applicant to the police station, they did not acknowledge the violation relating to the exercise of his freedom of expression (compare Centro\u00a0Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, \u00a7\u00a088, ECHR 2012). Thus, the first applicant remained a victim of the alleged violations under Articles 5 \u00a7 1 and 10 of the Convention when he lodged the application before the Court. The Government\u2019s objection as to the first applicant\u2019s victim status should be therefore dismissed.",
