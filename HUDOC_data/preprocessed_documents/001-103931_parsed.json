The second applicant and S.\u0160. were also obstructing the officers from carrying out their duty by jostling and pulling their clothes.

Although the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts. Where allegations are made under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, however, the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny (see Matko v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 43393/98, \u00a7\u00a0100, 2 November 2006).",

In this connection the Court observes that the three men arrested were the applicants' closest family members \u2013 V.I. was the first applicant's son and the second applicant's brother, A.I. was the first applicant's husband and the second applicant's father and O.B. was the first applicant's brother and the second applicant's uncle. There can be little doubt that the sight of them being beaten up by the police officers (as concerns the second applicant) and unsuccessful attempts to obtain information about the reason behind their arrest (as concerns the first applicant) intimidated the applicants on account of the arbitrariness of the situation and caused them emotional and psychological distress. Overall, having regard to the first applicant's physical injuries and the fact that due to them the forensic expert deemed her to be unfit to work for nine days, the traces of injuries on the second applicant's body and the fact that both applicants witnessed the police violence, the Court finds that the applicants were subjected to ill-treatment which was sufficiently serious to be considered degrading and thus to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention.",

This, although not conclusive on its own, nevertheless does cast doubt on the real necessity to arrest the applicants' family members and to have recourse to physical force to put the arrest into effect. The Court also notes the absence of signs of physical injuries to the policemen which is a typical consequence of resistance to arrest in comparable cases.",

The Internal Affairs investigator, the prosecutor and the Vilnius First District Court found against the applicants, noting that they and A.I., V.I. and O.B. would have sustained no physical damage had they not resisted arrest. In this connection the Court observes that, in contrast to the facts in Klaas (paragraph 30), in the present case the Vilnius City First District Court and even the prosecutor, who had to assure the independence and objectivity of the investigation, had no opportunity of hearing the parties to the criminal proceedings and witnesses at first hand and of evaluating their credibility. Quite the contrary, as it appears from the prosecutors' decisions to terminate the pre-trial investigation into the alleged police abuse, the prosecutors, although explicitly asked by the applicants to take over the pre-trial investigation, to question the witnesses one more time and to establish the concrete actions and involvement of each of the policemen, limited themselves to summing up the witness testimonies, as written down by Internal Affairs investigator within the police premises.",

As concerns the Vilnius City First District Court, the Court notes that in a one-page ruling it merely succinctly repeated the procedural steps taken in the case and summed up the prosecutor's conclusions (see, in contrario, Peleckas v.  (dec.), no.\u00a018293/03, 6\u00a0November 2007, as regards the effective and thorough investigation of the alleged ill-treatment by the police). The Court is mindful of the fact that the decision the court took was of a procedural nature, as opposed to examining the complaint of alleged police abuse on the merits and passing a judgment as to the actual guilt of the policemen. However, the Court is particularly concerned by the fact that the charges against the three men having being dismissed on 15\u00a0December 2004, neither the deputy chief prosecutor of the Vilnius Region Prosecutor's Office in his decision of 7\u00a0February 2005, nor the investigating judge on 3\u00a0March 2005 deemed it important and reasonable to take this circumstance into account and to reopen the pre-trial investigation, and to question the applicants, the policemen and the witnesses in a more transparent manner than mere questioning at the police station, where, naturally, the witnesses and victims were prone to more psychological pressure. On this latter point the Court draws attention to the applicants' accusation, irrespective of the question of whether it was founded, that the police investigator misled certain witnesses and wrote down their testimony in a way which was more beneficial to the police officers concerned. What is more, in their observations on the admissibility and merits the Government did provide examples of domestic case-law \n(see paragraph 33 above), albeit when the issue of police officers' responsibility was decided on the merits, where police officers had been convicted for abuse of office and where the victims and witnesses had been questioned in court. The Court also notes that the investigation failed to establish the particular roles of each of the policemen implicated in the events \u2013 to this day it is not clear to what extent each of them contributed to the applicants' injuries. Lastly, in their observations to the Court the Government themselves admitted that some of the contradictions could not have been eliminated in the applicants' case.",
