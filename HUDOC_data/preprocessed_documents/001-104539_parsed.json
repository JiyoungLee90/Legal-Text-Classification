Most of those were apparently the children of medical doctors, paramedical staff and teachers. The parents complained that whereas they were paying thousands of levs for private preparatory lessons, certain pupils had been bragging that they would be admitted to the English Secondary School in Burgas in exchange for paying BGN 300; indeed, only a month later this had become a fact. They cited several examples of perfectly healthy children who had been diagnosed as suffering from serious chronic illnesses. They said that they were not blaming the admissions commission, which had merely been taking note of the prior conclusions of medical doctors and allocating the pupils to schools depending on the nature of their purported health problems. They insisted that the Ministry should set up a special commission to investigate. A number of parents subsequently staged daily public protests in front of the building of the Burgas education inspectorate.",

The report, which was not made public, found that the commission had committed a number of violations of the school admissions regulations, such as admitting pupils who did not have the requisite medical conditions, making findings on the basis of invalid medical documents and poorly documenting its activities. It also said that there were indications that Dr\u00a0N.P. had been forging documents.

According to the uncorroborated information the matter concerns 40 boys and girls who got onto the lists despite having no right to benefit from the privilege under the Regulation on pupils with congenital and acquired diseases. For each child via the \u2018alternative\u2019 route the experts pocketed at least 300\u00a0[] dollars. The sum total of the bribe is about 15,000 dollars, said the source.

She had conversations with parents who claimed that some [pupils] had arranged for [their admission] by paying the commission.

The complaint says that \u2018other pupils brag in their classes that for 300 dollars they will be admitted to the English Language Secondary School\u2019, but does not specify to whom [this money] will be given.

If it had read and analysed properly the full text of the article \u2013 which contained many phrases removing certainty from the allegations and distancing the applicant from them \u2013 it would have found that she had not asserted that bribetaking had taken place. Moreover, the court had ruled ultra petita, as, in finding the article defamatory, it had relied on a phrase not pleaded by the complainants \u2013 \u201cthe children in respect of whom money was paid\u201d. It had also erred by holding that the applicant had perpetrated both forms of defamation \u2013 disseminating injurious statements of fact and imputing an offence \u2013, and by holding that speculating about a future event \u2013 the dismissal \u2013 could amount to an allegation of fact. Furthermore, the facts asserted by the applicant \u2013 the existence of signs of bribetaking \u2013 were true. An internal inquiry had indeed taken place. It had found that numerous serious violations had occurred which could hardly be explained by professional negligence alone. There were indications that parents had given money to obtain admission for their children. While all of these indeed constituted only prima facie evidence of bribe-taking, this was all the applicant had claimed. She had acted in good faith, checking her sources. Although she had been aware that she might upset certain people, she had decided to go to print in the best interests of the children who had not been admitted. She had done so in an urgent situation, going to press only three days before the start of the school year. She had made public a story which was the subject of lively discussion in the town, and had achieved a positive effect, preventing future instances of corruption. The court had to take into account all these factors and assess the necessity of the interference with the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression in concreto.",

Analysis of the impugned phrases shows that the complainants\u2019 supposed impending dismissal for being corrupt (which is asserted as a fact) is an injurious statement because it affects their personalities and is liable to tarnish their reputations. The legal conclusions would be completely different if [the applicant] had merely stated \u2018they will be sacked\u2019 without mentioning the specific reason for that, namely corruption. This word undoubtedly refers to the complainants\u2019 conduct and attributes negative qualities to them, characterising them negatively in their capacity as individuals and public officials. [The applicant], in her capacity as the author of the article, told the readers of the newspaper that the impending dismissal of the complainants was on account of corruption, which was presented as a fact in the article, that is, as something that had already happened, something real. It is exactly this which makes the news of their future dismissal injurious. Moreover, from a legal viewpoint, future events as well as negative facts in which an event is lacking are nonetheless facts. The use of the future tense does not therefore exculpate [the applicant], but should rather be taken as a mitigating circumstance, justifying a lesser penalty... Undoubtedly the negative consequences flowing from the defamatory assertion of a future dismissal (as stated in the article) are less than those flowing from a dismissal already carried out for corruption. However, in both cases the author undermines the good name of the person and their positive reputation. For similar reasons, the criminal nature of the act depends little on whether [the applicant] used the expression \u2018accused of corruption\u2019 or \u2018corrupt\u2019. The opinion of the defence that an allegation is defamatory, that is, capable of damaging the victims\u2019 reputations only in the latter case is not shared by [this court].",

As a rule, an offence, as an antisocial, guilty and punishable act, ... is in all cases reprehensible from a moral viewpoint and without exception reflects negatively on the personality of its perpetrator. For this reason, [the applicant\u2019s] assertion that as a result of a bribe the complainants received about 15,000 dollars categorically affects their good names and dignity as citizens and professionals. It was thus properly characterised as defamatory by [the lower court]. The argument of the defence that the impugned article did not contain allegations that the complainants had accepted bribes was correctly rejected as unfounded by [the lower court].

No evidence proving in an incontrovertible manner the truth of the injurious assertion that the complainants would be dismissed for corruption has been gathered, either by the [lower court] or before the adoption of [this court\u2019s] judgment. The [four orders] of 25 September 2000 show that the complainants were indeed disciplined after the publication of the article. However, they were not dismissed but merely given a warning of dismissal, which is obviously not the same thing. There is no indication whatsoever that their dismissal was proposed or discussed. They were penalised for the numerous violations committed by them in the course of their work as members of the commission for assigning pupils with chronic illnesses and/or special educational needs to specialised secondary schools, not for engaging in corrupt practices. It has not been established that the complainants committed the offence of bribetaking. For this reason, the [lower court] correctly refused to apply Article 147 \u00a7 2 [of the Criminal Code]. This provision states that [persons making allegedly defamatory allegations] are not to be punished if they prove the truth of the injurious statements or the imputation of an offence. In view of the presumption of innocence [enshrined in the Constitution and the Criminal Code], and in the absence of a final conviction establishing that the complainants committed the offence of bribetaking, the [lower court\u2019s] conclusion that the prerequisites of Article 147 \u00a7 2 ... have not been met is correct and lawful.

After completing the inquiry [the prosecuting authorities] instituted [a criminal investigation] against officials of [the inspectorate] suspected of having taken bribes... However, the certificate does not say whether these officials were the complainants. [In any event,] this does not alter [the lower court\u2019s] conclusion that [the applicant\u2019s] act was contrary to Article 148 \u00a7\u00a7 1 (2) and (3) and 2 in conjunction with Article 147 \u00a7 1 [of the Criminal Code], a conclusion which is fully shared by [this court]. Even if it were to be assumed that these criminal proceedings for bribery were directed against the complainants in their capacity as members and ... chairman of the commission ..., this fact alone is not enough to rebut the presumption of innocence and establish the truth of the injurious statements and the imputation of an offence, because the conclusion of these criminal proceedings by a final conviction of the four complainants of the offence of bribery is an uncertain future event. It is not disputed between the parties that at the time of the adoption of [this court\u2019s] judgment the criminal proceedings against the complainants are pending at the pre-trial stage. The ongoing nature of the investigation does not constitute grounds for adjourning the instant case until its completion, in view of the legal timelimits for concluding the criminal proceedings, which, if excessive in length, may engender a real risk that the absolute limitation period for prosecuting [the applicant] will expire. An adjournment of the case is therefore unacceptable, because it would deprive the complainants of the right to obtain a judicial determination of the charges levelled by them owing to the expiry of the limitation period for prosecuting the offence [allegedly] committed by [the applicant]. Nor do the criminal proceedings pending against the complainants constitute grounds for staying the proceedings in the instant case, although the outcome of the investigation concerning them is of great importance for [the applicant\u2019s] liability and the application of Article 147 \u00a7 2 [of the Criminal Code]. The court may stay a criminal case only in a limited number of situations [envisaged by the Code of Criminal Procedure]. The existence of a criminal investigation against the complainants, the outcome of which is determinative for the resolution of the present case, is not such a situation. There are, then, no grounds for staying the proceedings in the instant case pending completion of the criminal proceedings against the complainants. It follows that, in so far as it has not been properly established that the complainants committed the imputed corrupt acts, [this court] endorses [the lower court\u2019s] conclusion that [the applicant\u2019s] act amounted to defamation contrary to Article 148 \u00a7\u00a7 1 (2) and (3) and 2 in conjunction with Article\u00a0147 \u00a7 1 [of the Criminal Code].",

[Their conviction] would undoubtedly establish the truth of the injurious statements disseminated and of the imputation of an offence, as required under Article 147 \u00a7 2 [of the Criminal Code]. If that were to happen, [the applicant] could request the proceedings to be reopened and [the judgments against her] to be set aside, relying on the existence of a new fact which was not known to [the courts trying her case]. For these reasons, the information in the certificate issued by the prosecuting authorities is only an indication that there were grounds for investigating officials of the [regional inspectorate of the Ministry of Education and Science] for corruption, but it by no means disproves the charge that the injurious statements and the imputation of an offence were false. The defence\u2019s contention that the proving of the injurious statements obeys the normal rules on distribution of the burden of proof in criminal proceedings is incorrect and illogical precisely because of the complainants\u2019 interest in proving their charge. Article 83 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 [of the Code of Criminal Procedure] provides that the burden of proof ... is on the private prosecuting party. [The applicant] is not required to prove her innocence. However, in the circumstances, seeing that the complainants have no interest in triggering the application of Article 147 \u00a7 2 [of the Criminal Code], because this would lead to the non-imposition of the punishment they seek, it has to be accepted that the burden of proof shifts to [the applicant].

However, as a whole the objection that she acted without mens rea and thus did not commit an offence is groundless. In reply to the complainants\u2019 rebuttal of the article, published in Compass on 14 September 2000, in the same issue of the newspaper [the applicant] wrote a note in her capacity as the article\u2019s author. Part of the content of this note: \u2018Dear ladies and gentlemen educationalists, please accept my apologies if I have offended you by imputing to you acts that you did not perpetrate\u2019, as well as [the applicant\u2019s] explanation [at trial] that she did not write the article with the intention of offending anyone, lead the court to accept that [she] perpetrated the offence with oblique intent...

The information contained in the testimony of [a witness for the applicant] and the article in the issue of Sega of 11 September 2000 under the headline \u2018Bribes scandal in Burgas secondary schools\u2019..., in which the complainants are accused of corruption, is not based on such objective facts. It could not give [the applicant] a justified assurance that the injurious statements and the imputation were true. [The lower court] remarked correctly that not a single parent or pupil who gave such information to the applicant had been named. The [abovementioned witness for the applicant] does not say which parents of children who were denied admission complained to him that \u2018sums of 300 [United States] dollars were pocketed to allow in [healthy] children instead of sick ones\u2019 ... Contrary to her assertions, [the applicant] did not carry out a proper journalistic inquiry before drafting her article. [Her assertions] that she received the information from the parents of children who were not admitted (which were not corroborated by the testimony of any parent) and that the information in the article ... in the 11 September 2000 issue of Sega confirmed the allegations in the impugned article do not lend support to [her] argument that she \u2018complied with all possible requirements of goodfaith journalism\u2019. In accordance with the principle that journalists have to be objective, proper journalistic inquiry requires them to check the reliability of their sources. In the instant case, [the applicant] could have asked the [Ministry of Education and Science] about the reasons behind and the content of the [parents\u2019] letter mentioned in the article in Sega. Counsel for [the applicant] mistakenly objects that [she] had not been made aware that [the Ministry] had received an alert from protesting parents. In line seven of the impugned article [the applicant] pointed out that [the Ministry\u2019s internal inquiry] had been ordered by [the Minister] pursuant to \u2018an ALERT concerning bribetaking\u2019. She was obviously aware of an alert (a letter) received by [the Ministry]. There is no indication in the case file that any of the protesting parents or children with whom [the applicant] claims she conversed many times said that the complainants had engaged in corrupt acts. If [the applicant] had checked what alert had been received by [the Ministry] and the exact reason why [the Minister] had ordered an [internal inquiry], she would have no doubt reached a different conclusion. The protesting parents complained about \u2018the ruthless race between doctors to earn more money by giving false diagnoses to minors applying for admission to secondary schools\u2019 ... It is not disputed that none of the complainants is a medical doctor. Clearly, then, the protests were directed against the actions of the doctors, not against those of the commission of which the four complainants were members. No complaints of corrupt acts on the part of the complainants from parents, pupils or officials were received by [the Ministry] or by the [newly] formed \u2018Citizens\u2019 Association for the Salvation of Burgas\u2019, of which [the abovementioned witness] is a member. [When giving evidence at trial, this witness] testified about a complaint which he had received from ten or fifteen individuals who had confided that they had each given 300 [United States] dollars to a member of the commission. He had shared this information with [the applicant]. The information did not, however, contain objective facts capable of convincing [the applicant] as a journalist of the truthfulness of what she wrote in the article and thus absolving her of any intention to defame. On the one hand, [the witness] did not name any specific individual who was in a position to confirm his words, and, on the other, the corruption complaint concerned only one (unidentified) member of the commission, not all four complainants as asserted in the article. It should also be noted that there was a further member of the commission who is not a complainant [in this case], the witness Dr N.P. The [internal inquiry] carried out following complaints by parents had the task of checking whether the complainants had, as members of the commission, complied with [certain Ministry regulations], not whether they had taken bribes. For these reasons, [the court] finds no force in the defence\u2019s argument that [the applicant\u2019s] intent did not comprise the inaccuracy of the injurious statements disseminated and of the imputation of an offence. Even though the sources ... mentioned by [the applicant] herself could not, in the circumstances, have assured [her] of the reality of the situation, [she] wrote the impugned article. As correctly found by [the lower court], [the applicant] did not use a source for the amount of the bribe \u2013 \u2018about 15,000 [United States] dollars\u2019 \u2013, but made the calculation herself by multiplying 40 children by 300 dollars.

[The lower court] correctly referred to and construed Articles 39 \u00a7 2 and 41 \u00a7 1 of [the Constitution] and Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and rightly held that [the applicant\u2019s] right to impart information could not be used to infringe the rights and the good name of the complainants in the manner described above. Analysis of these provisions and of the rules of Articles 146, 147 et seq.

It went on to say that, owing to the accessory nature of a civilparty claim, the general rule of tort law that fault was presumed was not applicable to the examination of tort claims in criminal defamation proceedings. In such proceedings, the rules governing fault as an element of the tort of defamation were those of the criminal law. The court also held that under Bulgarian law strict liability could not be applied in respect of defamation, and referred to the constitutional principle that public officials were subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals.",

Another problem was the general difficulty of proving corruption. Given the numerous breaches committed by the officials in the present case, the indications that amounts had been paid for the admission of children to specialised schools and the parents\u2019 complaint to the Ministry, it had been legitimate for the applicant to air allegations of corruption. She had duly verified her story before going to press, basing her allegations on sources inside the education inspectorate, the allegations of protesting parents, statements by the four officials concerned and Dr N.P., and conversations with teachers. In her article she had presented three versions: the first based on her sources in the inspectorate and the parents\u2019 statements, the second based on the assertions of the four officials, and the third based on Dr N.P\u2019s assertions. She had not commented on the versions or presented any of them as her own. She had contacted those concerned and given them the opportunity to reply. She had been working under considerable pressure because she had to publish the article before the beginning of the school year. Although at the time there had been no written rules of journalistic ethics, she had complied with the usual rules. Her article had plainly been beneficial to the public debate in the relevant domain, whereas the sanctions imposed on her had had a clear chilling effect. The sums which she had been ordered to pay were many times higher than her income and she had struggled for years to pay them in full.",

They highlighted the presumption\u2019s potential chilling effect, especially when combined with strict liability in respect of libel. They pointed out that that chilling effect had been expressly recognised by the Supreme Court of the United States in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (376 U.S. 254) and by the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights in HerreraUlloa v. Costa Rica (judgment of 2 July 2004, Series C No. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 132 and 133). They cited further cases from a number of jurisdictions which, in their view, supported the same proposition, and pointed out that several countries in eastern Europe had decriminalised libel. They drew attention to the perils of imposing unrealistic standards of proof on libel defendants, and of equating such defendants with the prosecution in criminal cases. They described in detail the approaches adopted in a number of jurisdictions with regard to the standard of care required of journalists when reporting on matters of public interest and concerning public officials. They invited the Court to clarify further the appropriate test for examining cases concerning press allegations of official misconduct in the light of those approaches and the principles flowing from its own caselaw.",

The Court must apply the most careful scrutiny when, as here, the sanctions imposed by a national authority are capable of discouraging the participation of the press in debates over matters of legitimate public concern (see, among other authorities, T\u00f8nsbergs Blad A.S. and Haukom v. Norway, no. 510/04, \u00a7 88, ECHR 2007III). The Court would add that if the national courts apply an overly rigorous approach to the assessment of journalists\u2019 professional conduct, the latter could be unduly deterred from discharging their function of keeping the public informed. The courts must therefore take into account the likely impact of their rulings not only on the individual cases before them but also on the media in general. Their margin of appreciation is thus circumscribed by the interest of a democratic society in enabling the press to play its vital role in imparting information of serious public concern (ibid., \u00a7 82).",

Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 46, Series A no. 103; Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 98101; and Flux v. Moldova (no. 4), no. 17294/04, \u00a7 36, 12 February 2008). There was therefore nothing inherently wrong with her being asked to demonstrate the truth of her assertions, as required under Article 147 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, which embodies the socalled \u201cpresumption of falsity\u201d (sometimes, especially in commonlaw countries, referred to as \u201cdefence of justification\u201d or \u201cdefence of truth\u201d). The Court has dealt with this matter in the context of civil proceedings in the case of McVicar, and has concluded that it is not, in principle, incompatible with Article 10 to place on the defendant in libel proceedings the burden of proving to the civil standard the truth of defamatory statements (see McVicar v. the United Kingdom, no. 46311/99, \u00a7\u00a7 8387, ECHR 2002III). It later confirmed that ruling in Steel and Morris, subject to the proviso that the defendant must be allowed a realistic opportunity to do so (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a068416/01, \u00a7\u00a7 9395, ECHR 2005II). It reiterated that point in Alithia Publishing Company Ltd and Constantinides v. Cyprus (no. 17550/03, \u00a7 68, 22 May 2008); Wall Street Journal Europe Sprl v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 28577/05, 10 February 2009); and Europapress Holding d.o.o. v.\u00a0 (no. 25333/06, \u00a7 63, 22 October 2009). In Rumyana Ivanova it held, in referring to criminal libel proceedings, that a requirement for defendants to prove to a reasonable standard that the allegations made by them were substantially true did not, as such, contravene the Convention (see Rumyana Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 36207/03, \u00a7\u00a7 39 and 68, 14\u00a0February 2008). It recently reiterated that position, again with reference to criminal libel proceedings, in Makarenko v. Russia (no. 5962/03, \u00a7 156, 22 December 2009) and Rukaj v. Greece ((dec.), no. 2179/08, 21 January 2010). Those rulings were not novel or without precedent. The former Commission in several cases examined the presumption of falsity in the context of criminal libel proceedings. It noted that it existed in the legislation of most of the States signatories to the Convention (see Barril v.\u00a0France, no. 32218/96, Commission decision of 30 June 1997, Decisions and Reports (DR) 90B, p. 147, at p. 156), and expressly found that it was not as such contrary to Article 10 or Article 6 \u00a7 2 (see Lingens and Leitgeb v. Austria, no. 8803/79, Commission decision of 11 December 1981, DR 26, p. 171, at p. 181, and Tollefsen v. Norway, no. 16269/90, Commission decision of 1 April 1992, unreported). As to the Court, it has commented favourably on the presumption when discussing the compatibility with Article 6 \u00a7 2 of a related presumption concerning the liability of publishing directors (see Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2004II). It has found violations of Articles 6 \u00a7 1 and 10 in cases where defendants in criminal libel proceedings have not been allowed to avail themselves of that defence (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 47 and 48, Series A no. 236; Colombani and Others v. France, no. 51279/99, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2002V; and Folea v.

Given the nature of the conflicting interests, the States must be given a certain margin of appreciation in striking the appropriate balance between those rights (see A. v.

Finland, no. 184/06, \u00a7 69 in limine, 12 October 2010). Similarly, States cannot be said to have gone beyond it as a result of using legislative techniques \u2013 such as the presumption of falsity \u2013 whose aim is to enable those subjected to potentially defamatory attacks to challenge the truth of allegations which risk harming their reputations (see, mutatis mutandis, Steel and Morris, cited above, \u00a7 94 in fine).",

It is true that, taken in isolation, it could be seen as unduly inhibiting the publication of material whose truth may be difficult to establish in a court of law, for instance because of the lack of admissible evidence or the expense involved. However, it is not the Court\u2019s role to consider in the abstract whether national law \u2013 and, a fortiori, an individual rule of that law \u2013 conforms to the Convention (see McCann and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7 153, Series A no. 324; Pham Hoang v. France, 25 September 1992, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 243; Etxeberria and Others v. Spain, nos. 35579/03, 35613/03, 35626/03 and 35634/03, \u00a7\u00a081, 30 June 2009; and Romanenko and Others v. Russia, no. 11751/03, \u00a7\u00a039, 8 October 2009). It must confine its attention, as far as possible, to the particular circumstances of the case before it (see, among other authorities, Wettstein v. Switzerland, no. 33958/96, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2000XII, and Sommerfeld v. Germany [GC], no. 31871/96, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2003VIII), and base its examination on the provisions of the domestic law as they were applied to the applicant (see Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 62; Vasilescu v. Romania, 22 May 1998, \u00a7 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998III; Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others v. Austria, no. 40825/98, \u00a7 90, 31 July 2008; and Wall Street Journal Europe Sprl, cited above). In the instant case \u2013 as presumably in any criminal libel case in  \u2013 the abovementioned \u201cchilling effect\u201d was considerably tempered by the fault element of the offence of defamation under Bulgarian law. Under the Criminal Code, defamation is not a strictliability offence, and to secure a conviction the complainant must establish that the alleged defamer acted with mens rea, which can only be direct intent or recklessness (oblique intent, equivalent in some jurisdictions to positive indirect intent) (see paragraphs 37 and 38 above). To determine whether a person accused of libel has acted with mens rea, the Bulgarian courts seek, as they did in the case at hand, to establish whether he or she has complied with the tenets of responsible journalism (see paragraph 38 above and Rumyana Ivanova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 26 and 30). Libel defendants such as the applicant may thus be relieved of the obligation to prove the truth of the facts alleged in their publications and avoid conviction by simply showing that they have acted fairly and responsibly (see Radio France and Others, cited above, \u00a7 24, and contrast with Standard Verlags GmbH and KrawagnaPfeifer v. Austria, no. 19710/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a016, 30 and 57, 2 November 2006). That mechanism greatly reduces the presumption of falsity\u2019s potential negative effect on freedom of expression. The Court will revert to this matter below.",

In that connection, it is striking that in the instant case the Burgas Court of Appeal held \u2013 perhaps erroneously in terms of Bulgarian law (see paragraph 40 above) \u2013 that the only way of corroborating the allegation that someone had committed a criminal offence was to show that he or she stood convicted of it. This position cannot be condoned by the Court (see Flux v.\u00a0 (no. 6), no. 22824/04, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 31, 29 July 2008). While a final conviction in principle amounts to incontrovertible proof that a person has committed an offence, to circumscribe in such a way the manner of proving allegations of criminal conduct in the context of a libel case is plainly unreasonable, even if account must be taken, as required under Article 6 \u00a7 2, of that person\u2019s presumed innocence. Allegations in the press cannot be put on an equal footing with those made in criminal proceedings (see Barril, cited above, at pp. 15657; Unabh\u00e4ngige Initiative Informationsvielfalt v.\u00a0Austria, no. 28525/95, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2002I; Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v.

Nor can the courts hearing a libel case expect libel defendants to act like public prosecutors, or make their fate dependent on whether the prosecuting authorities choose to pursue criminal charges against, and manage to secure the conviction of, the person against whom they have made allegations (see Folea, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 3032).",

By reason of the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see, among other authorities, Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.

They placed particular reliance on her failure to seek corroboration of the story from the Ministry of Education and Science. They also expressed strong doubts as to whether she had in fact received reliable information that parents had paid money to get their children admitted to specialised schools (see paragraphs 23 and 29 above). It is true that, when dealing with the point, the  laid emphasis on the applicant\u2019s failure to cite the names of specific individuals who had made such an allegation. Such an approach might raise an issue in relation to the principle of protection of journalistic sources, one of the cornerstones of freedom of the press without which sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest (see Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, 27 March 1996, \u00a7 39, Reports 1996II; Roemen and Schmit v.

However, it cannot be overlooked that, as is apparent from its reasoning, the Burgas Regional Court was more concerned with trying to ascertain whether before writing her article the applicant had complied with her normal journalistic obligation to carry out sufficient research in support of her hardhitting allegation against the four officials and, in particular, whether she had duly checked the reliability of her sources, than with pressing her to reveal her sources. The Court is not persuaded that it would have been impossible for the applicant to establish to the national courts\u2019 satisfaction that she had done so without exposing those sources (see, mutatis mutandis, Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, cited above, \u00a7 106). The Court would point out in that connection that according to its caselaw, the more serious an allegation is, the more solid its factual basis should be (see Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, \u00a7 101; Pedersen and Baadsgaard, \u00a7 78 in fine, and Rumyana Ivanova, \u00a7 64, all cited above).

It also took into account the story\u2019s general context and the fact that it concerned a matter of public interest. It is true that it did not consider those points as relevant for the question whether the applicant had defamed the four officials, but regarded them as mere mitigating circumstances. For its part, the Court considers that, in view of the overall thrust of the article (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, \u00a7 48 in limine, Series A no. 236; Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7 47 in limine, ECHR 2003V; and Timpul InfoMagazin and Anghel v.

Nonetheless, the fact remains that they featured in the national courts\u2019 analysis of the case.",

For instance, it seems that they did not take into account the fact that the applicant had included the gist of the complainants\u2019 side of the story in her text. Nor did they sufficiently appreciate that at the time when the applicant had been researching her article, the results of the internal inspection carried out by the Ministry of Education and Science, which could have served as a reliable source of information, had not been made public, in spite of the fact that they had been ready for almost two months (see paragraph 11 above). That lack of publicity shows, on the one hand, the difficulty in obtaining reliable information on the issue and, on the other hand, the media\u2019s vital role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d in relation to such matters. It also highlights the public interest to publish information about the issue and about the authorities\u2019 reaction to it. Indeed, the lack of any contemporaneous official information, coupled with the uncontested existence of numerous irregularities in the admission of students, could reasonably have prompted the applicant to report on anything that was available, including information which was uncorroborated (see, mutatis mutandis, Flux (no. 7), cited above, \u00a7 44). It should be reiterated in that connection that the situation must be examined as it presented itself to the journalist at the material time, rather than with the benefit of hindsight (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 66 in fine and 72). However, those were only several elements among many that informed the national courts\u2019 assessment of the applicant\u2019s professional conduct.",

However, the Court does not consider it necessary to take a firm stance on that point, because it is in any event of the view that the sanction imposed on the applicant was disproportionate (see, mutatis mutandis, Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 10910).",

In addition, an award of damages for defamation must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered (see Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, 13 July 1995, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 316B, and Steel and Morris, cited above, \u00a7 96).

In Rumyana Ivanova the Court attached particular weight to that factor (see Rumyana Ivanova, cited above, \u00a7 69). However, it cannot overlook the fact that the possibility offered by Article 78a is apparently available only once, which means that, if convicted a second time of defamation, the applicant is likely to face criminal penalties.",

The four fines imposed on her came to a total of BGN 2,800, which, even taken alone, looks considerable when weighed against her salary (see paragraph 7 above). However, that amount must not be seen in isolation, but together with the damages and the costs awarded to the complainants. Those came to BGN 4,000 and BGN 512 respectively, making the total sum payable BGN\u00a07,472 (EUR 3,797.36). That sum, which was the equivalent of almost seventy minimum monthly salaries (BGN 110 (EUR 56.24) at the relevant time) and of more than thirtyfive monthly salaries of the applicant, was payable by her alone (contrast with Worm v. , 29 August 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 15 and 57, Reports 1997V). Indeed, one of the effects of the criminal character of the proceedings was that any fine imposed on the defendant would be payable by him or her alone. Unlike Rumyana Ivanova, where the Court was satisfied that BGN 3,050 was reasonable in the circumstances (see Rumyana Ivanova, cited above, \u00a7 69), in the case at hand it finds that BGN 7,472 was an excessive sum (contrast Wo\u0142ek and Others, cited above). The evidence submitted by the applicant shows that she struggled for years to pay it in full (see paragraph 31 above and contrast with St\u00e2ngu and Scutelnicu v.\u00a0Romania, no. 53899/00, \u00a7 56, 31 January 2006, and Mihaiu v.
