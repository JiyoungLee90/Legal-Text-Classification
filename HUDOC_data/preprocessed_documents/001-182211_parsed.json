The sole disagreement between the parties was the question of whether or not the applicants\u2019 alleged offences had been committed within the sphere of their business activities. If they were, the applicants could not have been detained by virtue of Article\u00a0108 \u00a7 1.1 of the CCrP which, as noted above, prohibited the remanding in custody of people suspected or accused of offences committed within the sphere of business activities. The provision itself did not define the concept of a \u201cbusiness activity\u201d. Two months after Article\u00a0108 \u00a7 1.1 of the CCrP entered into force, the Supreme Court of Russia instructed the national courts to be guided by the definition of a \u201cbusiness activity\u201d given by the Civil Code of Russia (see paragraph\u00a018 above).",

Poland, no.\u00a027785/95, \u00a7\u00a0114, ECHR 2000XI). In respect of the first applicant, who was suspected of defrauding his partners by arranging the sale of their company to him alone, the national courts simply stated that his offence was not connected with his business activity, without any apparent analysis. In respect of the second applicant, whose private bank had allegedly acquired unsecured promissory notes to transfer the money out of the bank\u2019s account, the national courts refused to apply Article\u00a0108\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01.1, referring to the \u201cmethod and circumstances\u201d of his alleged offence (see paragraphs 13-14 above), again without any further explanation.

At the same time, Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is mostly concerned with the existence of a lawful basis for a detention within criminal proceedings, whereas the possible justifications for such detention fall under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see Khodorkovskiy v.
