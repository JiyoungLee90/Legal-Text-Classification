Had this not been the case, the applicant company would have had reason to question the Court of Appeal\u2019s impartiality. However, the latter court had not reconsidered its decision of 3 November 2005, but abstained from taking cognisance of the request on the basis that it was null and void.

It delivered a decision on a new legal question, namely the legal and procedural question of whether the appeal application was null and void, viz, whether the method of appeal used by the applicant company was one envisaged and allowed according to the COCP. It therefore did not decide on the merits of its previous decision. Moreover, it found that it had not been sufficiently proved that there was a real risk that the relevant judges had been biased. Indeed, the applicant company had not contested the impartiality of the Court of Appeal at the beginning of the proceedings, namely on the basis that the appeal in respect of the decision of 25 February 2005 had also been decided by the same formation of the Court of Appeal. Furthermore, the judicial code of ethics, the judicial oath and the relevant law provisions in respect of withdrawal and abstention of judges offered a sufficient guarantee of impartiality.",

In this respect even appearances may be of some importance. What is at stake is the confidence that the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public (see Castillo Algar v. Spain, 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, \u00a7 45). It follows that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Wettstein, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044, and Ferrantelli and Santangelo v.\u00a0Italy, 7\u00a0August 1996, Reports 1996-III, \u00a7\u00a058).

Poland, no. 2065/03, \u00a7 40, 16 January 2007 and Eur. Comm. HR, R.M.B. v. the United Kingdom, No. 37120/97, dec. 9\u00a0September 1998). The assessment of whether the participation of the same judge in different stages of a civil case complies with the requirement of impartiality laid down by Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to be made on a case-to-case basis, regard being had to the circumstances of the individual case and, importantly, to the characteristics of the relevant rules of civil procedure applied to the case. In particular, it is necessary to consider whether the link between substantive issues determined in a decision on the merits and the admissibility of an appeal against that decision is so close as to cast doubt on the impartiality of the judge (see Warsicka, cited above, \u00a7 40).",

Unlike in Warsicka, where the applicant had recourse to the Supreme Court having a full remit to decide on the applicant\u2019s claims, in the instant case, the proceedings the applicant company brought before the constitutional jurisdictions could only deal with the impartiality issue and not with the admissibility or merits of the applicant company\u2019s request. Nevertheless, the absence of such a review cannot alone be determinative. The  found that the applicant company\u2019s impartiality complaint was unfounded. Having regard to the nature of the issues involved, namely that the Court of Appeal concluded that Article 229 invoked by the applicant company did not apply in those circumstances, as no appeal lay against the final judgment delivered by the Court of Appeal on 3 November 2005, it considered that the fact that the same formation gave a judgment on the merits of a case and subsequently decided that the applicant\u2019s request in the form of an appeal application was null and void, could not be in violation of Article 6 (see paragraph 13 above).",

In the present case, the question determined by the Court of Appeal on 14 December 2005 was not the same as the question which the Court of Appeal had determined on 3 November 2005. In the November hearing the court was examining the substance of the applicant company\u2019s request for a stay of execution. In the December decision, the court had to determine whether the applicant company\u2019s request for reconsideration under Article\u00a0229 (4) of the COCP was compatible with domestic law and procedure, and could be allowed. Only if that had been the case could the court have carried out an examination of the merits, a phase which never materialised in the circumstances of the case. Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, the scope of the examination involved, which can be considered tantamount to an assessment of admissibility, cannot be said to be the same or intrinsically linked to the merits of the original claim.",

There was no such link between the substantive issues determined on 3 November 2005 regarding the merits of a request for a stay of execution and the decision of 14\u00a0December 2005 on whether the applicant company had a legal avenue of access to an appeal or reconsideration of the previous decision, which would cast doubt on the impartiality of that court.",
