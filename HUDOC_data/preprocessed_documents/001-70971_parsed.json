Croatia (dec.), no. 20862/02, ECHR 2002VII). He therefore offered the domestic bodies the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violation alleged. However, it is understandable that the applicant, seeing that his constitutional complaint had failed, did not lodge a second constitutional complaint. For the Court, this would overstretch the duties incumbent on an applicant pursuant to Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Uni\u00f3n Alimentaria Sanders S.A. v.
