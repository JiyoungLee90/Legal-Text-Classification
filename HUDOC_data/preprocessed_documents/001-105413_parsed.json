The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, for example, Hentrich v.\u00a0France, 22\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a0296-A, and Remli v.\u00a0France, 23\u00a0April 1996, \u00a7 33, Reports 1996-II). Thus, the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits. To hold otherwise would not be compatible with the subsidiary character of the Convention system (see Gavril Yosifov v. Bulgaria, no. 74012/01, \u00a7 42, 6\u00a0November 2008). Nevertheless, the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires only that an applicant make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances (see Balogh v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a047940/99, \u00a7 30, 20 July 2004, and John Sammut and Visa Investments Limited v.

France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports 1996-III; Nasrulloyev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 656/06, \u00a7 71, 11 October 2007; and Mooren v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7 76, 9 July 2009).

Thus, Article\u00a06 -\u00a0especially paragraph 3 \u2013 may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions (Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036). As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 of the Convention is one element, amongst others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in paragraph 1 (Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 37, and Brennan, cited above, \u00a7 45).",

It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court\u2019s task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial. In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to \u2018guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective\u2019 and that assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused (Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

However, this right has so far been considered capable of being subject to restrictions for good cause. The question, in each case, has therefore been whether the restriction was justified and, if so, whether, in the light of the entirety of the proceedings, it has not deprived the accused of a fair hearing, for even a justified restriction is capable of doing so in certain circumstances (see John Murray, cited above, \u00a7 63; Brennan, cited above, \u00a7 45, and Magee, cited above, \u00a7 44).",

They also contribute to the prevention of miscarriages of justice and the fulfilment of the aims of Article\u00a06, notably equality of arms between the investigating or prosecuting authorities and the accused.",

Austria, no.\u00a09300/81, Commission\u2019s report of 12 July 1984, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 96). At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task it is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. This right indeed presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 100, ECHR\u00a02006-..., and Kolu v. Turkey, no. 35811/97, \u00a7 51, 2 August 2005). Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination (see, mutatis mutandis, Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0101). In this connection, the Court also notes the recommendations of the CPT (paragraphs\u00a039-40 above), in which the committee repeatedly stated that the right of a detainee to have access to legal advice is a fundamental safeguard against illtreatment. Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly called for in the case of serious charges, for it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies.",
