Sokolov v. , no. 3734/02, \u00a7\u00a032, 22\u00a0September 2005). The Court observes that on 24 March 2003 the Moscow City Court issued a final judgment by which the applicant was to be paid a certain sum of money by the Department of Culture, a State body. On 21 July 2003 the sum in question was transferred to the deposit account of a notary public and the applicant was able to receive it. The Court is of the view that the period from 5\u00a0May 1998 to 21\u00a0July 2003 should be regarded as a whole. It thus lasted approximately five years and three months.",
