The Court has already found violations in cases where the formalisation of an applicant\u2019s status as an arrested criminal suspect was delayed without a reasonable explanation (see, among many other authorities, Rakhimberdiyev v. Russia, no. 47837/06, \u00a7 36, 18\u00a0September 2014; Smolik v. Ukraine, no. 11778/05, \u00a7\u00a7 46-48, 19 January 2012; Ivan Kuzmin v. Russia, no. 30271/03, \u00a7\u00a7 81-84, 25 November 2010; and Aleksandr Sokolov v. Russia, no. 20364/05, 4 November 2010, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07073). The present case is another example of this practice: although the record of arrest was eventually prepared, the time of the applicant\u2019s arrest given in the record was different from the time of her actual apprehension. Her sixteen-hour detention at the police station was not recorded or acknowledged in any procedural form. It follows that her initial detention breached the requirements implicit in Article 5 of the Convention for the proper recording of deprivations of liberty.",

Russia (dec.), nos.\u00a029474/07 and others, \u00a7 31, 22 September 2015). The applicant had reason to believe that their neutrality may have been compromised on account of their affiliation with the narcotics police and she sought to obtain their attendance and examination in open court with a view to clarifying that point. Had she been successful in showing that they were in fact police employees, it would have bolstered the defence\u2019s claim that the record of seizure of objects and substances had been prepared in breach of the explicit prohibition on the participation of police operatives and was therefore inadmissible in evidence (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).

Counsel asked the trial court to obtain the list of visitors to the police premises on that day on the assumption that it would contain the names of civilian visitors only, as the police officers and employees would use their service badges to enter the building. If Ms P. and Ms A. had not been registered as visitors, that would have indicated, by converse implication, that they were employed by, or affiliated with, the police.

Accordingly, the Court concludes to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention.
