Nor would it be economically feasible for the Government to provide all 60-year-old men with pensions pending equalisation in 2020 as it would involve the diversion of substantial resources from other State needs (an estimated cost of GBP 75 billion). After a full public consultation exercise, the Government decided to bring the age up to 65 for all based on the considerations that people lived longer and healthier lives, there would be more pensioners supported by fewer people of working age, public expenditure on pensions was set to double by 2035 and occupational schemes were predominantly equalising at the age of 65 already. They pointed out that the European Union had accepted that Member States must be allowed a period of transition to plan and implement the move to equal ages. The \u2019s plans were in line with other developed nations and the European Commission had never suggested that its measures were in any way deficient or disproportionate but had impliedly accepted them.",

IB was a benefit funded out of NI contributions designed to protect the recipient against loss of income due to incapacity for the duration of their presumed working life. Systemic and fiscal coherence required that working life be taken as the working life upon which State pensionable age and NI contributions were based. Thus the linkage between the availability of IB and State pensionable age was necessary and justified, as accepted by the ECJ (see paragraph 21 above). It would not be possible to change the linkage by setting all IB entitlements as lasting to age 65 as this would produce incoherent results and impact adversely, inter alia, on those women with more complete pension contribution records than this applicant, who would find it more advantageous to receive their pension early. The linkage was also in the interests and fair treatment of other contributors to the NIF, particularly male contributors who were generally disadvantaged by the present scheme. They also pointed out that the discrimination complained of in this case had a very narrow compass, affecting only some women between age 60 and 65. The lower State pension age and NI contribution record in the great majority of cases worked to the advantage of women and the move from IB to a pension was advantageous to women with a full or nearly full contribution record. The difference in this applicant\u2019s position was a direct reflection of her contributions record. The fact that men over 60 in receipt of IB had their NI contributions paid for a further five years did not result in any unfair advantage as male entitlement to a full State pension was set five years\u2019 higher than that applicable to women. A man with the applicant\u2019s contribution record would only receive a partial pension also, though at the rate of 66% instead of 62%.",

This applies to systems of taxation or contributions which must inevitably differentiate between groups of tax-payers and the implementation of which unavoidably creates marginal situations. A Government may often have to strike a balance between the need to raise revenue and reflecting other social objectives in taxation policies. The national authorities are obviously in a better position than the Court to assess those needs and requirements, which in the present case involve complex concerns about the financing of pensions and benefits which impact on the community as a whole. In such an area the Court will generally respect the legislature\u2019s policy choice unless it is manifestly unreasonable (see, as the latest authority, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 52).",

As in this case, the applicant, Mrs Stec, lost her entitlement to the benefit at the age of 60 while a man would have continued to receive it until the age of 65. Both the REA and IB were benefits designed to compensate a person for financial loss as a result of their inability to work due to ill-health or incapacity and thus connected to employment and working life. The use of the State pension age as a cut off point made, the Government argued, the scheme easy to understand and to administer and the Court accepted that such questions of administrative economy and coherence were generally matters falling within the margin of appreciation referred to above (Stec, \u00a7 57). Also of strong persuasive value is the ECJ\u2019s stance on the objective necessity of ensuring consistency with the pension scheme in the entitlement to such employment-linked benefits (see Stec, cited above, \u00a7 58, and Relevant domestic law and practice, paragraphs 21-22). As in the Stec case therefore, the linkage of the cut-off age of IB to the notional end of working life or State pensionable age must be regarded as pursuing a legitimate aim and as being reasonably and objectively justified (see \u00a7 59).",

Differential pensionable ages were first introduced for men and women in the  in 1940, well before the Convention had come into existence, although the disparity persists to the present day (see paragraph 32 above). It would appear that the difference in treatment was adopted in order to mitigate financial inequality and hardship arising out of the woman\u2019s traditional unpaid role of caring for the family in the home rather than earning money in the workplace. At their origin, therefore, the differential pensionable ages were intended to correct \u2018factual inequalities\u2019 between men and women and appear therefore to have been objectively justified under Article 14 (see paragraph 51 above).",

It follows that the difference in pensionable ages continued to be justified until such time that social conditions had changed so that women were no longer substantially prejudiced because of a shorter working life. This change, must, by its very nature, have been gradual, and it would be difficult or impossible to pinpoint any particular moment when the unfairness to men caused by differential pensionable ages began to outweigh the need to correct the disadvantaged position of women. Certain indications are available to the Court. Thus, in the 1993 White Paper, the Government asserted that the number of women in paid employment had increased significantly, so that whereas in 1967 only 37% of employees were women, the proportion had increased to 50% in 1992. In addition, various reforms to the way in which pension entitlement was assessed had been introduced in 1977 and 1978, to the benefit of women who spent long periods out of paid employment. As of 1986, it was unlawful for an employer to have different retirement ages for men and women (see paragraph\u00a033 above).",

According to the information before the Court, the Government made a first, concrete, move towards establishing the same pensionable age for both sexes with the publication of the Green Paper in December 1991. It would, no doubt, be possible to argue that this step could, or should, have been made earlier. However, as the Court has observed, the development of parity in the working lives of men and women has been a gradual process, and one which the national authorities are better placed to assess (see paragraph 52 above). Moreover, it is significant that many of the other Contracting States still maintain a difference in the ages at which men and women become eligible for the State retirement pension (see paragraph 37 above). Within the European Union, this position is recognised by the exception contained in the Directive (see paragraph 38 above).",
