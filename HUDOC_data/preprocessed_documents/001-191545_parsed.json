However, the purpose of the alienation of the applicant\u2019s property in the present case was the renovation and development of the mosque complex, which did not fall within the exhaustive list of purposes stipulated in Article 157.9 of the Civil Code. Neither the domestic courts nor the Government addressed this matter.",

However, it has not been shown that that order contained any specific provisions relating to the alienation of private property. The Court finds it difficult to see how that order, issued during the Soviet era before the independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan, could be considered as an instrument expropriating privately-owned property, given that the right to private ownership of property, in its present scope, emerged in the domestic law after the independence (see, mutatis mutandis, Sargsyan v. Azerbaijan [GC], no. 40167/06, \u00a7 200 et seq., ECHR 2015). In any event, that order could not be considered as a lawful basis for expropriation after the currently applicable legal framework for expropriation was enacted by the Civil Code of 1 September 2000.",

However, the domestic courts failed to refer to any specific decisions that identified their dates, numbers, and content.
