The Supreme Court then reiterated its own case-law that, where the sale of property at a public auction is unlawful because of a bailiff\u2019s actions, restitution in integrum should not be applied; accordingly, it considered that the most appropriate way of protecting the applicant\u2019s rights was by awarding him damages. However, the court considered that, in line with \u201cthe nature of the obligation and the principles of equity, reasonableness and good faith\u201d (pagal prievol\u0117s esm\u0119, atsi\u017evelgiant \u012f teisingumo, protingumo ir s\u0105\u017einingumo kriterijus), the amount of damages in the applicant\u2019s case had to be assessed at the moment of the unlawful act, that is, the sale of the apartment.

The applicant argued that awarding him an amount equal to the apartment\u2019s market price in 2004, which amounted to about one fifth of its market price at the time of the final domestic judgment, had been manifestly insufficient in terms of enabling him to acquire a new comparable apartment.",

When making the award, the Supreme Court considered that \u201cthe nature of the obligation and the principles of equity, reasonableness and good faith\u201d warranted relying on market prices at the time when the apartment had been sold at a public auction (see paragraph\u00a018 above). However, the Supreme Court did not provide any explanation as to how those principles applied in the applicant\u2019s case, nor why they justified such a decision in the particular circumstances. The Court reiterates that, according to its established case-law reflecting a principle linked to the proper administration of justice, judgments of courts and tribunals should adequately state the reasons on which they are based (see Albergas and Arlauskas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a017978/05, \u00a7 67, 27\u00a0May 2014, and Paliutis v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 34085/09, \u00a7 45, 24 November 2015; see also the relevant practice of the Lithuanian Constitutional Court in paragraph 28 above).

However, the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument. It firstly observes that the applicant submitted his claim within the time-limit provided in the domestic law, and his exercise of his procedural rights cannot be interpreted as evidence of bad faith (see, mutatis mutandis, Kolomiyets v. Russia, no. 76835/01, \u00a7 29, 22\u00a0February 2007). The Court further notes that the Supreme Court explicitly held that, according to its own case-law, restitution in integrum should not have been applied in the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraph 18 above). Furthermore, the Supreme Court did not make any mention of the applicant\u2019s alleged bad faith, either in relation to the reasons presented by the Government, or in relation to anything else (contrast with the judgment of the first-instance court in the applicant\u2019s case\u00a0\u2013\u00a0see paragraph 12 above). Therefore, in the absence of adequate reasons in the final judgment, the Court considers the Government\u2019s position that that judgment relied on the applicant\u2019s alleged bad faith to be purely speculative and does not accept it (see, mutatis mutandis, Albergas and Arlauskas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67).",

Russia, no. 32718/02, \u00a7\u00a047, 24\u00a0May 2007). In particular, although the applicant made it clear that he had not had a home following the unlawful sale of his apartment, and that the amount of damages which he claimed was intended to cover the purchase of a new comparable apartment (see paragraph 10 above), it does not appear that the Supreme Court took any account of the applicant\u2019s ability to obtain a new home (see, mutatis mutandis, Rousk v.\u00a0Sweden, no.\u00a027183/04, \u00a7\u00a0140, 25\u00a0July 2013; compare and contrast Zrili\u0107 v.

In such circumstances, the Court considers that the domestic courts failed to strike a fair balance between the applicant\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his property and any competing general interest, and that awarding the applicant compensation which was several times below the market value of his apartment at the time when he submitted his claim to the domestic courts and which was insufficient for him to obtain a new comparable apartment imposed an individual and excessive burden on him.",
