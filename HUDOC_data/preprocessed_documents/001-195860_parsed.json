The Government\u2019s argument that the Constitutional Court is \u201cbound\u201d by the request formulated in the constitutional appeal is therefore irrelevant in the present case. The Court observes that the applicants indicated the total length of the proceedings and the number of levels of jurisdiction. They also provided the Constitutional Court with the decisions rendered in the proceedings. Since the impugned proceedings lasted more than nine and nineteen years for two and three levels of jurisdiction, respectively, the Court considers that the cases were prima facie meritorious. In such circumstance, the Constitutional Court should have examined the merits of the cases. If it needed any additional information or documents, it could have invited the applicants or the relevant authorities to provide them. In this connection, the Court observes that complaints about the length of proceedings, unlike some other complaints under the Convention, normally do not require much elaboration (see \u0160a\u0107irovi\u0107 and Others v. Serbia, nos. 54001/15 and 3 others, \u00a7 12, 20\u00a0February 2018, contrast Golubovi\u0107 and others v. Serbia (dec.), nos.\u00a010044/11 and 8 others, \u00a7 43, 17 September 2013, concerning a complaint about the inconsistent case-law of domestic courts). It follows that the applicants provided the national authorities with an opportunity which is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, namely of putting right the violations alleged against them (see Mur\u0161i\u0107 v. Croatia [GC], no. 7334/13, \u00a7 72, 20\u00a0October 2016).",
