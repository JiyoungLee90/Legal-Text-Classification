This represents an incarceration rate of some 220 per 100,000 inhabitants \u2013 one of the highest among Council of Europe member states. The Moldovan authorities recognised that the size of the prison population and the resulting overcrowding in prisons constituted a major challenge. Indeed, the delegation observed for itself that the national standard of at least 4 m2 of living space per prisoner was far from being met in most of the prison establishments visited; in particular at Chi\u0219in\u0103u and Soroca Prisons, the levels of overcrowding had reached disturbing proportions. In this context, the delegation was told by the authorities that the increase in the number of prisoners was largely attributable to the rising re-offending rates and excessive resort to remand detention, as well as to reluctance on the part of judges to grant early conditional release.",

It also notes that the remedy suggested by the Government does not have a preventive effect in the sense of improving the conditions of an applicant\u2019s detention, but only a compensatory effect (see, for instance, Holomiov v. Moldova, no.\u00a030649/05, \u00a7 107, 7 November 2006). It is not therefore effective in cases where people are still detained in such conditions at the time of lodging their application with the Court (see, for instance, Oprea v.

In cases where there is a continuing situation, the six-month period runs from the cessation of the situation (see B.\u00a0and D. v. the United Kingdom, no. 9303/81, Commission decision of 13\u00a0October 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 49, p. 44). The concept of a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d refers to a state of affairs which operates by continuous activities by or on the part of the State so as to render the applicant a victim (see Montion v. France, no. 11192/84, Commission decision of 14 May 1987, DR 52, p. 227; and Hilton v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a012015/86, Commission decision of 6 July 1988, DR 57, p. 108). Normally, the six-month period runs from the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of (see D.P. and J.C. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 38719/97, 26 June 2001).",

There is nothing to suggest that the applicant was in any way impeded by the authorities from complaining before that date regarding her detention in the detention centre of the GDFOC from 17\u00a0March 2010 to 29 March 2010 and regarding the first two periods of detention in Prison no. 13 (from 29 March 2010 to 30 March 2011 and from 26\u00a0January 2012 to 19 September 2012). It is true that the applicant was deprived of liberty within the framework of the same criminal proceedings. Nonetheless, in view of the significant gap between the first period of detention and the second such period (ten months) and between the second period and the third (eight and a half months) with which the complaints are concerned, the Court cannot treat them as part of a continuing situation as described above (see Haritonov v. Moldova, no.\u00a015868/07, \u00a7 26, 5\u00a0July 2011). In such circumstances, the Court considers that only the complaint concerning the last period of detention, in Prison no.\u00a013 from 5 June 2013 until present, was lodged within the time-limit provided for in Article 35 of the Convention. Consequently, the complaints in respect of the other periods of detention in Prison no. 13 and the detention facility of the Ministry of the Interior must be declared inadmissible under Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 4 of the Convention.",
