The specific circumstances of the instant case did not allow for an earlier termination of the proceedings. This was due to the extent and the complexity of the criminal charges. Apart from two counts of murder, of which he had been convicted, the applicant had been accused of holding a leading role in a foreign terrorist organisation and of having participated in causing a considerable number of explosions in Turkey. The case-files consisted of approximately 130 large volumes. As the applicant had been arrested by chance, the examination of the relevant facts could begin only after his arrest. The Turkish authorities had submitted a large number of documents such as expert opinions, sketches and records of witness testimony, which had to be translated and examined before the issue of the indictment on 24 June 2008. Due to the volume of the case-file and to the complexity of the subject matter, the main proceedings could not be opened before 21 November 2008. During the hearing, the progress of the taking of evidence had been determined by several requests by letters rogatory to the Turkish authorities. Members of the court and representatives of the parties travelled to Turkey four times in order to attend the hearing of witnesses before Turkish courts. Each taking of evidence by letters rogatory took considerably more than half a year. Following this, the taking of evidence was closed on 10 February 2011, but re-opened altogether three times at the request of the defence. The reading out of the applicant\u2019s last word alone took four days.",

The Court observes that S.G.\u2019s reliability may be called into question in view of the fact that the witness was giving hearsay evidence and that he had benefited from a milder sentence as a reward for having collaborated with Turkish prosecution authorities. The Court reiterates in this context that it has previously considered that the sometimes ambiguous nature of statements of so-called \u201cpentiti\u201d, and the risk that a person might be accused and arrested on the basis of unverified allegations that are not necessarily disinterested, must not be underestimated (compare Labita, cited above, \u00a7 157). Accordingly, such testimony had to be corroborated by other evidence in order to justify continued pre-trial detention (see Labita, cited above, \u00a7 158). In the instant case, the evidence given by S.G. was corroborated by documentary evidence establishing that the applicant had been elected into the central committee of the DHKP-C and by evidence given by witnesses who had confirmed that the applicant held a leading position in the terrorist organisation at the relevant time. In contrast to the Labita case, it thus cannot be said that the Court of Appeal relied exclusively on testimony given by a witness who had been rewarded for having collaborated with prosecution authorities. In the light of these considerations, the Court accepts that there persisted a reasonable suspicion against the applicant throughout the proceedings.",

The Court notes, at the outset, that the present case relates to serious offences, including two counts of murder committed in the context of terrorist attacks carried out in Turkey. The Court has previously acknowledged that States combating crime on an international scale may be faced with extraordinary difficulties (see Chraidi, cited above, \u00a7 37; and Tinner, cited above, \u00a7 62). The Court further observes that the applicant did not contest that the overall length of the criminal proceedings and, as a consequence, of his pre-trial detention, was primarily caused by the difficulties of gathering evidence by way of letters rogatory. Furthermore, the applicant contributed to the length of the proceedings by requesting the taking of evidence before the Court of Appeal to be re-opened. While the applicant was entitled to make use of his procedural rights, any consequential lengthening of proceedings cannot be held against the State (see, among other authorities, K\u00f6nig v. Germany, 28\u00a0June 1978, \u00a7 103, Series A no. 27). The fact that the first instance judgment given by the Court of Appeal on 21 November 2008 was quashed by the Federal Court of Justice does not reflect a lack of special diligence, as this decision was not based on any grave procedural error committed by the lower court, but on a divergence in the assessment of evidence.",

In this context the Court notes that delays in criminal procedures within the framework of international anti-terror laws are unavoidable due to difficulties in collecting evidence in different countries. Nevertheless, a pro-active approach is necessary in order to speed up the procedure as far as possible. In the instant case, the Court observes that the Court of Appeal travelled four times to Turkey in order to follow up requests by letters rogatory. It thus cannot be said that the domestic courts failed to exercise special diligence in this context.",
