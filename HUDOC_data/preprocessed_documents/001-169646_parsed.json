However, in the light of all the material in its possession, and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court finds that these complaints do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. It follows that these complaints are manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and\u00a04 of the Convention.",

The Court however rejects the second and third applicants\u2019 claim for the interest and inflation losses because of their failure to specify the precise amount they claimed under that head.
