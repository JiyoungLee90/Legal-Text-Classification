The Court notes that although the applicant complained to the police about her beating the next day after the incident, the investigation into it was instituted only some three months later. The Court further notes that in 2001-2003 the District Police adopted several decisions to suspend the investigation which were quashed as unfounded. Due to the District Police\u2019s negligence, Z. left for Germany and stayed there for about five years and eight months (20042010) which resulted in an unnecessary protraction of the criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the courts remitted the case for additional investigation three times and once for a fresh consideration by a lower court. The Court recalls that the repetition of such remittal orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see Wierciszewska v. Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7\u00a7 46, 25 November 2003). In the light of the above the Court considers that the investigation was ineffective and its length was unjustified.",
