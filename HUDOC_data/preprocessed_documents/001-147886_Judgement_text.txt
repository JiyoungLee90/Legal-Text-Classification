The case originated in an application (no. 64385/12) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Tamás Havas (“the applicant”), on 28 September 2012.
The applicant was represented by Ms E. Pivarnyikné Juhász, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 26 October 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Budapest.
At the material time the applicant was a managing director of a tour operator limited liability company, HTC Kft.
On an unspecified date criminal investigations were opened against HTC Kft and another limited liability company on suspicion of bankruptcy fraud. On 8 September 2000 the Budapest VI/VII Police Department ordered the search of the applicant’s flat and vehicle, since there were grounds to believe that as the managing director of HTC Kft, he kept certain company documents at home.
On 14 February 2007 the applicant was heard as suspect on charges of bankruptcy fraud.
On 18 May 2007 the Budapest VI/VII District Public Prosecutor’s Office preferred a bill of indictment against the applicant, charging him with bankruptcy fraud.
The first hearing was held by the Pest Central District Court on 3 November 2009.
On 21 April 2012 the Pest Central District Court acquitted the applicant. The judgment became final on 1 August 2012.
