It has clarified in this context that the authorities must ensure that diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate (see, for example,\u00a0Gorbulya v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a031535/09, \u00a7 62, 6\u00a0March 2014, and Pokhlebin v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a035581/06, \u00a7 62, 20 May 2010, with further references) and that \u2012 where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition \u2012 supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at successfully treating the detainee\u2019s health problems or preventing their aggravation (see, inter alia, Ukhan v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 30628/02, \u00a7 74, 18 December 2008, and Kolesnikovich v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a044694/13, \u00a7\u00a070, 22\u00a0March 2016, with further references). The Court stresses that medical treatment within prison facilities must be appropriate and comparable to the quality of treatment which the State authorities have committed themselves to providing for the entirety of the population. Nevertheless, this does not mean that each detainee must be guaranteed the same level of medical treatment that is available in the best health establishments outside prison facilities (see, for instance, Sadretdinov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a017564/06, \u00a7\u00a067, 24\u00a0May 2016, and Konovalchuk v.
