The Court does not disregard that the applicants\u2019 attempts to initiate domestic proceedings following the first decision delivered by the Court failed. It however notes as regards the first set of proceedings that there is no indication that the applicants specifically sought compensation of pecuniary damage sustained as a result of quashing of a domestic judgment in their favour (see paragraph 17 above). As regards the second set of proceedings, it results from the domestic judgments that their claims, this time expressly limited to the compensation of pecuniary damage representing the difference between the pension they actually received from 19 December 2001 to 3 March 2006 and the pension they should have received if the judgment of 26 July 2002 were complied with by the authorities prior to its quashing with the subsequent indexation, were dismissed only because they failed to use an appropriate procedure (see paragraph 23 above).",
