The Court reiterates that the authorities should show a degree of tolerance towards a peaceful, albeit unlawful, assembly which creates only minimal or no disruption of ordinary life (see Lashmankin and Others v. Russia, nos. 57818/09 and 14 others, \u00a7\u00a0461, 7 February 2017, and the cases cited therein). Given that in the present case the domestic authorities had failed to establish the number of people involved by the applicant in his \u201ccampaigning\u201d, the Court cannot conclude whether his public event \u201cdisrupted ordinary life\u201d, and if so, what the degree of disruption was. It notes, however, that having been informed of the police\u2019s position on the unlawful nature of the event and having been ordered to stop it the applicant complied or was ready to comply with the police order. Even assuming that the police did have prima facie reasons for assessing the event as an \u201cassembly\u201d, the authorities should have shown a degree of tolerance, for instance by allowing the applicant to complete his picket and imposing, if appropriate, a reasonable fine on the spot or later on (see Novikova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 161-75, and, by contrast, Nosov and Others v. Russia, nos. 9117/04 and 10441/04, \u00a7 59, 20 February 2014, where the domestic authorities showed tolerance towards the unlawful applicants\u2019 demonstration lasting for more than two months by not dispersing it).",

The Court reiterates that the authorities may have legitimate reasons to apply such a measure in order to put an end to someone\u2019s prima facie unlawful conduct where he or she has refused to comply with a lawful order to cease such conduct, or on other grounds, listed, for example, in Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Novikova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0177). While there is no allegation or proof of any calls for violence or actual violent behaviour on the part of the applicant, it is clear that he refused to cease his prima facie unlawful demonstration thus prompting the police to consider that no measure other than taking him to the police station would stop it. Be that as it may, the Court is not convinced that the applicant\u2019s ensuing retention at the police station for one day and eighteen hours was justified by a \u201cpressing social need\u201d. Once the administrative offence record had been compiled at the police station, the objective of taking the applicant there was met. However, instead of being released, the applicant was formally remanded in custody to \u201csecure his attendance\u201d at the hearing before the Justice of the Peace on 24\u00a0April 2008. That hearing, however, concerned a separate administrative offence arising from the events earlier on 22 April 2008. The domestic authorities advanced no convincing reason for continuing to keep the applicant at the police station (see, mutatis mutandis, Frumkin v. Russia, no.\u00a074568/12, \u00a7\u00a0140, ECHR\u00a02016 (extracts)).",

His conduct was classified as a group public event held without prior notification to the competent authority. The Court reiterates in this connection its findings made in Novikova and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0204-08) that a solo demonstration as a particular form of expression may attract attention from passers-by. The mere presence of two or more people in the same place at the same time is not sufficient for classifying the situation as an \u201cassembly\u201d, as it is understood under Article 11 of the Convention, with a view to connecting the holding of this assembly to the observance of the domestic requirement of prior notification for group events. In the present case the domestic courts adopted a formalistic approach in finding that the applicant had held a group \u201cpicket\u201d. While the applicant\u2019s exact behaviour was of relevance, in view of the insufficient domestic assessment and bearing in mind the presumption of innocence, the Court is inclined to accept that the applicant\u2019s behaviour did not go beyond that of a solo demonstrator delivering a message that happened to receive some interest from passers-by. In any event, it is difficult for the Court to conceive that such an event could have generated a significant gathering warranting specific measures from the authorities, namely relating to prevention of disorder or provision of first medical aid.",

With due regard to the presumption of innocence, where the authorities suspect intentional actions aimed at evading the notification requirement, they should bear the burden of proving the relevant factual and legal elements.
