It recalled that its jurisprudence differentiated between allowances acquired by compulsory contribution to the social security scheme on the one hand, and social allowances not constituting \u201cpurchased rights\u201d on the other hand. The former allowances (e.g. old-age pension or pension for surviving spouse) enjoyed property-like constitutional protection because of their inherent insurance element. As regards the latter, guarantees flowing from the requirements of the rule of law (i.e. protection of legitimate expectations, proper time for preparation) should be observed as criteria of constitutionality \u2013 instead of requirements related to the protection of property. In the case-law of the Constitutional Court, protection of legitimate expectations (or, in other words, protection of acquired rights) meant the application of the requirement of due time for preparation, ensuing also from the principle of legal security of already acquired titles. In the absence of an already acquired title, the Constitutional Court might only verify whether the time allowed by the legislation was sufficient for the individuals to become aware of its content. In fact, it was the difference in the solidity of the basis of expectation which was question in the respective situations.",

As stated in the decision, the law \u2018provides care under the constitutional principle of social security for individuals who before reaching the old age pension age have lost their ability to work by reason of disability or disability due to accident. ... Prior to reaching the official retirement age, the disability pension is a special benefit granted to individuals based on their disability. Upon reaching pensionable age, individuals who are ... incapable of work ... are not entitled to this special benefit, because on termination of their employment, they are eligible to receive an old age pension based on their age.\u2019",

Indeed, the right to an old-age pension or any social benefit in a particular amount is not included as such among the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (see, for example, Aunola v.

If, however, a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a welfare benefit \u2013 whether conditional or not on the prior payment of contributions \u2013 that legislation must be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see, in the context of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos.\u00a065731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2005X). For the Court, the latter principle allows for a particular interpretation in the context of disability care, which is a welfare benefit of a special character. Since the making of contributions to a pension fund may, in certain circumstances, create a property right and such a right may be affected by the manner in which the fund is distributed (see Kjartan \u00c1smundsson, quoted above, \u00a7 39), the Court considers that if the benefit, which had been granted on the basis of the legislation in force and which had been generated by the making of appropriate contributions to the scheme and the satisfaction of the requirements of the legislation in force during one\u2019s active employment, was removed \u2013 notably by a retrospective amendment to the contribution rules \u2013 such a measure will require a convincing justification for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as long as the other key requirement, namely a deteriorated health status, is in place.",

This expectation originates in the law in force during her employment and at the time of the original acquisition of disability pension rights.

By granting disability pension in 2001, the authorities implicitly recognised that she satisfied the relevant criteria.

We observe, however, that Stec and Others (cited above) was limited to the question whether the welfare benefit concerned by the complaint fell within the \u201cambit\u201d of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for the purposes of Article 14. But the Court has subsequently applied a similar test of applicability to complaints inviting it to find an independent violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, thus examining whether the withdrawal of social security and welfare benefits was in conformity with the requirements of legality and proportionality under Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see, for example, Wieczorek v. Poland, no.\u00a018176/05, \u00a7 67, 8\u00a0December 2009, and Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, \u00a7 39, 15\u00a0September 2009). In such cases the Court has maintained its constant position that such a claim of an unjustified interference with a right in the field of welfare rights will not be considered to fall under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 if the applicant cannot demonstrate, as an absolute threshold issue, that he or she had, at the time of the interference, an \u201cassertable right\u201d under domestic law. Consequently, as most recently confirmed once again by the Court in Richardson v. the United Kingdom ((dec.) no. 26252/08, 10 April 2012, \u00a7\u00a017), where \u201cthe person concerned does not satisfy, or ceases to satisfy, the legal conditions laid down in domestic law for the grant of any particular form of benefits or pension, there is no interference with the rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1\u201d (emphasis added); the Court referred to the cases of Bellet, Huertas and Vialatte v. France, (dec.) no. 40832/98, 27\u00a0April 1999, and Rasmussen v. Poland, no. 38886/05, \u00a7 71, 28\u00a0April\u00a02009.",

More than two years had thus passed since her right to a disability pension had been withdrawn and the judicial proceedings, in which the applicant challenged that withdrawal, had come to an end on 1 April 2011.

The majority thus purport to \u201capply\u201d the general principles of the Court\u2019s case-law, as reiterated in paragraphs 35-39 of the judgment, the correct application of which could not possibly have led to the result arrived at by the majority.",

Turkey, no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7 124, ECHR 2004-XII). Thus, for there to be any possibility for an applicant to have an arguable right under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, on the basis of a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d, that expectation must be based on some normative legal source at domestic level that can reasonably confer a property right on him or her. It goes without saying that a legitimate expectation to a property right does not arise where the person in question cannot possibly be the recipient of such a right in national law in the light of its nature and legal origins. As the Grand Chamber stated unequivocally in Kopeck\u00fd v. Slovakia ([GC], 44912/98, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2004IX), \u201cno legitimate expectation [under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1] can be said to arise where there is a dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law and the applicant\u2019s submissions are subsequently rejected by the national courts\u201d (see also Anheuser-Busch Inc v. Portugal, [GC], no.\u00a073049/01, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2007I).",

It is undisputed that it is not to be found in the domestic law of Hungary. Again, the applicant had no right to the pension in question in 2012. The existence of such a right was unambiguously rejected by the national courts. Therefore, as Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not create a right to acquire property and, more importantly, places no restriction on the Contracting State\u2019s freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, it is self-evident that in 2012, two years after she lost her domestic right to the disability pension, the applicant could not possibly have had a legitimate expectation under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of retaining an autonomous right that was non-existent within the confines of the right to property under the Convention. Again, as the Court stated as a general principle just over three years ago in Richardson (cited above, \u00a7 17), where the person concerned does not satisfy, or \u201cceases to satisfy\u201d, the legal conditions laid down in domestic law for the grant of any particular form of benefits or pension, there is no interference with the rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

In any event, the applicant has not argued, nor demonstrated in any way before this Court, that the contributory scheme in question was in the form of compulsory contributions, for example to a pension fund or a social insurance scheme, that created a direct link between the level of contributions and the benefits awarded. Therefore, the applicant did not, at any given moment, have an identifiable and claimable share in a particular fund for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, or so-called \u201cpurchased rights\u201d within the meaning of the Convention (see, for example, M\u00fcller v.

This understanding of the applicability of the right to property under the Convention follows directly from Stec and Others (cited above), which made redundant, in principle, the distinction between contributory or non-contributory pension schemes in the member States for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In both situations, the applicant must demonstrate that he or she had an assertable right under domestic law for Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to apply. That is simply not the case for the present applicant.",

However, the Court is not competent to decide that issue as the applicant\u2019s complaint in this regard was not lodged with the Court within six months of the final decision in those proceedings (see paragraph 7 above). The majority cannot remedy this situation by inventing a substantive right to a disability pension under the Convention, where none exists, with unforeseen consequences for the social security and welfare systems of the 47 member States of the Council of Europe.",
