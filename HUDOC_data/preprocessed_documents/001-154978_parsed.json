It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court on these points, that is to say, that the remedy to which they refer was accessible and capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints, and offered a reasonable prospect of success. However, once the question of this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to applicants to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in their case, or that there existed special circumstances exempting them from the requirement to have recourse to it (see, for example, Melnik v.

The Government did not refer to that law in their observations. Nor did they specify which provision of the domestic law the applicant\u2019s detention had in fact violated.
