The case originated in an application (no. 4198/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Romanian nationals, Mrs Gabriela Rusu, Mrs Maria Băjenaru and Mrs Ioana Poenaru (“the applicants”), on 13 December 2003.
The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Ruxandra Paşoi, Co-Agent of the Government of Romania before the European Court of Human Rights.
On 27 February 2006 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants were born in 1948, 1955 and 1976 respectively, and live in .
In 1950, the two-floors building and appurtenant land situated in , W. Filderman no. 1, the property of the applicants' parents, was seized by the State under Decree no. 92/1950 on nationalisation.
On 13 April 1999 the applicants' action for recovery of possession of immovable property was upheld in part by an enforceable judgment which acknowledged that the nationalisation of the building had been unlawful and ordered the administrative authorities to return the building and appurtenant land to the applicants, with the exception of a studio flat at the second floor, sold by the applicants' parents in 1945.
In spite of having the judicial recognition of their property right, the applicants were not able to recover possession over flat no. 1 because the State had sold it together with the appurtenant land to the tenants, under Law no. 112/1995.
On 11 October 1999 the applicants requested the court to find that the sale by the State was null and void. They considered that, as the nationalisation had been unlawful, the State was not the rightful owner and consequently it could not lawfully have sold any part of the building.
On 12 September 2000 the Bucharest Tribunal, by a final decision, dismissed the request for the rescission of the sale contract on the ground that the applicants brought the action for the recovery of possession after the sale of flat no. 1 by the State and that the tenants had made the purchase in good faith. The tribunal had not granted any compensation to the applicants.
On 28 June 2001 the Bucharest Court of First Instance admitted by a final decision the applicants' action to have acknowledged their right of property regarding the whole building.
On 13 February 2002 the applicants claimed compensation for the sale of flat no. 1 under the Law no. 10/2001 governing immovable property wrongfully seized by the State. At present, they have not received any compensation.
On 16 May 2002 the Bucharest Court of Appeal, by a final decision, dismissed the applicants' action for the recovery of possession of flat no. 1, considering that although the applicants were the rightful owners, the sale was performed in good faith and therefore the tenants could not be evacuated.
