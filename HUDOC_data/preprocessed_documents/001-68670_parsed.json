In this connection, the Government pointed out that the Constitution of the \u201cTRNC\u201d incorporated provisions for human rights drawn from the 1960 Cypriot Constitution, and also the European Convention on Human Rights, which formed part of the laws of the \u201cTRNC\u201d. Under the Constitution fundamental rights and liberties could only be restricted by law and only for the purposes that were provided for in law. Articles 136 to 155 of the Constitution provided for access to independent courts and for judicial review of administrative action on the grounds of illegality or error of law and excess and/or abuse of power (Article\u00a0152) as well as judicial review of legislation by way of reference to the Supreme Constitutional Court (Article 148) and the institution of proceedings for annulment of legislation and subsidiary legislation (Article\u00a0147). In particular, Article 152 of the Constitution provided that the High Administrative Court had exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate in the final instance on a complaint that a decision, act or omission of any body, authority or person exercising any executive or administrative authority was contrary to any of the provisions of the Constitution, or of any law or subsidiary legislation thereunder, or exceeded or abused the powers vested in such body or authority or person.",

In this connection, they relied on the interview given by the applicant in which she stated that her late husband had been worried about his family (see paragraph 198 of the Appendix).

Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court's task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and as a general rule it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them (see Klaas v. Germany, judgment of 22\u00a0September 1993, Series A no. 269, p. 17, \u00a7 29). Though the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts (Ibid., p. 18, \u00a7 30). The same principles apply mutatis mutandis where no domestic court proceedings have taken place because the prosecuting authorities have not found sufficient evidence to initiate such proceedings. Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v.

In this respect, the Court considers that the alleged events preceding the death of Kutlu Adal\u0131 give some support for the applicant's allegation that the killing of her husband was related to his activities as a journalist. Accordingly, the applicant's allegation that her husband was killed by or at least with the connivance of State agents cannot therefore be discarded as prima facie untenable.",

But no attempts were made to question Galip Mendi as regards the allegations concerning his involvement (see paragraphs 120, 140, 151 and 167 above). Likewise, it does not appear that the authorities, on being informed of the allegations in the press to the effect that Mr Ceylan had committed the murder along with H\u00fcseyin Demirci, were prompted immediately to take statements from Orhan Ceylan (see paragraph 132 above). The investigation conducted into the possible involvement of Mr Ceylan and Mr Demirci was therefore far from satisfactory (see paragraphs 129, 132 and 152 above). Furthermore, it seems doubtful whether there was an effective control as to whether all persons in the neighbourhood had been questioned (see paragraphs 119 and 148 above) even if in the immediate aftermath of the shooting a considerable number of statements were taken by the police from the people living in the vicinity of the scene of the incident.",

It is striking that this investigation, which included key witnesses whose evidence could have shed light on the impugned incident, was conducted only after the application had been communicated and subsequent to two hearings had been held in . In this connection, the Court notes that until October 2002 the investigating authorities did not attempt to take statements from Eybil Efendi, a police officer who was the first to arrive at the scene of the crime, and Ali R\u0131za G\u00f6rg\u00fcner, the then muhtar of the neighbourhood, who first entered the house with the police officers (see paragraphs 116 and 117 above).

Thus it was not established that any adequate steps were taken to investigate the possibility that the murder was politically motivated or had any link with his work as a journalist. On the contrary it appears that the responsible authorities already at an early stage of the investigation and on an insufficient basis discarded that possibility (see paragraphs 120, 140, 144 and 156 above).

Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see the following judgments: Aksoy, cited above, p. 2286, \u00a7 95; Ayd\u0131n v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 25\u00a0September 1997, Reports 1997-VI, pp. 1895-96, \u00a7 103; and Kaya, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106).",

However, as it has held in previous cases, these findings do not preclude the complaint in relation to Article 2 from being an \u201carguable\u201d one for the purposes of Article 13 (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, \u00a7 52; Kaya, cited above, pp.\u00a0330-31, \u00a7 107; and Ya\u015fa, cited above, p. 2442, \u00a7 113).

It appears from the documents contained in the case files that the investigating authorities have taken statements from almost a hundred persons who either lived in the neighbourhood or who might have heard or seen anything at the time of the killing (see paragraphs 37-178 in the Appendix). The local police arrived at the scene of the crime within a few minutes of the incident, a pathologist performed post-mortem examination, photographs of the scene of the incident were taken and a sketch map was drawn up, an autopsy was carried out, later on the same day, on Mr Adal\u0131's body and his personal belongings were secured as evidence (see paragraphs 48-52 of the judgment). Furthermore, a ballistics examination of the used cartridges found at the scene of the crime was carried out. As it can be seen from the meetings held between the applicant and the local authorities and also the numerous statements taken from family members, the applicant and her family members were provided with access to the investigation from the outset (see paragraphs 155, 160-163 in the judgment and paragraphs 37-43 and 170 in the Appendix). From the lowest ranking officer up to President Denkta\u015f, the domestic authorities have attached great importance to the issue of solving the murder and there was sufficient public scrutiny. In addition, it is clear that domestic authorities have given a follow up to each and every one of the applicant's complaints of discrimination, harassment or intimidation and conducted a prompt investigation into them (see, paragraphs 121, 139, 164, 166, 167 and 168-178\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Appendix).",

The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident\u201d (see paragraphs 221 and 223 of the judgment). It is clear from the case-law mentioned above that the authorities have a margin of appreciation in conducting the investigation. However, in the present case, the majority not only refused to leave such a margin to the investigating authorities but was inclined to act as a private body of investigators replacing the national authorities.

It is true that the Government have furnished the Court with a supplementary investigation file containing witness statements and reports from October 2002. In this connection, it need to be stressed that such a necessity arose only after the applicant had made numerous unfounded allegations concerning the possible involvement of certain individuals, such as H\u00fcseyin Demirci, Altay Say\u0131l and Mustafa Asilhan, in the killing of her late husband.",

It is therefore hard to consider Mr Adal\u0131 as a \u201cpolitical figure\u201d or an opponent of the local government by the mere fact that he used to write for a left-wing newspaper where he allegedly published articles criticising the policies of that government or of President Rauf\u00a0Denkta\u015f.",

However, it transpires from the submissions of the parties that Yenid\u00fczen was not the only newspaper which reported the St\u00a0Barnabas incident; K\u0131br\u0131s newspaper of 16 March 1996 reported the incident in detail a day before the Yenid\u00fczen report. Furthermore, there is not even a shred of evidence that Mr\u00a0Adal\u0131 had written an article about the St Barnabas incident because his name did not appear anywhere in Yenid\u00fczen. It is therefore not possible for a reader of the newspaper of 17\u00a0March 1996 to deduce that Mr Adal\u0131 was the author of the report about the incident which would consequently prompt the alleged \u201cthreats\u201d.",

It is striking that the applicant has never informed the national authorities about this aspect of the case but misled both the domestic investigating authorities and the Court with her allegations of political crime. Thus, in the absence of any allegation, the investigating authorities were unable to broaden the investigation so as to cover the alleged research or information held by Kutlu\u00a0Adal\u0131 about the secret organisations.",

Relevant samples were taken and scientifically examined. A pathologist who arrived at the scene a few hours after the killing performed the postmortem examination and, later on the same day, carried out an autopsy on the bodies. The Court also attached great weight to the fact the investigation into the killing of \u0130lker Tufansoy and his friend comprised of a case file of more than 600 pages (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 353-54). Having compared the investigation conducted in these two cases, I do not think that fewer steps had been taken in the instant case. To the contrary, the investigation in the present case was much more comprehensive and the investigation file which contains well over 1,000 pages of documents is an indication of the wide span of the investigation.",

As correctly pointed out in the judgment, the applicant has only partly succeeded in making out her complaints under the Convention (see paragraph 289 in the judgment). However, despite that fact, the majority considered it reasonable to award EUR 75,000. I\u00a0should like to point out that only a week before the adoption of the present judgment, the very same First Section of the Court awarded EUR 20,000 to the applicants in respect of their costs and expenses in the case of Akkum and Others v. Turkey (no.\u00a021894/93, 24 March\u00a02005). In Akkum and Others, the applicants were represented by two eminent university professors, namely Mr Kevin Boyle and Ms\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise Hampson, who have considerable experience in Convention proceedings. These two professors participated at a hearing in Strasbourg as well as at fact finding hearings in . Furthermore, the Court found in that case the Government responsible for the deaths of three relatives of the applicants and found multiple violations of Article 2 of the Convention as well as violations of Article 3 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. Accordingly, having regard to its facts, the number of applicants and the violations found, Akkum and others case was a far more complex case compared to the present one. The sum claimed by the applicants in Akkum and Others for the fees and costs of their lawyers, i.e.\u00a0GBP\u00a029,219.40, can be contrasted to the amount claimed by the applicant in the present case, i.e. GBP 319,783.85. In the light of the above, I am unable to see an objective and reasonable justification for the huge difference in respect of costs and expenses in the two cases. ",
