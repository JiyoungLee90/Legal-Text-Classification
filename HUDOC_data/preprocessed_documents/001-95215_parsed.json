By a faxed letter of 20 May 2008, the Registry was informed of the death of Ahmet O\u011fuz Ser\u00e7ino\u011flu. His second wife and five children (Dilek Ser\u00e7ino\u011flu, Vedide Deveci, Orhan Nazif Ser\u00e7ino\u011flu, Orhun Ser\u00e7ino\u011flu, \u00dclk\u00fc Ser\u00e7in Ser\u00e7ino\u011flu and Tevfik Sava\u015f Ser\u00e7ino\u011flu) declared their intention to pursue the application. For practical reasons, Ahmet O\u011fuz Ser\u00e7ino\u011flu will continue to be referred to as an applicant in this judgment, although his family is now to be regarded as such (see Ahmet Sad\u0131k v.
