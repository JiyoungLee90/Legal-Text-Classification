The charges included \u201cterrorism\u201d and premeditated, aggravated murder \u2013 capital offences \u2013 as well as attempting to overthrow the constitutional order and organising mass disturbances. At least 230 people were convicted and sentenced to between twelve and twenty-two years' imprisonment for their alleged participation in the unrest. All trials except one were closed to the public. The defendants' relatives and international observers were denied access to the courtroom. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and Human Rights Watch observers who were present at the only public trial from September to November 2005 were unanimous in their conclusion that the trial fell far short of international standards. They noted that all the defendants pleaded guilty to charges of \u201cterrorism\u201d and asked for forgiveness, while several even requested that they be given the death penalty. Their confessions, which were obtained from them during incommunicado pre-trial detention, closely followed the wording of the indictment. The observers expressed concerns that the defendants could have been subjected to torture and that their confessions could have been extracted under duress. Retained lawyers were not allowed to the detention centres or in the courtroom and were barred from representing their clients. The defendants were represented by State-appointed counsel who did not mount an active defence of the accused. There was no cross-examination of defendants or witnesses, and contradictions in the testimonies were not addressed. No witnesses for the defence were called to testify. The prosecution did not introduce any forensic, ballistic, or medical reports, nor did it present any exhibits or call expert witnesses. All the defendants were found guilty, predominantly on the basis of their confessions, and sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from fourteen to twenty years (see Human Rights Watch report of 11 May 2006 \u201cThe Andijan Massacre: one year later, still no justice\u201d; and the report of 21 April 2006 from the OSCE/ODIHR \u201cTrial monitoring in Uzbekistan \u2013 September/October 2005\u201d).",

The fact that the Government has rejected an international inquiry into the Andijan events, independent scrutiny of the related proceedings, and that there is no internationally accepted account of the events, is deeply worrying. Against such significant, serious and credible evidence of systematic torture by law enforcement officials in Uzbekistan, I continue to find myself appealing to Governments to refrain from transferring persons to . The prohibition of torture is absolute, and States risk violating this prohibition - their obligations under international law - by transferring persons to countries where they may be at risk of torture.

This is well illustrated by the current controversy over the use of 'diplomatic assurances' in the context of deportation procedures. The prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment encompasses the obligation not to send a person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would run a real risk of being subjected to such methods. In order to avoid such a risk in given cases, certain States have chosen the route of seeking assurances from the country of destination that the person concerned will not be ill-treated. This practice is far from new, but has come under the spotlight in recent years as States have increasingly sought to remove from their territory persons deemed to endanger national security. Fears are growing that the use of diplomatic assurances is in fact circumventing the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment.",

However, if in fact there would appear to be a risk of ill-treatment, can diplomatic assurances received from the authorities of a country where torture and ill-treatment is widely practised ever offer sufficient protection against that risk? It has been advanced with some cogency that even assuming those authorities do exercise effective control over the agencies that might take the person concerned into their custody (which may not always be the case), there can be no guarantee that\u00a0assurances given will be respected in practice.

To have any chance of being effective, such a mechanism would certainly need to incorporate some key guarantees, including the right of independent and suitably qualified persons to visit the individual concerned at any time, without prior notice, and\u00a0to interview him/her in private in a place of their choosing.

All the governments offering diplomatic assurances had long histories and continuing records of employing torture. Governments with poor records on torture routinely denied that torture was used and failed to initiate investigations when allegations of torture were made. It was highly unlikely that those governments, which persistently breached the international ban on torture, would keep their promises not to torture a single individual. Given that the receiving states were already under a duty not to torture or ill-treat detainees, and most had ratified legally binding treaties promising to refrain from such abuse, the diplomatic assurances, which were not legally binding, did not provide any additional protection to the deportees. Moreover, there was no mechanism inherent in the assurances themselves that would enable the person subject to the assurances to enforce them or to hold the sending or receiving government accountable.

In particular, a Russian man transferred from the US to Russia had been unlawfully detained, severely beaten and denied necessary medical care, despite assurances from the Russian authorities that he would be treated humanely in accordance with Russia's domestic law and international obligations. The European Court of Human Rights, in the case of Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, (no.\u00a036378/02, ECHR 2005III), had experienced directly that diplomatic assurances were ineffective. In that case Georgia had extradited five applicants to , despite an indication by the Court of interim measures requiring that none of them be extradited. The Russian Government had offered diplomatic assurances, including guarantees of humane treatment and unhindered access of the applicants to appropriate medical treatment, to legal advice and to the European Court of Human Rights. However, when the Court subsequently declared the application admissible and decided to send a fact-finding mission to visit the applicants, the Russian authorities had refused access to them.

In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the \u201cquality of the law\u201d, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. \u201cQuality of law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Khudoyorov\u00a0v.

The detention should have been extended by a court on application by a prosecutor, that is in accordance with the procedure and time-limits established by Article 109. It conceded that the requisite procedure had not been followed in the applicants' case (see paragraph 133 above). When the applicants asked for release, arguing that the authorised period of their detention had expired and no extension had been ordered in accordance with the procedure prescribed by Article 109, the domestic courts held that Article 109 found no application in their situation and that domestic law did not set any time-limits for detention with a view to extradition or any procedure for its extension (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above).

In examining the application for an extension, the court must decide whether continuation of the custodial measure is lawful and justified and, if it is not, release the detainee. Admittedly, the detainee has the right to take part in these proceedings, make submissions to the court and plead for his or her release. There is nothing, however, in the wording of either Article\u00a0108 or Article 109 to indicate that these proceedings could be taken on the initiative of the detainee, the prosecutor's application for an extension of the custodial measure being the required element for institution of such proceedings. No application for extension of detention had been made by the prosecutor in the applicants' case. In these circumstances, the Court cannot find that Article 109 secured the applicants' right to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of their detention would be examined by a court.",

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court emphasises the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see B\u00f6hmer v. , no.\u00a037568/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054 and 56, 3 October 2002; and Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v. , no.\u00a065559/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088 and 89, 27\u00a0February 2007).",

Italy (no. 37201/06, [GC], judgment of 28 February 2008), and especially of the following conclusion: \u201cThe weight to be given to assurances from the receiving State depends, in each case, on the circumstances obtaining at the material time\u201d (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0148). It will be recalled that in the Grand Chamber's judgment in the case of Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey concerning extradition to the same country \u2013 Uzbekistan \u2013 the Court concluded as follows, taking into account an assurance obtained from the Uzbek Government before the extradition date: \u201cIn the light of the material before it, the Court is not able to conclude that substantial grounds existed at the aforementioned date for believing that the applicants faced a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3\u201d (see Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7\u00a077, ECHR 2005-I).",

I could agree with this approach if I were persuaded that the extradition of the applicants was inevitable or was even carried out. But the Chamber's analysis of the facts of this extremely sensitive and constantly evolving case stops with the applicants' release on 5 March 2007 (that is, more than one year before adoption of the judgment!) (\u00a7\u00a050) and with the ruling of the Ivanovo Regional Court of 27 March 2007 upholding the decisions releasing them (\u00a7 51). According to the Russian media the applicants left Russian territory for \u201cthird countries\u201d; however, this information was not confirmed or refuted by the parties and the Court did not take the trouble to obtain information concerning the applicants' current situation (the application of Rules 39 and 41 of the Rules of Court provides such an opportunity). As my colleague Judge Zupan\u010di\u010d stressed in his concurring opinion in Saadi, speaking about the \u201cChahal test\u201d, \u201cone cannot prove a future event to any degree of probability because the law of evidence is a logical rather than a prophetic exercise. It is therefore an understatement to say that the application of the Chahal test is 'to some degree speculative'\u201d (see Saadi, cited above, concurring opinion of Judge Zupan\u010di\u010d). Accordingly, I favoured a clear position of non-violation over a \u201cprophetic exercise\u201d or \u201csome degree of speculation\u201d, precisely because of the lack of specific information concerning the current situation of the applicants.",
