The only difference between them was that the second procedure concerned an \u201caccused\u201d, while the first procedure concerned a \u201csuspect\u201d, who, in the indictment division\u2019s finding, nonetheless enjoyed all the rights granted to an accused. It held that this difference was not such as to deprive the bodies responsible for investigating a case of an important tool for uncovering decisive items of evidence, otherwise there would be a serious risk of a finding that there was no case to answer without the authorities having been able to exhaust all the investigatory options available to them. Referring to a legal opinion by Professors D. Tsatsos, A. Papadima and K.\u00a0Chrysogonos (published in the Poiniki Dikaiosyni magazine, no. 7/2003, pp. 813 et seq.), the indictment division held that the preliminary police investigation was judicial and not administrative in nature and that it was one stage in the criminal procedure. The indictment division further noted that the preliminary police investigation was conducted in accordance with the procedure for a pre-trial investigation, a specific reference being made to Articles\u00a0240 and 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP). In the indictment division\u2019s view, this meant that in deciding whether to bring a prosecution the public prosecutor\u2019s office had to use all the means at its disposal to gather evidence, in line with Article 178 of the CCP and the procedure applicable to the pre-trial investigation, with the exception of evidence that was incompatible with the nature of a preliminary police investigation (such as, for example, the memorandum of defence as a suspect and issuing an arrest warrant).",

It stated that the preliminary police investigation was not one of the cases for which, under Article 251 of the CCP, a search was a statutory requirement and that there existed no provision to the effect that a search was permitted during the preliminary police investigation. It added that, given that a search infringed individual rights, it had to be accepted that it was not authorised at this stage of the procedure. According to the Court of Cassation, a different approach would run counter to the principle of special law, which required that procedural infringements of individual rights, such as the inviolability of the home and of private and family life, and of the accused\u2019s rights of defence and the procedures for protecting them, were the object of express and specific measures.",

The prosecutor reviewed the relevant legislative provisions and, in particular, Article 31 of the Criminal Code and certain other articles of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He emphasised that it was clear from those provisions that the preliminary police investigation and the pre-trial investigation were similar in terms of their aim and the manner of proceeding. On the basis of Law no.\u00a03346/2005 and its explanatory report, he specified that, for the purposes of the proper conduct of the preliminary police investigation, the \u201csuspect\u201d enjoyed the same rights as the accused and that the judicial investigation ought to be speeded up in order to avoid repetition of investigative measures, especially where an in-depth assessment of the accusations had been conducted at the stage of the preliminary police investigation.

As there was a direct reference to Articles 240 and 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the preliminary police investigation was to be carried out in accordance with the procedure applicable to the judicial pre-trial investigation and, in particular, using the means stipulated in Article 178, Article 251 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure, thus including a search.",

They also relied on decision no.\u00a01575/2012 of the Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 19-22 above). More specifically, they argued that the purpose of such police investigations was no longer to uncover certain items which would indicate that an offence had possibly been committed, but to uncover sufficient evidence so that a prosecution could be instigated. They added that, since the relevant reforms, suspects enjoyed all the same rights as an accused and their statements constituted evidence that was taken into consideration by the courts. Suspects were authorised to take cognisance of all the material in the case file at an early stage and to refute the accusations even before they had been formally set out. Investigative acts such as a search or seizure were among those which made it possible to verify whether criminal acts had been committed by specific persons. The Government argued that if such investigative acts were to be hindered, crime investigations would be ineffective. Lastly, they considered that search and seizure operations were urgent in nature. In their view, if it seemed during a preliminary police investigation that evidence was likely to disappear, the investigators, including the prosecutor, were entitled to carry out a search in order to seize this evidence in good time.",

Judgment no.\u00a01328/2003, cited by the applicant in support of his arguments, contained a similar argument. However, the Court notes that both the scholarly article published in 2003 and judgment no.\u00a01328/2003 preceded the legislative reforms of 2003 and 2005, which, as the Government have emphasised, changed both the purpose of the preliminary police investigation and the procedure governing it. Equally, on 5 February 2009, and thus before the events in the present case, the prosecutor at the Court of Cassation sent a circular to the prosecutors\u2019 offices at all courts of appeal and first-instance courts, specifying the procedure to be followed with regard to searches conducted in the context of preliminary police investigations. The prosecutor analysed the new legislation in force and gave specific indications on the manner in which searches were to be conducted at this stage of the procedure (see paragraph\u00a019 above).",

According to the Court of Cassation, the preliminary police investigation was a fundamental stage in the investigation procedure, during which all forms of evidence provided for by Article\u00a0178 of the CCP were used, and it was intended to establish whether or not the conditions for instituting proceedings had been met. Again according to the Court of Cassation, given the operational methods and the aim pursued, there were now no longer any significant differences between the preliminary police investigation and the pre-trial investigation.

It will then be the Court\u2019s task to assess whether the reasons put forward to justify such measures were relevant and sufficient, and whether the proportionality principle has been adhered to. As regards the latter point, the Court must first ensure that the relevant legislation and practice afford individuals adequate and effective safeguards against abuse. Secondly, it must consider the specific circumstances of each case in order to determine whether, in the particular case, the interference in question was proportionate to the aim pursued. The criteria the Court has taken into consideration in determining this latter issue are, inter alia: the circumstances in which the order was issued, in particular whether any further evidence was available at that time; the content and scope of the order, having particular regard to the nature of the premises searched and the manner in which the search was conducted, including whether or not independent observers were present; and the extent of possible repercussions on the employment and reputation of the person affected by the search (see, among many other authorities, Van Rossem v. Belgium, no.\u00a041872/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a042-43, 9 December 2004; Smirnov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a071362/01, \u00a7 44, 7 June 2007; Mancevschi v.

The Court also considers it appropriate to distinguish the present case from certain of its judgments, cited by the applicant, in cases concerning searches carried out in lawyers\u2019 officers. Given the confidentiality of lawyer-client exchanges, the relevant safeguards in respect of such searches may be stricter than those in respect of a private flat or business premises.",

A search warrant has to be subject to certain limits so that the interference that it authorises in the rights guaranteed by Article 8, and particularly the right to respect for the home, are not potentially unlimited and, in consequence, disproportionate. Thus, a search warrant must include a minimum number of indications, making it subsequently possible to verify whether the the officials who execute it complied with the scope of the investigation thus authorised. In addition, the individual affected must have sufficient information on the proceedings at the source of the measure in question to enable him or her to spot, prevent and complain of abuse (see Van Rossem v. Belgium, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045 and 47).",

He also invited the investigators to seize \u201cany item or document found therein which, in [their] opinion, ha[d] a link with the case under consideration\u201d. It appears that the public prosecutor did not include any information about the investigation in question and the items to be seized, thus conferring broad powers on the investigating officer. The warrant did not contain any list of items and documents connected with the nature of the offence and the premises listed were private or professional premises, with no indication of the owners\u2019 or occupier\u2019s names. In addition, the prosecutor did not refer to the applicant by name, or describe what possible link he might have with the case under investigation.",

In the present case, the Court notes that the Greek domestic legislation did not provide for such prior scrutiny: the obligation imposed on the prosecutor by Article\u00a0253A of the CCP to inform the indictment division within three days of a decision in urgent cases to conduct certain investigative acts at the preliminary police investigation stage does not apply to searches.",

Even supposing that the authorities wished to achieve an element of surprise by refraining from alerting the applicant in advance, there had been nothing to prevent them, in order to comply with the letter of the above-mentioned provision, from attempting to contact him while the search, which lasted for several hours, was being conducted.

Given the wording of the warrant, it is disputable whether the applicant was given precise information about the scope of the search, which would have enabled him to check that the search was limited to seeking evidence of the offence mentioned in the search warrant and to complain of any abuses in that context (see, mutatis mutandis, Van Rossem, cited above, \u00a7\u00a048). The indictment division of the Athens Court of Appeal ruled on the applicant\u2019s appeal more than two years after the events and devoted most of its decision to determining whether a search and seizure operation could be carried out during a preliminary police investigation. The domestic authorities thus fell short of their obligation to provide \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d grounds to justify issuing the search warrant (see also Smirnov, cited above, \u00a7 47).",
