The case originated in applications against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) mostly by Romanian nationals on the various dates indicated in the appended table.
The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Notice was given to the Romanian Government of all the applications under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention; notice was also given of some of those applications (nos. 37487/03, 21121/04, 13354/05 and 35547/07), which also raised a complaint under Article 6 of the Convention.
Having been informed of their right to submit written observations pursuant to Article 36 § 1 of the Convention, the Governments of France (applications nos. 37487/03 and 7174/04) and Germany (application no. 12838/07) did not express an intention to take part in the proceedings.
Mrs Iulia Motoc, the judge elected in respect of Romania, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court). Accordingly, the President decided to appoint Mr Krzysztof Wojtyczek, the judge elected in respect of Poland, to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 26 § 4 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).
The list of applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table.
The factual and legal circumstances set out in the current applications are similar to those pertaining to the applicants in the case of Străin and Others v. Romania (no. 57001/00, §§ 5-18, ECHR 2005-VII), and to the applicants Ms and Mr Rodan in the case of Preda and Others v. Romania (nos. 9584/02 and 7 others, §§ 35-41, 29 April 2014).
In short, the applicants obtained final court decisions finding that the nationalisation by the former communist regime of their properties had been unlawful and that they had never ceased to be the legitimate owners of those properties. Despite the fact that their title deeds were not disputed, the applicants were not able to recover possession of their properties, as the latter had already been sold by the State to third parties. The applicants did not receive compensation for those properties.
The relevant background domestic law and practice in relation to acknowledged unlawfully nationalised properties sold by the State to third parties have been summarised in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Brumărescu v. Romania [GC] (no. 28342/95, §§ 34-35, ECHR 1999-VII); Străin and Others (cited above, §§ 19-23); Maria Atanasiu and Others v. Romania (nos. 30767/05 et 33800/06, §§ 44 et seq., 12 October 2010); Preda and Others (cited above, §§ 68-74); and Dickmann and Gion v. Romania (nos. 10346/03 and 10893/04, §§ 52-58, 24 October 2017).
