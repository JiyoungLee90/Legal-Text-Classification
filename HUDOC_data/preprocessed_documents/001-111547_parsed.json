Otherwise, there would be no point in hiding the camera among the clothes in the laundry basket. The hole in the laundry basket indicated that the approach was quite refined.

Whether a recording had actually been made, however, was unclear. It was apparent, the court continued, that the stepfather\u2019s motive was to film covertly the applicant for a sexual purpose. Given this motive, it was also regarded as certain that the stepfather did not intend the applicant to find out about the filming. Nor was he, according to the court, indifferent to the risk that she would find out about it. The court thereafter assessed whether the act legally constituted sexual molestation within the meaning of Chapter 6, section 7 of the Penal Code. It referred to a Supreme Court judgment (NJA 1996 p. 418) in which the Supreme Court had held, among other things, that the filming of sexual abuse was not a crime in itself as in Swedish law there was no general prohibition against filming an individual without his or her consent. Following that line of reasoning, and although finding that the act in question constituted a violation of personal integrity, notably in the light of the applicant\u2019s age and relationship to her stepfather, the Court of Appeal found that the stepfather could not be held criminally responsible for the isolated act of filming the applicant without her knowledge. Even if she had indeed obtained knowledge of the filming, the court reiterated, this knowledge was not covered by the stepfather\u2019s intent.",

However, since no charge of that kind had been brought against the stepfather, the Court of Appeal could not consider whether he could be held responsible for such a crime. In conclusion, despite finding the stepfather\u2019s behaviour extremely reprehensible, he was acquitted and the applicant\u2019s claim for damages dismissed.",

This was so, the court continued, even in situations where the deed in question deeply violated the personal integrity of the person concerned. Apart from certain exceptional situations, the only general sanctions available were the criminal provisions on defamation in conjunction with Chapter 1, section 3 of the Torts Liability Act (now Chapter 2, section 3 of the named act).

The Court of Appeal found the filming to constitute molestation and the sending of some of the e-mails to amount to defamation. It also awarded the exgirlfriend damages for, inter alia, violation of personal integrity. The Supreme Court granted leave to appeal concerning only the former alleged offence, namely the sexual molestation, and the issue of damages. The court reiterated that Swedish law contained no general prohibition against covert filming. The court also noted that in cases where the covert filming did not constitute a crime, no damages could be awarded. Although the need for a strengthened legal scheme in this regard had been acknowledged in Swedish legislative work already in the 1960s, the Court further noted, it had so far not led to any concrete results. According to the court, it was highly questionable whether the fact that acts of filming of an individual in situations where such filming deeply violated the personal integrity of the person concerned were left wholly unsanctioned under Swedish law, was compatible with the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention. Given this finding, the court continued, it was legitimate to examine whether sanctions could be provided by interpreting otherwise non-applicable domestic provisions in a treaty-conform manner. In this regard, the court referred to domestic case-law concerning compensation for violations of the Convention (see paragraphs 27-29 and 30). However, the court noted, another requirement under the Convention was that no one should be punished for an act which, at the time when it was committed, was not clearly criminalised by law. After having found that the filming in the present case did not fall under any applicable criminal provision, it was left unsanctioned and no damages were awarded.",

The aim of the proposal was in particular to protect individuals from interference in their private sphere by other individuals. It was proposed that the new criminal provision should cover anyone who, in a manner violating another individual\u2019s personal integrity, photographed or by other technical means recorded a picture of the individual in a home, bathroom, changing closet or a similar space. Moreover, the provision was proposed also to cover photographing or recording in any other space than the ones mentioned, if the act was committed in a pushy, covert or intrusive manner or if it constituted a serious violation of another individual\u2019s personal integrity in his or her capacity as a private person. It was proposed that sentences under the provision could range from penalties to imprisonment of up to one year. According to the report, no need to criminalise attempted photographing had emerged and it was therefore proposed that such acts, an example being the placing of technical equipment with the aim to film someone, were not to be covered by the new provision.",

It was also acknowledged that such acts may violate an individual\u2019s personal integrity regardless of whether he or she was made aware of the filming while it was ongoing or found out about it at a later stage. The report also referred to domestic case-law and noted that although the showing of a photograph or film to other people had been found to constitute a criminal act in some cases, the mere filming had been left unsanctioned. The report furthermore referred to Article 8 of the Convention and to the State\u2019s positive obligations under the article.

The application was lodged with the Court two and a half years after the delivery of the first of the mentioned Supreme Court judgments and four months after the judgment of 21\u00a0September 2007 concerning Article 8 in particular.

Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention \u2013 with which it has close affinity \u2013 that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights. Thus the complaint intended to be made subsequently to the Court must first have been made \u2013 at least in substance \u2013 to the appropriate domestic body, and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999-V, with further references).",

Moreover, the judgments and decisions referred to by the Government concerned acts committed by the state or by organs under direct or indirect control of the state while the present case concerns an alleged failure of the State\u2019s positive obligations due to an act committed by an individual. The underlying issues in the cases mentioned by the Government were thus different from those raised in the present case and do not resemble the situation in the case at issue. While the Court welcomes the development in Swedish law concerning the possibility to claim compensation on the basis of alleged violations of the Convention, it must be kept in mind that this development is a rather recent one. Consequently, it cannot generally be required of an individual applicant to pursue a compensation claim in respect of Convention issues that have not been determined by the domestic courts or are not closely related to issues that have been so determined. The reason for this is that, in many of these cases, the existence of the remedy cannot yet be considered as sufficiently certain (see, for example, Bladh v. Sweden (dec.), no.\u00a046125/06, \u00a7\u00a7 23-27, 10\u00a0November 2009 and Fexler v. , no. 36801/06, \u00a7 44, 13 October 2011).",

The domestic court had also held that the act could, at least in theory, constitute an attempted child pornography offence but that the indictment did not cover such an offence.

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Airey v. , 9 October 1979, \u00a7\u00a032, Series A no. 32 and X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, \u00a7 23, Series A no. 91).",

There are different ways of ensuring respect for private life and the nature of the State\u2019s obligation will depend on the particular aspect of private life that is at issue (see, for example, Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, \u00a7 104, 7 February 2012). Thus, where a particularly important facet of an individual\u2019s existence or identity is at stake, the margin allowed to the State is correspondingly narrowed. The same is true where the activities at stake involve a most intimate aspect of private life (see, among others, Evans v.\u00a0the  [GC], no. 6339/05, \u00a7 77, ECHR 2007I and Mosley v. the , no. 48009/08, \u00a7 109, 10 May 2011). The states are to maintain and apply in practice an adequate legal framework affording protection against acts of violence by private individuals (see, for example, A v. , no. 55164/08, \u00a7 60, 14 October 2010). While recourse to the criminal law is not necessarily the only answer, effective deterrence against grave acts where fundamental values and essential aspects of private life are at stake requires efficient criminal law provisions (see, for example, X and Y v. the Netherlands cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 27, M.C. v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a039272/98, \u00a7 150, ECHR 2003XII and K.U. v. Finland, no. 2872/02, \u00a7\u00a043, 2 December 2008).

The latter found it unclear whether a recording had actually taken place since the video tape had been destroyed without anyone seeing it.

Moreover, although finding that the stepfather\u2019s aim had been to film the applicant covertly for a sexual purpose, it also found he had not intended her to find out about the filming, nor been indifferent to the risk that she may find out about the act.

Shortly after the final judgment in the current case, namely in October 2008, the Swedish Supreme Court passed a judgment in another case (NJA 2008 p.\u00a0946, see paragraph 23), in which it found inter alia that an impugned completed act of covert filming did not constitute sexual molestation.

However, since no charge of that kind had been brought against the stepfather, the court could not consider whether he could be held responsible for such a crime. The Government maintained that it would have been difficult to establish such an offence because that would have required at least a picture of pornographic nature, which did not exist in the present case since the video tape had been destroyed by the applicant\u2019s mother. The Court finds reason to add in this respect that obviously the authorities could not be held responsible for the lack of evidence in the form of a film, nor for the possibility that other elements may also have been lacking for the offence to have constituted attempted child pornography crime. Nevertheless, it notes that by virtue of Chapter 16, section 17, a person could be convicted of attempted child pornography described in section 10a, first paragraph, and that the Court of Appeal specifically pointed to that possibility, at least theoretically. It is not for the Court to speculate on why a charge of attempted child pornography was not brought against the stepfather in the present case. In any event it recalls that only significant flaws in legislation and practice, and their application, can constitute a breach of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 8. The Court cannot replace the domestic authorities in the assessment of the facts of the case, nor decide on the alleged perpetrator\u2019s criminal responsibility.",
