With no assistance from staff, he could wash or relieve himself only if his cellmates helped him do so. He was not provided with a proper bath chair; instead, he was given a wooden toilet-seat which \u2013 unfit for the purposes of bathing \u2013 rotted away fast and on one occasion, broke under him. Because of harassment from fellow inmates on account of his disability and incontinence, he did not participate in the daily open-air stays. Classified as a 'Grade 4' security-level prisoner, he was transported with his hands handcuffed to his belt at all times. While being transported in this posture in a van without a safety belt, he could keep himself in his wheelchair only by supporting his body by leaning his head against the door of the transport cabin. As a consequence, he regularly suffered swellings on his head. When entering or exiting the transport van, staff dragged him by his belt, sometimes on the floor causing him bruises; an incident of this kind took place on 12 June 2006. On other occasions, his wheelchair \u2013 with the applicant, weighing 110 kilograms, sitting in it \u2013 was rolled down the van's steps.",

In particular, the fact that he had been at the mercy of his cellmates for a prolonged period of time in terms of satisfying his basic needs, such as relieving himself, bathing or getting dressed/undressed, was unacceptable. Likewise, the practice of transporting him in a van without a seatbelt to hold his wheelchair in place, together with the rough methods of getting him in and out of the vehicle was inhuman. This situation was aggravated by his classification as a 'Grade 4' security-level prisoner \u2013 impossible to challenge before the prison authorities and completely unjustified in the face of his paraplegia \u2013 as a consequence of which he had been kept handcuffed during transport and thereby prevented from securing his position whilst the vehicle was in motion.",

In considering whether treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a03, one of the factors which the Court will take into account is the question whether its object was to humiliate and debase the person concerned, although the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of violation of Article 3 (see Price v. the United Kingdom, no. 33394/96, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2001VII; Peers v.

In the latter respect, it would observe that the classification of the applicant as a 'Grade\u00a04' security-level prisoner and the resultant handcuffing added to the hardships he had to suffer on account of this method of transport.
