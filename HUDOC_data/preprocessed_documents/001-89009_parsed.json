A civil court is unable to pursue any independent investigation and is incapable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings regarding the identity of the perpetrators of fatal assaults or disappearances, still less of establishing their responsibility (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a057942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0119-121, 24 February 2005, and Estamirov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077).

In such circumstances, the Court finds it particularly regrettable that there should have been no thorough investigation of the relevant facts by the domestic prosecutors or courts. The limited information available about the investigation opened by the district prosecutor does not suggest any progress in almost seven years and, if anything, shows the incomplete and inadequate nature of those proceedings. Moreover, the stance of the prosecutor\u2019s office and the other law-enforcement authorities after the news of the detention had been communicated to them contributed significantly to the impunity of the perpetrators, as no necessary steps were taken in the crucial first days and weeks after the arrest. This is particularly striking in the present case in view of the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the bodies. The authorities\u2019 behaviour in the face of the applicants\u2019 well-substantiated complaints gives rise to a strong presumption of at least acquiescence in the situation and raises strong doubts as to the objectivity of the investigation.",

They referred to Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which allowed participants in criminal proceedings to complain to a court about measures taken during an investigation. This was an effective remedy to ensure the observation of their rights. The applicants had never made use of this possibility, which required the initiative of the participants in criminal proceedings, and thus the absence of court action could not constitute a violation of Article 13. They could also have claimed compensation for the alleged wrongdoing from the State authorities in civil proceedings.",
