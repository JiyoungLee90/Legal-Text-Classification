Turkey, no. 48804/99, \u00a7 57, 24 January 2008 and the cases cited therein). Moreover, the Court has already accepted that the more time that goes by without any news of the person who has disappeared, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died (see Tahsin Acar v. Turkey [GC], no. 26307/95, \u00a7 226, ECHR 2004III; see also Bozk\u0131r and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 24589/04, \u00a7 58, 26 February 2013). The Court thus considers that the national authorities were under an obligation to conduct an effective investigation into the applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s disappearance.",

In any event, the Court acknowledges that in some cases information purportedly casting new light on the circumstances of a killing may come into the public domain at a later stage. The issue then arises as to whether, and in what form, the procedural obligation to investigate is revived. To that end, the Court considered in its judgment in the case of Brecknell v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a032457/04, \u00a7 71, 27 November 2007) that, where there is a plausible, or credible, allegation, piece of evidence or item of information relevant to the identification, and eventual prosecution or punishment of the perpetrator of an unlawful killing, the authorities are under an obligation to take further investigative measures. The steps which would be reasonable to take will vary considerably according to the facts of the situation. The lapse of time will, inevitably, be an obstacle as regards, for example, the location of witnesses and the ability of witnesses to recall events reliably. Such an investigation may in some cases reasonably be restricted to verifying the credibility of the source or of the purported new evidence (ibid., \u00a7\u00a071; see also Gasyak and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a027872/03, \u00a7\u00a7 61-63, 13 October 2009).",

In this connection the Court notes that the bones and the motorbike parts were found in an area near the place where Mustafa Say\u011f\u0131 was last seen alive by two eyewitnesses (see paragraph 11 above). Secondly, the Court considers it important that\u00a0Mustafa Say\u011f\u0131\u2019s brother Mehmet Say\u011f\u0131 testified that he recognised the items discovered during the excavation (see paragraph\u00a020 above).

As noted above, the prosecutor D.K. had concluded at the end of a detailed investigation that the applicant\u2019s husband had been unlawfully detained by soldiers at the temporary military station, outside which he had last been seen by a number of civilian eyewitnesses. That finding had been reached after prosecutor D.K. had questioned the military personnel who had been based at that military station and the civilian eyewitnesses to the events. By contrast, in the 2009-2010 investigation the prosecutor M.A. not only failed to take into account those crucial findings, but also failed to identify and question any of the soldiers or the civilian witnesses despite the requests made by the applicant to do so.",

As summarised above, the authorities had not only been well aware of the disappearance before the 2009-2010 investigation, but had also been questioned by the Suru\u00e7 prosecutor D.K. and had provided that prosecutor with information concerning the applicant\u2019s husband (see paragraph 13 above).",

It appears that the importance and relevance of that discovery was hastily discarded by that prosecutor because the forensic authorities had not established the brand name of the motorbike and the basket attached to the motorbike had not been recovered.
