She argued that the lower courts had applied Article 69 of the Russian Family Code in a formalistic manner, and had based their decisions solely on the fact that she had been a drug addict, whilst failing to take into consideration the fact that she had been undergoing rehabilitation treatment. Moreover, the first-instance and appellate courts had disregarded her children\u2019s right to live and be raised in their family, as guaranteed by Article 54 of the Russian Family Code (see paragraph 51 below). In particular, they had failed to demonstrate convincingly that the children\u2019s forced separation from their mother and their placement in the care of the State had been in their best interests. The applicant further argued that the courts had failed to set out any facts showing that she had neglected her parental duties at any point, and that the courts\u2019 conclusion to that end had been groundless. According to the applicant, the case material showed that, although she suffered from an opiate addiction, she was making efforts to overcome it; moreover, she had never lost interest in her children\u2019s lives, their development and upbringing. She also argued that the impugned decisions had breached her right to respect for her private and family life, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention.",

Under the Court\u2019s well-established case-law, the national courts had a certain margin of appreciation in the field and were better placed to assess the relevance and substance of the evidence before them, including witnesses\u2019 statements. In the proceedings concerning withdrawal of the applicant\u2019s parental authority, the domestic courts had rightly considered that maintaining family ties between the applicant and her three children would be detrimental to their health and development, and that it would be in the best interests of the children to ensure their development in a safe environment. The courts had taken their decision on the basis of the adduced evidence. In particular, the first-instance court had established that the applicant had been taking drugs for a prolonged period of time, which had damaged the children\u2019s mental health; she had let her acquaintances take drugs in her flat, where her children lived; she had neglected her children and, in particular, had not taken care of their health and mental development; she had been unemployed and had a low income; and criminal proceedings had been pending against her.

Spain, no. 16572/17, \u00a7 51, 18 June 2019). There is currently a broad consensus \u2013 including in international law \u2013 in support of the idea that in all decisions concerning children, their best interests must be paramount (see Neulinger and Shuruk [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7 135, 6 July 2010, and X\u00a0v.\u00a0Latvia [GC], no. 27853/09, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2013). A child\u2019s interests dictate that the child\u2019s ties with his or her family must be maintained, except in cases where the family has proved to be particularly unfit and this may harm the child\u2019s health and development (see, for instance, K.B. and Others v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a036216/13, \u00a7 143, 14 March 2017). Severing such ties means cutting a child off from his roots, which may only be done in very exceptional circumstances everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, if and when appropriate, to \u201crebuild\u201d the family. In that context, the Court has emphasised, in particular, the State\u2019s obligation to adopt measures to preserve the parent-child bond as far as possible (see G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc v. Germany, no.\u00a074969/01, \u00a7 48, 26\u00a0February 2004; S.H. v.

Such further limitations entail the danger that family relations between parents and a child are effectively curtailed (see Kutzner v. Germany, no. 46544/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2002-I; Haase v.

Depriving a person of his or her parental rights is a particularly far-reaching measure which deprives a parent of his or her family life with the child, and it is inconsistent with the aim of reuniting them.

The Court is prepared to accept that the children\u2019s removal and initial placement in public care was justified, given in particular that the applicant had been intoxicated on the date in question, had suffered from withdrawal symptoms on the following days, and had clearly been unable to take care of her children (see paragraphs 8 and 19 above). It does not follow, however, that that fact, in itself, constituted sufficient grounds for such a far-reaching measure as deprivation of parental authority. The Court reiterates that a care order should be regarded as a temporary measure, to be discontinued as soon as circumstances permit, and that any measures implementing temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parents and the child (see Strand Lobben and Others, \u00a7\u00a0208, and Haddad, \u00a7 54, all cited above).",

Secondly, the applicant, her elder son and her mother consistently stated that the applicant had not demonstrated her addiction to her family members; in particular, there had been no \u201cinadequacies\u201d in her everyday behaviour (see paragraphs 27, 28 and 31 above).

Yet, there is no indication that the domestic authorities sought any independent evidence, such as an assessment by a psychologist, to evaluate the applicant\u2019s emotional maturity and motivation to act as a responsible parent and to resolve her drug-addiction problem. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s arguments and evidence that she had commenced rehabilitation treatment were rejected by the first-instance court as irrelevant (see paragraph 40 above), and by the appellate court with reference to the fact that it had been received after the first-instance court\u2019s judgment (see paragraph 43 above). The Court finds this line of reasoning striking in a situation where the applicant\u2019s drug addiction appears to have been the main, if not the only, ground for depriving her of parental authority. The domestic courts in fact chose to ignore the evidence adduced by the applicant, instead of assessing it during the proceedings (compare N.P. v. the Republic of Moldova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075).",

Moreover, the relevant court decisions did not explain how the applicant\u2019s being unemployed affected her ability and capacity to take care of her children. In fact, the report of 11 October 2013, relied on by the domestic courts, does not reveal any defects in the living conditions of the applicant\u2019s family, except for the fact that the room in which she and her children lived was stuffy, untidy and poorly ventilated. Otherwise, that report indicates that the children had separate sleeping places and that there were sufficient food supplies in the kitchen and in the refrigerator (see paragraph 19 above). Moreover, the report of 18\u00a0November 2013 clearly showed subsequent improvements, stating, in particular, that the flat was tidy, cosy and well ventilated and that recent repairs had been carried out in the kitchen (see paragraph 20 above). However, no assessment of those changes, in particular whether they could be regarded as a genuine attempt on the part of the applicant to improve her situation after the children\u2019s removal, was made by the domestic courts.",

The Court finds it surprising that the domestic authorities did not consider that alternative, despite the fact that, as noted in paragraph 86 above, the applicant did not have a history of neglecting her children. Nor did they give the applicant any warnings regarding the possible consequences of her allegedly negligent behaviour in respect of her children.",

It was also shown that the children were deeply attached to their mother and their maternal grandmother (see paragraphs 16 and 29 above), and that the maternal grandmother had been willing to keep the children in her care (see paragraph 20 above). Yet, it does not appear that the domestic courts gave due consideration to any of those aspects. In particular, when choosing the measure to be applied in the applicant\u2019s case, they did not assess the impact which the children\u2019s separation from their mother and grandmother might have on their well-being. That is particularly striking in view of the fact that the removal of the applicant\u2019s parental authority terminated her parental status and thus deprived her of any legal grounds to apply for contact orders or seek access to her children.",
