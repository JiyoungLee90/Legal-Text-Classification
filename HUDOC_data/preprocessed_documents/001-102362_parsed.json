Following this, the investigators instigated criminal proceedings into the crime of theft committed by unknown persons, although the identity of the offenders and their age had been established by that time. Nevertheless, they were summoned to the court as witnesses and the decision to place them in the juvenile holding facility does not appear to be for any of the purposes listed in subparagraph (c) of paragraph 1 of Article 5. The Government suggested that the applicants' detention had been effected for the purpose of bringing them before the competent legal authority, but it remained without answer which authority had been meant. Furthermore, there were no investigative actions taken in their respect during the detention and the criminal proceedings against them, although the applicants could not be criminally liable (see paragraph 17 above), were nonetheless introduced twenty days after their release from the holding facility. Therefore, the Court considers that the applicants' detention did not fall under the permissible exception of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c).",

However, the Court does not consider, and indeed, it does not appear to be argued by the Government, that the juvenile holding facility itself constituted \u201ceducational supervision\u201d. As it transpires from the domestic law, the centre is designed for temporary isolation of different categories of minors, including those who have committed an offence. The regulations on the juvenile holding facilities do not provide with sufficient clarity what educational activities must be organised in the centre and the preventive and educational work envisaged in the regulations includes purely investigative actions of data collection about possible involvement of minors in criminal activities. In the circumstances of the present case, it was not argued by the Government that the placement in the holding facility had been for the purpose of \u201ceducational supervision\u201d and it does not appear from the case-file materials that the applicants' detention was anyhow related to any such purpose or that the applicants participated in any educational activities during their stay in the holding facility.
