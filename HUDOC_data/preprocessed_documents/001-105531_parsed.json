Treatment has been held by the Court to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also \u201cdegrading\u201d because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them. In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24888/94, \u00a7 71, ECHR 1999IX).",

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. The Court has previously had before it cases in which it has found that there has been treatment which could only be described as torture (see Aksoy v.\u00a0Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 64, Reports of Judgments and Decisions\u00a01996-VI; Ayd\u0131n v.

In assessing whether the pain and suffering inflicted on a person amounts to torture in the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention, the Court takes the view that the increasingly high standard being required in the area of the protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspondingly and inevitably requires greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fundamental values of democratic societies (see Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 101).",

However, in cases of wilful illtreatment the violation of Articles 2 or 3 cannot be remedied exclusively through an award of compensation to the victim. This is so because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful ill-treatment by State agents to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough to prosecute and punish those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Vladimir Romanov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 78-79, and Nikolova and Velichkova v.

Further delays accumulated during the trial stage that started in March 2005 and lasted for more than two years. As a result of those delays the police officers were not finally convicted and sentenced until June 2008, about seven years after their wrongful conduct. This approach appears unacceptable to the Court, considering that the case concerned a serious instance of police violence and thus required a swift reaction by the authorities (see Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7 59).",

This is essential for maintaining public confidence, ensuring adherence to the rule of law and preventing any appearance of tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts (see Okkal\u0131 v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 52067/99, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2006XII (extracts)). The important point for the Court to review, therefore, is whether and to what extent the national authorities have done everything within their powers to prosecute and punish the police officers responsible for the ill-treatment, and whether they have imposed adequate and deterrent sanctions on them. For this reason, although the Court acknowledges the role of the national courts in the choice of appropriate sanctions for ill-treatment by State agents, it must exercise a certain power of review and intervene in cases of manifest disproportion between the gravity of the act and the punishment imposed. Were it to be otherwise, the States\u2019 duty to carry out an effective investigation would lose much of its meaning, and the right enshrined by Article 3, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 123; Atalay v.

However, the domestic courts chose to impose on the police officers sentences that were below the statutory minimum and to suspend those sentences in respect of four of the officers. The only reason for reducing the sentences was the fact that the police officers had been awarded medals for excellent police work and had positive references from their superiors (see paragraph 34 above). The Court, however, cannot accept those arguments as justifying imposition of lenient sentences on the police officers, who had been found guilty of a particularly serious case of prolonged torture. The sentences imposed on the police officers must therefore be regarded as manifestly disproportionate to the gravity of the acts committed by them. By punishing the officers with lenient sentences more than seven years after their wrongful conduct, the State in effect fostered the law-enforcement officers\u2019 \u201csense of impunity\u201d instead of showing, as it should have done, that such acts could in no way be tolerated (see, for similar reasoning, G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 12324; Atalay, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 40-44; Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73-75; and Nikolova\u00a0and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-63).",

With regard to pecuniary damage, the domestic courts are clearly in a better position to determine its existence and quantum. Regarding non-pecuniary damage, the Court must exercise supervision to verify whether the sums awarded are not unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases. Whether the amount awarded may be regarded as reasonable falls to be assessed in the light of all the circumstances of the case. The Court has accepted that it might be easier for the domestic courts to refer to the amounts awarded at domestic level, especially in cases concerning personal injury, damage relating to a relative\u2019s death or damage in defamation cases, for example, and rely on their innermost conviction, even if that results in awards of amounts that are somewhat lower than those fixed by the Court in similar cases. However, where the amount of compensation is substantially lower than what the Court generally awards in comparable cases, the applicant retains his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d of the alleged breach of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 182-92 and 202-15, ECHR 2006V).",

It is especially difficult in a case where personal suffering, whether physical or mental, is the subject of the claim. There is no standard by which pain and suffering, physical discomfort and mental distress and anguish can be measured in monetary terms. The Court does not doubt that the domestic courts in the present case attempted to assess the level of physical suffering, emotional distress, anxiety or other harmful effects sustained by the applicant as a result of the ill-treatment (see Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7 76, and Nardone v.  (dec.), no. 34368/02, 25 November 2004). However, it cannot overlook the fact that the amount of EUR 2,300 awarded for the prolonged and extremely cruel torture was substantially lower than what it generally awards in comparable Russian cases (see, for example, Maslova and Nalbandov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 839/02, \u00a7 135, ECHR 2008...

Measures depriving a person of his or her liberty may often involve an inevitable element of suffering or humiliation. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on the State to ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his or her human dignity, and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a7 10102, ECHR 2001VIII).",

The Court takes into consideration that the applicant might have experienced difficulties in procuring documentary evidence.

At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure respect for the right of an accused not to incriminate himself (see Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7 100, and Kolu v. Turkey, no.\u00a035811/97, \u00a7 51, 2 August 2005). Referring to the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Court has previously pointed out that the right of a detainee to have access to legal advice is a fundamental safeguard against ill-treatment (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 54).",
