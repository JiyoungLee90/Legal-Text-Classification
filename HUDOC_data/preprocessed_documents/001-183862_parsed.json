What is more, the decision of the Twelfth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court did not adduce any reasons other than the applicant\u2019s sex for her not having been appointed to the post in question. The present case is, therefore, identical to Emel Boyraz in which the Court concluded that the decisions of the administrative and judicial authorities had amounted to a discriminatory difference in treatment in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 56). Accordingly, and for the detailed reasons elaborated on in Emel Boyraz, the Court concludes that there has been a violation of Article\u00a014 taken in conjunction with Article 8 resulting from the refusal of the authorities to appoint, and then their subsequent dismissal of the applicant from the post of security officer.",

The same considerations also hold true for the applicant in the present case, who did not submit any other decisions by the Supreme Administrative Court, and therefore the Court considers that the difference of interpretation between the Twelfth Division and the General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions did not, in itself, amount to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the conflicting decisions rendered by the Supreme Administrative Court.",

In that connection, the Court reiterates that according to its established caselaw reflecting a principle linked to the proper administration of justice, judgments of courts and tribunals should adequately state the reasons on which they are based. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case. Although Article 6 \u00a7 1 obliges courts to give reasons for their decisions, it cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument.

More specifically, the Court has held that courts of cassation comply with their obligation to provide sufficient reasoning when they base themselves on a specific legal provision, without further reasoning, in dismissing cassation appeals which do not have any prospects of success (see Sale v. France, no.\u00a039765/04, \u00a7\u00a017, 21 March 2006, and Burg and Others v. France (dec.), no.\u00a04763/02, ECHR 2003-II; for the same approach with regard to constitutional court practice see e.g. Wildgruber v. Germany, (dec.) no.\u00a032817/02, 16\u00a0October 2006, and Wnuk v. Poland (dec.), no. 38308/05, 1\u00a0September 2009; and mutatis mutandis, regarding the public prosecutor\u2019s decision rejecting a civil party\u2019s request to lodge an appeal on points of law Gorou v. Greece (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a012686/03, \u00a7 41, 20\u00a0March 2009). However, the Court has also held that in the circumstances of a particular case, the requirement to give more detailed reasons could apply to courts of appeal (see, in particular, Yanakiev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a040476/98, \u00a7\u00a072, 10 August 2006; Gheorghe v.\u00a0Romania, no. 19215/04, \u00a7\u00a050, 15\u00a0March 2007; Wagner and J.M.W.L. v.\u00a0Luxembourg, no. 76240/01, \u00a7\u00a096, 28 June 2007; Velted-98 AD v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 15239/02, \u00a7\u00a048, 11\u00a0December 2008). In order to determine the extent to which this duty to give specific reasons applies at the appeal level, the Court has considered matters such as the nature of a filtering procedure and its significance in the context of the proceedings as a whole, the scope of the powers of a court of appeal, and the manner in which the applicant\u2019s interests were actually presented and protected before that court (see Hansen v. Norway, no.\u00a015319/09, \u00a7 73, 2 October 2014, with further references to Ekbatani v.\u00a0Sweden, 26 May 1988, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 134, and Monnell and Morris v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 56). In cases where the Court found that a court of appeal had been required to give more adequate reasons, it took into account factors such as whether the arguments that had been raised by the parties which had a decisive impact on the outcome of the case had been examined before any of the previous instances (see Yanakiev, cited above, \u00a7 71; Gheorghe, cited above, \u00a7 48; and Deryan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36-37) or whether the main pleas put forward by a party, especially when they concern the \u2018rights and freedoms\u2019 guaranteed by the Convention and the Protocols thereto, had been examined with rigour and care (see Wagner and J.M.W.L., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 96-97). Finally, in a later case concerning the filtering procedure of a court of appeal, the Court held that the very brief reasoning \u2013 namely that the appeal would not succeed  by a high court, ruling at second instance, had been insufficient in the particular circumstances of the case in so far as the appellate court in question had full jurisdiction to review facts, law and procedure in the case and the limited reasons given therein did not have due regard to that applicant\u2019s interest concerning his effective right of appeal to a higher court (see Hansen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 82-83).",

If the rectification request were admitted, the court of appeal in question conducted a reexamination of the case without taking new facts or findings into consideration (see, inter alia, Dedecan and Ok v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 22685/09 and 39472/09, \u00a7 23, 22 September 2015). The Court notes in that connection that the relevant provisions of Law no.\u00a02577 gave considerable leeway to the Supreme Administrative Court for its scope of review applicable in the rectification proceedings concerning questions of law and procedure. It can further be understood that if the rectification request were admitted, the Supreme Administrative Court had the power to uphold its previous decision, if necessary by giving additional reasons, or to annul it by rendering a new decision and remitting the case to the firstinstance court if the circumstances so required (see paragraph\u00a023 above).",

In the Court\u2019s view, those arguments concerning the merits of her dispute on points of law, which were coincidentally fully supported by the conclusions of the General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions, were not addressed by the Supreme Administrative Court in its previous decision on appeal, which had only endorsed the reasons of the first-instance court. Therefore, the applicant could have reasonably expected a specific reply from the Supreme Administrative Court. What also lends support to this position is the opinion of the judge rapporteur in charge of presenting the case to the Twelfth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court drawing attention to the decision of the General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions in the case of R.B. and recommending that the rectification request be granted. Furthermore, it was not the case that the Twelfth Division was ignorant of the General Assembly decision, the composition of which included some members of the Twelfth Division (see paragraph 18 above). Having therefore participated in the determination of the case of R.B., the interests of justice required them to elucidate the reasons for their decision of inadmissibility in the applicant\u2019s case. In that respect, sight must not be lost of the fact that the applicant who gained knowledge of the General Assembly\u2019s conclusions regarding the same issue sought recourse before the Twelfth Division in the expectation that this would be the final and only opportunity for the Supreme Administrative Court to re-evaluate her case before it became final.",

The loss of her employment undoubtedly deprived the applicant of her main source of income. Hence, there is a direct causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage claimed, which has to be reimbursed in such a way as to restore, as far as possible, the situation existing before the breach (see, inter alia, Rainys and Gasparavi\u010dius v.\u00a0Lithuania, nos. 70665/01 and 74345/01, \u00a7 45, 7 April 2005). However, the Court notes that a precise calculation of the sums necessary to make complete reparation (restitutio in integrum) in respect of the pecuniary loss suffered by the applicant is prevented by the inherently uncertain character of the damage flowing from the violations. This is particularly so in relation to the question of how long the applicant would have remained in TEDA\u015e had it not been for her dismissal. Nevertheless, an award may still be made notwithstanding the large number of imponderables involved in the assessment of future losses, though the greater the lapse of time involved the more uncertain the link becomes between the breach and the damage. The question to be decided in such cases is the level of just satisfaction, in respect of both past and future pecuniary loss, which it is necessary to award to each applicant, the matter to be determined by the Court at its discretion, having regard to what is equitable (see Lustig-Prean and Beckett v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (just satisfaction), nos.\u00a031417/96 and 32377/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a022-23, 25\u00a0July 2000, and Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom (just satisfaction), nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7\u00a7 18-19, ECHR 2000IX).",

The Court therefore finds it difficult to ascertain the precise amount of pecuniary damage which ensued. At the same time, it considers that the applicant would have been able to work as a security officer at least from the moment when she was offered the post after having succeeded in the examination and until the date her employment was actually confirmed by TEDA\u015e subsequent to the stay of execution decision of the Gaziantep Administrative Court. Moreover, had the administrative courts prevented the violation found under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention, the applicant would have been able to obtain redress for her loss of income concerning the period starting from her dismissal until the date of the final judgment in the domestic proceedings. The Court also considers that the applicant must have sustained non-pecuniary damage which the finding of a violation of the Convention in this judgment does not suffice to remedy. Therefore, taking into account the number of imponderables involved in the assessment of the applicant\u2019s loss of earnings and in the light of all the information in its possession, the Court decides on an equitable basis to award the applicant an aggregate sum of EUR\u00a011,000 under all heads of damage combined, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",

The majority is right when it states at paragraph 48 of the judgment, that according to the Court\u00b4s case-law where a high court refuses to accept a case on the basis that the legal grounds for such a case are made out, very limited reasoning may satisfy the requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In fact, the Court has held that courts of cassation comply with their obligation to provide sufficient reasoning when they base themselves on a specific legal provision, without further reasoning, in dismissing cassation appeals which do not have any prospects of success. In other words, in order to determine the extent to which this duty to give specific reasons applies at the appeal level, the Court has considered matters such as the nature of a filtering procedure and its significance in the context of the procedure as a whole, the scope of the powers of a court of appeal, and the manner in which the applicant\u2019s interests were actually presented and protected before the Court. The most recent consolidation of these general principles is found in the judgment of the Court in Hansen v Norway (no. 15319/09, \u00a7 73, 2\u00a0October 2014).",

Turkey, no. 36073/04, \u00a7 46, 4\u00a0March 2014). In other words, the question in the rectification proceedings is whether the party requesting rectification has demonstrated the existence of arguable grounds which would justify examining the rectification on the merits. Therefore, the decision on the rectification request cannot in itself be equated to a decision on the merits on appeal, for instance whether the law was applied correctly at first instance. It is true that this remedy is considered, as noted by the majority (see paragraph 49 of the judgment), an ordinary remedy under Turkish administrative law. However, for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and the duty to give reasons at the appellate stage, rectification proceedings must in our view, due to their very nature and purpose, be treated by this Court as a special and particular type of appellate remedy which requires the Court to be cautious in imposing on the domestic high court the duty to give reasons that limits its ability to adequately apply this mechanism in a manner which conforms with the very narrow scope of possible rectification of a previous judgment on appeal provided under domestic law.",

It also briefly noted that its previous decision had been in accordance with the law and procedure, implying therefore that the emergence of new case-law on a similar issue was not one of the grounds of rectification and that the decision of the General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions which postdated the Twelfth Division\u2019s decision did not render it retrospectively unlawful. In our view, that decision, which is analogous to a rejection on manifestly illfounded grounds, cannot be considered a decision on the merits. We also note that changes in domestic case-law are part and parcel of every-day work in courts of appeals and supreme courts all over Europe. High courts must have flexibility to assess if and to what extent changes in previous case-law will be applied retroactively to already decided cases or whether they will only be applied in the future.",
