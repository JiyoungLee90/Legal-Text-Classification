They have never lived in Kazakhstan and have no ties with that country. Even though the case file does not contain any information about whether they speak any Kazakh and even assuming that Russian is commonly spoken throughout that country, there is little doubt that in any case it would be difficult for them to adjust to life in Kazakhstan if they were to follow the applicant there.
