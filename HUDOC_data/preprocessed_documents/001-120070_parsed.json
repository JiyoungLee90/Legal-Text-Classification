Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of its Protocols, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see, among other authorities, Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 62, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 162, Series A no. 25).",

Turkey, 25 May 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 130-34, Reports 1998III), the same principle would not usually apply to situations where the person taken into custody has later been found dead (see, for example, Tanl\u0131 v.

A similar line of reasoning appears to be implicit in the cases of Y\u00f6yler and Ayder and Others (both cited above).

In the cases of Pannullo and Forte v.\u00a0France (no. 37794/97, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, ECHR 2001X) and Girard v.

The breadth of this margin varies and depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual, the nature of the interference and the object pursued by the interference (see S. and Marper, cited above, \u00a7 102). The Court has on many occasions stressed that it was aware that States faced particular challenges posed by terrorism and terrorist violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, 29 November 1988, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 145B; \u00d6calan v.

The Court finds that the interference with the applicants\u2019 Article 8 rights resulting from the said measure was particularly severe in that it completely precluded them from any participation in the relevant funeral ceremonies and involved a ban on the disclosure of the location of the grave, thus permanently cutting the links between the applicants and the location of the deceased\u2019s remains. In this connection the Court would also refer to the practice of various international institutions which in cases involving the application of similar measures considered such interference with the applicants\u2019 rights as particularly severe (see paragraphs 91-96).",

Therefore, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision, there must be a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention, but the remedy must in any event be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the State (see B\u00fcy\u00fckda\u011f v. Turkey, no. 28340/95, \u00a7 64, 21 December 2000, with the cases cited therein, especially Aksoy, cited above, \u00a7 95). Under certain conditions, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may satisfy the requirements of Article 13 (see, in particular, Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, \u00a7 77, Series A no. 116).",

Once the location and date of the ceremony have been disclosed,\u00a0it is extremely difficult or even impossible for the State to avoid completely such a risk, engendered by stress and hatred.\u00a0In such a situation of\u00a0uncertainty\u00a0it is hard for the State to determine whether and where it \u201coverstepped\u201d its\u00a0margin of appreciation.",
