Making reference to section\u00a089(1) read in conjunction with section 88(1) of Law 29/1998, the court stated that such references were required in order to appeal against decisions of both the High Courts of Justice and the Audiencia Nacional on the basis of any of the grounds provided for in section 88(1) of Law\u00a029/1998 \u2013 in line with the case-law of the Supreme Court as clearly set out in that court\u2019s decision of 10 February 2011, followed by subsequent decisions such as that of 26 May 2011.

In the court\u2019s view, requiring the notice of appeal to contain a reference to the legal provisions and case-law allegedly infringed was within the authority of the Supreme Court.

Making reference to one of its previous judgments (judgment no. 95/1993 of 22 March 1993), it highlighted that a judgment introducing a change in the case-law interpreted what a legal rule had meant since its creation. It could therefore not be inferred that the previous, contradictory case-law had changed such rules or could be imposed as customary law.",

In short, those dissenting opinions noted firstly that the new interpretation by the Supreme Court as to the requirements of the notice of appeal was unreasonable because such new requirements were not provided for by law. They further stated that the right to a fair trial and, more particularly, the right of access to a court and to judicial remedies might be breached if a new interpretation of formal requirements developed in case-law was applied to the examination of an appeal lodged when the new criteria had not existed or had not been known to exist, and the applicant had not been given any opportunity to remedy any newly arising deficiencies in the notice of appeal.

This usually occurs in cases involving a particularly strict construction of a procedural rule, preventing an applicant\u2019s action being examined on the merits, with the attendant risk that his or her right to the effective protection of the courts would be infringed (ibid., \u00a7 97).

The formal requirements of the notice of appeal on points of law which had been applicable at the time had been established by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions of 14 October 2010 (see paragraph 15 above). The applicant\u2019s appeal was, however, declared inadmissible by the Supreme Court on 9 February 2012 owing to non-compliance of the notice of appeal with the formal requirements. The inadmissibility decision was based on new criteria concerning the interpretation and application of the admissibility requirements for a notice of appeal on points of law which had been set out in a prior decision of the Supreme Court on 10 February 2011. The new criteria had the effect of incorporating new requirements into the notice of appeal provided for in section 89(1) of Law 29/1998 regulating judicial proceedings in administrative matters in comparison with the previous case-law as set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions of 14\u00a0October 2010 (see paragraph 16 above). In particular, as a result of the new criteria \u2013 and although section\u00a089(1) of Law 29/1998 did not expressly set out a list of formal requirements to be met by the notice of appeal \u2013 appellants on points of law against judgments of the Audiencia Nacional, as in the instant case, were required not only to state within the notice of appeal the specific grounds on which the appeal would be based but also to include a reference to the specific provisions or case-law that had allegedly been infringed or to the substance of the breaches to be raised in the appeal on points of law. As the Government have stated, the formal requirements for submitting a notice of appeal became stricter. In this connection, it is important to note that the above-mentioned Supreme Court decision of 10 February 2011 setting out the new criteria was delivered after the applicant had submitted both her notice of appeal and her appeal on points of law.",

It had regard, in particular, to the fact that the Supreme Court had expressly declared the appeals on points of law admissible whereas a number of years later (ranging from three to seven years, depending on the case) the same court had declared them inadmissible by means of a judgment for failure to comply with formal requirements \u2013 on the basis that the notices of appeal had not given sufficient justification as to how the alleged breaches had been relevant and decisive for the operative part of the impugned judgment or, in the case of Llavador Carretero, on the basis that the notice of appeal had not stated whether the impugned judgment was subject to an appeal on points of law, the time-limit had been observed and the appellant had locus standi. The Court also took into account that the appellants had not been allowed to submit comments on the possible existence of grounds for inadmissibility or to remedy the deficiencies found in the notices of appeal.

It notes in that connection that the aforementioned Supreme Court decisions of 14 October 2010 \u2013 setting out the criteria as regards the admissibility requirements for a notice of appeal \u2013 were delivered less than a month before the applicant had submitted her notice of appeal and were later confirmed by a number of subsequent decisions, some even given after the applicant\u2019s notice of appeal had been submitted. In particular, they had the purpose of clarifying the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law concerning the formal requirements of a notice of appeal (see paragraph 15 above), emphasising the need to address inconsistencies in its own case-law. The Court considers that at the time when the applicant submitted her notice of appeal on points of law, there was no indication of any perceptible line of case-law development departing from the criteria set out in the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions of 14 October 2010. The applicant therefore had no reason to believe that the Supreme Court would depart from its previous case-law. Accordingly, the Supreme Court\u2019s new criteria resulting from the decision of 10 February 2011, given in proceedings to which the applicant was not a party and which had the effect of thwarting her pending action, were not foreseeable or consistent with the case-law existing at the time when she had lodged both her notice of appeal and her appeal on points of law.",

By a decision of 28 October 2011, she was given a time-limit for making comments on the possible existence of certain grounds for inadmissibility in the notice of appeal (see paragraph 7 above). This is confirmed by the fact that the Supreme Court did not, either in its decision of 9 February 2012 declaring the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law inadmissible (see paragraph 8 above) or in its decision of 13\u00a0September 2012 dismissing the application for annulment lodged by the applicant (see paragraph 9 above), reproach her for having failed to rectify the notice of appeal. The sole ground for declaring her appeal on points of law inadmissible was that the notice of appeal had not complied with the requirements laid down in the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 10 February 2011. Indeed, the fact that the applicant was not allowed to remedy the newly arising defects was precisely one of the arguments she raised in her appeal to the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 10 above). This was consistent with the well-established case-law of the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above), which had reiterated that any deficiency in the notice of appeal resulting from a failure to comply with the formal requirements set out in section 89(1) of Law\u00a029/1998 could not be remedied, and that the time-limit provided for in section 93(3) of Law 29/1998 for making comments gave appellants the opportunity to argue against possible grounds for inadmissibility in the notice of appeal or the appeal on points of law, and therefore did not constitute a procedural step for remedying possible defects and omissions affecting such submissions.

It cannot be said that the applicant or her legal representative acted negligently or erred in lodging the appeal, or that they did not display the requisite diligence in pursuing the relevant procedural actions. The Court thus concludes that the applicant should not bear the adverse consequences of the application of the Supreme Court\u2019s new criteria in her pending case that led to the applicant\u2019s being denied access to the Supreme Court.",

Furthermore, it is particularly noteworthy that the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law was declared inadmissible on the basis that the notice of appeal had not made reference to the provisions or case-law allegedly infringed by the impugned judgment or to the substance of the breaches of legal rules or case-law that were to be complained of in the appeal on points of law. However, such information had to be included in the appeal on points of law, as required by section\u00a092(1) of Law 29/1998. Thus, even if it had not been duly stated in the notice of appeal, by the time the Supreme Court requested the applicant to make comments on the possible existence of grounds for inadmissibility in the notice of appeal, it had already received her appeal on points of law, which, having regard to the aforementioned legal requirements and taking account of the fact that the domestic courts did not find otherwise, can be assumed to have complied with the requirements set out in the relevant law. In view of this, coupled with the above finding that a new interpretation of the formal requirements for submitting a notice of appeal on points of law was applied retroactively and without the applicant being given the opportunity to remedy any deficiencies in her submissions, the Court is of the opinion that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision declaring the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law inadmissible amounted to excessive formalism involving an unreasonable and particularly strict application of procedural formalities unjustifiably restricting her access to its jurisdiction.",
