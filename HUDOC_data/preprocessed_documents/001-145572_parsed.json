This professional criminal underworld has its own recognised leaders, elaborate initiation rituals and a code of conduct. It has a particularly well-organised power structure, a strict system of subordination and control over its (criminal) members, but sometimes also over various different sectors of society. The history of the Sovietera institution of \u201cthieves\u2019 underworld\u201d dates back to Imperial Russia. The traditional structure of a Soviet criminal syndicate, beginning from the time of the 1917 Revolution, was built upon the ideas of hierarchy and strict obedience to the \u201cThieves\u2019 Code\u201d (\u201c\u10e5\u10e3\u10e0\u10d3\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10d9\u10d0\u10dc\u10dd\u10dc\u10d8\u201d in Georgian, and \u201c\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u201d in Russian \u2013 the special set of rules regulating the conduct of members of the underworld). Members of those criminal organisations were at that time fervently anti-communist, and for the most part were required to lead modest, non-materialistic lives. However, as the Soviet era progressed, new types of criminals and criminal structures began to emerge, which were in reality concerned only with accumulating wealth and power. These individuals broke with the traditional visions of the \u201cthieves\u2019 underworld\u201d and formed new gangs based on purely materialistic interests. It has also been argued that the Soviet State contributed to the dismantlement of the traditional structure of the criminal underworld which in its turn resulted in the elevation of the \u201cthieves in law\u201d to mythical status (bibliography: L.D.

They are the elite of the organised crime underworld, equivalent to the rank of \u201cGodfather\u201d in the Italian Mafia. The title of \u201cthief in law\u201d is usually conferred upon the criminal by a more senior \u201cthief in law\u201d, through a criminal ritual known as \u201cbaptism\u201d. Holders of this title are considered to be guardians of the \u201cThieves\u2019 Code\u201d. A \u201cthief in law\u201d would rarely commit a crime himself. One of the most notable features of the control exerted by \u201cthieves in law\u201d is their reputation-based authority in criminal circles. Thus, physical presence is by no means a determining factor in the power and authority of those criminal bosses. Instead, a welldeveloped network of communications and a positive public perception of the criminal bosses ensure their influence in the criminal world. In general terms, \u201cthieves in law\u201d have to fulfil four basic functions in order to maintain effective leadership in the criminal underworld: (1) an informational function (that is, the collection, analysis and evaluation of information on a wide range of topics, including those regarding specific individuals and events); (2) an organisational function (that is, planning of various specific activities and delegation of responsibilities to other members of the criminal underworld); (3) a normative-regulatory function (that is, dissemination of criminal ideology, romanticising of criminal life, recruitment of youth, maintenance of the Thieves\u2019 Code within the criminal community); and (4) a decision-making function (directing and coordinating the activities of other affiliated organised criminal group, such as housebreakers, racketeers, robbers, pickpockets, vehicle hijackers, kidnappers). Furthermore, one of the most important tasks assumed by a \u201cthief in law\u201d was that of administering the common monetary fund of the criminal underworld, or the \u201ckitty\u201d (obshyak). It should also be stressed that \u201cthieves in law\u201d had control and authority not only over criminals, but also over sectors of society in general. In the past, they were considered to be respectable social authorities, and were frequently used as dispute resolution facilitators. They were held up as models for young people, due to their enormous wealth and authority. Indeed, the significance of the affiliations and overlaps between the social and criminal elites has often been noted as one of the most vivid features of the institution of \u201cthieves in law\u201d (bibliography: Joseph D. Serio and V. S.

Furthermore, Georgian \u201cthieves in law\u201d were considered to be one of the most powerful and influential ethnic groups among their peers in the criminal elite throughout the Soviet Union (in terms of statistics, Georgian \u201cthieves in law\u201d made up 31.6% of the overall number of criminal bosses, and were the second largest ethnic group after the Russian \u201cthieves in law\u201d, who made up 33.1% of that population). Decisions by Georgian \u201cthieves in law\u201d traditionally carried particular weight for criminals of similar or lower ranks. In 1985 the Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party ordered the law-enforcement bodies to crack down on the country\u2019s \u201cthieves in law\u201d. To emphasise the importance of this mission, the Central Committee made it clear that officials failing to carry out the assignment would be treated as lawbreakers themselves and be dealt with accordingly. By 1986, 52 Georgian \u201cthieves in law\u201d had been arrested. However, the domestic courts imposed the lightest possible sentences. This was partly explained by the absence of a relevant legislative basis for effective prosecution of organised crime (there was no law at the relevant time proscribing the fact of being a criminal boss). Thus, four \u201cthieves in law\u201d were imprisoned for violating rules on probation, nine for being vagrants and leading other forms of \u201cparasitic lifestyles\u201d, fourteen for illegal possession or storage of firearms and ammunition, and nineteen for drug dealing, and the remaining six \u201cthieves in law\u201d were imprisoned for various illegal activities of a minor nature. In any event, it remained difficult to prevent in any effective way the imprisoned \u201cthieves in law\u201d from plying their trade, since they could easily continue to run the criminal underworld from their prison cells (bibliography: V.\u00a0Davis Nordin and G.\u00a0Glonti, Thieves of the Law and the Rule of Law in Georgia, Caucasian Review of International Affaires, Vol. 1 (1) \u2013 Winter 2006; L.

They emphasised that the informal authority of such criminal bosses extended well beyond the criminal underworld, and also contaminated numerous facets of ordinary public life. Thus, young people strove to resemble the criminal rulers, many high-ranking public officials were also known to have cooperated with and supported those rulers, and they received financial support \u201cdonated\u201d to them by business circles. This undue influence resulted, among other things, in the total control of prisons by \u201cthieves in law\u201d. Through threats, coercion, and co-optation, criminal bosses exerted tremendous influence over other prisoners and the prison authorities, and non-compliance with the imposed rules imposed by them, including failure to contribute to their common purse (obshyak) might result in severe punishment, including death.",

It was only after the change of Government in November 2003 that the State started to take legislative and other measures aimed at challenging the power of the criminal bosses. In particular, on 20 December 2005 an amendment was made to the Criminal Code of Georgia, adding Article 223(1), which penalised two separate criminal offences \u2013 (i) being a member of the \u201cthieves\u2019 underworld\u201d and (ii)\u00a0being a \u201cthief in law\u201d.

For instance, Article\u00a0223(1) was intended to cover the generally acknowledged phenomenon whereby \u201cthieves in law\u201d did not commit crime personally, but managed various criminal activities via criminal syndicates acting under their direct or indirect subordination. One of the most notable features of the \u201cthieves\u2019\u201d power was their reputation-based authority in criminal circles, which meant that, even if they were physically absent from the country, they could still pose, through a network of committed criminals, a threat to public order.",

Furthermore, the Amendment constituted only one element of a wider legislative package aimed at intensifying the fight against the criminal syndicates. The other piece of legislation, adopted on the very same day, was the Law on Organised Crime and Racketeering, section 3 of which comprehensively explained to the public the definition of such terms as \u201cthieves\u2019 underworld\u201d, \u201cbeing a member of the thieves\u2019 underworld\u201d, \u201csettlement of disputes using the authority of a thief in law\u201d, \u201cbeing a thief in law\u201d and so on.

Furthermore, some of the most powerful \u201cthieves in law\u201d had been able to flee Georgia and had found shelter either in the Russian Federation, in Ukraine, or even in the countries of Western Europe. The most important result of this efficient anti-criminal campaign was, however, significant progress in eradicating the social influence of criminal bosses over the public at large, thus diminishing their privileged societal position.",

It also sets forth, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty. While it prohibits, in particular, extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused\u2019s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. When speaking of \u201claw\u201d, Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statute law as well as case-law and implies qualitative requirements, including those of accessibility and foreseeability (see Cantoni v.

That means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent are vague, and their interpretation and application depend on practice. Consequently, in any system of law, however clearly drafted a legal provision, including a criminal law provision, may be, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. A law may still satisfy the requirement of \u201cforeseeability\u201d where the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action\u00a0may entail (see Achour v.

The Court\u2019s attention has previously been drawn to the functioning of that dangerous criminal community, and its vindictive rules, in the context of the Georgian prison sector (see Tsintsabadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a035403/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a061, 66-69 and 87-92, 15 February 2011). Now, in the context of the present case, the findings of several socio-legal studies on the impact of the criminal institution of \u201cthieves\u2019 underworld\u201d on Georgian society at large were explained in detail before the Court (see paragraphs 21-24 above). In consequence, and drawing parallels with the recognised social blight represented by other mafia-type organisations (see, for instance, Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 30, Series A no.\u00a0281A), the Court notes the rationale behind the respondent State\u2019s decision to create, on 20 December 2005, a legislative basis in order to combat that criminal activities more effectively.",

Having regard to these studies and to the Government\u2019s submissions, the Court observes that this criminal phenomenon was already so deeply rooted in society, and the societal authority of \u201cthieves in law\u201d was so high, that among ordinary members of the public criminal concepts such as \u201cthieves\u2019 underworld\u201d, \u201ca thief in law\u201d, \u201csettlement of disputes using the authority of a thief in law \u201d, \u201cobshyak\u201d, and so on, were matters of common knowledge and widely understood (see also Tsintsabadze, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 66-69).",

Interestingly enough, the Georgian legislature opted to maintain colloquial language in the legal definition of those offences; in the Court\u2019s view, this was apparently done to ensure that the essence of the newly criminalised offences would be grasped more easily by the general public. That being the case, the Court is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s attempts to present himself as a person to whom the concepts concerning that criminal subculture were entirely foreign, especially given that he explicitly suggested the contrary in his depositions to the domestic investigation. Thus, the applicant stated that he knew that Mr\u00a0A.K. possessed the special status of \u201cthief in law\u201d and that, in general, a \u201cthief in law\u201d was, in his opinion, \u201ca righteous person\u201d (see paragraph 8 above). Furthermore, when visiting his imprisoned acquaintance, a candidate for \u201cbaptism\u201d as a \u201cthief in law\u201d, the applicant, as well as discussing financial issues relating to management of the common fund of the thieves\u2019 underworld (the kitty, or obshyak), also expressed opinions which clearly confirmed his interest in the fate of the relevant criminal subculture, the \u201cthieves\u2019 underworld\u201d, and his understanding of the special set of rules governing it. Further, when willingly becoming involved in the unofficial adjudication of two private disputes, the applicant did not hesitate to use his own authority as a senior member of the thieves\u2019 underworld, and that of his boss, the titular \u201cthief in law\u201d Mr A.K., as a means of persuasion (see paragraphs 13-15 above).",

The other major piece of legislation, enacted on the very same date, was the Law on Organised Crime and Racketeering, section 3 of which comprehensively explained to the public the definition of such already colloquial terms as \u201cthieves\u2019 underworld\u201d, \u201cbeing a member of the thieves\u2019 underworld\u201d, \u201csettlement of disputes using the authority of a thief in law\u201d, \u201cbeing a thief in law\u201d, and so on.
