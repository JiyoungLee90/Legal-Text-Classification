The case originated in an application (no. 55902/11) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Olena Prokopivna Ryzhenko (“the applicant”), on 23 August 2011.
The applicant was represented by Ms T.I. Lezhukh, a lawyer practising in Kyiv. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their then Agent, Mr N. Kulchytskyy, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 27 February 2012 the applicant died. Her children and heirs, Ms Olga Mykolayivna Potsiluyko and Mr Oleksandr Mykolayovych Ryzhenko, who also acted as her successors in the domestic proceedings, expressed the wish to pursue the application.
On 12 November 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
On 13 October 2008 the applicant’s son, Mr Ry., was found dead in the pond which he had been guarding as a night watchman.
On the following day a post-mortem examination was completed. It concluded that Mr Ry. had drowned. A number of bruises and sores were discovered on his chest. The expert assessed those injuries as insignificant and considered that they had been inflicted by blunt hard objects.
During the period from October 2008 to February 2013 the police refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the death fifteen times. All those rulings were quashed by the prosecution authorities or the courts for superficiality and incompleteness of the investigation undertaken.
On 7 February 2013, following the entry into force of the new Code of Criminal Procedure in November 2012, the case was registered in the Unified Register of Pre-Trial Investigations.
Thereafter the police terminated the criminal investigation twice having found that there was no indication of a homicide. Both those decisions were quashed.
As of April 2014 the pre-trial investigation was ongoing.
