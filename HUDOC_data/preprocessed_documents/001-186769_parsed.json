Accordingly, he had had no possibility of being present in person. As the items had been seized again immediately after having been returned to his lawyer, the applicant had not had time to verify their condition and to confer with his lawyer on how to\u00a0respond. In that regard, his lawyer could not, even in theory, have checked the condition of some of the material concerned because it was encrypted. Moreover, it was protected from seizure by lawyer-client privilege. Lastly, the applicant argued that the Austrian authorities knew about the items they had asked to be seized again exclusively from the results of their unlawful initial seizure. Therefore, the re-seizure had served the sole purpose of rectifying the initial seizure, which was against the object and purpose of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 2010, and for which his lawyer had been arbitrarily exploited.",

As regards its proportionality, they submitted first of all that execution of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 2010 had been complicated by difficulties in establishing the applicant\u2019s address and identifying the items seized in 2009 that belonged to him. As he had been advised at the domestic level, it was open to him to claim restitution of further items provided he could establish title to them. As for the re-seizure, the Slovakian authorities had been implementing an Austrian letter rogatory, knowing that the items in question had been in the possession of the applicant\u2019s lawyer. They had opted for a request that he surrender them, which was a less stringent measure than its alternative, physical seizure. It was true that the lawyer had been threatened with a fine and with disciplinary proceedings. However, such a fine was appealable and the PPS did not in fact have disciplinary authority in relation to the lawyer. In view of the digital form of the information that had been seized again, it had not been possible without the applicant\u2019s assistance to distinguish which part of it was business related and which was private. Such a distinction could only be made by the Austrian authorities in the proceedings for the purposes of which that material had been seized again. As to the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 2010, it could not be seen as constituting an absolute obstacle to the reseizure of the material originally seized in 2009, in particular on grounds of lawyer-client privilege, since no such matters had been addressed in the 2010 judgment. In sum, the Government argued that the Slovakian authorities had preserved a fair balance between the various interests at\u00a0stake.",

In determining whether an\u00a0interference is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, the Court will take into account that a certain margin of appreciation is left to the Contracting States. Its review is not limited, however, to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith. In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must consider the impugned decisions in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced to justify the interference at issue are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d. In comparable cases, it has examined whether domestic law and practice afforded adequate and effective safeguards against any abuse and arbitrariness.

In so far as the domestic authorities\u2019 limited answer to that argument can be understood, they found that it was the applicant\u2019s free choice not to take part in person in the handover of the items to be restored and that, consequently, he could not complain of not being able to exercise his rights properly in person.",

Thus, even if the authorities\u2019 reasoning could be accepted in principle, it cannot be accepted on the facts since the applicant had no knowledge that the items would be seized again and accordingly could not have had any choice as to whether to participate in person or not.

However, the Convention is intended to guarantee rights and freedoms that are practical and effective as opposed to ones that are theoretical or illusory. Therefore, in relation to the re-seizure, Slovakia remained bound by Article 1 of the Convention to secure the applicant his rights and freedoms defined in the Convention and its Protocols.",
