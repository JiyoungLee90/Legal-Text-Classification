The term employed by that provision (\u201cundermining the dignity of a judicial office\u201d) inevitably includes an element of vagueness and is subject to interpretation by the courts. The Constitutional Court noted regarding that point that it was impossible to establish a precise catalogue of disciplinary offences (see paragraph\u00a046 above). Furthermore, in their decisions delivered in the course of the proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s case, the disciplinary courts referred to the case-law of the Supreme Court, which elaborated on the concept of the \u201cdignity of a judicial office\u201d and which had to be interpreted in combination with other rules binding on judges. Among those rules was the requirement that judges (i) possess \u201cunblemished character\u201d (section\u00a061 of the 2001 Law) and (ii) act in accordance with the judicial oath and avoid anything that could bring into disrepute the dignity of a judge (section 82 of the 2001 Law). The judicial oath, in turn, required that a judge act with propriety and honesty (see paragraphs 28, 38 and 49 above). The disciplinary courts furthermore referred to the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law regarding the appropriate manner of addressing criticism to another judge (see paragraphs\u00a029 and 40 above).

The courts furthermore referred to the relevant domestic case-law, indicating that criticism addressed by a judge to another judge should be made in a tactful, moderate and dispassionate manner (see paragraphs\u00a029 and\u00a040 above). In the light of the abovementioned obligations, the domestic courts found that the applicant had exceeded the limits of his right to impart opinions and had not adhered to the standards of judicial propriety, and by doing so he had undermined the administration of justice (see paragraph 41 above). In addition, he had undermined the reputation of the judge inspector and her professional standing.

From that perspective, it is difficult to see how the applicant could have demonstrated that his value judgments had a sufficient factual basis. The Court notes the applicant\u2019s argument that he had the right to comment on the report because the report, in his view, contained an inaccurate assessment of his work. He submitted, inter alia, that the judge inspector had criticised him for his failure to comply with his superiors\u2019 instructions, without having offered him the opportunity to respond to those allegations. Given the circumstances of the case, the Court finds that the impugned remarks, which constituted value judgments, could be regarded as having a certain factual basis and thus remained within the acceptable limits (see Peruzzi, cited above, \u00a7 58-59, where a lawyer\u2019s statements that a judge had taken unfair and arbitrary decisions were deemed acceptable).",
