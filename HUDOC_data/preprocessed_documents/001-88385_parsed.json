The Federal Minister pointed to the \u2019s case-law, according to which a conviction under Article 80 of the Criminal Code concerned essentially the same punishable conduct as the offence under section 130(1), no. 16, of the Industrial Safety Act. Thus, to conduct two sets of criminal proceedings concerning these offences would be in breach of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. The IAP had, however, overlooked the fact that in the present case no proceedings had been conducted against the applicant before a criminal court. The inquiries by the District Public Prosecutor, an employee of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, had the purpose of verifying whether or not a charge should be brought against a person and whether proper criminal proceedings should be opened. As a result the District Public Prosecutor had discontinued the preliminary inquiries since he had not found sufficient reasons to prosecute the applicant. That being so, it could not be said that an act had been committed which fell within the scope of Article 80 of the Criminal Code. The ne bis in idem principle did not therefore apply.",
