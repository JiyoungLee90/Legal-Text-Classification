Unlike the first two of these provisions, the third emanated from the Veterinary Surgeons\u2019 Council (see paragraphs 11 and 26 above) and not directly from parliament. It is nonetheless to be regarded as a \"law\" within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) of the Convention. The competence of the Veterinary Surgeons\u2019 Council in the sphere of professional conduct derives from the independent rule-making power that the veterinary profession - in company with other liberal professions - traditionally enjoys, by parliamentary delegation, in the Federal Republic of Germany (see notably the judgment of 9 May 1972 by the Federal Constitutional Court, Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, vol. 33, pp. 125-171). Furthermore, it is a competence exercised by the Council under the control of the State, which in particular satisfies itself as to observance of national legislation, and the Council is obliged to submit its rules of professional conduct to the Land Government for approval (sections 8 (3) and 18 of the 1964 Act - see paragraphs 11 and 26 above).",

Such considerations are especially cogent in the sphere of conduct governed by the 1909 Act, namely competition, this being a subject where the relevant factors are in constant evolution in line with developments in the market and in means of communication. Finally, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal based its judgment of 24 January 1980 on a combined application of section 1 of the 1909 Act and paragraph (a) of Rule 7 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which is a clearer and more detailed provision.",

The Hanseatic Court of Appeal grounded its decision on the protection of the \"rights of others\" and there is no cause for believing that it was pursuing other objectives alien to the Convention. The judgment of 24 January 1980 thus had an aim that was in itself legitimate - that is to say, subject to the \"necessity\" of the measure in issue - for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) of the Convention. There is no need to inquire whether that judgment is capable of being justified under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) on other grounds as well.",

The injunction issued on 24 January 1980 does not achieve a fair balance between the two interests at stake. According to the Hanseatic Court of Appeal, there remains an intent to act for the purposes of commercial competition, within the meaning of section 1 of the 1909 Act, as long as that intent has not been entirely overriden by other motives (\"nicht v\u00f6llig hinter sonstigen Beweggr\u00fcnden verschwindet\" - see paragraph 22 above). A criterion as strict as this in approaching the matter of advertising and publicity in the liberal professions is not consonant with freedom of expression. Its application risks discouraging members of the liberal professions from contributing to public debate on topics affecting the life of the community if ever there is the slightest likelihood of their utterances being treated as entailing, to some degree, an advertising effect. By the same token, application of a criterion such as this is liable to hamper the press in the performance of its task of purveyor of information and public watchdog.",

The applicant was restrained from making certain public statements, but the injunction did not preclude him from making statements on other points concerning, or from contributing to public debate on, the veterinary services available in his city. It is equally evident from paragraph 22 of the judgment that the resultant interference was confirmed by the Hanseatic Court of Appeal on 24 January 1980 in a fully-reasoned ruling in which the relevant issues under German law were considered in detail. To this should be added that the decisions of the German courts were grounded on rules on professional conduct and unfair competition. Although restrictions on advertising and publicity by members of the liberal professions are well known in the States Parties to the Convention, the combined application of rules from these two categories is not the general practice.",

The Court has already, in previous judgments, expounded the principles governing how this problem should be approached (see notably the Handyside judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, pp. 22-24, paras. 48-50, and the Sunday Times judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, pp. 35-38, paras. 58-62).

There is no doubt, in our view, that this was so in the applicant\u2019s case. As to the supervisory role of our Court, the main question for determination is whether the decisions of the German courts were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. The fact that the article in question was not solely devoted to generating publicity or even that its author had not had publicity in view as an objective does not alter this conclusion. The German courts were certainly not acting unreasonably in taking into consideration those aspects of the article which produced a publicity-like effect. Having due regard to the limited scope of the restrictions, we consider that the principle of proportionality was not transgressed.
