His request of 18\u00a0October 2002, however succinct, contained his reasons: that the trial had been unduly protracted and that he had been held in pre-trial detention for already more that two years and four months since his committal for trial (see paragraph 18 above). Moreover, the Court would add that since the applicant\u2019s arrest on 8 October 1999 more than three years had already passed when the judge of the R\u012bga Regional Court received the applicant\u2019s letter, a fact which the Government admit is in violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. Moreover, the applicant appears to have applied to that court on several other occasions (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above). Even though the Court has not been furnished with copies of those requests, it can be inferred from the replies given by the judges of the  that these letters contained, at least in substance, similar requests to that of 18\u00a0October 2002.",

Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, as then in force, there was no time-limit placed on detention pending trial and the detention order, in principle, remained in force until judgment had been given on the merits. The Court has already found that no remedy was available under Latvian law whereby the lawfulness of detention could be periodically reviewed at the trial stage before the examination of the merits of the case had begun (Svipsta, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 141-143). Moreover, when the judge replied to the applicant\u2019s request for release of 18\u00a0October\u00a02002, he explicitly referred to the applicable provisions of the domestic law and noted that the Senate of the Supreme Court had extended his detention until 30 April 2003 (see paragraph 19 above). The Court considers that such an explanation confirms that no remedy existed in Latvian law at that time for the applicant to contest the lawfulness of his detention. The Court would further add that Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention obliges the court to provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question. In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 (c), a hearing is required (see, among many other authorities, Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7\u00a0162, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII). It is evident from the facts of the case that no such hearing had taken place either before the Senate of the Supreme Court or before the judge of the  during the period under consideration. Therefore, the Court considers that the applicant was not offered the procedural safeguards contained in Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention.",
