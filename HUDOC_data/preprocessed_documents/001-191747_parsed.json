In the present case, although the Government argued that the shares held by the applicants could not be considered \u201cpossessions\u201d as they had not had any value in view of the actual financial situation of Ya\u015farbank, the Court cannot give weight to that argument as it observes that the shares of the bank were being sold on the stock exchange until the time the Council of Ministers announced its decision.

In the Court\u2019s view, there has therefore been an interference with their right to peaceful enjoyment of their property (see S\u00fczer and Eksen Holding A.\u015e. v.

It is true that it involved a deprivation of property, but in the circumstances the deprivation formed a constituent element of a scheme for controlling the banking industry.

The Court held that section 14(5) of Law no.\u00a04389 as amended by Law no. 4491, which had constituted the basis of the impugned transfer, had lacked foreseeability as it had been applied only two days after the entry into force of the amendment allowing for the transfer of the ownership of the bank\u2019s shares.

In the proceedings for the annulment of that decision, the applicants pointed, in particular, to their status as minority shareholders and the deficiencies in the supervision of Ya\u015farbank. The Supreme Administrative Court dismissed their actions for annulment, relying on the reasoning it had provided in the case brought by the main shareholders for the annulment of the Council of Ministers\u2019 decision. The Court notes that in its judgment in the case of Ya\u015far Holding A.\u015e., it found no reason to question the findings of the Supreme Administrative Court in the main shareholders\u2019 case, in which the domestic court had concluded that in view of the difficulties encountered by Ya\u015farbank and its failure to implement the required measures, the continuation of its activities would have jeopardised the rights of its creditors and undermined the reliability and stability of the banking system (cited above, \u00a7 94). While it does not depart from that conclusion in the present case, it notes that the applicants\u2019 main submission before the Supreme Administrative Court was the unlawfulness of the application of section 14(5) in a manner which included the transfer of their shares together with those of the main shareholders. According to the applicants, their shares should not have been subject to that provision on account of their position as minority shareholders who had obtained their shares on the stock exchange. The Court observes that by dismissing the applicants\u2019 requests for the annulment of the Council of Ministers\u2019 decision on the same grounds it had relied on in the main shareholders\u2019 case, the domestic court did not address the applicants\u2019 main argument about the lawfulness of the application of section 14(5) to their shares.",
