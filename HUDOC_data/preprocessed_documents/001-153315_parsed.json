Its expert team recommended that the contacts between the applicant and his son take place every second Saturday for two hours for the period of three months, and after that every Saturday, in the presence of the mother and a child-welfare professional. However, the centre\u2019s experts suggested that the contacts should not take place in the child\u2019s home as it was not a neutral ground and could give rise to conflicts between the applicant on the one side and Z.J. and her parents on the other. Their report indicated that the applicant\u2019s son was very emotionally attached to his mother, that he did not know his father but wanted to meet him. The expert\u2019s opinion also suggested that the centre impose a child-protection measure of supervision of exercise of parental authority focusing on contacts between the applicant and his son, with a view to facilitating those contacts and assisting the parents in improving communication between them (see paragraph 59 below).",

Therefore, in cases concerning a person\u2019s relationship with his or her child there is a duty to exercise exceptional diligence in view of the risk that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the matter. This duty, which is decisive in assessing whether a case has been heard within a reasonable time as required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, also forms part of the procedural requirements implicit in Article 8 (see, for example, S\u00fc\u00df v.

The adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between a child and the parent who does not live with him (see, for example, Fern\u00e1ndez Cabanillas v.

The cooperation and understanding of all concerned will always be an important ingredient. However, lack of cooperation between separated parents is not a circumstance which can by itself exempt the authorities from their positive obligations under Article 8. It rather imposes on the authorities an obligation to take measures to reconcile the conflicting interests of the parties, keeping in mind the best interests of the child as primary consideration (see Fern\u00e1ndez Cabanillas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47 and 50).",
