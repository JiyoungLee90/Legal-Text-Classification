According to the report, Mr S., the direct marketing executive, explained to the officers that he was not authorised to accept and sign the inspection order or the order to initiate proceedings against the applicant company. The officers asked him to direct them to someone authorised or to the mailroom, so that they could serve the orders and start the inspection. Mr S. took the officers to the mailroom but nobody was there. An employee who arrived at the mailroom at 9.25\u00a0a.m. refused to sign anything and said that she would call her superior. A moment later Mr P., the deputy finance executive, arrived at the mailroom. It is stated in the report that in a loud voice he then asked the officers to leave, pointing with his hand in the direction of the exit and showing no intention to cooperate with the officers, despite being warned by them that refusal to cooperate would be regarded as an obstruction of the inspection, resulting in a fine. Since none of the employees wanted to accept the orders, the officers eventually left them in the mailroom and the orders were thus deemed to be served. According to the report, at 9.31 a.m. the officers left the building because they believed that the inspection would not be possible without police assistance. At 9.57\u00a0a.m., after the arrival of the police, the officers again entered the applicant company\u2019s premises. At 10\u00a0a.m. Mr V. arrived. He apologised for the inconvenience and was willing to cooperate. At 10.45 a.m. the officers started the inspection, which was then carried out without any obstructive behaviour on the part of the applicant company.",

The obstruction had been Mr P.\u2019s unwillingness to cooperate with officers and to immediately facilitate access to evidence and its preservation. It concluded that the applicant company had obstructed the inspection by not making the inspection physically possible (preiskava ni bila fizi\u010dno omogo\u010dena) after being requested and warned to do so by the officers. Waiting in the reception area for the applicant company to prepare for the inspection or for the authorised person of the company to arrive ran contrary to the purpose of an unannounced inspection, which was to secure evidence. The Office also held that it was a company\u2019s duty to cooperate even when its legal representative was absent. In setting the fine, the Office considered that the inspection had been delayed for one hour and thirty minutes, and for twenty-six minutes the applicant company\u2019s conduct had been outside the officers\u2019 control and could have resulted in the destruction of incriminating evidence. Referring to the EU Commission\u2019s practice, it held that the punishment had to be stringent enough to deter the offenders. It also had regard to the subsequent exemplary cooperation of the applicant company and the fact that this had been the first time a fine had been imposed under the Competition Act.",

It requested an oral hearing, maintaining that a direct examination of the evidence was required to properly establish the facts of the case. In particular, the four witnesses, who had been present at the premises on the day of the alleged obstruction, would prove that the applicant company had not obstructed the inspection or refused to cooperate with the officers. They would also show that the officers had not properly introduced themselves and had tried to enter the premises in an aggressive manner. The applicant company also argued that the officers could not be prevented from doing something which they had not specifically requested, namely access to specific places or persons under the inspection. At the time the obstruction had allegedly been committed, the officers had only asked for someone on whom they could serve the orders and had been subsequently politely asked to wait in the reception area. The applicant company\u2019s employees had complied with the duty to cooperate by trying to find that person. The applicant company argued that the officers could have freely continued with the inspection. Furthermore, had there been an obstruction of the inspection, the Office would have sanctioned the company on the spot and not six months later. As to Mr P., it held that he had not been an employee of the applicant company and had not been authorised to collect any mail. Since he was only in a contractual relationship with the applicant company, his allegedly illegal actions could not be attributed to it. Lastly, given the amount of the fine imposed, which was excessive, immediately enforceable and of a punitive nature, the proceedings at issue had been criminal in nature and required adequate fair trial guarantees.",

It noted at the outset that the applicant company was not allowed to introduce new facts and evidence in the judicial review proceedings and that they would not be taken into consideration. The court emphasised that although the applicant company had contested the facts as established by the Office (see paragraph 10 above), it had not challenged the fact that the officers could not immediately after their arrival at the company\u2019s premises secure the evidence. In particular, the majority of the management had been absent, while Mr P. had refused to cooperate and had asked the officers to leave the premises until the arrival of his superiors. According to the Supreme Court, the applicant company had merely argued that the above-described acts had not constituted an obstruction of the inspection. In the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion this was not a question of fact but purely of law. In this connection, the court held that making the officers wait in the reception area while the company prepared for the inspection ran contrary to the purpose of an inspection. It was irrelevant whether the company\u2019s employees had raised their voices at the officers or had asked them to leave. The only important fact was that the authorised persons could not immediately start securing the evidence. The applicant company had not acted in accordance with the minimum duty to cooperate, which had been necessary for the inspection, and had thus obstructed it. The court also rejected the argument that Mr P. could not obstruct the inspection, finding that he was a contractual worker working in the name of the applicant company in accordance with section\u00a031(5) of the Competition Act (see paragraph 25 below). Lastly, the court deemed the imposed fine adequate, considering the seriousness of the violation and the relevant circumstances of the case.",

U-I-40/12). On the basis of an examination of the applicable law, the court assumed that the proceedings for determining violations of competition law which were carried out in their entirety under the Competition Act \u2013 supervision proceedings \u2013 were not, in themselves, regulated as punitive. The Constitutional Court also held that the supervisory powers of the Agency were directed towards the reestablishment of the compliance of the market with competition rules. By contrast, the court noted that the minor-offence proceedings, in which the Agency imposed a fine as a repressive measure for general and special preventive and retributive purposes, were of a punitive nature.",

Referring to the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above), they stressed that the proceedings at issue had been conducted in their entirety in accordance with the Competition Act and had been separated from the minor-offence proceedings. In both the Agency had had to establish a violation, but it had only been in the latter that the Agency had determined the objective and subjective elements of the minor offence concerned and imposed a fine. They emphasised that in minor-offence proceedings offenders could be heard on all the facts and evidence of the case. Regarding the nature of the violation, the Government argued that the provisions of competition law were not universally applicable, but applied only to the conduct of undertakings that affected competition in the market. The main purpose of issuing the infringement decision had been to end the anti-competition practices and to restore market compliance with competition rules. In the administrative proceedings the Agency could only impose reasonable measures under section 37 of the Competition Act (see paragraph 25 above) aimed at eliminating the violation and its consequences. Noting that the minor-offence decision against the applicant company had been set aside by the domestic courts, they argued that no fine or any other sanction had been imposed on the applicant company for the violation established by a final decision in the administrative proceedings.",

It was an administrative (procedural) penalty, which was not entered in criminal records and did not have any other legal consequences in respect of a criminal conviction under Slovenian law. Secondly, they maintained that the purpose of the fine was to enable the Agency to effectively exercise its supervisory powers under the Competition Act. The fine was not universally applicable. Lastly, the Government submitted that the amount of the fine depended on the economic size of the undertaking, whereas the maximum fine could not be higher than 1% of the undertaking\u2019s annual turnover in the preceding business year. In the present case, the imposed fine had been five times smaller than the maximum statutory fine, which could not be converted into a prison sentence.",

The fact that in the administrative proceedings only a declaratory decision on the abuse of a dominant position had been issued without any measures or actual effect, only confirmed its view that their only purpose had been to impose a fine in the subsequent minor-offence proceedings. In addition, criminal proceedings could be instigated against an undertaking and the persons responsible on the basis of the findings and conclusions of the Agency.

Furthermore, these criteria are alternative and not cumulative: for Article 6 to apply in respect of the words \u201ccriminal charge\u201d, it suffices that the offence in question should by its nature be \u201ccriminal\u201d from the point of view of the Convention, or should have made the person concerned liable to a sanction which, by virtue of its nature and degree of severity, belongs in general to the \u201ccriminal\u201d sphere. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d (see Jussila v.

It further notes that the same facts which gave rise to supervision proceedings could constitute the factual basis for a minor offence (section 73 of the Competition Act, see paragraph 25 above). However, the Court observes that the Agency can impose a fine only in minor-offence proceedings, when acting as a minor-offence authority pursuant to section 12(2) of the Competition Act (see paragraph 25 above). Furthermore, in minor-offence proceedings the domestic courts are in no way bound by the administrative decision of the Agency. They have jurisdiction to decide on all aspects of the case. Moreover, the administrative decision of the Agency can stand without the minor-offence decision. Therefore, the Court considers that the supervision proceedings, on the one hand, and the minor-offence proceedings before the Agency and ensuing judicial review proceedings, on the other, should be regarded as two separate sets of proceedings for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention. It will now turn to examine whether the criminal limb of Article 6 applied to the supervision proceedings.",

In this connection, the Court observes that the Agency when conducting supervision proceedings applies the rules of administrative procedure (section 15 of the Competition Act, see paragraph 25 above). Similarly, the legality of the decision-making of the Agency in this type of proceedings is subject to appeal before the Supreme Court, which decides in special judicial review proceedings, applying, mutatis mutandis, provisions of the Administrative Disputes Act (section 54 of the Competition Act, see paragraph 25 above). However, this consideration is not decisive, as the indications furnished by the domestic law have only a relative value (see A.\u00a0Menarini Diagnostics S.R.L. v.

It notes that the provision found to have been infringed by the applicant company (section 9 of the Competition Act, see paragraph 25 above) was intended to preserve free competition in the market. The Agency as a public regulatory authority monitored restrictive agreements and abuses of dominant position. These are general interests of society, usually protected by criminal law (see A. Menarini Diagnostics S.R.L., cited above, \u00a7 40). On the other hand, the contested decision (see paragraph 18 above) was issued by the Agency acting in its capacity as a supervisory authority (and not a minor-offence authority). When acting in such a capacity, the Agency was only entitled to determine the existence of a violation of competition rules, demand that the undertaking cease the violation and impose on the undertaking certain measures which it considered suitable for remedying the established violation and its consequences (section 37 of the Competition Act, see paragraph 25 above). In the supervision proceedings the decisions were to be issued on objective grounds without the need to establish any criminal intent or negligence on the undertaking\u2019s part and were not entered in criminal records. The Court further finds it particularly important that in the present case, the impugned decision imposed no measures on the applicant company (compare and contrast with A. Menarini Diagnostics S.R.L., cited above, \u00a7 41). In fact, the applicant company itself acknowledged that the Agency in the supervision proceedings had only issued a declaratory decision on the abuse of a dominant position without any measures or actual effect on the applicant company (see paragraph 37 above).",

However, this is not decisive (see \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Germany, 21 February 1984, \u00a7 52, Series A no. 73, and A.\u00a0Menarini Diagnostics S.R.L., cited above, \u00a7 39). As for the second criterion, the Court notes that the measure imposed on the applicant company resulted from section 31 of the Competition Act, which applies a general obligation to a specific circumstance, that is, the imposition of fines on undertakings obstructing the Agency\u2019s officers in the exercise of their powers (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6zmurat \u0130n\u015faat Elektrik Nakliyat Temizlik San. ve Tic. Ltd. \u015eti. v. Turkey no. 48657/06, \u00a7 25, 28 November 2017). It would appear that the\u00a0prohibition on obstructing inspections was intended to ensure effective exercise of the Agency\u2019s powers. The Court observes that the effective exercise of official duties of agents of the State appears to be in the general interests of society, protected also by the Criminal Code in Slovenia (see paragraph 29 above). Moreover, with regard to the third criterion, it observes that the fine at issue concerned a substantial amount and that the maximum fine the applicant risked incurring amounted to more than EUR 500,000. Furthermore, the fine was directly enforceable (section\u00a031(4) of the Competition Act, see paragraph 25 above). It was imposed several months after the inspection had finished, thus did not pursue the aim of ensuring an effective inspection. It was essentially intended to punish the unlawful conduct, in order to prevent reoffending, and not to compensate any damage caused by the applicant company.",

Since in the present case the Supreme Court refused to examine the facts on which the applicant company\u2019s conviction was based, the violation of the applicant company\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention was simply obvious.",

In my capacity as the national judge, I nonetheless wish to invite the stakeholders in the Slovenian legal system, notably the legislature, the Government and the judiciary, to reflect on whether any amendments to the relevant legislation are needed in order to avoid similar violations in future. In this respect, these stakeholders might wish to turn their attention to the applicable provisions on administrative disputes governing the extent to which it is possible for plaintiffs to address questions of fact in their submissions to the competent court performing judicial review, and the corresponding extent of competence of that court to review or even autonomously establish the relevant facts. Alternatively, it might be of importance to establish whether the implementation of the existing legislative provisions is in conformity with the Convention requirements outlined above.",

Russia, nos. 46632/13 and 28671/14, 23 February 2016). Furthermore, it is unclear whether any other form of redress is available to the applicant company in the present situation at the national level. Without entering into an analysis of whether a claim for damages, lodged in civil contentious proceedings, or a request for reopening with analogous interpretation of the provisions governing criminal procedure could provide a way out in this situation, I find it of particular importance that Article 15 \u00a7 4 of the Slovenian Constitution expressly guarantees the right to obtain redress for any violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In the light of this provision, one would reasonably expect the legal system to put in place effective and straightforward legal avenues for victims, particularly in cases where the violation has been established by a judgment of this Court.",

It is impossible to speculate on what the outcome of the proceedings before the Supreme Court would have been had the violation not occurred. Equally, the Court must refrain from any speculation on the hypothetical outcome of any reopening or redress proceedings had the domestic legal system provided for them. To put it simply: if in the present case the Supreme Court conducted evidentiary proceedings and established the relevant facts of the case autonomously, it may have found for the applicant company, but, equally, it could have dismissed the applicant company\u2019s action and confirmed the fine as imposed by the Office. It could also have done something in between, e.g. reduced the impugned fine in the light of the circumstances of the case, which it would establish on its own.",

In such situations, many legal systems have developed the \u201closs of real opportunities\u201d doctrine (Fr. perte de chances r\u00e9elles), according to which the amount of damages to be awarded corresponds to the likely amount of the claimant\u2019s gain had there been no violation.

Pursuant to Article 30 of the Convention, any such decision could only be taken by the Grand Chamber. Furthermore, the damage suffered by the applicant company was the lost opportunity to benefit from a fair trial. This is a form of damage in itself, which has to be compensated in the present case.",

The same principle applies to this case. In this regard, we find it highly problematic that Slovenian law does not allow for the reopening of the present proceedings (see paragraph 65 of the judgment). This is not in accordance with Recommendation (2000)2 of the Committee of Ministers on the reexamination or reopening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, and hence Slovenian law lacks basic human rights safeguards in this regard.",
