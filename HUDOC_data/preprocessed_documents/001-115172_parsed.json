The Court observes that the initial application form and correspondingly the complaints communicated to the Government concerned only the period when the applicant was kept in normal prison cells and was allegedly not provided with the medical assistance he needed and asked for. Therefore, in the Court\u2019s view, the new grievances cannot be considered as an elaboration of the applicant\u2019s original complaint on which the parties have commented and hence these matters cannot be taken up in the context of the present application (see, for instance, Saghinadze and Others v.

Complaints intended to be made subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law. Article 35 \u00a7 1 further requires that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used (see Cardot\u00a0v. , 19 March 1991, \u00a7\u00a034, Series A no.\u00a0200).

Such a remedy can, in principle, be both preventive and compensatory in nature. However, where the applicant has already resorted to either of the available remedies, considering it to be the most appropriate course of action in his or her particular situation, the applicant should not then be reproached for not having pursued an alternative remedial course of action (see Goginashvili v. , no. 47729/08, \u00a7 49, 4\u00a0October 2011).",

The relevant authorities were thereby sufficiently informed of the applicant\u2019s situation and had an opportunity to offer redress (see Melnik v. Ukraine, no.\u00a072286/01, \u00a7\u00a070, 28 March 2006; S\u0142awomir Musia\u0142 v. , no.\u00a028300/06, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2009-... (extracts); and Hummatov v.

While it is true that the applicant did not use the official complaint procedure under the Code of Administrative Procedure as suggested by the Government, the Court notes that the problems arising from the alleged lack of proper medical treatment for contagious diseases, including HCV, in Georgian prisons were of a structural nature at the material time and did not only concern the applicant\u2019s personal situation (see Poghosyan, cited above, \u00a7 69, and Ghavtadze v. Georgia, no. 23204/07, \u00a7 104, 3 March 2009).

The authorities must also ensure that a comprehensive record is kept concerning the detainee\u2019s state of health and his treatment while in detention (see, for example, Khudobin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 59696/00, \u00a7\u00a083, ECHR 2006-XII (extracts)); that the diagnoses and care are prompt and accurate (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0115, and Melnik, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0104-106); and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a therapeutic strategy aimed, to the extent possible, at curing the detainee\u2019s health problems or preventing their aggravation (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 109 and 114; Isayev v. , no. 28827/02, \u00a7 58, 28\u00a0May 2009; and Popov v.

Moreover, the certificate is dated 29 June 2011, and there is no other written medical record accounting in detail for the treatment the applicant has allegedly been receiving in Rustavi no. 6 Prison between 18 July 2008 and 16 June 2010. In the absence of any detailed medical history, it is highly doubtful that the chief doctor could have recapitulated the medical treatment administered to the applicant throughout his two-year stay in Rustavi no. 6 Prison by heart.",

It suffices to note that the only piece of evidence submitted by the Government in support of the above assertion is the medical certificate of 29 June 2011. In view of the comprehensiveness, complexity and the importance of those medical tests for the final diagnosis and treatment plan of the applicant, the Court does not understand why the relevant prison authorities would have carried out these tests without adding the corresponding medical records to the applicant\u2019s medical file.",

In the present case, such an assessment could be obtained from a liver biopsy and relevant blood tests determining the viral genotype and viral load (see Poghosyan, cited above, \u00a7 57). As already observed above (paragraphs 43-44 above), the Government failed to prove that any of the above mentioned medical tests were indeed performed on the applicant within the relevant period of time. The Court, therefore, considers that by leaving the infected applicant, despite his HCV diagnosis, without appropriate diagnostic examination for over three years, the relevant authorities put his health and well-being at risk (see a contrario, Goginashvili, cited above, \u00a7 80). The applicant was also left without relevant information in respect of his illness, and was thus deprived of any control over it (see Testa v. , no. 20877/04, \u00a7 52, 12 July 2007). In this respect the Court considers irrelevant the Government\u2019s submission, unsupported by relevant medical evidence, that the applicant had been receiving hepatoprotectives, since as a consequence of the lack of adequate medical examinations, the exact effect of chronic hepatitis on the applicant\u2019s health had not been established and he could not have been provided with adequate medical care (see Testa, cited above, \u00a7 52, and Poghosyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58).",

In this connection, the Court would observe the following: with respect to the applicant\u2019s heart problems, the applicant was first examined by a cardiologist only on 23 January 2010 (see paragraph\u00a035 above) that is almost three years after the applicant\u2019s detention. As for angina pectoris and viral hepatitis B, it appears that no medical tests were carried out within the relevant period of time. The Court notes that the applicant entered the prison system with a serious diagnosis made by outside medical specialists. In such circumstances, even if it accepts the Government\u2019s argument that the above-mentioned diagnosis was only of a preliminary nature, the Court considers that the relevant prison authorities were under an obligation to promptly verify it in order to properly plan the applicant\u2019s future treatment.",

The Court hence considers, that the Government failed in discharging their burden of proof concerning the availability of adequate medical supervision and treatment to the applicant in prison (see, Malenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 18660/03, \u00a7\u00a7 55-58, 19 February 2009; Ashot Harutyunyan v.\u00a0Armenia, no. 34334/04, \u00a7 112, 15 June 2010, and, a contrario, Goginashvili, cited above, \u00a7 72).",
