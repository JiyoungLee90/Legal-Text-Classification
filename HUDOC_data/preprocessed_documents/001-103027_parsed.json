The article went on to state that the law did not define privacy, but left it to the courts to interpret on a case-by-case basis. The section was amended in 2000, but the only change in essence, according to the article, was the title of the section, now known as dissemination of information violating private life. The article further noted that the worst fears of the press had never materialised but there had been some surprises. The article made reference to a decision of the Supreme Court from 2001 to convict Alibi magazine for publishing a story with a picture and the name of a person who was at the time accused and later convicted of fraud on public pension funds. The article then reverted to the judgment in question pondering, without mentioning any names, as to who could be considered a private person and what was the responsibility of such a person with regard to his or her public performance and behaviour.",

The mere fact that the interview with the head of the fire department had been published in the newspaper did not justify the conclusion that he had also consented to its publication in the periodical. Repeating a violation did not necessarily cause the same amount of damage and suffering as the initial violation. The readers of the newspaper and the periodical were partly different, and the circulation of the newspaper apparently did not entirely coincide with that of the periodical. Therefore, and considering the differences in the content and tone of the articles, the Supreme Court found it established that the article published in the periodical was conducive to causing the head of the fire department additional mental suffering. The events reported in the article did not concern the plaintiff's conduct in the performance of his duties as head of the fire department and it had not been necessary to mention the complainant's name and profession for the purpose of discussing a matter involving significant public interest or reporting on the offences. By associating the complainant's name and profession with the offences in question, the article had unlawfully spread information and insinuations concerning his private life likely to cause him damage and suffering. The disclosure of the complainant's name and the emphasis on his occupation had amounted to an insult. By again reporting on the matter two months after the events had occurred, the periodical was found to have caused the complainant additional suffering for which separate compensation was to be paid.",

The Supreme Court, having assessed the provision on the invasion of privacy in the Penal Code in the light of this Court's case-law, found that A. did not hold a position that meant that such details of her private life were of public importance. The article had thus invaded A.'s privacy.",

According to the Personal Data Act, any information about the commission of an offence and the resulting sentence qualified as \u201csensitive\u201d personal data. The publicity per se of criminal proceedings and of related documents did not mean that information made public during the proceedings could be freely published as such by the media. The Supreme Court concluded that publishing the name of a person convicted of, inter alia, assault and deprivation of liberty did not invade his privacy as the person concerned had been convicted of offences of violence which had also degraded the victim's human dignity.

The greater and more profound social implications a matter has, the more important it is to be able to publish information thereon. The Council divided persons into three groups as to the protection of identity: (1) persons exercising political, economic or administrative power; (2) other public persons, for example in the sectors of entertainment, sports, arts or science; and (3) ordinary citizens. The Council noted that the protection of identity is narrowest for group 1 and most extensive for group 3. However, this scale was not to be used formally, but the extent of protection should be interpreted on a case by case basis. A person's position had a great significance in determining the protection of private life but that alone could not be considered as a decisive factor. The significance of a matter also had an important impact. The conduct of a well-known person appearing in public in connection with his or her professional tasks or public role does not as such belong to such person's protected private life. On the contrary, information concerning lifestyle does normally belong to such person's sphere of private life even though his or her sphere of protection is narrower than that of an ordinary citizen. In some cases information concerning a person's lifestyle can be closely connected to his or her professional tasks in a way that its publication is justified. It is required, however, that the matter in question does have considerable general significance. Also, the publishing should not extend further than is necessary for the consideration of the matter. Finally, it is in accordance with good journalistic practice to see to it that the publishing does not cause undue suffering for the person in question or for his or her relatives.",

Even if the Penal Code provision in question had only been in force for about one and a half years at the time of the events, already the earlier provision of the Penal Code, which had been in force for 25 years, together with the preparatory works, had described the concept of private life and had guided the interpretation of the said provision. The earlier provision had been interpreted by the Supreme Court on several occasions prior to the publication of the impugned article. The rules on criminal liability could thus be regarded as having been gradually clarified through judicial interpretation in a manner which had been consistent with the essence of the offence. There had been no greater difficulties in the application of the said provision, although the boundary between the protection of private life and the freedom of expression had been sought here more clearly than in the application of other provisions of the Penal Code. The general nature of the provision had allowed for its flexible application in line with social developments as well as the balancing of the freedom of expression and the protection of private life. According to the Court's case-law, the consequences which a given act may entail did not have to be foreseeable with absolute certainty as this was unattainable. Consequently, in the Government's view, the relevant domestic law had been precise enough in order for the applicants to be able to foresee, to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances of the present case, the consequences which their action would entail.",

On the contrary, information concerning lifestyle did normally belong to such person's sphere of private life.

The Supreme Court had noted in its precedent case KKO 2005:82 that O.T. had not been a public official but an assistant in elections of a political candidate. The political motivations connected to her recruitment could not be considered to entail that protection of her private life would become narrower. The extra-marital relationship had not, at any rate, had any impact on O.T.'s capacities to perform her function as a communications expert for the election campaign.

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may entail excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances.

Furthermore, the Court notes that the exception in the second sentence of the earlier provision concerning persons in a public office or function, in professional life, in a political activity or in another comparable activity is equally clearly worded (see Flinkkil\u00e4 and Others v. Finland, no. 25576/04, \u00a7 66, 6 April 2010). The Court finds that the content of Chapter 24, section 8, of the Penal Code corresponds to the old Chapter 27, section 3(a), of the Penal Code as the amendments and clarifications made to the existing provision have been mainly technical (see and compare Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.

Even though there was no precise definition of private life in the preparatory works (see government bills HE 84/1974 and HE 184/1999), these works mentioned that the necessity of mentioning a person's name or other description of a person enabling identification was always subject to careful consideration.

Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart \u2013 in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest (see Jersild, cited above, \u00a7 31; De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24\u00a0February\u00a01997, \u00a7 37, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I; and Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no.\u00a021980/93, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999-III). This duty extends to the reporting and commenting on court proceedings which, provided that they do not overstep the bounds set out above, contribute to their publicity and are thus consonant with the requirement under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that hearings be public (see Egeland and Hanseid v. Norway, no. 34438/04, \u00a7 49, 16 April 2009). Not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas, the public also has a right to receive them (see, Sunday Times v. the  (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7 65). In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, \u00a7 38, Series A no.\u00a0313, and Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, loc. cit.).",

Even though she could not be considered a civil servant or a politician in the traditional sense of the word, she had not been a completely private person either. Due to her function in the presidential election campaign, she had been publicly promoting the goals and objectives of one of the presidential candidates by belonging to his inner circle and by being therefore visible in the media during the campaign. The Court considered that, when taking up her duties as a communications officer for one of the two presidential candidates, she must have understood that her own person would also attract public interest and that the scope of her protected private life would become somewhat more limited. The impugned article had had a direct bearing on matters of public interest, namely the on-going presidential election campaign. Moreover, the fact that P.N.'s ex-spouse had conducted election debates on television prior to the publishing of the article, and that the article had apparently been politically motivated and intended to affect the campaign, were also of relevance in this respect. Taking into account that the article had been published during the presidential election campaign and had thus been closely linked to it in time, the Court considered that the article did not only satisfy the curiosity of certain readers but it also contributed to an important matter of public interest in the form of political background information. The Court thus found a violation of Article 10 of the Convention (see Saaristo and Others v. Finland, 12 October 2010, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67).",

As the Court has already found a violation in this respect in the Saaristo and Others v. Finland case, it sees no reason to judge differently in the present case. The only relevant difference was that the article in that case was published two years earlier. However, the Court notes that the information about O.T.'s private life was already available to the public and might already have been known to a large number of people (see Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], cited above, \u00a7 53). There was thus no need to prevent the disclosure of that information again. For the Court, it is also of importance that the article was based on public court proceedings and on a district court judgment which was a public document (see Eerik\u00e4inen and Others v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7 64). The district court did not declare its judgment secret at any point of time (see paragraph 30 above). In addition, there is no indication that the reporting in question would have disclosed any new private information about O.T.

In addition, they were, together with the applicant company, ordered to pay damages jointly and severally to O.T. in a total amount of EUR 6,000 plus interest and her legal fees amounting to EUR 11,845.95 plus interest and EUR 2,623 plus interest, in total EUR 27,150.08. The amounts of compensation must be regarded as substantial, given that the maximum compensation afforded to victims of serious violence was approximately FIM 100,000 (EUR 17,000) at the time (see paragraph 34 above).",

France [GC], cited above, \u00a7 59, Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2004-II and Rumyana Ivanova v. , no. 36207/03, \u00a7 68, 14 February 2008). Nevertheless, in the Finnish legal system, when a statement, whether qualified as defamatory or insulting by the domestic authorities, is made in the context of a public debate, the bringing of criminal proceedings against the maker of the statement entails the risk that a prison sentence might be imposed. In this connection, the Court points out that the imposition of a prison sentence for a press offence will be compatible with journalists' freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article\u00a010 only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been impaired as, for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere v. Romania [GC], no.\u00a033348/96, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2004-XI). For the Court, similar considerations should apply to insults expressed in connection with a public debate (see D\u0142ugo\u0142\u0119cki v. , no.\u00a023806/03, \u00a7 47, 24 February 2009). The Court would further observe that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in its Resolution 1577 (2007) urged those member States which still provide for prison sentences for defamation, even if they are not actually imposed, to abolish them without delay (Resolution Towards decriminalisation of defamation adopted on 4\u00a0October 2007). For the Court, similar considerations should apply to infringements of privacy which arise in circumstances such as those in the instant case (see Saaristo and Others v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7 69).",
