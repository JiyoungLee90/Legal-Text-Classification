The case originated in an application (no. 31266/96) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Austrian national, G.H. (“the applicant”), on 26 March 1996.
The applicant was represented by Mr H. Walther, a lawyer practising in Klagenfurt (Austria). The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Winkler, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that proceedings involving a request for planning permission were not concluded within a reasonable time.
On 23 October 1997 the Commission (First Chamber) declared the application partly inadmissible and adjourned the examination of the above complaint.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted in accordance with Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 12 October 1999 the Chamber declared the remaining complaint admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
On 6 May 1991 the applicant applied to the mayor of Baldramsdorf for an amendment to planning permission he had been granted in 1988 for a game fence. The amendment concerned the fence’s boundaries. The mayor convened an on-site meeting for 5 July 1991, which was also attended by a neighbour ("the neighbour").
On 20 November 1991, the applicant applied to have a higher authority (the local council: Gemeindevorstand) decide his application. On 13 October 1992, the council accepted jurisdiction, but refused the substantive application.
On 7 April 1993 the Kärnten Regional Government (Landesregierung), on the applicant's appeal, quashed the decision of 13 October 1992 and remitted the case to the council. An objection by the neighbour was dismissed.
The council took a second decision on 17 May 1993. On this occasion, it again accepted jurisdiction and granted the applicant's amendment request.
The neighbour challenged the decision of 17 May 1993 before the Regional Government, which on 21 September 1993 quashed the decision of 17 May and again remitted the case to the council. However, on 8 November 1993 the applicant challenged the decision of 21 September 1993 by way of an administrative complaint to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof), which on 21 May 1996 quashed the Regional Government’s decision. The case therefore returned to the procedural stage at which the council's decision of 17 May 1993 had been made and challenged by the neighbour.
On 7 May 1997 the Regional Government dismissed the neighbour's objection. The neighbour did not appeal to the Administrative Court.
