However, even after the same court issued a special clarification imposing the duty to register the transfer of title on the Council, the domestic authorities do not appear to have taken any steps to enforce the judgment. Instead, they chose to attack the clarification by way of supervisory-review proceedings. As the Government failed to submit copies of the judicial decisions of 4 December 2003 and 20\u00a0May 2004, it is impossible to determine the domestic courts' current approach to the distribution of the obligation to perform State registration. In any event, the Government have not contested that the enforcement proceedings are now pending, but the judgment has remained without enforcement to date, that is for more than four years since it was issued.",
