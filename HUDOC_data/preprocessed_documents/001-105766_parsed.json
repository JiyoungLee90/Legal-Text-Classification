It further found that the visual and acoustic warning that had been given did not correspond to the actual content of the trailer and documentary, in violation of Regulations 21 (5) and 22, and that information transmitted about one of the drug addicts had not shown the appropriate sensitivity towards human suffering, in violation of paragraph 8(2) of part I of appendix VIII of the Regulations.",

For example, the identity of a caller, a light drug user, had been displayed on screen, despite his wish to remain anonymous. The CRTA considered that the drug addicts who had participated in the programme did not appear to have been fully aware of their actions, and that their free consent and decision should therefore not have been taken into full account because they had been in a state of despair, vulnerable and under the influence of strong substances that had affected their judgment. In any event, the disclosure of their identity, the media exposure and the extensive coverage of their private lives was likely to have numerous negative consequences for them. The CRTA stated that it was also concerned about the personalisation of the drug problem through the disclosure of the identity of certain drug addicts, as this might lead to their becoming role models or even \u201cheroes\u201d for vulnerable people who would like to identify with them. According to the CRTA the documentary had also lacked objectivity and pluralism, as criticisms and negative comments had been made against the medical authorities, the police drug squad, the Minister of Health and the Director of a Psychiatric Clinic, without them having been given the opportunity to present their position on the matter, in violation of section 26(2) of the Law.",

On the contrary, it seems to us that the enquiry covered everything, indeed in detail. In some of the recourses the applicants submitted, in this connection, that a legal problem arose because the investigating official who conducted the enquiry put a second report before the Authority, whereas he should have submitted only one.

We firstly note their embodiment in Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was ratified by  by Law No. 39/62, and the essential reproduction of that provision in Article 30.2 of the Constitution. The relevant jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) was not invoked during the discussion of the recourses. This is explained, however, by the inherent difficulty in the evaluation of the factors on the basis of which the classification is made, since in the variform sphere of activity of the administrative organs it is sometimes difficult to decide, firstly, whether the case falls within article 6(1) of the European Convention and secondly, if it does, whether its provisions have been complied with. With regard to the first decision, bearing in mind the tendency of the ECHR to lay emphasis on rights under private law as opposed to factors of public law, which means beneficial interpretation in favour of the citizens, we are of the view that we must approach the recourses before us on the basis of the right to impartiality. This granted, we proceed to examine whether the procedure fulfilled the safeguards of impartiality. In our opinion the affirmative answer is justified. It appears to us that in all the cases, without exception, there has been a satisfactory distinction between the various stages, which consisted in the collection of the facts, their preliminary examination, the briefing of the applicants in relation to these, affording them the right to be heard, in writing or orally, and the final adjudication. The fact that according to section 38(1)(d) of the Law \u201c... income which accrues from the imposition of administrative fines on the stations ...\u201d is deposited with the Authority is not, in our view, inconsistent with impartiality. No private or personal financial interest is involved. The Authority, as a legal person under public law, acts impersonally to further the purposes of the Law. According to the same provision, other income also is deposited with the Authority, including fees from the grant of licences, the examination of applications, etc., as well as the State grant, which, in any event, ensures the financial sufficiency of the Authority so that it may carry out its work of particular significance in contemporary society.",

Article 6 (1) of the European Convention refers to a procedure before a court. What is needed in cases where decisions determining civil rights and obligations are issued by administrative organs is the possibility of access to a court to challenge the administrative decision: see Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium Series A Vol. 58 (1983). Where such possibility is offered, then the extent of the jurisdiction of the Court acquires significance. In cases concerning decisions by professional disciplinary bodies the ECHR has considered full jurisdiction of the  indispensable in relation to both factual and legal matters. Certain decisions of state administrative organs were approached in the same manner later, whereas in other decisions which, as it was held, belonged to a domain where the need for recognition of the state authority in the determination of policy ought to prevail, it was decided that judicial review was sufficient. Harris, O\u2019Boyle and Warbrick deal with this aspect in their work \u201cLaw of the European Convention on Human Rights\u201d (1995) page 194.

Because even if it is identified with the criminal meaning of Article 12 or the quasi-criminal meaning of Articles 150 and 162, the sanctions which are provided for by the Law and Regulations in question are related not to the possibility of penalties provided for in paragraph 3 but to non-compliance with the provisions of the Law and the Regulations, which constitute the basis for the issue of the broadcasting licence.

Paragraph 1 of Article 146 sets out four grounds upon which annulment is justified: (i)\u00a0\u00a0failure to comply with the Constitution, (ii)\u00a0\u00a0failure to comply with the Law, (iii)\u00a0\u00a0acting in excess of or (iv)\u00a0\u00a0abuse of powers. Challenges for annulment under the first three headings include, inter alia, lack of competence or jurisdiction, errors or misconception of law or fact, lack of proper enquiry \u2013 that is, failure to ascertain the facts properly \u2013, lack of due reasoning and failure to comply with the rules of natural justice and good administration. Challenges under the fourth head include the use of legal power to achieve a purpose not contemplated by the law. Should the recourse succeed, the power of the Supreme Court is confined to declaring an act or decision null or void, or, in the case of an omission, that it ought not to have occurred, so that what had not been done should now be done (Article 146.4). The Supreme Court will not go into the merits of the decision and substitute the decision of the administrative authority or organ concerned with its own decision; it will not decide the matter afresh. If the Supreme Court annuls the act or decision in question, the matter is automatically remitted to the appropriate administrative authority or organ for re-examination (see, amongst numerous authorities, Papakyriakou v.\u00a0the\u00a0Public Service Commision, (1999) 3 C.L.R 720; Yiannis Koursaros v.\u00a0the Cyprus Ports Authority (1999) 3 CLR 345; Vrahimis Hatzihannas v. the Republic (1999) 3 CLR 216; Andreas Kamenos v. the Republic (1998) 3\u00a0C.L.R. 25; Stavros Loizides v. the Minister of Foreign Affairs (1995) 3\u00a0CLR 233; Eleourghia Pettemeridi Ltd\u00a0v. the Republic (1994) 3 C.L.R.199; the Republic v.

The Law incorporates basic provisions of the European Directive of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by Law, Regulation or Administrative Action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities, as amended by Directive 97/36 EC of 30 June 1997. These provisions concern procedures and criteria for, inter alia, granting broadcasting licences, protecting minors and restricting the duration and content of advertisements, telemarketing and sponsorship. Prior to the amendment of the Law in April 2004 by Amending Law 97(I)/2004 of 30 April 2004, Law 7(I)/1998 applied only to commercial/private broadcasting and not to the public service broadcaster CyBC. A dual public/private broadcasting system therefore existed before this amendment. The provisions were also limited to broadcasters licensed by the CRTA.",

The Government first pointed out that the applicant had not brought a recourse against the decision in case no. 88/2000(3), on the basis of which the fine sought to be recovered in the civil proceedings was imposed. Secondly, although the applicant had brought a recourse against the decision in case no. 75/2000(3), this had been dismissed by the Supreme Court for failure on the part of the applicant to file written submissions. No attempt had been made by the applicant to have the above recourse reinstated. Instead, the applicant had tried to challenge the above decisions in the context of its defence in the civil proceedings brought against it by the CRTA for the payment of the fines. In such proceedings, however, grounds pertaining to the legality of an administrative decision, including issues as to the proportionality of the fine imposed by such a decision, could not be put forward as a defence to the debt claim and could not be examined by the civil courts, as they were matters that fell within the revisional jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The Government underlined that decisions of administrative authorities giving rise to rights and obligations were considered to be legal and enforceable unless and until they were declared null and void by the Supreme Court in a recourse brought under Article 146.",

The rule is based on the assumption that the domestic system provides an effective remedy in respect of the alleged breach. While in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism, it does not require merely that applications should be made to the appropriate domestic courts and that use should be made of remedies designed to challenge impugned decisions which allegedly violate a Convention right. It normally requires also that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at the international level should have been aired before those same courts, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see, among many other authorities, Fressoz and Roire v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 29183/95, \u00a7 37, ECHR 1999I).",

As the Government point out, however, the applicant failed to use this remedy. The applicant relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 24 February 2003 as a ground for absolving it from doing so. The Court firstly, notes that the two decisions of the CRTA were taken in November 2000, that is, more than two years before the Supreme Court gave its judgment in the joint recourses. Secondly, the CRTA decisions constitute separate executory administrative acts which do not necessarily give rise to the same grounds for annulment. It cannot be said therefore that the applicant would have been unsuccessful if he had brought recourses against these decisions and that the Supreme Court would have found, in its examination of the legality of the relevant decisions, that annulment was not justified on any ground. In this respect the Court notes in particular that the applicant was successful in two of the twenty-six recourses he had brought. In so far as the applicant can be taken to claim that he had exhausted domestic remedies as he had aired his complaints concerning the CRTA decisions in the civil proceedings brought against him, the Court notes that the civil courts did not have the competence to examine matters which fell within the exclusive revisional jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.",

Thirdly, the aim of the Law and, by analogy, of the fines was to ensure that the interests of viewers and listeners were safeguarded and to discourage non-compliance; its aim was not to collect funds and to punish stations who failed to comply. The situation was therefore not akin to that in the Jussila case (cited above). Furthermore, the administrative procedure was distinguishable from the criminal procedure set out in section 48 of the Law. Fines imposed under the administrative procedure were viewed as debts and could only be recovered through civil proceedings.",

Unlike in Tsfayo, the applicant had not submitted any evidence showing a lack of impartiality on the part of the CRTA. In this connection, the Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning the alleged financial interest of the CRTA in imposing fines were flawed. They noted that the members of the CRTA, including the President and Vice President, did not receive a fixed salary and were not engaged on a full time basis. All the members received an amount as compensation for attending meetings, plus travel expenses. This was the usual practice in  with members of public benefit bodies and organisations. In addition the President of the CRTA received an additional annual amount as compensation and/or reimbursement for attendance costs.",

The sums received went into a separate fund and could be used by the CRTA to pay its operational costs. The Government referred to sections\u00a024 and 38 of the Law and Regulation 5. It could not therefore be said that the CRTA was dependent on administrative fines to cover its operating costs, including salaries and compensation paid for attending meetings. The Government considered that the figures the applicant relied on concerning fines, licence fees and operational costs were irrelevant as they concerned a different period in time.",

In this regard the Government submitted that the general principles of administrative law developed in civil law jurisdictions by, for example, the French Conseil d\u2019Etat, the Greek Council of State and the German constitutional and administrative courts, were applicable to judicial review proceedings under Article 146, and that the grounds of invalidity set out in that provision were broadly interpreted. For example, the Supreme Court would declare a decision to be null and void, where, inter alia, it lacked adequate reasoning, where it was based on a misconception of the facts or a mistake of law, or where there had been a breach of natural justice or a breach of the principle of proportionality. A misconception of the facts would be found to exist in a number of situations, including where the administration had failed to take into account material facts or had taken irrelevant facts into consideration. In support of its submissions the Government relied on a number of Supreme Court judgments (Yiallourides v. the Republic (1969) 3 CLR 379); Kontos v. the Republic (1974) 3 CLR 112; Constantinou v. the Republic (1966) 3 CLR 793; Christides v. the Republic (1966) 3 CLR 732; Hadjisavva v. the Republic (1972) 3 CLR 174; Meletiou v. the Republic (1969) 3 CLR 578; Thalassinos v. the Republic (1974) 3 CLR 290).",

That the Supreme Court had made detailed reference to one particular case was due to the fact that the parties, having agreed with the court, put forward their arguments with reference to that case.

The arguments put forward by the applicant in its attempt to show that the Supreme Court lacked full jurisdiction did not concern facts or the credibility of evidence before the CRTA but rather the conclusions of the CRTA as to, for example, whether a particular broadcast was unsuitable for children or did not respect the private life or reputation of others. The Government also pointed out that the applicant had not raised in its recourses before the Supreme Court as a ground for annulment of the CRTA\u2019s decisions issues pertaining to the necessity of the imposition of the fines or their proportionality. In this respect they submitted that the applicant\u2019s claim that the Supreme Court could not examine such arguments in its judicial review capacity was unfounded. The Government relied on a number of judgments of the Supreme Court, mainly concerning the imposition of fines by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cCySec\u201d), in which the court examined allegations concerning, inter alia, the amount and proportionality of the fines and the reasoning justifying their imposition (Cyprus Stock Exchange v.

According to the domestic court\u2019s case-law, pronouncement on a legal issue should not disqualify a judge from entertaining the same legal question in a subsequent case, whether between the same parties or other parties. A judge\u2019s role was to solve legal and factual points that arose in each case on the basis of the Constitution and the law. A previous decision or opinion by a judge on a specific matter did not necessarily prejudge his or her opinion on constitutional and legal issues.

In relation to the above, the applicant submitted that there was an overriding need to allow the broadcast in question. The applicant underlined, inter alia, the importance of informing the Cypriot public of significant issues affecting Cypriot society, such as drug abuse [CRTA case no. 11/2001(3)] or the possible committing of an offence, such as paedophilia [CRTA case no. 75/2000(3)]. In so far as advertising was concerned, the applicant highlighted the need to take into account the various economic interests involved and the fact that advertising was its only source of income. In this connection, it noted that it should be possible to transmit advertisements of children\u2019s toys at times when children were watching television. The applicant also pointed out that in certain television series the use of certain products was essential to the set and contributed to a series\u2019 success.",

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Whilst certainty in the law is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Rekv\u00e9nyi v.

The Court\u2019s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation.

The remarks in question were made in the context of a dialogue between characters of that series who suggested, inter alia, that in the old days it was possible that the town of Paphos had a lot of brothels, that during the 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s and part of the 70\u2019s most of the whores were from that town, that Limassol had been full of Arabs, most of them darker than chocolate and some of them very snobbish, and that Paphos was a whores\u2019 town, with thousands of whores, all of them imported from Greece at the time, just as Russian women were imported nowadays.",

In this connection, the Court also attaches importance to the fact that the applicant did not make any submissions at all in the proceedings before the CRTA in the case (see point 26 of the Annex) and that it did not submit observations before the Court disputing the necessity of the interference with its right to freedom of expression in so far as this programme was specifically concerned.",
