The applicant wrote a statement that he was willing to submit to medical examinations and treatment, on condition that he was admitted to the tuberculosis hospital of facility no. 1 for examinations by independent medical specialists invited by his relatives.

In particular, section III of the Regulation sets out the procedure for initial steps to be taken by medical personnel of a detention facility on admission of a detainee. On arrival at a temporary detention facility all detainees must be subjected to preliminary medical examination before they are placed in cells shared by other inmates.

Particular attention must be paid to individuals suffering from contagious conditions. No later than three days after the detainee\u2019s arrival at the detention facility, he should receive an in-depth medical examination, including fluorography. During the in-depth examination a prison doctor should record the detainee\u2019s complaints, study his medical and personal history, record injuries if present, and recent tattoos, and schedule additional medical procedures if necessary.

Primarily restating the European Prison Rules and CPT standards, the Recommendation went beyond reiteration of the principles in some aspects to include more specific discussion of the management of certain common problems including transmissible diseases. In particular, in respect of cases of tuberculosis, the Committee of Ministers stressed that all necessary measures should be applied to prevent the propagation of this infection, in accordance with relevant legislation in this area. Therapeutic intervention should be of a standard equal to that outside prison. The medical services of the local chest physician should be requested in order to obtain the long-term advice that is required for this condition, as is practised in the community, in accordance with relevant legislation (Section 41).",

This was due to a combination of factors, including: (i) increased poverty, (ii) under-funding of TB services and health services in general, (iii) diagnostic and therapeutic approaches that were designed for a centralized command-and-control TB system, but were unable to cope with the social mobility and relative freedom of the post-Soviet era, and (iv) technical inadequacies and outdated equipment. Migration of populations from ex-Soviet republics with high TB burdens also increased the problem. Prevalence rates were many times higher in the prison system than in the general population. Treatment included lengthy hospitalizations, variations among clinicians and patients in the therapeutic regimen, and frequent recourse to surgery. A shrinking health budget resulted in an erratic supply of anti-TB drugs and laboratory supplies, reduced quality control in TB dispensaries and laboratories, and inadequate treatment. The social conditions favouring the spread of TB, combined with inadequate systems for diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance, as well as increased drug resistance, produced a serious public health problem.",

They reasoned that according to medical specialists and research, the majority of the Russian adult population and, consequently, the majority of individuals entering the Russian prison system, are already infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis (\u201cMBT\u201d). They cited statistical data, arguing that out of 100,000 persons infected with the bacteria only eighty-nine will develop an active form of the illness. The Government stressed that detection of dormant MBT cannot be made through ordinary radiological methods of screening and a period of several years may pass between the date when a person contracts the illness and the date when the illness fully develops. They drew the Court\u2019s attention to the fact that modern science did not clearly identify the factors which led to the reactivation of the tuberculosis process. It is, however, established that persons with a weak immune system are prone to the infection. Hereditary factors should also be taken into account. The Government disputed the possibility of detaining individuals suffering from contagious forms of tuberculosis alongside healthy inmates in Russian detention facilities. They accepted that in September 2000 during detention in the correctional colony the applicant had shared a cell with a person suffering from a non-contagious form of tuberculosis. Therefore, the applicant\u2019s contact with that person could not have been a factor in the development of the illness.",

A serious deterioration of his health in March 2004 resulting in his suffering a spontaneous pneumothorax had been a firm evidence of inadequate quality of the medical services. The applicant further disputed the Government\u2019s assertion that he had refused to cooperate with the authorities. He explained that his refusals to submit to medical observations and testing in the correctional colony had pursued the single purpose of forcing the colony administration to transfer him to a \u201cproper\u201d medical establishment.

Moldova, no.\u00a030649/05, \u00a7\u00a0121, 7\u00a0November\u00a02006), and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at curing the detainee\u2019s health problems or preventing their aggravation (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0109, 114; Sarban v. Moldova, no.\u00a03456/05, \u00a7\u00a079, 4 October 2005; and Popov v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0211). However, the Court has also held that Article 3 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as securing for every detained person medical assistance at the same level as \u201cin the best civilian clinics\u201d (see Mirilashivili v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a06293/04, 10\u00a0July 2007). In another case the Court went further, holding that it was \u201cprepared to accept that in principle the resources of medical facilities within the penitentiary system are limited compared to those of civil clinics\u201d (see Grishin v. Russia, no.\u00a030983/02, \u00a7\u00a076, 15\u00a0November 2007).",

In fact, the medical certificates submitted by the parties show that he had no history of tuberculosis before his placement in detention facility no.\u00a01 in Oryol. Likewise, no symptoms of tuberculosis were discovered in the period from 25 February 1997, when the applicant underwent his first fluorography exam in detention, to 30\u00a0October 2001, when the disease was diagnosed.

At the same time, for the Government to effectively argue that the applicant was infected with Koch\u2019s bacillus even before his arrest, it would have been necessary for the authorities to perform on the applicant, upon his admission to the detention facility and in addition to a fluorography examination, the Mantoux test or a special tuberculosis blood test which would have indicated the presence of the latent infection. However, as follows from the parties\u2019 submissions, apart from fluorography examinations, the Russian penitentiary institutions did not employ any other methods to check for TB at the moment of detainees\u2019 admission to detention facilities. It is therefore possible to conclude that the applicant was never exposed to the infection prior to his arrest and that he only contracted tuberculosis in detention, particularly taking into account that in October 1998 he had been placed in a cell with an individual suffering from the contagious form of tuberculosis (see paragraph 10 above). In this respect, the Court attributes particular weight to the conclusion recorded in the applicant\u2019s medical history and finding the roots of the applicant\u2019s tuberculosis in his detention with the sick inmate (ibid). The Court also does not lose sight of the statistical estimations that place Russia among one of the twenty-two highest-burden countries for tuberculosis in the world, recording a drastic increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in the 1990s, with some reports indicating that TB is many times more prevalent in Russian prisons than in civilian life (see paragraph 49 above). With all these considerations in mind and also adding to them the fact that the first eight fluorography tests performed between the applicant\u2019s arrest and October 2001 showed no pathology in the applicant\u2019s lungs, the Court considers it most probable that the applicant contracted tuberculosis in detention facility no. 1 (see Staykov v. , no. 49438/99, \u00a7 81, 12 October 2006; Yakovenko v. Ukraine, no. 15825/06, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 95, 25 October 2007; Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 111; and Ghavtadz, v. Georgia, no.\u00a023204/07, \u00a7 86, 3 March 2009). In these circumstances, the Court does not consider it necessary to establish the veracity of the applicant\u2019s argument regarding another alleged instance of his detention with an inmate with TB in September 2000 (see paragraph 11 above).",

Estonia, no. 64812/01, \u00a7 54, 8 November 2005, and Pitalev v. Russia, no.\u00a034393/03, \u00a7\u00a053, 30 July 2009, with further references). However, the State does have a responsibility to ensure treatment for prisoners in its charge, and a lack of adequate medical assistance for serious health problems not suffered from prior to detention may amount to a violation of Article 3 (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7 108 et seq.). Absent or inadequate treatment for tuberculosis, particularly when the disease has been contracted in detention, is most certainly a subject of the Court\u2019s concern. It is therefore bound to assess the quality of medical services the applicant was provided with in the present case and to determine whether he was deprived of adequate medical assistance as he claims, and if so whether this amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see Sarban v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 3456/05, \u00a7 78, 4\u00a0October 2005).",

Given the fact that the applicant did not dispute his refusal to follow medical recommendations of the detention authorities, albeit for quite different reasons than those implied by the Government, the Court will assess the quality of the medical care during the two periods of the applicant\u2019s detention, accepting September 2004 as the dividing point.",

In this connection, while observing no entries in the applicant\u2019s medical history recording health complaints before the discovery of the disease in October 2001, the Court still finds strong evidence before it in support of the applicant\u2019s claims as to the belated screening of the illness. In particular, it does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that almost a year passed between the chest fluorography examinations in 2000 and 2001 (see paragraph 9 above). The Court is troubled by that delay, given the fact that at the time the applicant was, most probably, a carrier of the latent tuberculosis infection following his detention alongside an inmate ill with active tuberculosis, he was in detention, a recognised setting for the transmission and development of tuberculosis (see Ghavtadze, cited above, \u00a7 86, and, most recently, Pakhomov v. , no. 44917/08, 30 September 2009, \u00a7 64), and there is no indication that following his contact with the inmate who was ill the applicant received the full course of preventive treatment to reduce the risk of the latent infection progressing to active TB later in his life. The Court believes that in these circumstances the Russian authorities were under an obligation to closely monitor the applicant\u2019s health to be able to respond promptly to any reactivation of the latent infection, an obligation which they failed to comply with.",

The Government did not provide any explanation for the delay, nor did it indicate whether the authorities had ever considered that the delay in the applicant\u2019s admission to the hospital could have worsened his untreated condition, as well as made him a source of a secondary spread of infection throughout the prison population and facility staff, should the applicant turn out to be sputum smear positive. Noting that delayed treatment is particularly detrimental to patients suffering from tuberculosis, the Court also finds it striking that it was not until 17\u00a0December 2001 that the applicant started receiving antibacterial treatment (see paragraph 13 above). While acknowledging the necessity to perform clinical tests for proper diagnosis, case definition and choice of standard treatment regimen, the Court is concerned that the testing delayed the initiation of the applicant\u2019s treatment.

In particular, the evidence placed before the Court shows that, having been placed on a strict medication regime necessary for the tuberculosis therapy when the initial stage of the treatment was followed by the continuation stage, as recommended by the WHO, the applicant received a number of anti-tuberculosis medicines and concomitant antihistamine drugs, which were administered to him in the requisite dosage, at the right intervals and for the appropriate duration.

The applicant was released from the hospital to correctional colony no. 2 with a recommendation to continue treatment on an HE regimen. The medical records indicate that the applicant had been attended to a number of times throughout his detention in the colony in 2002 and 2003 and had been prescribed tests and medication. However, the same records show that the applicant\u2019s treatment in the colony was unregulated and erratic. In particular, there is no evidence that the hospital\u2019s recommendation to continue treatment with isoniazid and ethmbutol was followed through. In fact, it was not until March 2003 that the applicant finally gained access to treatment with anti-bacteriological drugs (see paragraph 17 above). It also does not appear that the applicant was attended by doctors on a regular or systematic basis. The Court is mindful that the first examination of the applicant was performed by the colony doctor on 9\u00a0October 2002, more than three months after the applicant\u2019s return to the correctional colony. It also does not lose sight of the fact that the colony authorities regularly delayed quarterly X-ray examination and clinical testing of the applicant. Given that the above tests and examinations were essential for effective monitoring of the applicant\u2019s condition and timely diagnosis of possible reappearance of symptoms of TB, it is regrettable that they were performed haphazardly. In addition, the Court notes the authorities\u2019 inert response to the applicant\u2019s health complaints in January 2003 and discovery of certain changes in his left lung during an X-ray examination not long after the complaints had been raised. In the light of these considerations the Court does not deem such medical attention to be adequate and reasonable, given the condition from which the applicant was suffering (see, for similar reasoning, Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 114-115).",

It appears that the authorities took care to evaluate the refusals and considered individually each refusal of treatment on the applicant\u2019s part to determine a proper response and, if possible, to adjust to the applicant\u2019s demands. They offered him psychological support and attention, having provided clear and complete explanations of medical procedures, the sought outcome of the treatment and negative side effects of irregular medication (see, by contrast, Gorodnitchev, cited above, \u00a7 91; Testa v.

The discussions, as well as any limits or conditions that the applicant set on a refusal, were clearly documented in his medical records. Despite the applicant\u2019s consistent and occasionally aggressive refusals to comply with medical recommendations, the authorities did not interpret such behaviour as firm and complete refusal of other medical interventions, and did not abandon their attempts to comply with the schedule of medical procedures and treatment, even inviting representatives of the supervising State body and human rights organisations in an attempt to persuade the applicant not to refuse medical care (see paragraphs 22 and 26 above). The authorities\u2019 openness to dialogue with the applicant is also confirmed by their offers to the applicant of alternative medical facilities for the purpose of medical examinations.

Patients, such as the applicant, have the responsibility to communicate and cooperate with health authorities, to follow treatment and to contribute to community health. The Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant\u2019s refusals to undergo treatment or medical examinations were occasionally linked to his requests for those procedures to be performed in a particular medical establishment. In this respect, the Court would like to reiterate its constant jurisprudence according to which a State has a sufficient margin of discretion in defining the manner in which it fulfils its obligation to provide detainees with the requisite medical assistance, inter alia, by choosing an appropriate medical facility, taking into account \u201cthe practical demands of imprisonment\u201d as long as the standard of chosen care is \u201ccompatible with the human dignity\u201d of a detainee (see Aleksanyan, cited above, \u00a7 140). There is no indication in the file that the authorities\u2019 choice of medical facility for the applicant was incompatible with the required standard of care.",

In reaching this conclusion the Court also does not lose sight of the fact that the occasional medical examinations to which the applicant did consent did not reveal any deterioration of his health during the period under examination. Furthermore, the applicant, who is no longer detained, did not provide any evidence in support of his claim that his condition had worsened. Accordingly, there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the alleged failure to provide him with requisite medical care after September 2004.",
