The Court accepts the Government's argument that both courts had to deal with the increased workload and that the authorities had taken certain steps to remedy the situation. It recalls that it has recognised those factors in its previous cases in which the Government relied on similar arguments (see Kurzac v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34; Ha\u0142ka and Others v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36-37). The Court considers, however, that the remedial measures applied by the authorities were ineffective and that they did not accelerate the proceedings in the applicant's case. It reiterates that it is for the Contracting States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can guarantee to everyone the right to a final decision within a reasonable time in the determination of his civil rights and obligations (see, among other authorities, Frydlender v. France, cited above, \u00a7 45). The Court observes, therefore, that the Government have not supplied any convincing explanation for the overall length of the trial. It considers that the remedial action relied on by the Government cannot exonerate the authorities from their responsibility for the total delay in the proceedings.",
