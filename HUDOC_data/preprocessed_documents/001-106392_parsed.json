The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), \u00a7\u00a012, 26 October 1984). The Court finds that this principle also applies in the present cases, having regard to the violation found.

As to the determination of the amount due for compensation, the Court notes the considerable discrepancy between the figures advanced by the parties\u2019 experts. Therefore, in view of the information in its possession concerning immovable property prices in Bucharest, the Court holds that, should the respondent State fail to enforce the outstanding judgment, it shall pay the applicant EUR 35,000 in respect of pecuniary damage representing the loss of value of the applicant\u2019s building due to the non-enforcement of the final judgment in its favour.",
