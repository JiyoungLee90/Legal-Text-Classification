During his various visits to a neurologist the applicant made no related complaints either. The only trauma mentioned in the records is, in fact, the concussion sustained by the applicant in 1967, and it appears that the neurologist\u2019s conclusion about the post-traumatic origin of the applicant\u2019s encephalopathy related to that event.

On the other hand, the Court has consistently stressed that, to fall under Article 3, the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment (see, mutatis mutandis, Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, p. 15, \u00a7\u00a030, and Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no.\u00a0161, p. 39, \u00a7 100).

The Court, however, notes that at least one witness could observe on numerous occasions the applicant\u2019s attempts to maintain intimate hygiene, as required by his health condition. It appears from Mr Z.\u2019s statement that the applicant had to endure humiliation and pain having to perform these attempts in the sight of his cellmates, and would rather have done so privately if at all possible. It follows that whether or not there existed any partitioning of the sanitary facilities in the respective cells, the overall sanitary arrangements did not ensure sufficient privacy given the applicant\u2019s personal situation, and were inadequate in view of his health problems. In addition, it appears that when it came to using the communal showering facilities, no allowance was made for the excessive number of detainees; this further contributed to the poor standard of hygiene.",
