The lawfulness of the interception had already been examined by the prosecutor\u2019s office, which in their submission was an institution exercising a judicial function, and the admissibility of evidence obtained as a result would be examined in the criminal proceedings, where hearings were held at first and second instance.

He did not deny that there had been a statutory basis for the interference under section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities. He complained about the quality of the law and argued that it had left too much discretion for domestic authorities to choose how to apply it and that arbitrariness in its application could not be excluded. Under section 7(5) the prosecutor could merely approve the interference without examining the facts of each case. In effect, that provision allowed operational measures to be taken without prior judicial authorisation, only requiring that the prosecutor\u2019s office be informed within 24 hours. In the applicant\u2019s case, the authorisation was not sought from the judge within 72 hours, in breach of domestic law. As to the question of a legitimate aim, the applicant pointed out that the criminal proceedings had been instituted only on 30 December 2005; thus, the telephone interception could not have been carried out in connection with those proceedings. In his submission, the telephone interception under the Law on Operational Activities had been carried out in order to circumvent the regular procedure (under the Criminal Procedure Law) of obtaining prior authorisation by a judge.",

The interference had resulted from the interception of A.B.\u2019s telephone conversations, which had been authorised under section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities. In the Government\u2019s view this was sufficient to conclude that the criterion of lawfulness was met in the present case. Moreover, the lawfulness of the interception had subsequently been confirmed on several occasions by the prosecutor\u2019s office in response to the applicant\u2019s complaints (paragraphs 11-15 above). They claimed that it had also been verified by the relevant judge of the Criminal Cases Chamber of the Supreme Court (in the context of the criminal proceedings). Lastly, they referred to the findings of the Constitutional Court confirming that the said provision had been sufficiently clear and precise as to exclude arbitrariness. Namely, the said provision contained an exhaustive list of offences and the necessary precondition for its application was a situation requiring immediate action. Furthermore, the Government submitted that the interference at issue had pursued the legitimate aim of preventing crime, given that it had been carried out in the framework of criminal proceedings in connection with aggravated bribery. In response to the applicant\u2019s argument, they further reiterated that owing to the rapid development of events from 27 to 30 December 2005 no measures other than the operational interception of telecommunications would have been efficient for gathering credible information about the details of and accomplices involved in the bribery scheme.",

Indeed, as can be seen from the submissions by the KNAB before the Constitutional Court, it had been the authority\u2019s opinion that ex post facto approval was not required in all cases \u2013 namely, that it was not required if the operational measures were terminated in less than 72\u00a0hours. This argument was expressly dismissed by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 17.2 in fine of its judgment, paragraph 24 above). The Court finds that, in accordance with the relevant Latvian law, as interpreted by the Constitutional Court, the ex post facto approval by the President of the Supreme Court, or a specially authorised judge, of the operational measures was required in the circumstances of the present case, notwithstanding that the interception of the telephone conversations was terminated in less than 72 hours. This conclusion is not altered by the fact that the lawfulness of these measures was confirmed by various prosecutors. Their conclusions were limited to section 35(1) of the Law on Operational Activities (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above) and, in any event, their review was carried out before the Constitutional Court adopted its judgment in the present case providing for an authoritative interpretation of section 7(5) of that Law.

In Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev the Court reiterated that in the context of secret surveillance an effective remedy under Article 13 meant a remedy that was as effective as it could be having regard to the restricted scope for recourse inherent in such a system. In that case the Court verified whether there existed under Bulgarian law remedies which were effective in this limited sense. The Court noted that review of surveillance might intervene at three stages: when it was first ordered, while it was being carried out, or after it had been terminated (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099).",
