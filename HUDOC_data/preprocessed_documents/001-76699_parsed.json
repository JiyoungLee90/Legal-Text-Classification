However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that it took the court of first instance approximately twentynine years - fourteen years and six months of which fall within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction ratione temporis - to give a judgment on the merits. Admittedly, the Court notes that the proceedings were prolonged due to a number of adjournments in particular for onsite inspections either due to adverse weather conditions or the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to attend them, the death of some of the plaintiffs and collecting evidence from various authorities. However, reiterating that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of the requirements of that provision, including the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see\u00a0Arvelakis v. Greece, no.\u00a041354/98, \u00a7 26, 12\u00a0April 2001), the Court considers that the domestic court could have applied stricter measures to speed up the proceedings. Neither the complexity of the case nor the conduct of the plaintiffs is sufficient to explain the delay in which the case was processed by the firstinstance court. Therefore, the Court considers the delay must be considered to be attributable to the domestic court\u2019s handling of the proceedings.",
