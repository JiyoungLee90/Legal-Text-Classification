The court found that the land at issue had indeed been owned by their predecessors, notably their father, grandfather and grand-grandfather, but that they had not proved that they had inherited it when their last predecessor had died in 1997. Notably, the court considered that the land at issue was in the coastal zone and thus State property pursuant to section 4 of the Coastal Zone Act of 1992 and \u201csection\u00a013 and other sections\u201d of the State Property Act (see paragraphs 21 and 24 below), and that the claimants could not claim the right to property in respect of such land. The court made no reference to section 30 of the Coastal Zone Act (see paragraph 22 below). As regards the State\u2019s submission that the land had been nationalised, the court noted that the contents of the decisions relied on by the State could not be clarified.

It also found that the conditions under which the coastal zone can be privately owned are not provided for by law (nisu zakonom odre\u0111eni), \u201cwhich leaves open numerous questions on practical implementation\u201d.

The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision. It is moreover necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant may bring before the courts and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments. That is why the question whether a court has failed to fulfill the obligation to state reasons, deriving from Article 6, can only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case. If, however, a submission would, if accepted, be decisive for the outcome of the case, it may require a specific and express reply by the court in its judgment (see Hiro Balani v.\u00a0Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 27-28, Series A no. 303B, and Ruiz Torija v.\u00a0Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30, Series A no. 303A).",

However, as was duly explained by the Court of First Instance (see paragraph 9 above), the applicants\u2019 last predecessor was not registered as the owner of the property at issue at the time of his death in 1997. The Court further notes that during the proceedings the applicants explicitly referred to the different status of the adjacent plot of land. They argued that it would be arbitrary to reject their claim, and that the existence of different statuses would lead to legal uncertainty. Before the Court they argued that the domestic courts did not reply to this specific argument. The Court notes, however, that the Court of First Instance made a reference to the applicants\u2019 submission by considering that the Real Estate Administration decision of 2 March 2010 was of no particular influence because it did not relate to the land which was the subject of the examination in the domestic proceedings (ibid.). The High Court, while not referring to the decision of 2 March 2010 or to the status of the adjacent plot of land, explained why the applicants could not claim ownership over the land at issue. It specified that, assuming that they had had ownership, they had in any event lost it in accordance with the Coastal Zone Act 1992 and the State Property Act 2009 (see paragraph 11 above). Insofar as the High Court referred to the Coastal Zone Act 1992, its reasoning was thus based on the legal framework in force before the death of the applicants\u2019 predecessor in 1997. For its part, the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of the High Court, clarifying that it was indeed pursuant to the Coastal Zone Act 1992 that the coast could not be the object of private property. It accepted that private property in the coastal zone was possible under the Property Act 2009, but only if the property right was granted after the entry into force of that Act, which was not the applicants\u2019 case (see paragraph 12 above).",

In other words, the Court considers that the domestic courts provided in their judgments specific and explicit reasons for the dismissal of the applicants\u2019 claim, which rendered irrelevant the latter\u2019s argument based on the status of an adjacent plot. There has accordingly been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
