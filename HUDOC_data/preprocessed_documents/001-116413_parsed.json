The proposal also stated that in 2002 the first applicant had organised a drug trafficking channel from Brazil through western Europe to . It referred to the interception at Sofia Airport on 12 September 2002 of a shipment which originated from , was addressed to the applicant, and contained 8.64 kilograms of almost one hundred per cent pure cocaine. A criminal investigation had been opened into this matter. The proposal went on to say that, having failed to complete that transaction, the first applicant had \u201cnot given up his attempts to find a quick way of making money\u201d. There existed operative information that in 2005 he had tried to organise the shipment of 300\u00a0kilograms of cocaine from Brazil to the .

Also, there existed operative information that on 11 September 2004 he had tried to convince several persons to kill a person residing in . He also maintained regular contacts with persons abroad who were privy to his criminal activities. Lastly, there existed information that on 2 December 2005 he had telephoned the United States embassy in , making false assertions that a terrorist act had been planned against it, and had given details implicating a cousin of his, in order to frame him and thus exact revenge for the refusal of his cousin\u2019s father to lend him money.

It held that the order had been issued by a competent authority and in due form. There had not been any material breaches of the rules of administrative procedure. It was true that the authorities had not notified the first applicant of the proceedings against him and had not given him an opportunity to make objections and representations. However, that omission had not been material, because the first applicant had had the opportunity of putting forward his arguments against expulsion in the judicial review proceedings. The fact that the expulsion order had been served on him without an interpreter was not a problem either, because there existed evidence that he understood and spoke Bulgarian. The court went on to say that on the basis of the materials adduced in the proceedings, which had in effect not been disputed by the first applicant, it considered it established that in 2002 he had taken part in the organisation of a drug trafficking channel from Brazil through western Europe to Bulgaria, and in 2005 a drug trafficking channel from Brazil to the Netherlands; that he was an active member of an international gang engaging in the forgery of securities and financial frauds; that he maintained intensive contacts with persons in and out of the country who carried out criminal and terrorist activities; and that he had given the Embassy of the United States of America in the Hague false information that others would try to organise a terrorist act against it. In those circumstances, the authorities\u2019 conclusion that the first applicant\u2019s continued presence in  would pose a threat to national security was correct. His arguments that he had not been convicted of criminal offences were irrelevant, because the measure taken against him was preventive. It was admissible to resort to such a measure if there existed enough information that he might carry out a serious offence. Moreover, there existed information that he had already committed narcotic drugs offences and that he was a member of an international criminal organisation. The arguments that the expulsion order fell foul of the Convention and the 1951 Refugee Convention because it was inadmissible to expel the first applicant to a country where his life and health might be at risk and because the expulsion would separate him from his family were likewise unavailing. The expulsion had been lawfully ordered, and the first applicant had been able to challenge it before an independent and impartial court. The expulsion order did not specify the country to which the first applicant should be removed, and the law did not require that it should spell that out. The arguments on that point were therefore irrelevant.",

It ruled that those provisions had to be interpreted as meaning that the maximum duration of detention laid down in them had to include a period of detention completed in connection with a removal procedure commenced before the rules in the Directive became applicable, and also as meaning that the period during which enforcement of a deportation order had been suspended because the person concerned had challenged it by way of judicial review was to be taken into account in calculating the period of detention for the purpose of removal, where the person concerned remained in detention during that procedure. The court also ruled that Article 15 \u00a7 4 of the Directive had to be interpreted as meaning that only a real prospect that removal could be carried out successfully, having regard to the periods laid down in Article\u00a015 \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 6, corresponded to a reasonable prospect of removal, and that such a reasonable prospect did not exist where it appeared unlikely that the person concerned would be admitted to a third country, having regard to those periods.",

Section 44(6) of the Aliens Act 1998 allowed, under certain conditions, the detention of aliens with a view to their expulsion, and the issuing of the expulsion order had automatically stripped the first applicant of his refugee status. The duration of his detention had not been excessive or in breach of the timelimits laid down in European Union law and transposed in Bulgarian law. He had been released on 1 February 2010, which meant that the timelimit under section 44(8) of the above Act had been complied with.

It is therefore immaterial whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national or Convention law (see Chahal, cited above, \u00a7 112; Slivenko v. Latvia [GC], no. 48321/99, \u00a7 146, ECHR 2003X; Sadaykov v. Bulgaria, no. 75157/01, \u00a7 21, 22 May 2008; and Raza v. Bulgaria, no. 31465/08, \u00a7 72, 11 February 2010). Any deprivation of liberty under the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) will be justified, however, only for as long as deportation or extradition proceedings are in progress. If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under that provision (see, among other authorities, Chahal, cited above, \u00a7 113; A. and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 164; Mikolenko v. Estonia, no.\u00a010664/05, \u00a7 63, 8 October 2009; and Raza, cited above, \u00a7 72). In other words, the length of the detention should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 74 in fine). Indeed, a similar point was recently made by the ECJ in relation to Article\u00a015 of Directive 2008/115/EC (see paragraphs 55 and 58 above). It should, however, be pointed out that unlike that provision, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention does not lay down maximum timelimits; the question whether the length of deportation proceedings could affect the lawfulness of detention under this provision thus depends solely on the particular circumstances of each case (see Auad v. Bulgaria, no. 46390/10, \u00a7 128, 11\u00a0October 2011).",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down, as a minimum, the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of that law (see, among other authorities, Amuur v.

However, when he was redetained on 31 July 2008, in three separate decisions the Sofia City Administrative Court refused to examine his legal challenge against the order for his redetention, holding \u2013 apparently on the basis of the then prevailing caselaw of the Supreme Administrative Court \u2013 that the order, being subordinate to the expulsion order and issued within the framework of the expulsion proceedings, was not subject to judicial review (see paragraphs 25 and 49 above). On appeal, two panels of the  upheld two of the lower court\u2019s rulings, but another panel overturned the third one and remitted the case for examination on the merits (see paragraphs 26 and 29 above). On remittal, the  examined the case on the merits, in a judgment given almost seven months after the first applicant had sought judicial review of the order for his detention (see paragraph 27 above). That judgment was in turn upheld by the  in a final judgment given one year and almost four months after the first applicant had sought judicial review of the order for his detention (see paragraph 28 above). Thus, unlike Mr\u00a0Raza, the first applicant in the present case was ultimately able to obtain judicial review of the order for his detention (contrast Raza, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077). However, the Court is unable to find that the proceedings in which that happened complied with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, because the amount of time taken by the national courts finally to determine the legal challenge to the detention order cannot be regarded as complying with the requirement of that provision that the decision be taken \u201cspeedily\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, Rahmani and Dineva v. Bulgaria, no. 20116/08, \u00a7 80, 10\u00a0May 2012).",

On this point, the Court observes that, although that possibility was not expressly envisaged by the Aliens Act 1998 or another instrument, it appears that as a matter of practice the first applicant could at any point during his detention \u2013 even before the enactment of the new section 46a of the Act \u2013 seek release from the authorities and, in case of a negative reply or lack of reply, apply for judicial review (see Raza, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 28, and Rahmani and Dineva, \u00a7 79, both cited above, as well as the two Supreme Administrative Court decisions cited in paragraph 52 above). However, it cannot be overlooked that in both Raza and Rahmani and Dineva it took the administrative courts about a year finally to determine such legal challenges, and that those courts did not directly order the applicants\u2019 release but only declared their detention unlawful and referred the cases back to the authorities with instructions to rule on the applicants\u2019 request for release. In both cases the Court found the duration of the proceedings in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4. In Rahmani and Dineva (cited above, \u00a7 80), it went on to say that the failure of the courts directly to order release could not be regarded as compliant with Article 5 \u00a7 4, because that provision requires a remedy in which the decisionmaking body has the power to release the detainee. There is nothing to indicate that if the first applicant in the present case had opted for that procedural avenue, his legal challenge would have been examined in a different way.",

Since the domestic proceedings were classified in their entirety, the Court has no information on the exact nature of the materials placed before that court (see, mutatis mutandis, Liu\u00a0v.\u00a0 (no. 2), no. 29157/09, \u00a7 90, 26 July 2011). However, a reading of its judgment of 2 June 2008 shows that it did not make any reference to the evidentiary basis for its findings of fact (see paragraph 21 above). In those circumstances, and bearing in mind that in a number of previous similar cases that court failed effectively to scrutinise allegations that an alien represented a national security risk (see C.G. and Others v.

In addition, some of those allegations \u2013 such as those that the first applicant was an active member of an international gang engaging in the forgery of securities and financial frauds, and that he maintained intensive contacts with persons in and outside the country who carried out criminal and terrorist activities \u2013 appear too general to have given him an opportunity effectively to challenge them (see Liu (no. 2), \u00a7\u00a7 9091, and, mutatis\u00a0mutandis, A. and Others v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7\u00a7 22024, both cited above).

The Court has already had occasion to observe that other countries have, in the same context, chosen to keep secret only those parts of their courts\u2019 decisions whose disclosure would compromise national security or the safety of others, thus illustrating that there exist techniques that can accommodate legitimate security concerns without fully negating fundamental procedural guarantees such as the publicity of judicial decisions (see paragraph 95 above).",

The first applicant, who is legally represented, did not refer to any circumstance that might put his life or health at risk in . The mere fact that he was granted refugee status eleven years ago, in 2001, cannot be regarded as sufficient proof in that respect (contrast Auad v. Bulgaria, no. 46390/10, \u00a7\u00a0103, 11 October 2011, where the grant of humanitarian status had taken place less than two years before the Court\u2019s examination of the case), especially bearing in mind that the applicants did not provide any information about the reasons for which the State Refugee Agency decided to grant them refugee status (see paragraph 9 above). In Auad, decided in September 2011, the Court noted that the situation in Lebanon as a whole did not appear so serious that the potential return of a Palestinian there would constitute, in itself, a breach of Articles 2 or 3 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 103). The Court is not aware of any fresh developments that might call that assessment into question. It is true that in Auad it found that there existed a higher risk for Palestinians, such as Mr Auad, coming from, and likely to be returned to, one of the Palestinian refugee camps in , Ain alHilweh. However, the first applicant in the present case did not specify whether he came from one of the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon or from Lebanon proper, and, unlike Mr Auad (ibid.), did not point to any facts showing that he might be at risk from official or private violence in that country.",
