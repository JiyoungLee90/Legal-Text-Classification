The applicant replied that he was well and did not need anything. The Court refers to its Salduz judgment ([GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7 54-55, 27 November 2008), in which it underlined the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial. The Court further held that in order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently \u201cpractical and effective\u201d, Article 6 \u00a7 1 required, as a rule, access to a lawyer as from the first questioning of a suspect by the police, unless it were demonstrated in the particular circumstances of each case that there were compelling reasons to restrict this right. Having regard to the foregoing, and bearing in mind that the restriction imposed concerning access to a lawyer was systematic, pursuant to section 31 of Law no.\u00a03842, and applied to anyone held in police custody in connection with an offence falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts, the Court observes that although Mr Eraslan did meet his lawyer during his police custody, this meeting lasted for fifteen minutes and was in no way related to the applicant's defence rights. Furthermore, as regards the Government's contention that the remaining applicants did not ask to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer, the Court observes that the restriction imposed on the applicants' right of access to a lawyer was systematic and applied to anyone held in police custody in connection with an offence falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts.",
