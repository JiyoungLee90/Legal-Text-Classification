As to the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant had failed to bring this issue to the attention of the court hearing the case, they did not show on the basis of domestic law or practice that there was a specific procedure to be followed for a person who wished to be released from the cage, in view of the existing practice (compare \u010calovskis v. Latvia, no. 22205/13, \u00a7\u00a091, 24\u00a0July 2014). Furthermore, the Government did not dispute the fact that placing defendants in metal cages when they appeared before a court in criminal proceedings was still a general practice, as argued by the applicant (see Svinarenko and Slyadnev v. Russia [GC], nos. 32541/08 and 43441/08, \u00a7\u00a075, ECHR 2014 (extracts) regarding the use of a \u201cmetal cage\u201d in courtrooms in the member States of the Council of Europe). This is also confirmed by a copy of the photo submitted by the applicant concerning the confinement of a defendant in a metal cage during a recently held court hearing. In this context, turning to the Government\u2019s further argument that the applicant\u2019s complaint was unsubstantiated, the Court notes that there is nothing in the materials before it to support that conclusion. As the Court has previously held, in certain situations, such as in conditions-of-detention cases, the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. They are required, in particular, to collect and produce relevant documents (see Ananyev and\u00a0Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7 123, 10 January 2012). However, in the present case the Government did not produce any evidence to refute the applicant\u2019s allegation.",

The applicant was arrested during the active phase of the registration process for the referendum campaign in which he officially represented REAL, which campaigned against the draft amendments to the Constitution (compare Mammadli, cited above, \u00a7 102).

The intimidation of a campaigning member of the opposition in the run-up to the constitutional referendum had serious potential to discourage opposition supporters from participating in open political debate. At the core of the applicant\u2019s Article 18 complaint is his alleged persecution, not as a private individual, but as an opposition politician committed to playing an important public function through democratic discourse. As such, the restriction in question did not merely affect the applicant alone, or his fellow opposition activists and supporters, but the very essence of democracy as a means of organising society, in which individual freedom may only be limited in the general interest (see Navalnyy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0174).",
