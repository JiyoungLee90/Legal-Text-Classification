They lodged their application with the Court only after they had realised that the investigation had been ineffective. In addition to their references to the case of Varnava and Others v. Turkey ([GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, ECHR 2009-), the applicants also cited, amongst others, the cases of Tsechoyev v. Russia (no. 39358/05, 15\u00a0March 2011) and Amuyeva and Others v. Russia (no. 17321/06, 25\u00a0November 2010). They pointed out that even in those cases, which concerned killings, in spite of lulls in the investigations lasting several years, the applications were deemed admissible by the Court. In addition, the applicants in Petimat Magomadova (no. 36965/09), Amirova and Others (no. 4345/10) and Yusupovy (no. 33944/10) maintained that the armed conflict in Chechnya had led them to believe that delays in the investigation were inevitable. Moreover, owing to their poor command of Russian, their lack of legal knowledge and the absence of financial means to hire a lawyer, and in the absence of domestic provisions for free legal assistance to victims of enforced disappearances, they had been unable to assess the effectiveness of the investigations. The applicants in the cases of Inalova (no. 4334/10), Ismailova (no. 25515/10), Merluyev (no. 36141/10), Basnukayeva and Others (no. 66420/10) and Viskhazhiyev and Others (no. 11873/10) stated that they had initially believed that the abductions of their relatives would be investigated in a proper manner. However, with the passage of time and the lack of information from the investigating authorities, they began to doubt the effectiveness of the investigation and started looking for free legal assistance in order to assess the effectiveness of the proceedings and then, subsequently, to lodge their applications with the Court without undue delay. In this respect they referred to the case of Tashukhadzhiyev v.\u00a0Russia (no. 33251/04, 25 October 2011), in which the application was lodged with the Court eight and half years after the events in question.",

The Court reached a similar conclusion in another case where the domestic investigation into the events had been pending for more than eight years and where the applicants were doing all that could be expected of them to assist the authorities (see Bozk\u0131r and Others v.

Bearing in mind its conclusions in Varnava and Others in which the ten-year time-limit concerning the investigation into the alleged disappearances occurred in the context of an armed conflict (see Varnava, cited above, \u00a7166), the Court notes the following. The investigation into the abduction of the applicants\u2019 relatives was initiated in 2001 and in the course of the following three years the applicants gave statements to the authorities and requested assistance in the search for their missing relatives. The documents furnished by the Government reflected only the proceedings between 2001 and 2004.
