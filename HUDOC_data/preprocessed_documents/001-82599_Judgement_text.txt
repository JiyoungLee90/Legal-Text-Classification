The case originated in an application (no. 35994/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Mihai Grivneac (“the applicant”), on 12 September 2003.
The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr V. Pârlog.
The applicant complained that the failure to enforce the final judgment of 6 October 2000 in his favour had violated his right to have his civil rights determined by a court within a reasonable time, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, and his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions, as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 9 December 2004 the President of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Chisinau.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.
The applicant initiated court proceedings against a private individual. On 6 October 2000 the Centru District Court awarded him 2,000 United States Dollars (USD). No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final and enforceable fifteen days later. He obtained an enforcement warrant, which the bailiff did not enforce.
In response to a request of the Centru District Court dated 22 December 2000, the Chişinău Land Register stated that the debtor did not have any real estate registered in Chişinău.
On 14 February 2001 a bailiff established that the debtor did not live at the address indicated by the applicant and that, accordingly, it was impossible to enforce the judgment.
On 6 March 2001 the debtor's wife paid the applicant USD 1,000.
On 16 March 2001 the Centru District Court ordered the local police to determine the debtor's whereabouts. On an unknown date a copy of the decision was sent to the local police station. On 3 February 2004 the police decided to take steps to locate the debtor. According to the police, the debtor cannot be found.
The judgment of 6 October 2000 has not been enforced to date.
The relevant domestic law has been set out in Prodan v. Moldova (no. 49806/99, ECHR 2004III (extracts)).
