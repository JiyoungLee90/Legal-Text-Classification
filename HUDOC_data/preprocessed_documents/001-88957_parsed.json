It was stated, inter alia, that since during questioning the applicant had constantly increased the amount of the loss she had allegedly suffered, her statements in this respect should be treated with caution. It was established that during questioning I.B., E.R., R.Z. and V.I. had denied having burgled the applicant\u2019s property and that it was impossible, on the basis of an assessment of the evidence, to discover what had been stolen from the applicant\u2019s property, and in what circumstances. Besides, since the instigation of the criminal proceedings in 1995 no evidence had been obtained as to the persons responsible for the loss or theft of the applicant\u2019s property.

According to the Government, the mere fact that the applicant joined the criminal proceedings as a civil claimant did not create an \u201cenforceable claim\u201d which could constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01. In addition, the applicant did not have a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of obtaining effective enjoyment of a particular pecuniary asset for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01, since the admissibility and the final amount of the civil claims had not been established by the national courts either within the criminal proceedings or in separate civil proceedings. In this respect, the Government pointed out that a claim only became enforceable once a court had accepted it in whole or in part. Moreover, they stressed that the domestic courts alone were in a position to assess the value of the applicant\u2019s claim and in particular to examine why it had been increased from LVL 763 to 32,798.10 (approximately from EUR 1,090 to 46,854) during the pre-trial investigation. The Government thus submitted that the applicant\u2019s property rights had never been established by a court judgment and that her right to compensation had never become enforceable for the purposes of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 which, accordingly, was not applicable in the instant case. They therefore concluded that the applicant\u2019s complaint should be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded pursuant to Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0and\u00a04 of the Convention.

Moreover, as her property had been left without surveillance until her release, she had sustained further damage.

Belgium, judgment of 13\u00a0June 1979, , \u00a7 63, Series A no. 31). \u201cPossessions\u201d within the meaning of the above provision may be either \u201cexisting possessions\u201d or assets, including claims, in respect of which the applicant can argue that he has at least a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of obtaining effective enjoyment of a property right (see Pine Valley Developments v. Ireland, judgment of 29\u00a0November 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 222, and Kopeck\u00fd v.  [GC], no.\u00a044912/98, \u00a7\u00a035, ECHR 2004IX). The Court has held that its case-law does not contemplate the existence of a \u201cgenuine dispute\u201d or \u201can arguable claim\u201d as a criterion for determining whether there is a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d protected by Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see Kopeck\u00fd, cited above, \u00a7 52). For a claim to be capable of being considered as an \u201casset\u201d falling within scope of Article 1 Protocol No.\u00a01, it must have a sufficient basis in national law (see Draon v.

Where that has been established, the concept of \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d can come into play, which must be of a nature more concrete than a mere hope and be based on a legal provision or a legal act such as a judicial decision (see Draon, cited above, \u00a7\u00a065, and Gratzinger and Gratzingerova v. the  (dec.), no.\u00a039794/98, \u00a7\u00a073, ECHR 2002VII).",

In that respect, it observes that criminal proceedings were instigated in connection with both burglaries and that it was established in the course of the criminal proceedings that property belonging to the applicant had indeed been stolen (paragraphs 25 and 31, above). Moreover, it was not disputed by the Government that the burglaries at the applicant\u2019s properties had taken place. The Court therefore considers that there has indisputably been an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions. It is true, as the Government maintained, that the interference involved the acts of private individuals for whom the State bore no direct responsibility. Nonetheless, the Court notes that the authorities were under a specific statutory obligation to protect (nodro\u0161in\u0101t aizsardz\u012bbu) the applicant\u2019s premises during her detention, pursuant to Article\u00a080 of the Criminal Procedure Code (paragraphs 6, 11 and 44, above), and that the failure of the police to comply with that obligation was recognised at the domestic level in the imposition of disciplinary measures on the police officers involved (see paragraph 11, above). However, the Court does not find it necessary to decide whether there is a sufficiently close link between that failure and the theft of the applicant\u2019s property to engage the responsibility of the State with regard to the interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights as such.",

Furthermore, where the interference is of a criminal nature, this obligation will in addition require that the authorities conduct an effective criminal investigation and, if appropriate, prosecution (see, mutatis mutandis, M.C. v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a039272/98, \u00a7\u00a7 151-153, ECHR 2003-XII). In that respect, it is clear that the obligation, like the obligation under Articles\u00a02 and 3 of the Convention to conduct an effective investigation into loss of life or allegations of ill-treatment, is one of means and not one of result; in other words, the obligation on the authorities to investigate and prosecute such acts cannot be absolute, as it is evident that many crimes remain unresolved or unpunished notwithstanding the reasonable efforts of the State authorities. Rather, the obligation incumbent on the State is to ensure that a proper and adequate criminal investigation is carried out and that the authorities involved act in a competent and efficient manner. Moreover, the Court is sensitive to the practical difficulties which the authorities may face in investigating crime and to the need to make operational choices and prioritise the investigation of the most serious crimes. Consequently, the obligation to investigate is less exacting with regard to less serious crimes, such as those involving property, than with regard to more serious ones, such as violent crimes, and in particular those which would fall within the scope of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention. The Court thus considers that in cases involving less serious crimes the State will only fail to fulfil its positive obligation in that respect where flagrant and serious deficiencies in the criminal investigation or prosecution can be identified (cf. ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 167-168).",

Ploti\u0146a v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a016825/02, 3 June 2008). While the outcome of criminal proceedings may have a significant or even decisive effect on the prospects of a civil claim, whether lodged in the context of the criminal proceedings or brought in separate civil proceedings, the State cannot be held responsible for the lack of prospects of such a claim simply because a criminal investigation has not ultimately led to a conviction. Rather, the State will only fail to fulfil its positive obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 if the lack of prospects of success of civil proceedings is the direct consequence of exceptionally serious and flagrant deficiencies in the conduct of criminal proceedings arising out of the same set of facts, as outlined in the preceding paragraph.",

It is true that on several occasions deficiencies in the investigation of the criminal case relating to the burglary in Jelgava were acknowledged by the domestic authorities and relevant orders were given to the investigating authorities (see, in particular, paragraphs 11, 13, 15, 24 and 33 above) and that it appears that the instructions were not carried out and that the investigation was not speeded up. Moreover, in the proceedings relating to the burglary in Dobele the head prosecutor ordered a new criminal investigation six years after the initial investigation had been terminated, due to failings in the conduct of that investigation (paragraph\u00a033, above). Nevertheless, the Court cannot find that the deficiencies in the conduct of the criminal investigations were of such a nature and degree that the State can be considered to have failed to fulfil its obligation under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as far as it related to the investigation and prosecution of the crimes. In that connection, it notes in particular that the proceedings relating to the burglary in Jelgava were terminated because it had proved impossible to obtain sufficient evidence to prove charges against specific individuals, whereas in the proceedings relating to the burglary in Dobele it does not appear to have been possible to identify the perpetrators. In these circumstances, the Court does not find it established that the failure to bring the criminal proceedings to a successful conclusion was the result of flagrant and serious deficiencies in their conduct.",

The Court observes furthermore that, according to domestic law, a final decision in criminal proceedings is not necessary in order to lodge a claim for damages by way of civil proceedings (see Ploti\u0146a v. Latvia, cited above). Consequently, it was open to the applicant, if she considered that the criminal proceedings were ineffective and that her civil claims lodged in those proceedings were not being properly dealt with, to institute separate civil proceedings. In the light of its conclusion in respect of the conduct of the criminal investigations, the Court cannot find that civil proceedings would not have had any reasonable prospects of success. Indeed, it observes that while the criminal proceedings in relation to the burglary in Jelgava were terminated on account of lack of sufficient evidence for the purposes of a criminal conviction, certain suspects had been identified (albeit ten years later), while in the criminal proceedings in relation to the burglary in Dobele suspects were identified at an early stage. It is undisputed that the applicant could have brought separate civil proceedings against these suspects, in the context of which the burden of proof would have been less demanding. The Court considers that such proceedings would in principle have provided the applicant with appropriate protection of her interests. Moreover, the Court observes that it was open to the applicant at every stage of the criminal proceedings to opt for the possibility of instituting civil proceedings and that it was incumbent on her, if she considered the criminal investigations to be inadequate or deficient, to lodge civil actions against the suspects. Since the applicant failed to do so, the Court finds that it cannot be established that such proceedings did not constitute an appropriate means whereby the State could fulfil its positive obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

Those included travel expenses for her trips to Jelgava, where she had allegedly visited local authorities. The applicant submitted confirmation that she had paid for fuel and some postal expenses. The applicant also sought LVL 2,000 (approximately EUR 2,857) in respect of costs and expenses relating to her legal representation in the proceedings before the Court as well as fees for the legal advice she sought during the examination of her case by the domestic authorities. The applicant attached a copy of a contract concluded on 10 June 1997 between her and a private person, E.E., who is not a lawyer, for legal assistance in the proceedings before the domestic authorities and the Court.",
