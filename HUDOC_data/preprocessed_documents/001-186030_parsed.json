The Court does not consider it necessary to examine whether the systematic nature of the restriction on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer was, in itself, sufficient to find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and\u00a03\u00a0(c) of the Convention, as, in any event, the Government have not offered any compelling reasons for the restriction or demonstrated that the absence of legal assistance at the initial stage of the investigation did not irretrievably prejudice the applicant\u2019s defence rights (ibid., \u00a7 58, and see Ibrahim and\u00a0Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, \u00a7\u00a0274, ECHR 2016).

Likewise, the Court of Cassation dealt with this issue in a formalistic manner and failed to remedy this shortcoming (see Bayram Ko\u00e7 v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a038907/09, \u00a7 23, 5 September 2017).",

Considering that the trial court sentenced the applicant on the basis of \u201callowing [the] terrorist organisation\u2019s members to stay in his hotel without registering them in the hotel\u2019s guestbook\u201d for the offence of aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation, the Court is unable to accept the Government\u2019s view that Mehmet Desde had not made any statements incriminating the applicant. The Court further observes that the trial court admitted those statements to the case file without examining their admissibility. Thus, in the present case, it cannot be concluded that the applicant was not affected by the use of such evidence in securing his conviction.",
