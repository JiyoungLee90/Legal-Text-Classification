It was found that on 7\u00a0August 2002 the applicant\u2019s son had taken up his sentry duty, being armed with a rifle. At about 4 a.m. on 8\u00a0August 2002 Pte S., who was inspecting the outposts on that night, found the applicant\u2019s son sleeping in the entrenchment. Pte S. woke him up and hit him with the rifle about twenty times in the chest and leg areas and once with a fist in the face. Two hours later the applicant\u2019s son committed suicide. Other versions, including homicide, had been also examined, but rejected as unsubstantiated. As a result of the investigation Pte S. was charged with having breached rules on relations between servicemen of equal rank and with having incited the applicant\u2019s son to suicide. The criminal case was quickly sent to court for trial. The case was terminated following the adoption of an Act of Amnesty. The applicant\u2019s civil claims against Pte S. were left without examination, but she retained the right to submit a civil action against him. The Government considered that discharging Pte S. from criminal liability based on the Amnesty Act could not have rendered the investigation ineffective.",

While Pte S. was eventually charged with the offences of breach of rules on relationship between servicemen of equal rank and incitement to suicide, at no further instance did the investigating or judicial authorities return to the role of Sgt K. in the events. The Court however sees force in the applicant\u2019s argument that the authorities should have thoroughly investigated Sgt K.\u2019s involvement in the incident. The latter was Pte\u00a0Styazhkov\u2019s superior; when he and Pte S. discovered Pte Styazhkov sleeping, it was Sgt K. who had hit him first, then ordered him to do press-ups and crawl along the ground in his bullet-proof vest (see paragraphs 14-15 above). Sgt K. then watched Pte\u00a0S. continue beating Pte Styazhkov without stopping him. The Court considers that in those circumstances Sgt\u00a0K.\u2019s own actions and his tacit approval of Pte S.\u2019s actions should have been the subject of thorough examination by the investigating authorities. However, just two days after the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s death Sgt K. was excluded from the scope of the criminal investigation which was further on limited to actions of Pte S. only.",

The Government did not contest the applicant\u2019s account of the court proceedings. On 6\u00a0June 2003 the State Duma passed an act of amnesty which provided, among others, for discontinuation of criminal proceedings against servicemen who had committed criminal offences during the armed conflict and/or anti-terrorist operations in the territory of the former Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Chechnya-Ingushetia if they had not yet been examined by the courts (see paragraph 27 above).

The above circumstances might create an impression that the State authorities were deliberately avoiding the beginning of a criminal trial until adoption of the Amnesty Act which would absolve from criminal liability perpetrators among servicemen having taken part in operations in Chechnya. In any event the Court has no doubts that the State authorities did not display due diligence to have Pte S.\u2019s criminal case examined. Such conduct of the State authorities did not only affect the investigation of Pte\u00a0Styazhkov\u2019s death, but might also have a negative impact on public confidence in the adherence of the State authorities to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Mosendz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0107).",
