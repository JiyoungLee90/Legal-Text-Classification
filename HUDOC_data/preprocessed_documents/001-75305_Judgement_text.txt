The case originated in an application (no. 3021/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Vasile Lungu (“the applicant”), on 27 November 2001.
The applicant was represented by Ms S. Chitic, acting on behalf of the “Lawyers for Human Rights”, a non-governmental organisation based in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V. Pârlog.
The applicant complained that the failure to enforce the judgment of 18 August 1997 violated his right to have his civil rights determined by a court guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention and his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 8 October 2003 a Chamber of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Cocieri. He is a retired employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 1997 the applicant, along with other employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, lodged with the Chişinău District Court an action against the Ministry of Internal Affairs seeking compensation in place of the servicemen’s food allowance.
On 18 August 1997 the Chişinău District Court awarded the applicant, along with other co-plaintiffs, compensation in the amount of 1,407 Moldovan lei (MDL) (307 euros (EUR) at the time). No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final.
The applicant obtained an enforcement warrant which the Bailiff did not enforce. On an unspecified date the applicant complained about the non-enforcement of the judgment of 18 August 1997. In an undated letter, the Superior Bailiff of the Chişinău District Court replied to the applicant that the judgment of 18 August 1997 could not be enforced due to the lack of funds in the bank account of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
On 18 December 2003 the judgment was enforced.
The relevant provisions of domestic law and practice are set out in this Court’s judgment in the case of Prodan v. Moldova (no. 49806/99, § 31, ECHR 2004III (extracts)).
