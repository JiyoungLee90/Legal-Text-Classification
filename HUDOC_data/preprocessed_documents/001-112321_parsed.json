No in situ inspection was carried out at the time when the police arrived at the scene. Furthermore, the authorities never answered the applicant\u2019s allegations of bias of the investigation judge. These objective flaws in the investigation show a passive attitude as to the efforts made to properly probe applicant\u2019s allegations of rape.",

As to the domestic proceedings concerning the investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of rape, the Court agrees that, as they were essentially aimed at remedying some of the violations of the Convention alleged before the Court, these domestic legal costs may be taken into account in assessing the claim for costs (see Scordino v.\u00a0Italy (no.\u00a01) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7 284, ECHR 2006-V). In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court awards the applicant the sum of EUR 2,000 for costs and expenses in the proceedings before the national authorities. As to the Convention proceedings, making its assessment on an equitable basis and in the light of its practice in comparable cases, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant, who was represented by counsel, the sum of EUR 2,000, less EUR\u00a0850 already received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe, plus any tax that may be chargeable to her on these amounts.",
