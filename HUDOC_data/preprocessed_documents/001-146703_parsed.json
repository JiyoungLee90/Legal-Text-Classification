The Court reiterates that, in the absence of a European consensus on the religious nature of Scientology teachings, and being mindful of the subsidiary nature of its role, it must rely on the position of the domestic authorities in the matter and determine the applicable Convention provision in the light of it (see Kimlya and Others v. Russia, nos. 76836/01 and 32782/03, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2009, and Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia, no.\u00a018147/02, \u00a7 64, 5 April 2007). The Court need not determine whether or not Scientology is a religion because it can defer to the judgment of the Russian authorities on that matter. In contrast to the Kimlya and Church of Scientology Moscow cases, in which the Russian authorities explicitly concurred regarding the religious nature of the applicant Scientology organisations, the religious study in the instant case concluded that the nature of the applicant group was non-religious. Alleged legal defects in the study, including the manner in which it had been prepared, were a matter of controversy in the domestic proceedings. What is decisive for the Court, however, is that the reason for refusing the registration of the applicant group \u2013 which had ultimately been endorsed by the Russian courts \u2013 was the legal provision establishing a special fifteen-year waiting period that applies only to religious organisations. In these circumstances, the Court sees no need to distinguish the present case from the Kimlya case, which concerned the same reason for refusing registration. It therefore considers that the complaint must be examined from the standpoint of Article 9 of the Convention, interpreted in the light of Article\u00a011 (see Kimlya, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081).

In their view, the interference was \u201cprescribed by law\u201d and all the refusals of registration had been based on the relevant legal provisions. The interference pursued a legitimate aim, namely that of protecting public order (they referred to Kimlya, cited above, \u00a7 97). The Government justified the interference as having been necessary in a democratic society for suppressing manifestations of religious discord (they referred to Wingrove v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 25 November 1996, \u00a7\u00a058, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V, and Otto-Preminger-Institut v.\u00a0Austria, 20 September 1994, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 295A). They also claimed that similar waiting periods were provided for by the laws of some other Member States. According to their information, Austrian law set the waiting period at twenty years, Latvian law at twenty-five years, and Romania\u2019s Law no.\u00a0489 of 28 December 2006 provided that religious denominations, other than the eighteen listed in the law, may be recognised if they can prove their existence in the country for at least twelve years.",

They contended that the refusal had not been \u201cprescribed by law\u201d because the law did not meet the standards of clarity and foreseeability required under the Convention. Referring to Article 132 of the Russian Constitution and sections 7(2) and 11(5) of the Religions Act, the applicants submitted that the law expressly authorised local authorities to issue letters confirming the length of a group\u2019s existence and that the courts\u2019 rejection of the confirmation letter on the basis of an alleged lack of authority was unreasonable. Furthermore, whereas the Religions Act required only formal presentation of a confirmation letter, the courts had rejected it as \u201cunreliable\u201d with reference to arbitrary criteria that were not prescribed by law and had imposed an unforeseeable and unattainable threshold.",

The Government\u2019s reliance on the Wingrove and Otto-Preminger-Institut judgments had been misconceived, as these cases had been decided under Article 10 and had concerned specific acts offending others\u2019 religious beliefs. The applicants, on the other hand, had never engaged in any offensive expressions of their beliefs or otherwise offended religious sensibilities of others. They maintained that the applicable standard should be the one that favours religious pluralism, even where there is religious tension and division within society (they referred to Serif v. Greece, no.\u00a038178/97, \u00a7 53, ECHR 1999IX, and Kokkinakis v.\u00a0Greece, 25\u00a0May 1993, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 260A). Finally, the Government\u2019s contention that the waiting period reflected democratic standards acceptable in other Member States was not borne out by the facts. The Austrian system gave rise to the Court\u2019s finding of a violation in Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others v. Austria (no.\u00a040825/98, \u00a7 79, 31 July 2008), the Latvian 1995 Law on Religious Associations did not contain any such requirements, and in Romania the waiting period is relevant only to attaining the status of a \u201creligious denomination\u201d, a special form that enjoys certain public-law privileges including State subsidies. No such waiting period is required for the status of a \u201creligious association\u201d, which confers upon the religious community legal entity status and other rights under the law.",

In cases where the organisation of a religious community has been in issue, a refusal to recognise it as a legal entity has also been found to constitute an interference with the right to freedom of religion under Article 9 of the Convention, as exercised by both the community itself and its individual members (see Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 79-80, and Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others v.

The most recent refusal referred to the absence of a document confirming the group\u2019s fifteen-year existence, the allegedly non-religious nature of the group, and some technical defects in its articles of association. The findings of the District Court, however, as upheld on appeal by the City Court, focused exclusively on the defects in the fifteen-year confirmation letter and did not rely upon any of the other grounds in dismissing the applicants\u2019 complaint. In this respect, the Court reiterates that its task is not to take the place of the national authorities and to re-hear all the parties\u2019 arguments. The interpretation and proper application of domestic law is left primarily to the domestic judicial authorities but is subject to the Court\u2019s overriding supervisory function.

Nevertheless, the Court considers it important to reaffirm its position that the lengthy waiting period which a religious organisation has to endure prior to obtaining legal personality cannot be considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d (see Kimlya, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 99-102, and Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a078-80). In so far as the fifteen-year waiting period under Russia\u2019s Religions Act affected only newly emerging religious groups that did not form part of a hierarchical church structure, there was no justification for such differential treatment. A provision such as this was peculiar to Russian law and there were no other member States of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe that required a religious organisation to prove such a lengthy existence before registration was permitted (see Kimlya, cited above, \u00a7\u00a098). The Court has already had occasion to find a violation on account of a similar provision in Austrian law (see Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07880), whilst the Russian Government\u2019s claim that Latvian and Romanian laws imposed waiting periods on base-level religious communities was mistaken (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above).",
