All those irregular operations were traceable back to the representatives of company S.M.I. in their capacity as natural persons, as clearly shown by the fact that the payments had been repeated each year, whereas normally, business brokerage services were payable as a lump sum paid all at once, not in parts over a period of time. According to the judge, the payments had not been [real] commissions as claimed by the applicant, given that, on the one hand, company S.M.I. had paid large amounts of money and, on the other hand, there had been no real and documented business relationships between the brokers and company S.M.I. According to the judge, [the payment of] such large amounts of money would have required the services to be carried out by well-organised and, most importantly, active broker companies. This had not been the case, in the light of the fact that the brokerage companies involved had their headquarters in countries which were known to be tax havens (paesi a fiscalita\u2019 privilegiata) and that they did not have the corresponding administrative structure. Moreover, the evidence had shown that the applicant and B. had deposited the money (which they had obtained through the payment of undue commissions) in bank accounts that, despite being formally registered in the broker companies\u2019 names, were actually traceable back to the applicant and B., and the latter had repeatedly withdrawn money from them.",

As a shareholder, the applicant could have appropriated such funds via the collection of dividends. But on the contrary, he had opted to pay fictitious commissions in order to pauperise company S.M.I.\u2019s patrimony, namely the patrimony of a different legal person [separate from the applicant as a natural person], having an economic patrimony which was distinct from the one that the shareholders held in their own name.

In particular, they had simulated brokerage services which had never in fact been provided. According to the Judge of Criminal Appeals, the elements mentioned below had shown that the payment of these commissions (provvigioni) covered the misappropriation of company S.M.I.\u2019s funds \u2013 which in the judge\u2019s opinion had allowed the applicant to obtain a considerable amount of money in a non-transparent way. In particular, the judge considered: (i)\u00a0the amount of the sums payable, which was far greater than the percentage ordinarily payable in commissions, and in certain cases had amounted to approximately 50% of the sums which had [notionally] been paid by the fictitious clients; (ii) the fact that the payments were repeated annually, whereas business brokerage was normally a one-off service; (iii) the absence of real and documented business relationships between company S.M.I. and the brokerage companies, which were located in low-tax jurisdictions and did not have the appropriate administrative structures; and (iv) the fact that the brokerage companies were, in reality, traceable back to the applicant and B., to the extent that the latter had made multiple withdrawals [of money] from the companies\u2019 bank accounts. Such withdrawals were sometimes made in more or less the same periods as the payments made by company S.M.I., as indicated, in detail, in the Central Bank\u2019s report (inter alia, the withdrawals made by the applicant from the account in the name of company S.). According to the judge, all the payments which had been made to the brokerage companies and which had been indicated in the indictment had concealed the transfer of money from company S.M.I. to other companies which were traceable back to the applicant and B. The accused persons, who could have, legitimately, kept the profits and remuneration for their activity (registered in the accounts as payments to them from company S.M.I.), had, instead, irregularly disposed of company S.M.I.\u2019s funds, by registering large sums of money in the name of foreign brokerage companies, in order to evade taxes and to leave no trace of the origin of the money in question. In that way, company S.M.I. (rather than the brokers) had suffered damage from the crime of embezzlement. In the judge\u2019s view, such conduct indisputably had to be characterised as such (pacificamente configurabile come tale), given that the patrimony of a company is distinct from the shareholder\u2019s personal patrimony. The judge noted that, in order to dispose of a company\u2019s funds, it was necessary to document, in a legitimate and transparent way, the various financial movements and the reasons for such movements, in order to safeguard creditors and third parties. In the judge\u2019s opinion, it was evident that the accused persons had not made use of the sums in question to the advantage, or in the interests, of company S.M.I.",

Moreover, there was no doubt as to the existence of deliberate intent (dolo), since the entire plan (meccanismo) had been put in place in order to carry out abusive acts in relation to the company\u2019s funds. Nor was it credible that the applicant and B. had truly believed that they had the right to use the sums as if they were their own, since, had that been so they would not have orchestrated the various transfers but would simply have withdrawn the money directly. It followed that, while the criminal charges had to be discontinued as being time-barred, the civil claims upheld at first instance on the presupposition of the [applicant\u2019s] criminal responsibility had to be maintained in accordance with Article\u00a0196 bis of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuation decision in any other proceedings, the fairtrial guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a094). The Court has found that \u201cfollowing discontinuation of criminal proceedings the presumption of innocence requires that the lack of a person\u2019s criminal conviction be preserved in any other proceedings of whatever nature\u201d (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102). What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have ended is the person\u2019s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public. To a certain extent, the protection afforded under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 2 in this respect may overlap with the protection afforded by Article 8 (see, for example, Zollman v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a062902/00, ECHR 2003\u2011XII, and Taliadorou and Stylianou v.\u00a0Cyprus, nos.\u00a039627/05 and 39631/05, \u00a7\u00a7 27 and 56-59, 16\u00a0October 2008).",

In contrast, the Court has previously considered that the presumption of innocence will be violated in cases concerning statements after the discontinuation of criminal proceedings if, without the accused\u2019s having previously been proved guilty according to law and, in particular, without his having had an opportunity to exercise the rights of the defence, a judicial decision concerning him reflects an opinion that he is guilty (see, inter alia, Minelli v.\u00a0Switzerland, 25 March 1983, \u00a7\u00a037, Series A no. 62, and Englert v.\u00a0Germany, 25 August 1987, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 123; see also, most recently, G.I.E.M.

Indeed, that terminology went beyond a reference to the constitutive elements of an offence - which could be relevant both for civil as well as criminal responsibility - but expressly found that the applicant\u2019s actions had amounted to the acts with which he had been charged. Those words thus amounted to an unequivocal pronouncement that the applicant had committed a criminal offence (see Lagard\u00e8re, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081, Farzaliyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067 and, a contrario, Fleischner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a063).

Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuance decision in any other proceedings, the fairtrial guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. Once the criminal proceedings have ended, what is also at stake is the person\u2019s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the general public. The voicing of suspicions about the possible guilt of a defendant is no longer admissible once a final judgment of acquittal has been handed down; the right to be presumed innocent will be violated in cases concerning statements made after the discontinuance of criminal proceedings where, without the person previously having been proved guilty according to law and, in particular, without his having had an opportunity to exercise defence rights, a judicial decision concerning him reflects an opinion that he is guilty (see, inter alia, Minelli v.\u00a0Switzerland, 25 March 1983, \u00a7\u00a037, Series A no. 62). In cases concerning respect for the presumption of innocence, the language used by the decisionmaker will be of critical importance; but consideration has to be given also to the nature and context of the particular proceedings. Having regard to that nature and context, sometimes even the use of \u201cunfortunate\u201d language may not be decisive. The fact that exoneration from criminal liability ought to be respected in civil compensation proceedings should not preclude the establishment of civil liability to pay compensation arising out of the same facts on the basis of a less strict burden of proof: if the domestic decision on compensation were to contain a statement imputing criminal liability to the defendant, an issue falling within the ambit of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention would arise. Even the use of expressions from the sphere of criminal law has not led the Court to find a violation of the right to the presumption of innocence where, read in the context of the judgment as a whole, the use of the said expressions could not reasonably have been understood as an affirmation imputing criminal liability (see Fleischner v.\u00a0Germany, no. 61985/12, \u00a7\u00a7 64-65, 3 October 2019).",

Azerbaijan, no.\u00a029620/07, \u00a7 62, 28 May 2020). At second instance, the Judge of Criminal Appeals upheld the compensation order issued by the first-instance court which had sentenced the applicant. In respect of the charge of embezzlement, the judge stated that it had to be dropped as the proceedings were time-barred. He also stated that the applicant\u2019s conduct could be characterised as the acts of misappropriation of funds with which he had been charged and that there was no doubt as to the existence of deliberate intent (dolo). To be precise, he held: \u201cin that way, company S.M.I. [rather than the brokers] had suffered damage from the crime of embezzlement \u2013 such conduct indisputably had to be characterised as such, given that the patrimony of a company is distinct from the shareholder\u2019s personal patrimony\u201d; also finding that \u201cthe fact that the accused persons had appropriated those sums and had disposed of them as though they were their own had thus amounted to the acts of misappropriation of funds, i.e. the conduct with which they had been charged\u201d; and lastly that \u201cthere was no doubt as to the existence of deliberate intent\u201d.",

More importantly, the applicant chose to take that approach, even though he, or his legal representative, was or should have been aware that under domestic law, a judge would not be able to declare a charge statute-barred if the judge was of the view that the accused was innocent of that charge (see paragraph 24 of the judgment). In consequence, having regard to the domestic law as it stood, the applicant was or should have been aware that in order to uphold his plea that the proceedings were statute-barred (owing to the expiry of a limitation period), the judge would have had to consider the possibility that he was not innocent, and thus that the judge would explicitly raise a suspicion as to his guilt. In choosing to proceed with that plea of his own free will, the applicant was thus prepared to cast doubt on his innocence, in so far as it enabled him to avoid punishment. In this connection, the Court recognises that, in the context of any criminal proceedings, decisions must be made as to how best to present an accused\u2019s defence at trial. In many cases several options will be available and it is the responsibility of the accused to select, with the advice of counsel, the defence which he wishes to put before the court (see Ebanks v. the United Kingdom, no. 36822/06, \u00a7 82, 26 January 2010). However, he or she must then assume the consequences of those choices. This is an element which characterises both the context and the nature of the proceedings in the light of the specificities of the domestic legal framework. It is the applicant who consciously chose not to have the criminal charge against him examined on the merits, even though this would have allowed the applicant, if his guilt was unproven, to avoid any considerations of a civil nature.",

The actio provides compensation for damage that the plaintiff claims to have suffered as a result of unlawful behaviour by the defendant. The subjective elements of this action are deliberate intent (dolo) or negligence (colpa), which must exist together with the causal link between the event and the conduct of the injuring party (damnum and iniuria). It is therefore the duty of the judge whose role it is to assess the existence of such liability to ascertain the mental attitude of the defendant (the subjective element), which can be either deliberate intent or negligence.

The above-mentioned legal framework does not dispense the respondent State, and specifically the courts ruling on the matter, from respecting the rights arising under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. Thus the Court must nevertheless assess the language used by the decision-maker, which is of critical importance in assessing the compatibility of the decision and its reasoning with Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02.

It also excluded any good faith on the part of the applicant, holding that there had been the necessary dolo (subjective element). While relevant to an assessment of criminal liability, both these elements also had a direct incidence on the assessment of civil liability, and were therefore part of the normal exercise of the judge\u2019s duty to determine both the existence of civil liability and the amount of the damages due (the an and quantum). Further, the Judge of Criminal Appeals never examined the applicant\u2019s guilt for the offence of embezzlement and never ruled that the applicant was guilty (see above, paragraph 7). Moreover, in his conclusion, the Judge of Criminal Appeals explicitly held that while the relevant criminal charges (including embezzlement) had to be discontinued as being time-barred, the civil claims upheld in the first-instance judgment, by which the applicant had been sentenced, had to be maintained. It follows that, when reading the appellate judgment in its entirety, there is no doubt that the applicant was not declared guilty, but that he was nevertheless held civilly liable for the damage sustained by S.M.I. based on the considerations made by the Judge of Criminal Appeals. This particular context in the present case is a central element in making a correct assessment of the measure, which as a whole does not contain any finding of guilt. In particular, it should be stressed that the finding of dolo does not contain any reference to criminal liability: the judge is referring, in fact, to \u201cdeliberate intent\u201d and not to \u201ccriminal intent\u201d.",

From this standpoint, the close proximity and concomitance of the two outcomes \u2013 declaration of statute-barred proceedings, and award of damages for the same acts \u2013 constitute a guarantee that no one should be led to believe that the applicant was found guilty under the criminal law. The representation of the applicant resulting from the judgment is that determined by the reality of the case: a person who has not been declared criminally liable because the charge became time-barred during the proceedings, and who has been sentenced to pay compensation for damage resulting from the misappropriation of which he was accused.",

                        "content": "14.\u00a0\u00a0In the present judgment, the Chamber refers repeatedly to the case of Fleischner (cited above). In that case the charges against the applicant were also time-barred. In subsequent civil proceedings, however, the civil judge stated that the applicant\u2019s actions had \u201cfulfilled the constitutive elements of deprivation of liberty under Article 239 of the Criminal Code and of coercion under Article 240 of the Criminal Code\u201d. The judgment goes on to establish that: \u201cthis was not a statement about the applicant\u2019s guilt\u201d, explaining that \u201c[t]he District Court [had] deliberately used the technical legal term \u2018constitutive elements\u2019 (Tatbestand) to make it clear that it had solely assessed certain elements of a penal provision that could be the basis for both criminal and civil liability. It [had] limited itself to that finding and [had] not expressly [found] that the applicant had committed the offences\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 63). The judgment then underlines the fact that the civil claim had not been brought in the criminal proceedings, but separately and subsequently before another judge. It will be difficult for national judicial authorities in general to understand the reason why a direct statement relating to the fulfilment of the elements \u2013 objective and subjective \u2013 of the offence should not be equated with the statements made in the judgment of the Judge of Criminal Appeals; there being no direct statement of criminal liability in the judgment of the latter either (as explained above in paragraph 7). The act of embezzlement, and the existence of a certain mental attitude, are constitutive elements of both civil and criminal liability also in the San Marino system (as explained above in paragraph 10). Even the Judge of Criminal Appeals confined himself to saying that the applicant misappropriated the sums (as is clear from the subsequent reference to the need to distinguish between the assets of the company and those of the shareholder; see paragraph 3 above), and to ascertaining his mental attitude in doing so, without any criminal characterisation (\u201cdeliberate intent\u201d, not \u201ccriminal intent\u201d). There was no reasoning suggesting that the court regarded the accused as \u201cguilty\u201d (see Bikas v. Germany, no. 76607/13, 25 January 2018). The claim for civil relief and the related assessment were actually part of the same criminal proceedings. However, as mentioned in paragraph 12 above, this circumstance can rather be regarded as an element that reinforces the impression that the applicant did not commit any crime, precisely because at the same time, and alongside the civil award of damages, the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings was established. Paragraph 62 of the judgment states that \u201c[i]n other words, the Judge of Criminal Appeals did not only determine the actus reus but went further and stated that the applicant\u2019s acts were made with the requisite mens rea \u2013 which in this case he considered to be dolo\u201d. The same thing can be found in paragraph 63 of the Fleischner judgment (cited above), where it refers to \u201cconstitutive elements\u201d in the plural. Therefore, the objective element, with the subjective element (Tatbestand, in San Marino law fattispecie), are insufficient to entail criminal guilt in both cases. The assessment as to a violation of the presumption of innocence principle should perhaps consider whether the judgment in question imputes criminal liability in a more global, less sophisticated, way. The impact on a person\u2019s reputation and public perception are the most important elements, which the Court\u2019s jurisprudence has long identified, in this connection. In the light of the above, in my opinion, the present judgment appears not to be completely consistent with the Court\u2019s previous case-law.",

The consequences for the injured party, from this perspective, change significantly if the damage was inflicted with the will to cause damage or as a result of mere negligence. For example, the moral impact and suffering caused by a deliberate punch to a person\u2019s face will be different if the same blow comes from a sudden and involuntary movement. It is therefore relevant, also for the civil judge, to carry out an assessment, even a detailed one, of the defendant\u2019s mental attitude.",

In such cases, the civil judge is not only entitled to ascertain the existence of the crime, but must do so every time criminal proceedings have not taken place, as well as when they have not reached a decision on the merits. It is important for the judge also to rule on this latter aspect. The civil judge can legitimately, in my opinion, and without incurring any violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2, establish, while respecting certain procedural safeguards, that a person has committed or has not committed a criminal offence, in order to decide \u2013 among other things \u2013 on the existence of, and compensation for, the damage deriving from that offence. This is a conclusion that does not appear to be in contrast with what was established by the Grand Chamber in the Allen case (cited above) \u2013 which does not contain any prohibition for the civil judge to proceed with a verification of the existence of the offence as such \u2013 but one on which there does not seem to be a clear position in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence, which tends rather towards a very detailed assessment of the language used.",
