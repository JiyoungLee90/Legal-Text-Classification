The case originated in an application (no. 24706/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Bernard Rylski (”the applicant”) on 24 September 2001.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the divorce proceedings in his case exceeded a reasonable time.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 22 September 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Warszawa.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
In 1991 the applicant's wife filed with the  (Sąd Wojewódzki) a petition for divorce, asking to be granted custody rights over her daughter and child maintenance from the applicant. On 12 July 1991 a mediation hearing was held, but the parties did not reach an agreement.
On 29 October 1991 and 13 December 1991 hearings were held. The court heard witnesses and ordered the applicant to file a declaration of means. In addition, it requested an opinion of an expert psychologist and a social inquiry report to be prepared.
On 3 February 1992 the court secured the claim and ordered the applicant to pay 500,000 old zlotys (PLZ) in monthly maintenance for his daughter. On 5 February 1992 the court dismissed the applicant's motion for exemption from court fees. On 19 February 1992 the applicant appealed against the decisions of 3 and 5 February 1992. His appeal was dismissed. On 20 February 1992 the applicant challenged the impartiality of the judge. His motion was dismissed.
On 5 October 1992 the court ordered another social inquiry report. On 28 October 1992 a psychologist's opinion concerning relations between the parents and the daughter was issued. On 16 March 1993 the court held a hearing. It heard an expert in psychology and one witness. The court regulated the frequency of the applicant's contacts with his daughter pending the divorce proceedings.
On 16 March 1993 the court imposed a fine on the applicant for offending the court.
On 26 April 1993 the plaintiff asked the court to increase the amount of child maintenance.
On 1 the plaintiff submitted her pleadings.
On 26 May and 7 June 1993 the court yet again summoned the applicant to submit, within seven days, information regarding his financial situation. He complied with the summons on 11 and 22 June 1993.
On 11 June 1993 the applicant appealed against the decision of 15 April 1993 by which his previous appeal against the fine imposed on him had been rejected. On 22 June 1993 his appeal was rejected as having been lodged outside the prescribed time-limit.
On 27 July 1993 the court amended its decision concerning maintenance, increasing it to PLZ 900,000. It considered that as a construction engineer the applicant was able to earn approximately PLZ 3,000,000 per month. The applicant appealed.
On 2 September 1993 the applicant appealed against the decision imposing a fine on him. On 9 September 1993 his appeal was rejected as having been lodged after the prescribed time-limit. The applicant appealed against this decision and his appeal was rejected on 29 November 1993.
On 22 October 1993 the court ordered him to comply with the formal requirements in respect of his appeal against the decision of 27 July 1993. On 12 November 1993 the case file was sent to the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny). On 29 November 1993 that court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the decision of 27 July 1993.
On 30 November 1993 the applicant complained that the plaintiff had impeded his contacts with the child.  On 16 May 199 the plaintiff asked the court not to schedule hearings in July.
On 8 June 199 the applicant was charged with having forced a witness in his divorce proceedings to withdraw her testimony. On 12 July 199 the Warsaw District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) submitted to the Warsaw District Court a bill of indictment concerning that charge.
On 20 June 199 the prosecutor submitted to the District Court another bill of indictment against the applicant. The applicant was charged with domestic violence against his wife.  On 15 September 199 the Warsaw District Court joined those two cases.
On 27 November 1995 the Warsaw District Prosecutor submitted to the court another bill of indictment in which he charged the applicant with evading the payment of maintenance for his daughter. Apparently the case was joined to the earlier proceedings.
On 30 September 2003 the District Court convicted him of the first two charges and acquitted him of the third charge and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment. Upon his appeal, on 6 May 200 the  stayed the execution of the sentence for a probationary period of five years.
On 7 July 199 the court ordered the parties to submit their pleadings within one month. On 22 August 199 it urged them to comply with its summons. They submitted their pleadings on 21 September 199.
On 12 October 199 the case-file of the divorce proceedings was sent to the District Prosecutor upon his request. It was returned on 16 November 199.
On 27 December 199 the court scheduled a hearing for 2. On 24 February and 19 May 1995 two hearings were held. The applicant did not appear and in consequence they were adjourned. On 15 September 1995 a hearing was heard. The applicant did not agree to a divorce.
On 13 and 27 September 1995 the applicant submitted pleadings in which he inter alia asked the court to order the plaintiff to pay him alimony.
On 2 a hearing was held at which the court heard both parties. The  dismissed the applicant's claim for alimony from his wife and refused his request to reduce the amount of the maintenance payable to his daughter. He appealed, but on 18 July 1996 the Warsaw Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal.
On 2 the  amended its decision of 16 March 1993 in that it increased the frequency of the applicant's meetings with his daughter. He and his wife appealed and on 18 July 1996 the Warsaw Court of Appeal quashed that decision. It considered that the contested decision was not supported by an opinion of psychologists.
The hearing scheduled for 23 February 1996 had to be adjourned until the appeals were examined. The hearing held on 13 December 1996 was adjourned. The court ordered a supplementary expert opinion of psychologists.
On 29 January 1997 the institution which was to prepare an expert opinion informed the court that it had started mediation between the parties and that the opinion would be submitted after 12 March 1997. The opinion was submitted on 30 March 1997. On 23 December 1997 a hearing was held at which the court heard the expert and the plaintiff. It decided to summon another witness – a Mr J.M.
On 23 December 1997 the  issued an order concerning the applicant's contacts with his daughter pending the divorce proceedings. It decided that the meetings should take place on the first, second and third Saturdays of every month between 11 a.m. and  without the mother's presence. The court also ordered a guardian (kurator sądowy) to supervise those meetings. Having regard to the opinion of the psychologists, it considered that in the ongoing conflict between the parents, the daughter, who was emotionally attached to her mother, had become more and more unfriendly towards her father, which called for more frequent contacts with the father.
On 29 December 1997 the applicant requested the written grounds for the decision. They were sent to him on 5 February 1998. On 18 February 1998 he appealed against the decision. On 25 February 1998 he was summoned to pay a court fee. On 3 April 1998 a hearing was held but it was adjourned pending the examination of the applicant's appeal. On 18 June 1998 the Warsaw Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal against the decision of 23 December 1997.
On 30 September 1998 the applicant requested the court to increase the frequency of his contacts with the child.
On 15 January 1999 the court held a hearing and dismissed the motion to call the witness J.M. The court heard the parties. The applicant asked the court to hear another witness as well as all the witnesses who had already been heard. He also requested a stay of the proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. The court dismissed those motions.
On 29 January 1999 the  gave judgment, granting a divorce based on the applicant's fault, and deciding on the daughter's custody and child maintenance. On 19 March 1999 the court served the written grounds of the judgment on the applicant. He appealed and requested an exemption from the appeal fee on 7 April 1999.
On 5 May 1999 the court dismissed the applicant's motion for an exemption from court fees. The applicant appealed on 18 May 1999. On 17 June 1999 his appeal was dismissed. The court based its decision on the fact that the applicant had not submitted the necessary documents to confirm his financial situation.
On 2 August 1999 the applicant was summoned to pay the appeal fee. On 20 August 1999 he asked the court to exempt him from that fee. On 7 September 1999 the court dismissed his motion. The applicant appealed on 30 September 1999. On 18 November 1999 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's appeal.
On  the applicant requested the court to exempt him from the court fee. On 18 January 2000 his motion was dismissed. The applicant appealed on 1 March 2000. On 1 his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The courts emphasised that the applicant had persistently repeated his request without providing any new circumstances to justify a new motion and without submitting relevant documents.
On 28 April 2000 the applicant again requested to be exempted from the court fee.
On 2 June 2000 the court again ordered the applicant to pay the court fee for his appeal, amounting to 400 PLN.
On 16 June 2000 the applicant asked for exemption from the court fee. This motion was dismissed on 28 June 2000 for the same reasons as given previously. On 19 July 2000 the applicant appealed against this decision. It was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 27 October 2000.
On 28 June 2000 the applicant's appeal against the judgment of 29 January 1999 was rejected on formal grounds for non payment of the appeal fee. The  noted that the applicant's repeated and unsubstantiated motions for exemption had been dismissed several times and he had failed to pay the fee despite two summonses. The court emphasised that the applicant's only intention was to delay the proceedings, to the detriment of the plaintiff. The applicant appealed on 19 July 2000.
On 27 December 2000 the applicant asked to be exempted from all court fees, in particular from the appeal fee. On 8 January 2001 his motion was sent to the .
On 12 March 2001 the court called on the applicant to pay the court fee of 80 PLN for his appeal against the decision of 28 June 2000 (see paragraph 40 above).
On 27 March 2001 the court refused to exempt the applicant from the court fees. It underlined that the applicant had requested to be exempted from the court fees on several occasions but had once again not indicated any new circumstances justifying his request. On 24 April 2001 the applicant appealed. On 28 May 2001 his appeal was dismissed.
On 28 June 2001 the  ordered the applicant to pay the court fee due for his appeal against the decision rejecting his appeal against the judgment (see paragraph 42 above).
On 12 July 2001 the defendant informed the court that he had paid the court fee for the appeal against the judgment (amounting to 400 zlotys) and requested the court to reinstate the time-limit for paying the fee.
On 19 July 2001 the  issued two decisions, in which it rejected the applicant's appeal against the decision of 28 June 2000 and rejected the applicant's motion to be granted retrospective leave to pay the appeal fee.
The judgment of 29 January 1999 became final on 8 August 2001.
Articles 417 et seq. of the Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny) provide for the State's liability in tort.
In the version applicable until 1 September 200, Article 417 § 1, which lays down a general rule, read as follows:
“1.  The State Treasury shall be liable for damage caused by a State official in the course of carrying out the duties entrusted to him.”
Article 418 of the Civil Code, as applicable until 18 December 2001, provided for the following exception in cases where damage resulted from the issue of a decision or order:
“1.  If, in consequence of the issue of a decision or order, a State official has caused damage, the State Treasury shall be liable only if a breach of the law has been involved in the issue of the decision or order and if that breach is the subject of prosecution under the criminal law or of a disciplinary investigation, and the guilt of the person who caused the damage in question has been established by a final conviction or has been admitted by the superior of that person.
The inability to establish guilt by way of a criminal conviction or in a decision given in disciplinary proceedings shall not exclude the State Treasury's liability for damage if such proceedings cannot be instituted in view of a [statutory] exception to prosecution or disciplinary action.”
On 1 September 200 the Law of 17 June 2004 on amendments to the Civil Code and other statutes (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy – Kodeks cywilny oraz niektórych innych ustaw) (“the 2004 Amendment”) entered into force. While the relevant amendments have in essence been aimed at enlarging the scope of the State Treasury's liability for tort under Article 417 of the Civil Code – including the addition of a new Article 4171 and the imposition on the State of tortious liability for its omission to enact legislation (the so-called “legislative omission”; “zaniedbanie legislacyjne”) – they are also to be seen in the context of the operation of a new statute introducing remedies for the unreasonable length of judicial proceedings.
Following the 2004 Amendment, Article 4171, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:
“3.  If damage has been caused by failure to give a ruling (orzeczenie) or decision (decyzja) where there is a statutory duty to give them, reparation for [the damage] may be sought after it has been established in the relevant proceedings that the failure to give a ruling or decision was contrary to the law, unless otherwise provided for by other specific provisions.”
However, under the transitional provisions of Article 5 of the 2004 Amendment, Article 417 as applicable before 1 September 200 shall apply to all events and legal situations that subsisted before that date.
On  the  (Trybunał Konstytucyjny) dealt with two constitutional complaints in which the applicants challenged the constitutionality of Article 417 and 418 of the Civil Code. They alleged, in particular, that those provisions were incompatible with Articles 64 and 77 § 1 of the Constitution.
On the same day the  gave judgment (no. SK 18/00) and held that Article 417 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution in so far as it provided that the State Treasury was liable for damage caused by the unlawful action of a State official carried out in the course of performing his duties. It further held that even though Article 418 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 64 of the Constitution, it was contrary to Article 77 § 1 since it linked the award of compensation for such damage with the personal culpability of the State official concerned, established in criminal or disciplinary proceedings.
On 18 December 2001, the date on which the 's judgment took effect, Article 418 was repealed. The 's opinion on the consequences of the repeal read, in so far as relevant:
“The elimination of Article 418 of the Civil Code from the legal system ... means that the State Treasury's liability for the actions of a public authority consisting in the issue of unlawful decisions or orders will flow from the general principles of the State liability laid down in Article 417 of the Civil Code. This, however, does not rule out the application in the present legal system of other principles of State liability laid down in specific statutes and not necessarily only those listed in the Civil Code.”
On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings.
A party to pending proceedings may ask for the acceleration of those proceedings and/or just satisfaction for their unreasonable length under Article 2 read in conjunction with Article 5(1) of the 2004 Act.
Article 2, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:
“1.  Parties to proceedings may lodge a complaint that their right to a trial within a reasonable time has been breached [in the proceedings] if the proceedings in the case last longer than is necessary to examine the factual and legal circumstances of the case ... or longer than is necessary to conclude enforcement proceedings or other proceedings concerning the execution of a court decision (unreasonable length of proceedings).”
Article 5 provides, in so far as relevant:
“1.  A complaint about the unreasonable length of proceedings shall be lodged while the proceedings are pending. ...”
Article 16 refers to proceedings that have been terminated and that do not fall under the transitional provision of Article 18 in the following terms:
“A party which has not lodged a complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings under Article 5 (1) may claim – under Article 417 of the Civil Code ... – compensation for the damage which resulted from the unreasonable length of the proceedings after the proceedings concerning the merits of the case have ended.”
Article 42 of the Civil Code sets out limitation periods in respect of various claims based on tort. That provision applies to situations covered by Article 417 of the Civil Code. Article 42, in so far as relevant, reads:
“1.  A claim for compensation for damage caused by a tort shall lapse 3 years following the date on which the claimant learned of the damage and the persons liable for it. However, the claim shall in any case lapse 10 years following the date on which the event causing the damage occurred.”
Article 18 of the 2004 Act lays down the following transitional rules in relation to the applications already pending before the Court:
“1.  Within six months after the date of entry into force of this law persons who, before that date, had lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights ... complaining of a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time guaranteed by Article 6 (1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ..., may lodge a complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings on the basis of the provisions of this law if their complaint to the Court had been lodged in the course of the impugned proceedings and if the Court has not adopted a decision concerning the admissibility of their case.
A complaint lodged under subsection 1 shall indicate the date on which the application was lodged with the Court.
The relevant court shall immediately inform the Minister of Foreign Affairs of any complaints lodged under subsection 1.”
