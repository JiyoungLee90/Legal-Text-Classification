However, he lodged appeals against the other decisions extending his detention. He also requested on several occasions that his detention be replaced by a more lenient preventive measure. The Court has already considered that those remedies, namely an appeal against a detention order and/or a request for release, whether submitted to the prosecutor or to the court, depending on the stage of the proceedings, and also an appeal against a decision to extend detention, serve the same purpose under Polish law. Their objective is to secure a review of the lawfulness of detention at any given time during the proceedings, at both the pre-trial and the trial stage, and to obtain release if the circumstances of the case no longer justify continued detention (see\u00a0Iwa\u0144czuk v. Poland (dec.), no. 25196/94, 9\u00a0November 2000, and Wolf\u00a0v.\u00a0Poland, nos.\u00a015667/03 and 2929/04, \u00a7\u00a078, 16\u00a0January 2007). It follows from the Court\u2019s case-law that the applicant is not required to appeal against each and every decision extending his detention (see,\u00a0a\u00a0contrario, Bronk v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 30848/03, 11\u00a0September 2007). The Court therefore considers that the applicant was not required to appeal against all refusals to release him in order to comply with the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies. It follows that this complaint cannot be rejected for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies.",

It suffices, in the absence of a formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official in question regards the accused as guilty, while a premature expression of such an opinion by the tribunal itself will inevitably run foul of the said presumption (see,\u00a0among other authorities, Deweer v.

The Government argued that, having regard to the overall context of that decision, the  had referred to the existence of evidence pointing to a likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences concerned, and not to the question of his guilt or innocence. However, the Court emphasises that there is a fundamental distinction to be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear judicial declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that the individual has committed the crime in question (see, Garycki v. Poland, no.\u00a014348/02, \u00a7\u00a071, 6\u00a0February 2007, Ne\u0161t\u00e1k v. Slovakia, no.\u00a065559/01, 89, 27 February 2007).
