He was alleged to have subjected her to verbal abuse, hit her on the head with his hand and fist, slapped her, held her by the throat, tried to strangle her, thrown her against the furniture or onto the ground, pushed her down stairs and kicked her. He had also hit the children, gambled away the household\u2019s money on gaming machines and smashed the crockery. As a result, his wife had sustained haematomas, bruising and a fractured nose and had been obliged to seek medical assistance on that account on 26 June 2000, 18 July 2003 and 8 February 2006. The applicant had allegedly sought to undermine his wife psychologically in order to control her. According to the prosecutor, the applicant had thus committed the continuing offence of abusing a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2(b) of the Criminal Code, given that his conduct prior to the introduction of that offence on 1 June 2004 had amounted to the offence of violence against an individual or group of individuals under Article 197a of the Criminal Code and assault occasioning bodily harm under Article 221 of the Code.",

It sentenced him to a suspended term of two and a half years\u2019 imprisonment and placed him on probation for five years. He was also placed under supervision and ordered to undergo treatment for alcohol dependency. The court based its decision on the statements given by the applicant, the victim (his wife) and several witnesses and on documentary evidence and expert reports. It adopted the classification of the offence as abuse of a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2(b) of the Criminal Code as in force from 1 June 2004 onwards, taking the view that this classification also extended to the acts committed by the applicant prior to that date since they had been punishable at the material time, amounting at least to the offence of violence against an individual or group of individuals under Article 197a of the Criminal Code. Lastly, the court considered that, owing to the duration of the conduct in question, the offence committed in the present case presented a relatively high degree of danger which justified a sentence ranging from two to eight years\u2019 imprisonment under paragraph 2 of Article 215a of the Criminal Code. Taking into consideration the extenuating circumstances (in particular the fact that the applicant had confessed and that he had no previous convictions), it imposed a suspended sentence situated at the lower end of the range.",

On this point the Supreme Court noted, referring to its ruling Tzn 12/93 of 8 December 1993, that where, as in the case at hand, the offence was a continuing one which was considered to constitute a single act, its classification in criminal law had to be assessed under the law in force on completion of the last occurrence of the offence. That law therefore also applied to the earlier assaults, provided that these would have amounted to criminal conduct under the previous law. In the instant case the Supreme Court considered that the applicant\u2019s conduct prior to the amendment of the Criminal Code on 1 June 2004 had amounted at least to an offence punishable under Article 197a or Article 221 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.",

Taken separately, his actions committed between 1 June 2004 and 8 February 2006 would not then have fulfilled the conditions, in terms of their intensity or their duration, required to justify the application of paragraph 2 of Article 215a of the Criminal Code; instead, paragraph 1, which provided for a maximum three-year sentence, would have been applied.",

In the Government\u2019s view, the applicant was simply contesting the courts\u2019 interpretation of the Criminal Code, although that interpretation had been based on settled case-law. In that connection the Government pointed out that the courts\u2019 case-law formed part of the concept of \u201claw\u201d referred to in Article 7, which embodied the principle that only the law could define a crime and prescribe a penalty (the Government cited Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, ECHR 2006-IV). They also noted that Article 7 did not prohibit the application of a subsequent law to the acts at issue, provided that those acts had also amounted to an offence under the law in force at the time they were committed and that the law in question had been foreseeable and accessible (the Government cited G. v.\u00a0France, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 25-26, Series A no. 325-B). The Government also referred to the Court\u2019s view according to which the principle of legal certainty required that, where a person was accused of a continuing offence, both the bill of indictment and the judicial decision should make clear that the ingredients of a continuing offence were present (they cited Ecer and Zeyrek v. Turkey, nos. 29295/95 and 29363/95, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2001-II).",

Accordingly, the authorities had applied the Criminal Code as in force on that date, complete with Article 215a, which had been introduced on 1 June 2004. From the standpoint of domestic law, therefore, there had been no retrospective application of the criminal law. The Government observed in that regard that it had been possible to apply the new provision only because the applicant\u2019s actions had also constituted offences prior to June 2004 under Articles 197a and 221 of the Criminal Code, as noted by the prosecutor and the courts (they cited, by contrast, Veeber v.

Whereas under Article 215 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2(b) he had risked a sentence of between two and eight years\u2019 imprisonment, he had actually been sentenced to a suspended term of two and a half years\u2019 imprisonment. In that connection the Government conceded that, under Articles 197a and 221 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code as in force prior to 1 June 2004, the applicant would have faced a slightly less severe sentence, namely a maximum of two years\u2019 imprisonment. Firstly, however, the applicant\u2019s sentence had been suspended and, secondly, it was necessary to take into consideration the fact that he had continued his conduct after June 2004. Accordingly, if the courts had not applied the concept of a continuing offence in the present case they would have had to examine the applicant\u2019s conduct prior to 1 June 2004 on the basis of Articles 197a or 221 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code and his conduct after that date on the basis of 215a \u00a7 2 of the Code. His actions would then have been treated as cumulative offences attracting an aggregate sentence under the provision of the Criminal Code relating to the offence which carried the heaviest sentence, namely Article 215a. Accordingly, even in that hypothetical situation the sentence imposed on the applicant would have been just as severe as that imposed in the present case, if not more so.",

Classifying those acts as a continuing offence of abusing a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2(b) of the Criminal Code, the prosecutor noted that the applicant\u2019s conduct prior to the introduction of that offence on 1 June 2004 could be considered to amount to the offences defined by Articles 197a and 221 of the Code. The domestic courts agreed with this assessment, finding the applicant guilty of the acts committed between 2000 and 8 February 2006. Referring to its case-law, the Supreme Court observed in particular that in the case of a continuing offence considered to constitute a single act, the criminal nature of that act had to be assessed under the law in force on completion of the last occurrence of the offence, and that the law in question applied to the earlier occurrences provided that they would have been classified as criminal acts under the previous law. In the instant case the Supreme Court therefore considered that the Criminal Code as in force at 8 February 2006 should be applied to all the applicant\u2019s actions and that the classification provided for in Article 215a, which had entered into force on 1 June 2004, should be adopted, given that the applicant\u2019s actions prior to that amendment of the Criminal Code had been punishable under Articles 197a or 221 \u00a7 1 of the Code.

In these circumstances the Court considers that the relevant statutory provisions, accompanied by the interpretative case-law, were such as to enable the applicant to regulate his conduct. It points out in that connection that the case-law in question was developed prior to the date on which the applicant committed the first assault on his wife (see, conversely, Veeber, cited above, \u00a7 37).
