In these circumstances it was not credible that he had continued to smoke, trusting that it was not dangerous owing to the tobacco companies\u2019 marketing of their product.

Article 6 \u00a7 1 under its \u201ccivil head\u201d applies only to proceedings concerning the \u201cdetermination\u201d of a \u201ccivil right\u201d which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law (see among other authorities Acquaviva v.

Thus, the right to have third parties prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence cannot be asserted independently: it must be indissociable from the victim\u2019s exercise of a right to bring civil proceedings in domestic law, even if only to secure symbolic reparation or to protect a civil right such as the right to a \u201cgood reputation\u201d (see, inter alia, Perez v.

As to the applicants\u2019 argument that they intended to seek financial reparation in the second set of proceedings but that they were prevented from doing by the District Court\u2019s sudden closure of the case, the Court does not find any force in this argument since it was not put forward in the appellate courts.
