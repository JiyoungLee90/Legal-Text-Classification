As to the partial announcement of the 1990 judgment against the applicant, the Government stressed that this was done by the trial judge at the request of the prosecutor at the stage of the examination of the case file material, and not during the questioning of witnesses and victims as alleged by the applicant, and that the applicant did not raise any objections in this respect. The Government explained that a copy of the 1990 judgment was included in the case file because the applicant\u2019s unspent conviction under this judgment had legal importance for determining the latter\u2019s sentence, as account needed to be taken of the applicant\u2019s recidivism and the type of correctional facility where the applicant was to serve his sentence. The Government further relied on the record of the hearing of 26\u00a0July 2004, from which it follows that witness M. and victims T. and P. testified without being subjected to any pressure by the trial judge. The applicant\u2019s applications for the withdrawal of the trial judge were duly considered by the court and dismissed with relevant reasons being given. The Government summed up that the reading out of part of the 1990 judgment could not serve as a reasonable justification of the applicant\u2019s doubts as to the court\u2019s impartiality.",

The Court observes, however, that the parties disagree as to the moment in the proceedings when the reading out of the 1990 judgment had taken place and as to its purpose.
