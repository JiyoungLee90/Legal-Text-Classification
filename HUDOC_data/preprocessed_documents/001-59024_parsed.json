The Second Division declared that the relevant parts of the Act on the Use of EC Coal in the Electricity Supply (Gesetz \u00fcber die weitere Sicherung des Einsatzes von Gemeinschaftskohle in der Elektrizit\u00e4tswirtschaft), which were underlying the coal-mining contribution in question, were unconstitutional as the coal-mining contribution amounted to an inadmissible special levy (Sonderabgabe). The Federal Constitutional Court quashed the District Court's decision of April 1986 in as much as the payment of the contribution was concerned and sent the case back to that court. It further ordered that the legislation in question, to the extent that it was unconstitutional, should not be applied beyond 31 December 1995. The Constitutional Court did not entertain the applicant's complaint about the mode of calculation on the ground that the relevant regulations had changed meanwhile.",
