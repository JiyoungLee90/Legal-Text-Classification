In the Court\u2019s view, the fact that all the reports were drawn up by a single officer seriously undermined their credibility (see, mutatis mutandis, Gedrimas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 21048/12, \u00a7 82, 12 July 2016, and the cases cited therein) \u2013 especially having regard of the fact that that same officer was subsequently charged with the ill-treatment of the applicant. However, that issue was never explicitly addressed by any of the domestic courts and the credibility of the officers \u2013 unlike that of the applicant \u2013 was never called into question by the courts which dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint (see Gedrimas, \u00a7 82, and Yusiv, \u00a7 73, both cited above).",

However, there is no indication that any effort was made to secure any evidence relating to the glasses, either by going back to the location of the arrest to look for them, or at least by warning the applicant not to remove his glasses from that location until the authorities had had the opportunity to examine them. The failure of the authorities to promptly secure evidence concerning the glasses precluded that part of his complaint from being objectively verified and led to its dismissal by the courts in a summary fashion (see paragraph\u00a040 above).",
