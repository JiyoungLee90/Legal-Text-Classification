Leaving aside the family members who are not the applicants in the present case, the Court notes that an acceptable flat was made available to the applicant only on 11\u00a0August 2006, that is six years and ten months later. The Court rejects the Government\u2019s argument that they may only be held liable for the period of non-enforcement up to the date when the first offer of a flat was made. As noted above, the domestic courts were not convinced by the authorities\u2019 allegation that the applicant\u2019s refusal of the offer had been unreasonable. They found that the flats offered had not met the sanitary standards (see paragraph 10 above). Likewise, the Court does not consider it necessary to deduct the period following the judicial decision of 28 February 2001 because that decision did not become final and was eventually quashed on appeal. Even assuming that the six-month suspension in 2000 had a valid justification, the Russian authorities are still responsible for the delay spanning over more than six years, during which the judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour remained without enforcement.",
