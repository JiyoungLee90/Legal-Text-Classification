The proceedings before the District Court took some two years and eight months for most of the charges. This may already be regarded as exceptionally long for a criminal trial, yet it took a further one year and seven months to determine the final indictment. While the Government explained this delay by the fact that two defendants had absconded, it appears that they were arrested in early 1997 and there is no explanation for the lapse of time before the District Court gave its judgment on these outstanding charges on 25 September 1998.

In those circumstances, the sum claimed is out of all proportion with the scope and complexity of the case before the Court.
