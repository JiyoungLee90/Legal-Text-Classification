In particular, an auditeur militaire carried out his duties under the supervision and direction of the Minister of Justice; he combined the functions of public prosecutor and investigating judge; his interests as prosecutor and those of the remand prisoner or defendant were directly opposed; and he alone was vested with the power of decision, since he was not bound by the dissenting opinion of either or both of the officers designated to sit on the Board (see paragraph 24 below).",

Articles 35 and 36 of the Code of Military Criminal Procedure, adopted under an Act of 15 June 1889, empowered Boards of Inquiry to issue arrest warrants.

To begin with, the mere fact that the auditeur militaire could discharge the function of public prosecutor in a case in which he had acted as investigating judge contravened Article 5 \u00a7 3 (art. 5-3). Again, in the instant case the senior deputy auditeur militaire, Mr. Van Even, did in fact combine the functions of investigating magistrate (as chairman of the Board of Inquiry) and officer of the public prosecutor\u2019s department: having conducted the investigation, he represented the public prosecutor\u2019s office on 11 May and 23 June 1982 when the Court Martial gave its decision on Mr. Pauwels\u2019 applications for release, and on 23 June 1982 it was he who signed the summons initiating proceedings before that court; in its judgment of 27 February 1985, the Courts-Martial Appeal Court had moreover itself recognised that Mr. Van Even had acted in the prosecution.",

The evidence, however, did not afford any reason to suppose that the applicant\u2019s detention on remand would probably have been brought to an end if a judicial officer other than Mr. Van Even - that is to say an independent judicial officer - had chaired the Board of Inquiry. In short, no pecuniary damage had flowed from the breach of the Convention.",
