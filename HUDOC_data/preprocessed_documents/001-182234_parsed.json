In particular, the Court found that the actions of the police in arresting the protesters and removing them from the President\u2019s Administration\u2019s premises might be considered as justified by the demands of the protection of public order. However, bearing in mind the length of the detention pending trial and the exceptional seriousness of the penalty imposed on Mr Taranenko, the pre-trial detention and the sanction were not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Taranenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a019554/05, \u00a7\u00a7 68-97, 15 May 2014).",

On the other hand, for the reasons also stated in Taranenko (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a090-97), the Court finds that, although a sanction for the applicants\u2019 actions might have been warranted by the demands of public order, the lengthy period of detention pending trial and the long prison sentences imposed on them were not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Indeed, like Ms Taranenko, the applicants in the present case were also remanded in custody for a year and were convicted either to long suspended prison sentences or to long prison sentences without remission which were actually served. It is significant in this connection that none of the applicants was accused of any use or threat of violence against individuals or infliction of any bodily harm to anyone. Nor did the domestic courts establish whether any of the applicants had personally participated in damaging State property or had committed any other reprehensible act. It is also significant that before the end of the trial the defendants compensated all the pecuniary damage caused by their protest action.",

Russia (nos. 11082/06 and\u00a013772/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a064647, 25\u00a0July 2013) and Yaroslav Belousov v. Russia (nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0145-54, 4 October 2016). Like in those two cases, the courtroom arrangements in the present case (see paragraphs 15 to 17 above) made it impossible for the applicants to have confidential exchanges with their legal counsel, to whom they could only speak during short breaks and in close proximity to the police guards. It is significant that the use of the security installation was not warranted by any specific security risks or courtroom order issues but was a matter of routine. The trial court did not seem to recognise the impact of those courtroom arrangements on the applicants\u2019 defence rights, and did not take any measures to compensate for those limitations. Such circumstances prevailed for the entire duration of the first-instance hearing, which lasted for five months and during which most of the communication between the applicants and their lawyers took place in the courtroom (see paragraphs 12 to 14 above).",
