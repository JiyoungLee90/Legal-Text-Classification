Nor is this case about any single decision or measure taken by the enforcement authorities. The applicant company indeed complained about the respondent State\u2019s failure to act in enforcing the judgment rendered in its favour. The Court further notes that Article 5 of the Enforcement Procedure Act 2004 placed the responsibility for expeditious conduct of the enforcement proceedings on the courts (see paragraph\u00a014 above). It also observes that, for its part, the applicant company had repeatedly complained about the delay in the enforcement proceedings to various State bodies to no avail (see paragraph 10 above). At all events, the Government failed to provide any examples of cases in which a complaint under Article 58 of the Enforcement Procedure Act 2004 expedited the enforcement proceedings. Therefore, a complaint against illegal or irregular acts of bailiffs cannot constitute an effective remedy for the alleged violation. Accordingly, the applicant company was not required to make use of that remedy.",

Specifically, the property initially seized at the debtor\u2019s house had been released at her request contrary to Articles 23 and 24 of the Enforcement Procedure Act 2004 (see paragraphs 16 and 18 above). Moreover, no further attempts were made to make an inventory of the debtor\u2019s movable assets (see paragraph\u00a09 above) and to execute the enforcement order. In view of the fact that the enforcement proceedings were not terminated on the grounds of the debtor\u2019s indigence in accordance with Article 79 of the Enforcement Procedure Act 2004 (see paragraph 18 above), the Court cannot but conclude that the debtor had sufficient assets.
