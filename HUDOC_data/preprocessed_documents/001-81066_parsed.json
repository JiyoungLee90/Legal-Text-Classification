The Court's case-law according to which the freedom of the press to inform might be even better protected if the information concerned a public figure would therefore not be fully applicable in the instant case in respect of the prefect's family, particularly, the Government alleged, in so far as Mr Erignac was to be considered more as a civil servant than as a politician (Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 2), judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV, \u00a7\u00a029). What was more, he had not been murdered in the course of his official duties.

There should be an objective examination of the complaint in order to establish whether the specific act complained of could reasonably be considered as having injured the feelings of the person concerned to the extent of amounting to a violation of the right to respect for his private life.
