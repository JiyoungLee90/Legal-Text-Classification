Germany, no. 59320/00, \u00a7 57, 24 June 2004, with further references and Pfeifer, cited above, \u00a7 38). The Court reiterates that where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see MGN Limited v. the United Kingdom, no. 39401/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0150 and 155, 18\u00a0January 2011, and Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others v.

In balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to respect for private life in the present case, the Court will take into account the following relevant criteria laid down in its case-law.",

The rumoured marital problems of a president of the Republic or the financial difficulties of a famous singer were not deemed to be matters of general interest (see Standard Verlags GmbH v.

In addition, the Court has previously found no public interest justifying the publication of data concerning a person\u2019s health or reference to her sexual life, which were held to be of a purely private nature and therefore fell within the protection of Article 8 of the Convention (see Biriuk v. Lithuania, no. 23373/03, \u00a7\u00a7 39-42, 25 November 2008).",

The article also included lampooning statements about the applicants\u2019 characters by the journalist, such as: \u2018The Some\u015fans. She the cock, he the hen, together two eagles\u2019, or qualifying the first applicant as a bothered journalist who was \u2018obsessed with his former lover\u2019. The Court further observes that the domestic courts did not make any assessment at all as to whether the material published was of public interest, but focused on other aspects of the case, such as whether what was published was true, or whether there was an intention to defame the applicants. Even so, these aspects were not analysed in the general context of the case, but only in the light of the statement given by the journalist (see paragraph 14 above).",

In that connection, the Court has previously held that a fundamental distinction needs to be made between reporting factual matters capable of contributing to debate in a democratic society, relating to politicians in the exercise of their official functions for example, and reporting details of the private life of an individual who does not exercise such functions, with the sole aim of satisfying public curiosity (see Von Hannover, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63 and 65, and Standard Verlags GmbH, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47 and 53). In the latter case, freedom of expression calls for a narrower interpretation (see Von Hannover, cited above, \u00a7 66, and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s (ICI PARIS), cited above, \u00a7 40).",

It also notes that the domestic courts did not make any assessment which could lead to the conclusion that they were public figures, but confined themselves to quoting the journalist\u2019s statement that the first applicant was a public figure. The domestic courts did not mention and did not assess in any way the situation of the second applicant. On this point, the Court notes the dissenting opinion of Judge M.A.C. from the Bihor County Court, who made an extensive analysis of the applicants\u2019 situation and held that they could not be regarded as people in public life, and that it was not proved in the case that the matters publicised relating to them, even if true, were of public interest (see paragraph 15 above).",

Therefore, in view of the above, the Court is not convinced that the national courts attached the required importance to the questions whether the article contributed to a debate of general interest and whether the applicants should have been regarded as public figures. It is not the Court\u2019s intention to speculate on the result of the domestic proceedings in the current case or on whether a person should have been convicted or not by the domestic courts. However, the Court considers that the national courts did not carefully balance the right of the journalist to freedom of expression against the right of the applicants to respect for their private life.",
