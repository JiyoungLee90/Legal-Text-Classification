It also determined that M. was to ensure that the children went to the Centre. Relying on the opinion of Dr T. (see paragraph 16 above), the court held that the children had refused contact with the applicant and that this was not the result of the manipulation of M. but originated in their negative experiences with the contact sessions in the past. Nonetheless, in view of the fact that the father and the children had had no contact since June 2006 and that the contact sessions had never before been carried out with the assistance of experts, the court concluded that the negative attitude of the children was not enough to discontinue contact. When fixing the new contact arrangements, the Higher Court emphasised that the presence of an expert from the Centre at the contact sessions was mainly to provide expert assistance in establishing mutual trust between the applicant and the children. It also opined that it was not necessary for the contact sessions to take place at the Centre, and that they could take place somewhere in the vicinity, in a more relaxed environment for the children and the applicant.",

It held in this connection that a parent refusing to attend the therapy would be responsible for the absence of contact between the applicant and his children. The Centre simultaneously applied for an interim order to immediately suspend the applicant\u2019s contact with his children. The Centre noted that, notwithstanding its professional work, and the applicant\u2019s cooperation and good intentions, the children continued to categorically refuse any contact with the applicant. It also noted that the four Centre officials (caseworkers) who had been present during the contact sessions saw no prospect of the relationship between the applicant and the children improving in the framework of the supervised contact sessions and that the children were not willing participants in them. In such circumstances, in the absence of any relationship between the applicant and his children, and for the time being, they also did not foresee the possibility of organising contact sessions outside the Centre. It submitted that the conditions for the applicant maintaining contact with his children could only be created by the applicant and M. jointly, and that they had been unable to achieve this so far. In their further submissions to the court, the Centre noted that the contact sessions were a serious burden for the children and that the continuation of contact would amount to gradual psychological abuse. It also emphasised that the applicant and his lawyer did not trust the Centre and believed that the officials were biased.",

The activities of the Centre had been aimed at suspending contact instead of actively establishing it with the help of an expert. He noted, in particular, that at the first contact session the children had actively communicated with him. The first session after a long time had been crucial from an emotional standpoint, but had lasted only fifteen minutes because of the caseworker\u2019s intervention. The next contact session had started with the caseworker\u2019s appeal to the children that they could leave. He argued that the children had been put under systematic pressure by M. and, indirectly, the Centre.

It held that the 2008 contact order had taken into account the applicant\u2019s characteristics and attitude, as well as the fact that the children had not had any contact with him since 2006. In order to overcome the existing alienation and initial difficulties in re-establishing contact, the order specified a third party who would help and offer advice in this regard. The court noted that the records did not show that the Centre had played an active role in implementing the 2008 contact order. In particular, contact was limited to the children entering the Centre under strict protocol, stating that they did not want contact, and them leaving the premises together with the caseworkers. The court concluded that Dr T.\u2019s recommendations regarding how the contact sessions should be conducted had not been followed properly. The court further held that there was no reason not to try systematic family therapy in parallel to the contact sessions at the Centre, especially by preparing the children for contact directly before the sessions. The children, represented in the proceedings by M., appealed against the decision. On 16 April 2009 the Ljubljana Higher Court allowed the appeal and remitted the case to the first-instance court. It noted that a critical change in circumstances had occurred since contact was formalised in 2008, and that there was a risk to the children\u2019s psychological development.",

The court observed that the children continued to refuse contact with the applicant and that during five supervised contact sessions there had been no progress in establishing a relationship between him and them. The court held that the Centre\u2019s experts responsible for counselling were of the opinion that their attempts at establishing contact had been unsuccessful and not in the children\u2019s interests, even though they had done everything possible. It thus concluded that continuing with contact would be a psychological burden, threatening the development of the children and that this could cause them irreparable harm. The applicant lodged an objection, arguing that the first-instance court had not taken into account the fact that the 2008 contact order had never been implemented because the Centre had not carried out any activities in this regard but had instead been working towards the discontinuation of contact. His objection was dismissed as unfounded. He then appealed. On 13\u00a0April 2011 the Ljubljana Higher Court dismissed the appeal, finding that it was preferable for the children not to be forced into contact with the applicant. The court reiterated that in terms of the interim order it was irrelevant what the cause was of the traumatic experience the children had in relation to contact, but noted that this could be relevant in the context of potential family therapy.",

Dr T. conducted interviews with each child and the parents. In her expert opinion of 20 October 2010 she noted that the children resented any contact with their father because they were preoccupied with their previous negative experiences with him (see paragraph 16 above). They saw it as a decision forced upon them which did not take into account their emotional needs and wishes. The expert observed that the children had not established an emotional connection with their father at a young age and had expressed an irrational fear of their father linked to them feeling insulted. Their resentment was also the main reason for the difficult implementation of supervised contact. Given their age and the circumstances, she believed that establishing contact would not benefit the children. In the opinion she also noted that M. had not prevented contact and that the children\u2019s resentment did not seem to be based on the alleged manipulation. Furthermore, noting that the applicant was capable, motivated and eager to act in his relationship with the children in a way that would not harm them, the expert suggested that the applicant and M. start parental therapy. She explained that the process of forming a relationship with the father was still open and dynamic and that therapy was aimed at establishing mutual trust between parents. When giving evidence to the court (see paragraph 34 below) Dr T. pointed out that therapy involving counselling and teaching appropriate communication to both parents would stand an 80% chance of success. She also noted that M. should obtain some advice on appropriate communication with the children regarding the importance of their contact with their father and communication with the applicant and submitted that if M. refused to attend counselling, this would call into question her motivation to help the children. Lastly, the expert held that she had not noticed any mistakes in the work of the Centre\u2019s caseworkers during the contact sessions.",

It dismissed the remainder of the Centre\u2019s application, for the obligatory participation in family therapy (see paragraph 28 above), and the applicant\u2019s request for an interim measure ordering family therapy (see paragraph 29 above). The court observed that the supervised contact sessions had been unsuccessful, which had been acknowledged by the Centre, the expert psychiatrist and the applicant. It found that the children, who were almost fifteen years old at the time of the court\u2019s deliberations and thus able to form their own opinion on contact (section 410 of the Civil Procedure Act, see paragraph 47 below), had categorically refused any contact with the father because of their past negative experiences and that supervised contact had caused them mental distress. It held that in such circumstances the reason for the interruption of contact was no longer important. It noted that the children were going through adolescence and that it was possible that they were displaying loyalty to M. by refusing contact with the applicant. In any case, the contact sessions were no longer in the children\u2019s interests because they were a serious psychological burden for the children and were, due to the disagreements between the parents, traumatic for them. The court stated that, according to the expert\u2019s opinion, any attempt to establish contact under the current conditions would not benefit the children. It also noted that, although the applicant was very motivated and keen to establish contact with the children, he had appeared stressed and under pressure during the supervised contact sessions. Moreover, the court held that he was partly responsible for unsuccessful contact because he had been too impatient, had felt offended and angry and had been unable or had not known how to get close to the children, for which he had unreasonably blamed the Centre\u2019s caseworkers. Lastly, the court also found it inappropriate to order family therapy involving the participation of the children. It noted in this connection that M. had not agreed to it and that the children had clearly refused any cooperation with their father during the contact sessions and were seriously distressed. The latter was crucial for deciding that they should not be forced in any further proceedings for the establishment of contact. The court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for an interim measure ordering family therapy for the same reasons, interpreting it as therapy for all family members, including the children.",

He disagreed with the court\u2019s opinion that the reasons resulting in the discontinuation of contact were no longer relevant and pointed out that the children\u2019s alienation from him was the result of wrong decisions taken by the administrative authorities and wrong assessment of the evidence by the court. He repeated his request to appoint a psychologist, who could explore the negative attitude of the children towards him.

In the court\u2019s view, the main reason for the children\u2019s negative attitude towards contact with the applicant were his personal characteristics, as indicated by the court expert, combined with the inadequate participation of M. It found that the opinion of expert Dr T. based on a paedopsychiatric examination of the children and psychiatric diagnostics had provided sufficient grounds for the decision to discontinue contact and that the court-appointed expert had concluded that further tests were unnecessary given the age of the children. The court also stressed that the decision to discontinue contact had not been based solely on the opinion of the children. Other evidence, namely the expert\u2019s opinion, the Centre\u2019s report and the hearing of M. and the applicant, confirmed that contact was not beneficial to the children, who continued to refuse any contact with the applicant. It confirmed that M. had not prevented contact but that, according to the expert\u2019s opinion, she should have played a more active role. The court also observed that the expert believed that the children\u2019s interests required that family therapy be carried out and that such therapy would have an 80% chance of success in the present case. However, the Higher Court found that there was no case-law on the question of whether a custodial parent could, without any relevant legal basis, be forced to participate in family therapy. It also found that family therapy should not, in any event, be ordered because it would only be successful if the applicant\u2019s behaviour changed and M. displayed changes in her attitude. Lastly, although it had been established convincingly that family therapy could be successful in the present case, it had not been established equally convincingly that the applicant would succeed in overcoming the personal difficulties which had hindered the relationship between him and the children.",

In particular, it stated that guidelines for internal monitoring, professional criteria for the improvement of teamwork, and special training programmes were to be set up for all officials responsible for assisting families after a marriage break-up.

One of the fundamental principles is that all children have a right to be consulted and heard in proceedings involving or affecting them. The best interests of the children are a primary consideration for the Member States. The Guidelines also provide that children should be treated with care and sensitivity throughout any procedure, with special attention for their personal situation, well-being and specific needs, and with full respect for their physical and psychological integrity. Judgments and court rulings affecting children should be duly reasoned. In all proceedings involving children, the urgency principle should be applied to provide a speedy response and protect the best interests of the child, while respecting the rule of law. In family law cases, courts should exercise exceptional diligence to avoid any risk of adverse consequences on the family relations. Once the judicial proceedings are over, national authorities should take all necessary steps to facilitate the execution of court decisions involving and affecting children without delay. Lastly, after judgments in highly conflictual proceedings, guidance and support should be offered to children and their families by specialised services (see points nos. 49-51, 76 and 79).",

Bearing in mind that the parents have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child, social service delivery should, according to the Recommendation, ensure a supportive environment for the child by providing the appropriate level and diversity of services and resources necessary for positive parenting and the empowerment of parenting skills. The Recommendation also provides that children should be treated as full bearers of rights, as active subjects in the planning, delivery and evaluation of social services, with special attention for their age, development and individual circumstances. In all processes where social services are provided to children, they should, inter alia, have the right to be listened to and be informed of decisions taken and the extent to which their views have been taken into account. Specialist social services should be in place to ensure immediate emergency interventions and address negative impacts of adverse childhood experiences, and provide social and psychological support to children and their families. These multidisciplinary services and/or programmes should be based on assessments of the children\u2019s individual needs and preferably evidence-based interventions. They should, inter alia, include services for children and parents with regard to parents in special need of parenting skill training, for example due to deficient parental practices.",

Finland, no.\u00a08249/02, \u00a7\u00a7 57-59, 9 May 2006); such interests normally dictate that the child\u2019s ties with his or her family must be maintained, except in cases where this would harm his or her health and development (see, for example, Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7 136, ECHR\u00a02010).",

The Court has repeatedly held that in cases concerning the contact rights of one of the parents, the State has in principle an obligation to take measures with a view of reuniting the parents with their children and an obligation to facilitate such reunions, in so far as the interests of the child dictate that everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, if and when appropriate, to \u201crebuild\u201d the family (see, among other authorities, Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7 94).",

It is an obligation of means, not of result, and may require preparatory or phased measures. The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the cooperation and understanding of all concerned will always be an important ingredient. However, since the authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such cooperation, the lack of it is not a circumstance which can by itself exempt them from their positive obligations under Article 8. Rather, it requires the authorities to take measures to reconcile the conflicting interests, keeping in mind the best interests of the child as a primary consideration (see Ribi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 27148/12, \u00a7 94, 2 April 2015; for the position of the Committee on the Rights of the Child as regards the right of the child to have his or her best interests taken as a primary consideration, see paragraph 49 above). What is therefore decisive is whether the domestic authorities have taken all necessary steps to facilitate contact that can reasonably be demanded in the special circumstances of each case (see, mutatis mutandis, Kuppinger v. Germany, no. 62198/11, \u00a7\u00a0101, 15 January 2015, and Hokkanen v. Finland, 23 September 1994, \u00a7\u00a058, Series A no. 299A). Another important factor to be taken into account is that in cases concerning a person\u2019s relationship with his or her child, there is a duty to exercise exceptional diligence in view of the risk that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the matter (see Ribi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 92). This duty applies not only to proceedings involving the determination of custody and contact rights, but also to proceedings concerning the implementation of those rights (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7 102).",

However, in making this assessment, the Court will take into account not only the judicial decisions which discontinued the contact, but also the acts and omissions of the involved authorities, in particular the Centre, as they had a direct bearing on the situation on which such decisions were based (see paragraph 74 above).",

The Court further observes that the Ljubljana Higher Court already in the first set of contact proceedings observed that the children, then twelve years old, refused to have contact with the applicant (see paragraph 18 above). The aforementioned court, however, did not deem the children\u2019s negative attitude towards their father sufficient for discontinuing contact. Consequently, the Higher Court decided to authorise the applicant to have contact with his children one and a half hours every fortnight under the Centre\u2019s supervision. In the 2008 contact order it explicitly held that the main role of the welfare authorities in the case was to provide expert assistance in establishing mutual trust between the applicant and the children (see paragraph 18 above).",

The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s objection that the mother\u2019s conduct was the main obstacle to the contact, not the work of the Centre (see paragraph 61 above). It however emphasises that a lack of cooperation on the part of a custodial parent does not of itself absolve the authorities of their responsibility under Article 8 to take measures that can reasonably be demanded in the circumstances of the case to reconcile the conflicting interests (see paragraph 74 above). In this connection, the Court observes that the domestic authorities were well aware of the negative effect that the conflict between the parents had on the children, and recognised family therapy for the parents as the only viable option for the successful establishment of contact between the applicant and the children (see paragraphs 28, 32, 33 and 37 above).

Lithuania, cited above \u00a7 102). The assistance of the Centre, as determined in a judicial decision (see paragraph 18 above), was in the specific circumstances of this case therefore part of the necessary measures that the authorities were reasonably required to take in line with their positive obligations under Article 8 (see, mutatis mutandis, Aneva and Others v.

However, in the present case, instead of taking the aforementioned measures, the welfare authorities after only four unsuccessful contact sessions applied to the Kranj District Court to have the contact between the applicant and his children discontinued (see paragraph 28 above). The Kranj District Court and the Ljubljana Higher Court followed the Centre\u2019s application and discontinued the applicant\u2019s contact with his children on the grounds that the forced supervised contact had caused the children mental distress and could harm their development (see paragraphs 35 and 37 above).",
