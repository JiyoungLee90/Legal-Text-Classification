The body had shown injuries to the arms and foot which were in keeping with blows to those areas. The extensive bruising of the left forearm could have been due to the deceased having used his arms to try and ward off blows. The injuries in these areas were referred to as defence injuries which typically involved the forearm and hands. They might also involve the feet if the feet were used to shield blows. The cut to the right arm suggested that it had been inflicted with a sharp implement such as a knife.",

Poisoning as a cause of death could be excluded from the toxicological examination performed. However, there were a number of possible mechanisms to account for the appearances. The first of these was traumatic or crush asphyxia. In this type of death the chest was pinioned in such a way as to prevent breathing. Crucifixion caused death in a similar manner, as did so-called Palestinian hanging where the hands were tied behind the back and the body was suspended from the tied arms which would cause respiratory failure if the position was held for a sufficient length of time. The second possible mechanism was the placing of a plastic bag over the face or head, which was well recognised to lead to death. This would not leave any specific external signs. Finally, in a choke hold or carotid sleeper an arm was held across the neck. In choke holding it was held across the front of the neck, frequently damaging the structures in the neck, particularly the laryngeal cartilages. With carotid sleeper a similar hold was placed, but with the neck being held in the crook of the arm so that the carotid arteries were occluded. Application of either hold could prove fatal.",

It had further revealed hyperaemia in the lungs as well as acute swelling, meaning expansion, of the alveoli in particular. In the alveolar septa, that is the walls separating the alveoli, the capillary walls had been enlarged and had contained great quantities of red blood cells. In some places the alveolar septa had been ruptured, causing the alveolar cavities to enlarge. These were not changes that would occur after death. The rupturing of alveolar septa could occur in patients suffering from emphysema or chronically obstructed lungs, but also in persons who had met with a violent death or, as it was known in forensic medicine, a forcibly induced death such as strangulation, hanging or pressure exerted on abdomen or chest. However, in the case of a forcibly induced death one would expect to see red blood cells in the alveolar cavities in addition to tears in the septa, and this had not been observed.",

However, the policy had been changed and they had been advised that as long as the public prosecutor did not request it, they should not send their reports to this Committee but rather evaluate their own findings and send them to the office of the public prosecutor. If the public prosecutor had only asked for the cause of death, as opposed to the exact cause, the Institute would have provided him with possible causes.

A failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention (Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 23531/94 \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 70, ECHR 2000-VI).

The available medical evidence, such as it is (see paragraphs 78-79 above), indicates that he was not, at that time, suffering from any potentially fatal condition and did not then bear the bruises and scars that were subsequently observed in the post-mortem examination; like the Commission, the Court finds that at least some of these marks would have been visible to even the most casual observer and even if Yakup Akta\u015f was fully clothed at the time. The applicant's and Yakup Akta\u015f's brother, Mahmut Akta\u015f, stated before the Delegates of the Commission that he had gone to see Yakup Akta\u015f at Derik gendarmerie on the day following his arrest; he too had found Yakup Akta\u015f in apparent good health (see paragraph 189 above).",

The Court will therefore proceed on the finding that the body showed a mask-like mauve discoloration (cyanosis) starting from the upper section of the thorax, 15 cm below the jaw towards the thorax, and covering the complete surface of the neck including the ears and the back of the neck; a one- or two-day-old graze measuring 1 x 0,5 cm consistent with trauma in the frontal section of the forehead, 3 cm above the middle of the left eyebrow;\u00a0an area of ecchymosis measuring 10 x 2 cm, consistent with blunt trauma, on the outer section of the left arm humerus and parallel to the axis of the body; extensive ecchymoses on the left forearm and hand, including the fingers; an area of ecchymosis measuring 4 x 1 cm, consistent with trauma, on the outer section of the upper right arm humerus and parallel to the axis of the body; 5 cm below this, another area of ecchymosis 4\u00a0x\u00a02 cm in size; a clean cut, 8 cm in length and 3 cm in width, perpendicular to the axis of the body under the right armpit and starting near the back and trailing towards the middle of the armpit; a further ecchymotic area on the right forearm near the wrist; a widespread ecchymotic area covering one half of the outer surface of the left foot; dirt and calluses covering the soles of the feet; and an 8 cm long scar, seven to eight days old, in the shape of a half moon on the right shoulder blade.",

The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, \u0130lhan v.\u00a0Turkey [GC] no. 22277/93, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2000-VII).",

The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (for example, the Kaya judgment, cited above, \u00a7 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible (O\u011fur, cited above, \u00a7 88). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eye-witness testimony (see, concerning witnesses, for example, Tanr\u0131kulu v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 109). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0355).

While recognising that the interests of these witnesses also deserved protection under the Convention, the Court found that it ensued from this different position that police officers' anonymity should only be maintained in exceptional circumstances (judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III, p. 712, \u00a7\u00a056).

Moreover, it observes that Yusuf Karako\u00e7 gave evidence to the Mardin Assize Court (...) in proceedings which, unlike those before the Commission, were held in public.

The taking of evidence in this manner would at least have given the applicant's representatives the opportunity to observe the demeanour and comportment of the individual witnesses and have allowed them to contribute to the Delegates' taking of evidence by structuring their own questions in that light. In this respect the Commission is alarmed by the Government's comment contained in their observations mentioned above which appears to suggest that the appearance of the eleven members of the gendarmerie might well have led to their descriptions being communicated to terrorists. Insofar as this comment is directed at any of the applicant's representatives, the Commission considers that it is unbecoming, unsubstantiated and moreover in clear contradiction to the statement made by the Acting Agent of the Government during the hearing to the effect that the Government had no specific objections against any member of the applicant's team of representatives.",
