On 14 March 2001 the old CCrP was amended to permit defendants to be remanded in custody if the charge carried a sentence of at least two years' imprisonment, if they had previously defaulted, had no permanent residence in Russia or if their identity could not be ascertained. The amendments of 14 March 2001 also repealed the provision that permitted defendants to be remanded in custody on the sole ground of the dangerous nature of the criminal offence they had allegedly committed. The new CCrP reproduced the amended provisions (Articles 97 \u00a7 1 and 108 \u00a7 1) and added that a defendant should not be remanded in custody if a less severe preventive measure was available.",

The Court accepts that that factor was relevant in assessing the risk of his absconding. Such a risk, if convincingly established, may lead the judicial authorities to place and leave a suspect in detention in order to prevent any attempts to escape. It is however necessary, among other conditions, that the danger be a plausible one and the measure appropriate, in the light of the circumstances of the case and in particular the past history and the personality of the person concerned (see, mutatis mutandis, Sergey Medvedev v. Russia, no. 3194/08, \u00a7 52, 30 July 2009). In the light of this principle the Court is particularly mindful of the applicant's arguments, which were not disputed by the Government, that in 1994 he had openly moved his family from Omsk to St Petersburg and that it was not until 1999 that he had learned about the criminal charges brought against him in 1995 (see paragraph 76 above). The Government also did not dispute that those charges had been dropped in 2000 on \u201crehabilitation grounds\u201d. In this respect the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the reference to the applicant's placement on the list only appeared in the prosecution decisions extending the applicant's detention before October 2000. The domestic courts which took over the task of authorising the applicant's detention after October 2000 never mentioned his alleged attempt to abscond from criminal prosecution in 1995. The Court is therefore not convinced that in the circumstances, when the applicant was not aware of the criminal charges against him, the mere failure of the investigating authorities to find him at the place of his former residence in Omsk leading to his placement on the list of wanted persons justified the conclusion that he was liable to abscond, particularly so after the charges had been dropped on rehabilitation grounds in 2000.",

The domestic courts merely repeated the same conclusion concerning possible collusion, without citing any reason why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicant in support of his requests for release, they considered the risk of interference with witnesses and evidence to exist and be decisive. The Court is therefore not convinced that the domestic authorities' findings that the applicant was likely to pervert the course of justice, reoffend or abscond had sufficient basis in fact.",

They paid no regard to the arguments in favour of the applicant's release pending trial. It is also of particular concern to the Court that the Russian authorities persistently used a stereotyped summary formula, simultaneously extending the detention of the applicant and his co-defendants. In the Court's view, this approach is incompatible in itself with the guarantees enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in so far as it permits the continued detention of a group of persons without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention or of compliance with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement in respect of each individual member of the group (see Dolgova v.

The Court is mindful of the fact the case was pending for more than two years and ten months before the St Petersburg City Court. In particular, it took the investigating authorities less than a year to prepare the case for examination by the trial court (see paragraph 7 above). However, after the St Petersburg City Court had received the case file on 7\u00a0September 2000, it was not until 24\u00a0October 2001 that the first trial hearing was to be held (see paragraph 8 above). The following two hearings were rescheduled due to the judge's participation in other unrelated proceedings, causing an additional delay of almost three months (see paragraph 9 above). An additional aggregated delay of more than five months was caused by the lack of available courtrooms and the judge's involvement in other proceedings (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). The Court reiterates the Government's argument pertaining to the judge's heavy workload. However, Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v.  (No. 2), no. 72159/01, \u00a7 57, 4 March 2004).
