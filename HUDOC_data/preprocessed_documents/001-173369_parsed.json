An article on the matter was printed on pages 2 and 3. The third applicant was identified as its author. The headline of the article read \u201cAssistant professor entangled in police investigation\u201d and another picture of A appeared beside the headline. The article was based on information from the accountancy firm\u2019s report. It is not known how the applicants knew about the report and its contents. The article discussed inter alia A, who was a board member and one of three owners of the company and the former supervisor of the MBA programme and assistant professor of business studies at the University of Iceland. The article described the company\u00b4s situation with reference to the accountancy firm\u00b4s report. It stated that the report had concluded the company had paid for the A\u00b4s expenditures, which were unlikely to be connected to the company\u00b4s operations. The report had also indicated that A and one of his co-owners had known about the grave financial situation of the company long before it had been declared bankrupt in 2010. The report had concluded that the company\u00b4s assets had been partly expended when it was clear that it was insolvent. These assets had in fact been transferred to another company, owned by the A\u00b4s co-owner.When the company was declared bankrupt on 30\u00a0September 2010 the company owed approximately 1,100,000,000\u00a0ISK (approx. 7,150,000 euros at the time) to a large bank in Iceland.

Here it has to be taken into account that in general the media are required to base coverage on thorough research of the facts. Taking this into account, and having regard to [the absence of a formal decision by the police to investigate] [the company] and its board members, including [A], the court cannot accept [the applicant\u2019s] arguments. No police investigation had been instigated against [A], thus the statements \u201cPolice investigate Assistant Professor\u201d and \u201cAssistant professor entangled in police investigation\u201d were factually wrong, but both statements did in fact have the same meaning. It was not unreasonably difficult to verify whether such an investigation had in fact been opened. The wording of the statements was of such a nature as to make the reader believe that [A] was a suspect in a police investigation because of his criminal and punishable acts. This damaged [A\u2019s] reputation. Therefore, the court has to agree with [A] that [the applicants] violated Article 235 of the Penal Code No 19/1940 (Almenn Hegningarl\u00f6g) by publishing the aforementioned statements. In the light of the aforesaid, and with reference to Article 241(1) of the Penal Code, [A\u2019s] request to declare the statements null and void is granted.

The Court considers that A\u2019s status must be assessed in the context of considering the legitimate public interest nature of the article published by the applicants (see paragraph 52 above). In this regard the Court notes that A was an assistant professor of business studies, i.e. a university level teacher in the field, as well as chairman of the board and one of the owners of a leading industrial firm. Furthermore, the subject matter of the liquidator\u2019s report on which the article was based was the suspicion of criminal misconduct by the company\u2019s board, of which A was a member. Therefore, the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that A was fully entitled to the same level of protection as a private person wholly unknown to the public taking account of his professional position together with the subject matter of the article and his links with the issues raised (see Axel Springer AG v.

Although the compensation was not a criminal sanction, and the amount may not appear harsh, the Court reiterates that in the context of assessing proportionality, irrespective of whether or not the sanction imposed was a minor one, what matters is the very fact of judgment being made against the persons concerned, even where such a ruling is solely civil in nature. Any undue restriction on freedom of expression effectively entails a risk of obstructing or paralysing future media coverage of similar questions (see, for example, Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s v.

Only at the domestic level do the proceedings involve both of the parties whose opposing rights are at stake. Therefore, full procedural fairness and equality of arms between those parties can only be secured at the domestic level. In proceedings before this Court the configuration is not comparable, as one of the original parties to the dispute is absent and the complaint made by the other party is considered without any input from his opponent at the domestic level. While the Government, as respondents before this Court, are able to defend the domestic decisions, it is not their role to represent the other private party whose rights were also at issue in the underlying domestic proceedings, nor are they in a position to do so. The proper balancing of the opposing individual rights thus depends fundamentally on the quality of those domestic proceedings and decisions, with this Court\u2019s role being limited to a review of the domestic decisions as they stand, on the basis of the complaints and observations submitted in the present procedure. Any shortcomings in the proceedings before the domestic courts may prevent this Court from having the full picture before it and/or from considering all the aspects of the underlying domestic case, even where they might otherwise have been relevant to the analysis under the Convention.",

Although the general principles that should guide the assessment are well established, it is both clear and inevitable that the outcomes will largely depend not only on the factual circumstances of each case but on how those circumstances have been dealt with in the domestic proceedings. This in turn depends both on how the circumstances have been presented, proven and argued at the domestic level and on how they have been addressed and considered by the domestic courts. The quality of the domestic proceedings is not just important, it may be decisive for the outcome, including the outcome of the review undertaken by this Court.",

In my opinion, it is not asking too much to require that professional journalists in this field should know, and make known, matters such as the difference between someone having been reported to the police on the grounds of a suspicion of criminal conduct, and someone being the subject of an investigation opened by the police on the grounds of such a suspicion. In particular, it is not asking too much to require that any significant mistakes or inaccuracies in such (or similar) respects concerning an individual who has been publicly identified as a suspect should be subsequently corrected, at least on request.",

I can also agree with the finding that given A\u2019s position as a university-level teacher in business studies, the fact that the accountants engaged by the bankruptcy liquidator had produced a report raising suspicions of criminal wrongdoing relating to company assets on the part of the management of which A was a member, and that such a report had been submitted to the police, raised an issue of public interest of a kind that could justify his being identified to the public at that stage of the proceedings, in particular in the wider context of media coverage dealing with the aftermath of the financial crisis in the country (see paragraph 53 together with paragraph 52 of the judgment).",

In this regard, we are faced with some unaddressed questions that would, at least for me, have been relevant considerations, such as whether or not A was offered a subsequent opportunity to comment and give the public his version of the events, and whether or not the applicants continued to cover the matter to the point of also reporting to the public, at a later stage, that the police investigation had been closed without any charges being brought against A (see paragraph 20 of the present judgment).",
