He submitted that under Article\u00a0182 of the CAJ, a plaintiff\u2019s action could not be examined when it had been lodged out of time. He further submitted that the court\u2019s factual conclusions had been devoid of an evidentiary basis. In particular, there was no evidence whatsoever that the protesters had breached the law, apart from the complaints by V.Ch. and Y.S., who had given false home addresses and thus could not be identified. The applicant further complained that the court had rejected his request that those individuals be located and summoned, and that the police officers present at the site of the picket also be summoned for questioning concerning the alleged breaches of the law by the protesters. He also regretted that the court had refused his requests that the relevant police reports documenting the purported breaches of the law (if any) be produced and an inspection of the picket site be carried out with a view to determining whether the tents erected by the activists could count as \u201carchitectural structures\u201d and whether there had been any obstruction of traffic or pedestrians.

It agreed with the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and noted, in particular, that by installing the tents, the protesters had breached section\u00a016 of the Populated Localities Development Act and section\u00a018 of the Automobile Roads Act. At the same time, the Court of Appeal found that the sanction imposed on the protesters had been disproportionate. In particular, the Constitution of Ukraine generally allowed peaceful assemblies, which could therefore not be prohibited in a blanket manner. Nevertheless, it did not envisage a form of assembly such as the \u201cpicketing\u201d of administrative buildings \u201cwith the installation on the streets of small architectural structures\u201d. Accordingly, the court found that the term \u201cpeaceful assemblies\u201d in the operative part of the District Court\u2019s judgment had to be substituted with the term \u201cpickets\u201d.

As was seen in those cases, at the material time no law had yet been enacted by the Ukrainian Parliament regulating the procedure for holding peaceful demonstrations, although Articles\u00a039 and\u00a092 of the Constitution clearly required that such a procedure be established by law, that is, by an Act of the Ukrainian Parliament (see Vyerentsov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055, and Shmushkovych, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040).

The only substantive change introduced as a result of the appeal proceedings was the replacement of a sweeping injunction on organising any \u201cpeaceful assemblies\u201d in future with a supposedly more narrow prohibition on holding \u201cpickets\u201d (see ibid). At the same time, it is to be noted that the Court of Appeal neither explained the meaning of the term \u201cpicket\u201d and its correlation with the term \u201cpeaceful assembly\u201d, nor referred to any legal acts which could clarify that distinction. Likewise, no definition of the term \u201cpicket\u201d in the domestic legal order can be discerned from any other material which has been made available by the parties.
