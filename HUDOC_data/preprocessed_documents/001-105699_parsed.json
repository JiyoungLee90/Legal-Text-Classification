As to the ten-month length of the proceedings before the appeal court, the Government submitted that it had been justified since the applicant had failed on several occasions to submit admissible grounds of appeal, which had later led to the necessity to consider an extension of the time-limit for appeal.

It also takes into account the applicant\u2019s argument undisputed by the Government that all or most of the documents included in the first mailing could not be restored.
