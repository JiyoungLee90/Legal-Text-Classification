According to Professor [MA]\u2019s findings, the children\u2019s story essentially corresponds to what is stated in the mother\u2019s complaint. Moreover, the children reveal certain details to him which even the mother has not mentioned and which her children manifestly cannot have invented. Professor [MA] concludes: \u2018We are convinced that the children\u2019s visits to their father are manifestly likely to have an adverse effect on their future development. It is already clear that the immediate effect of access is that the children are extremely upset and disorientated; after the two days spent with their father, they present as anxious and aggressive. If these visits continue, we fear that both children may develop problems, in the nature of mental illness in the case of the elder and, in the case of the younger, a tendency to regress, with arrested development. We therefore request that the children should undergo a thorough psychiatric examination; that all the parties, including the father, should be interviewed; and that, pending this examination, the father\u2019s right of access be temporarily withdrawn.\u2019",

The children were examined both immediately after an access visit and at less stressful times during the week. Professor [MA] concluded: \u2018The two children confirm, independently of each other, the various types of sexual abuse which have been inflicted on them.\u2019 Could the mother have coached the children in these stories? Professor [MA] says \u2018Jan\u2019s version of events always coincides with his mother\u2019s. I see this in itself as an indication that Jan\u2019s story reflects real experiences. A child of six does not in fact yet have the intellectual capacity, in the context of a guided interview, to faithfully reproduce, exactly as it has been told to him, a story which he has been \"fed\". Furthermore, there were times when Jan replied to very specific questions with equally specific answers, which he had never given his mother (and which his mother had therefore never mentioned). Thus when asked whether \"he bites the willy when it comes into his mouth\", he answers, very specifically: \"I can\u2019t, because he (the father) puts his fingers between my teeth.\" I do not consider that a six-year-old child is capable of inventing so specific a response, nor do I believe that such specific responses could have been \"prepared\" in advance by the mother.\u2019",

His clearest memory is of the events of July 1984. He describes how Daddy sometimes used to sit on him, how Daddy used to put his sexual organ into his anus, or sometimes his mouth, and weewee. He says that Daddy threatened him, saying that he would saw Grandma and Grandpa in half, and really hurt Jan, if he said anything about it all. He says that Daddy didn\u2019t act like that when Daddy and Mummy were still together, Daddy just used to hit him; (2) Jan describes these experiences fairly readily and there are no contradictions in what he says. However, he presents as shocked and embarrassed when recounting certain things. He blushes and sometimes protests vigorously that Daddy was hurting him. He does not give the impression of making things up or merely seeking attention.\u2019",

For example, members of the X family are militants in the Stracke Noodfonds, the Marnixring, the Orde van de Prince, the Vlaamse Kulturele Produkties (an offshoot of Were Di), the Nationalistich Jong Studenten Verbond (NJSV) and the Vlaams Blok. It is a well-known fact that the X family gives financial support to the VMO. In 1971 they helped create the \u2018new\u2019 VMPO under Bert Eriksson, and at the time of the VMO trials they launched an appeal through the Stracke Noodfonds for members to make a financial contribution in support of \u2018dozens of young Flemish people facing ridiculous penalties and fines\u2019. Witnesses confirm that the cellar of the X family\u2019s house is decorated with Nazi swastika flags, the ideal d\u00e9cor for nostalgic little \u2018brown\u2019 parties.

As early as 10 January 1984 Dr [MG] sent the following results of his examination of four smear tests to a forensic medical examiner, Dr [MM]: \u2018Apart from amorphous matter, epithelial and mucous cells, I observed, in three out of the four samples, a structure with a triangular head on a long, more or less straight tail, which matches the description of spermatozoa. I observed the presence of one such structure in two of the three samples, and two in the third.\u2019 Other doctors also made the same findings. Subsequently, Professor [MA] and the court expert [MB] reach the conclusion, independently of each other, that Wim and Jan have been sexually and physically abused. The latest report is by Professor [MC]. In order to supplement an earlier report, this expert examined the children on twelve occasions between 1 August 1985 and 31 May 1986 - the elder without his mother present, Wim normally in his mother\u2019s presence because at the beginning it was practically impossible to examine him without her. As Director of \u2018Kind en Gezin in Nood\u2019 [\u2018Children and Families in Need\u2019], one of the departments of Leuvense Universitaire Ziekenhuizen [Louvain University Hospitals], Professor [MC] is one of the principal authorities in the field. In order to remain entirely uninfluenced in his work, he expressly decided to refuse any form of payment. His report contains the most horrific findings. According to it, the children have been beaten not once but several times with a spiked cudgel. This abuse is, moreover, inflicted as a form of ritual. Candles are lit; sometimes, the father wears a brown uniform and the cudgel has a \u2018sign of the devil\u2019 on it. Through the children, Professor [MC] was also able to discover where the father took his inspiration from. He found the sign of the devil in Volume I of the Rode Ridder (\u2018The Red Knight\u2019)(!), entitled De barst in de Ronde Tafel (\u2018The cleft in the Round Table\u2019). The sign is accompanied by the following text: \u2018This is the symbol of the Prince of Darkness, an unknown magician and Grand Master of Black Magic! Even before the Round Table was created, he went away and no one knows where he is today! He devotes his exceptional knowledge and power to everything that is evil and negative! His sole objective is to sow confusion and destruction. He is a symbol of the violence which reigns in these times over humanity and justice!\u2019",

We realise how delicate it is to quote from letters that were not intended for publication, but needs must when the devil drives. Professor [MA] describes how the interview went: \u2018After I had discussed my problem and my request, namely that three experts should be appointed, I quickly realised that Principal Crown Counsel wished to proceed with the case impartially and without prejudging the issues, but that Mr [YD] already had a very clear idea of what should be done - \"The children\u2019s story was made up, perhaps fed to them by the mother, and the children should be entrusted to the care of their grandparents, with the father also being involved in the process.\" Mr [YD] brushed aside my request for an expert report rather brusquely. In his view, judges had far more expertise than doctors in this field, and subjecting the children to further expert investigations and interviews could only do them more harm. Principal Crown Counsel was much more balanced in his response and considered that an expert report was indeed called for. Moreover, Principal Crown Counsel expressed serious reservations about Mr [YD]\u2019s suggestion. He said that the children\u2019s paternal grandfather, to whose care Mr [YD] proposed entrusting the children, was, and I quote, \"mad\". At every reception at which he encountered Mr X, he would see Mr X senior explaining, very clearly and without attempting to disguise his meaning, that Hitler should come back to this country. He added that this impression that the grandfather was \"mad\" was shared generally by all the guests at such receptions. And he expressly told Mr [YD] that he would consider it totally unjustified to entrust the children to the care of their paternal grandfather.\u2019",

Professor [MA] gave the following evidence in his own defence before the Ordre des M\u00e9decins [Medical Association]: \u2018He (Principal Crown Counsel) described how Mr X had been made a notary, against the advice of the judicial bodies, on the last day in office of the late Mr\u00a0[ZK] (then Minister of Justice) and that, furthermore, in a very short space of time (a few years) he had succeeded in transforming an almost defunct practice into one with an official profit of 32 million francs a year. He obviously doubted whether a notary could make such an annual profit by legal and honest means in view of the property crisis at the time, and thought he remembered that Mr X had already been the subject of legal proceedings at the time in connection with his activities as a notary.\u2019",

It is certainly none too soon. The battle between the legal and medical professions in the Wim and Jan case had reached a climax. In a final attempt to make the Antwerp magistrats see reason, four eminent experts sent a joint letter to Principal Crown Counsel [YJ], declaring on their honour that they were 100% convinced that Mr X\u2019s children were the victims of sexual and physical abuse. The professional competence of these four experts cannot be questioned - even by the  magistrats.

That interference was provided for in Articles 1382 et seq. of the Belgian Civil Code and pursued the aim of protecting the reputation of others - in this instance the reputation of the judges of the division of the Court of Appeal that had delivered the judgment - and maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary, legitimate aims under Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2).",

They attributed to the judges and the Advocate-General political ideas similar to those of the father who had been awarded custody. I consider these comments to have been very offensive to the Belgian judiciary and defamatory of the judges and Advocate-General at the Court of Appeal. The latter were intentionally accused by the applicants of having taken unjust decisions because of their friendship or their political affinities with one of the parties to the proceedings, and that amounts to an accusation of misfeasance in public office.",
