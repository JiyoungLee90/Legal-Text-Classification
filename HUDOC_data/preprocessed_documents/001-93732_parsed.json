It followed that the cooperation of claimants played an important role. The possibility of finalising the restitution process with the least delay often depended on the readiness of claimants to choose a type of restitution not involving the physical return of the property at issue and to reach an agreement with other co-owners. The Government also pointed out that, under the domestic law, the restitution process concerning the plot of land was directly related to the finalisation of the restoration of property rights to the disputed premises. As long as the exact part of the premises which was owned by the applicant was not determined, it was not possible to establish the size of the plot of land. Since the applicant to a great extent had himself obstructed the smooth restoration of property rights to the premises, this had subsequently caused delays in finalising the restitution of the land.

It follows that certain impediments to the realisation of the applicant\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions are not in themselves open to criticism. However, there is a risk that such restitution proceedings may unreasonably restrict an applicant\u2019s ability to deal with his or her possessions, particularly if such proceedings are protracted \n(see, mutatis mutandis, Luordo v. , no.\u00a032190/96, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2003IX). The state of uncertainty which an applicant may experience as a result of delays attributable to the authorities is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State\u2019s conduct (see Almeida Garrett, Mascarenhas Falc\u00e3o and Others v. Portugal, nos. 29813/96 and 30229/96, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2000I, and Broniowski v.\u00a0 [GC], no.\u00a031443/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0151 and 185, ECHR 2004V).",

Even taking into account that Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention came into force with regard to  only four years later, the applicant has still not been paid to date. The Court is not insensitive to the complexities inherent in the restitution process. However, in the present case the hindrance to the peaceful enjoyment of his property is mainly attributable to the respondent State, since the Court has already found that the related civil proceedings breached the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement (see paragraph 62 above). In the Court\u2019s view, notwithstanding the uncooperative attitude of the applicant, the overall length of the restitution proceedings upset the balance which had to be struck between the general interest in securing the disputed premises for public needs and the applicant\u2019s personal interest in the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. The interference with the applicant\u2019s right was accordingly disproportionate to the aim pursued.",

First of all, I note that the restitution process was very complicated and lengthy because of the difficult political and social conditions which emerged with the creation of new proprietary relations (see, mutatis mutandis, Kopecky v. Slovakia, [GC] no. 44912/98, \u00a7\u00a7 35, 37, ECHR 2004-IX). Judicial disputes, which were common in restitution cases, were also to be regarded as an obstacle to the rapidity of the process. It follows that the cooperation of claimants played an important role. Therefore, the possibility of finalising the restitution process with the least delay often depended on the readiness of claimants to choose a type of restitution not involving the physical return of the property at issue, and to reach an agreement with other co-owners. Of course, even accepting that some difficulties will arise for the State in the restitution process, I fully agree with the well developed jurisprudence of the Court, that a \"fair balance\" must be struck between the demands of the general interests of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights (see Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, \u00a7\u00a7 68-69, Series A no. 52), and that an excessive burden cannot be placed on the person concerned \n(see Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7 78, ECHR 1999VII). I also agree with the Court\u2019s established position that a person cannot be unreasonably placed in a situation where he cannot effectively deal with his possessions, particularly where such situations are protracted due the State authorities\u2019 fault (see paragraph 86 of the judgment).",

Turning to the present case, I note that the case file and all the documents therein show that the delay in finalising the restitution process for the disputed premises had mainly been caused by the behaviour of the applicant and his failure to effectively cooperate with the authorities. It was the applicant who had obstructed the expeditious restoration of his property rights by insisting on the return of the premises in kind, knowing that no such possibility existed (see paragraphs 66, 69-70 and 72-73 of the judgment). In addition, the applicant did not act in a cooperative manner during the civil proceedings. In particular, the civil case was suspended from 7\u00a0October 1994 until 1\u00a0July 1999 since the applicant failed to inform the Kaunas City District Court about his relative\u2019s state of health \n(see paragraphs 11, 13-14 and 22 of the judgment). Even after the Supreme Court\u2019s final decision of 26 January 2005, by which it was acknowledged that he was not entitled to the physical restitution of the disputed premises, the applicant initiated further judicial proceedings, by submitting new requests and claims to the domestic courts, whilst at the same time showing no interest in their possible outcome by, inexplicably, failing to appear before the court (see paragraphs 22 and 23 of the judgment). Moreover, the applicant failed to cooperate with the local authorities, given that he refused to accept the letter of 15\u00a0December 2008 in which the  requested him to indicate his bank account details in order to pay him compensation for the disputed premises (see paragraph 24 of the judgment).",

In my view, this aspect could have been examined separately, because it could have confirmed the conclusion of no violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the Convention. Under the domestic law, the restitution of the plot of land in this case was directly linked with the finalisation of the restoration of property rights to the premises, the latter process having been delayed by the applicant himself. I observe that, after the final decision of 21\u00a0June 2005 of the , the restitution proceedings were quite rapid. The process of cadastral delimitation and measurement was completed on 22\u00a0January 2006, and in 2007 the plot of land adjacent to the disputed premises was registered in the State Land Registry. Finally, after the applicant withdrew his administrative claim on 4\u00a0June 2008, the head of the Kaunas Regional Administration adopted a decision specifying the size and location of the plot of land, physically returned to him an area of land measuring 44 sq. m, and requested him to indicate his preferences regarding compensation for the remaining 131 sq. m of the plot. Therefore, I cannot see any unjustified delays which could be attributable to the State in finalising the restitution of the plot of land.",

In the context of the present case, I agree with the Court that the overall delay in finalising the restitution process was substantial \n(see paragraph 62 of the judgment). However, having regard to the considerations above, particularly the applicant\u2019s uncooperative attitude towards the authorities (see U\u017ekur\u0117lien\u0117 and Others v. Lithuania, \nno. 62988/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-36, 7 April 2005), which attitude negatively influenced the rights of other plaintiffs in the case (see the judgment of Igarien\u0117 and Petrauskien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no. 26892/05, 21 July 2009, not yet final), I think that there has been no infringement of the applicant\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions and that a \"fair balance\" has been struck.",
