Contrary to the case materials, on 30\u00a0July 2013 the applicant had only just been let out of the remand centre when he was immediately arrested at the exit of the detention facility. They argued that the administrative-offence record had been forged and therefore was inadmissible. Secondly, they maintained that the applicant\u2019s expulsion would amount to his \u201cextradition in disguise\u201d. They pointed out, with reference to the letter of 30\u00a0July 2013 (see paragraph\u00a019 above) that the very initiative to conduct an urgent check of the applicant\u2019s migration status had been taken by the prosecutor\u2019s office, that is the authority in charge of his extradition case. The interest the prosecutor\u2019s office displayed in the carrying out of the migration check \u2013 a matter clearly outside their competence \u2013 could be interpreted as an indication of that authority\u2019s interest in ensuring the applicant\u2019s return to Uzbekistan.

The appeal court upheld the administrative sanction as lawful and found no grounds to amend it. The court rejected the applicant\u2019s argument to the effect that he could not be removed from Russia in the absence of a final decision in the refugee-status proceedings as irrelevant, since \u201cthe examination of the respective appeal did not have a bearing on the event or the legal qualification of the administrative offence\u201d. The court further noted that, in any event, on 27\u00a0August 2013 his application for refugee status had been refused. As regards the applicant\u2019s argument about the authorities\u2019 failure to bring the administrative proceedings against him in a timely manner, the court considered that this circumstance did not constitute a ground for quashing the lower court\u2019s judgment.

Nor was the situation of his brother of relevance, since no criminal case had been opened against him in Uzbekistan. Contrary to the migration authority\u2019s findings, the applicant had not learned about the exact nature of the charges or the stage of the proceedings against him in Uzbekistan until his arrest. The fact of his border crossing in 2009 was of little relevance and did not undermine his statement that since 1999 he had not left Russia for a considerable period of time. The Moscow FMS in its decision had referred to the extradition proceedings but had omitted to note the crucial point, namely the fact that extradition had been refused in the meantime (see paragraph\u00a015 above). Lastly, the defence reiterated that the practice of torture against detainees in Uzbekistan could be described as systemic and that there was no evidence of any improvement in recent years.

He had relied on reports by UN agencies and respected international NGOs, which clearly demonstrated that individuals who, like him, were suspected of membership of Hizb ut-Tahrir were at an increased risk of ill-treatment. In particular, to demonstrate that there had not been any positive change in the humanrights situation in Uzbekistan, he had referred to the concluding observations of the UN Committee against Torture of 10\u00a0December 2013, the Human Rights Watch report released in January 2014 and the Amnesty International report of July 2013 (cited in paragraphs\u00a066, 69 and 73 above, respectively).

However, expulsion by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article\u00a03, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the individual concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article\u00a03. In such a case, Article\u00a03 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see Saadi v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a037201/06, \u00a7\u00a0125, 28\u00a0February 2008).",

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR 2005I).

The Court reiterates its constant approach that, whilst a person\u2019s failure to seek asylum immediately after arrival in another country may be relevant for the assessment of the credibility of his or her allegations, it is not possible to weigh the risk of illtreatment against the reasons put forward for expulsion (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia v.

Any such allegation always concerns an eventuality, something which may or may not occur in the future. Consequently, such allegations cannot be proven in the same way as past events. The applicant must only be required to show, with reference to specific facts relevant to him and to the class of people he belongs to, that there is a high likelihood that he would be ill-treated (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0128). Detailed submissions to that effect were made by the applicant in the present case.

As regards the admissibility of such reports, the Court has on several occasions addressed this issue in its case-law (see paragraphs\u00a083 and 85-86 above) and sees no reason to depart from its settled approach in this respect. The Court notes that the conclusions of those reports are corroborated, in particular, by the findings of the UN bodies (see paragraphs\u00a064-66 above), which were at no point disputed by the Government. Bearing in mind the authority and reputation of the authors of those reports, the fact that on the points in question their conclusions are consistent with each other and that those conclusions are corroborated in substance by other sources, the Court does not doubt their reliability (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0143; see also Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0137, and the extensive case-law cited in paragraph\u00a098 above). All these reports describe a disturbing situation and, in particular, mention numerous and regular cases of torture and illtreatment of detainees. The Court further notes that the Government have not adduced any evidence capable of rebutting the assertions made in the sources cited by the applicant (see Saadi, cited above). Having regard to the information summarised in paragraphs\u00a064-73 above, the Court cannot but confirm that the issue of illtreatment of detainees remains a pervasive and enduring problem in Uzbekistan.",

The above charges constituted the basis for the extradition request and the arrest warrant issued in respect of the applicant. The Court has examined a number of cases in which the applicants were accused of criminal offences in relation to their involvement with Hizb utTahrir (see Muminov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09498; Karimov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a054219/08, \u00a7\u00a0100, 29 July 2010; Rustamov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0126 and 127; and the very recent case of Kasymakhunov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0123).

Turning again to the assurances given by the Uzbek authorities and relied on by the Government, the Court finds, in addition to its conclusion in paragraph\u00a097 above, that they were given for the purposes of extradition proceedings that were ultimately discontinued and as such are of no direct relevance to the expulsion proceedings.",

He argued that the authorities had abused their powers by ordering his detention within the framework of administrative proceedings solely with a view to ensuring his return to Uzbekistan, notwithstanding the refusal of the extradition request. The applicant considered that his detention pending administrative removal had in any event been unlawful, as the Code of Administrative Offences set no time-limit for such detention, and no such time-limit was given by the domestic courts. He argued that the Russian law on detention pending expulsion was not sufficiently clear and foreseeable. Referring to Azimov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0172-73), the applicant argued that detention pending expulsion must not exceed the maximum term for detention as an administrative penalty, as otherwise it constituted a punitive rather than a preventive measure.",

In this connection, Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f) provides a different level of protection from Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d.

If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f). The deprivation of liberty must also be \u201clawful\u201d. Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is at issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention. To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention should be appropriate; and the length of the detention should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see A. and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a03455/05, \u00a7\u00a0164, ECHR 2009, with further references).",

However, it was not until 30\u00a0July 2013 that the applicant was released from the remand prison (see paragraph\u00a022 above).

The Court does not see any reason to disagree with that assessment and finds that the applicant\u2019s detention within the impugned period was no longer covered by Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f).

This may happen in the present case; however, it is unclear what will happen after the expiry of the twoyear timelimit, since the applicant will clearly remain in an irregular situation in terms of the immigration law and will again be liable to expulsion and, consequently, to detention on that ground (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0171).",

A remedy must be made available during a person\u2019s detention to allow that person to obtain a speedy judicial review of the legality of the detention, capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release. The existence of the remedy required by Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see Ismoilov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0145, with further references). The forms of judicial review satisfying the requirements of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 may vary from one domain to another, and will depend on the type of deprivation of liberty at issue. It is not excluded that a system of automatic periodic review of the lawfulness of detention by a court may ensure compliance with the requirements of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 (see Megyeri v.\u00a0Germany, 12\u00a0May 1992, \u00a7\u00a022, Series\u00a0A no. 237A).

As in Azimov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0151), the applicant in the present case complained under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 not about the initial decision on his placement in custody, but of his inability to obtain a judicial review of his detention after a certain lapse of time. As the Court further noted in Azimov (ibid), detention under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f) lasts, as a rule, for a significant period and depends on circumstances which are subject to change over time. Given that since the delivery of the appeal decision of 18\u00a0September 2013 the applicant has so far spent more than nine months in custody, new issues affecting the lawfulness of the detention might have arisen during that period. In such circumstances the Court considers that the requirement under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 was neither incorporated in the initial detention order of 31\u00a0July 2013 nor fulfilled by the appeal court.",
