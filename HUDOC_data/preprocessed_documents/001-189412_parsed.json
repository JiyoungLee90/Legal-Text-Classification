The 2016-2017 proceedings, brought by the defendant in military courts, were unfair, the decision to discontinue the enforcement proceedings had been taken in disregard of the earlier courts\u2019 findings on the same matter, and the final judgment in his favour still had to be executed.",

The Court notes, however, that the judgment of 13\u00a0January 2009 has not been annulled or modified. The Court further observes that in 2014-2015 the argument referred to by the Government was twice raised in the domestic proceedings and rejected by the domestic courts which found that the defendant\u2019s disagreement with the initial court\u2019s ruling was not a reason to discontinue the enforcement and that, accordingly, the possibility to execute it had not been lost (see paragraphs\u00a019 and 20 above). However, in 2016 different courts examined the same set of facts and reached a different conclusion (see paragraph\u00a022 and 26 above). Without delving into the issue of an alleged discrepancy between the courts\u2019 conclusions in the three sets of proceedings, the Court finds it sufficient to note that at least by 21\u00a0December 2016, when the authority\u2019s request to discontinue the enforcement was granted by the first instance court, the judgment of 13\u00a0January 2009 in the applicant\u2019s favour had already remained without execution for more than seven years (see, mutatis mutandis, Kotsar v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a025971/03, \u00a7\u00a028, 29\u00a0January 2009). Given that the enforceability of the judgment was twice confirmed by the domestic courts in 2014 and 2015 (see paragraphs\u00a019 and 20 above), that period was attributable to the authorities and is clearly in breach of the Convention requirements.",

That statute, which entered into force on 1\u00a0January 2017, enables those concerned to seek compensation for damage sustained as a result of excessive delays in the enforcement of court judgments ordering the domestic authorities to fulfil various obligations in kind (see Kamneva and Others, cited above). The Court has found that the amended Compensation Act in principle meets the criteria set out in the Gerasimov and Others pilot judgment and provides the applicants with a potentially effective remedy for their non-enforcement complaint (see Shtolts and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a087-116 and \u00a7\u00a0123).",
