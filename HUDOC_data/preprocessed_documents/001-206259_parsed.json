They then handcuffed him and brought him to a car and he asked them to stop cursing as he was of the Muslim faith. They then pushed him into the car and started beating him, having put a black face mask with eye holes on the back on him. They started driving to the airport, in about an hour they stopped for a bathroom break and they took the mask off after he had told them he would stay calm. For the remaining two and a half hours, he was being driven without a mask but handcuffed. At about 10 a.m. they stopped near the forest, he was handcuffed to a tree, with one of the men guarding him while two others were resting in the car. For about six to eight hours he was standing like that, being bitten by mosquitos, and no food or drink was provided to him. After that, they started driving to different pharmacies in search of some medicines that the men needed to buy. After that for about two hours he sat in the automobile near the forest. When they came to the airport, the applicant was checked in for the flight, and taken to the plane where two other plain-clothed men speaking Uzbek met him. They did not introduce themselves. They handcuffed him, put a baggy face mask on him and took his belongings away. He could not see anything once on board but he heard there were other passengers and he was taken past them in handcuffs. When the plane started taxiing for takeoff, he asked to have the handcuffs taken off. Instead, he was taken to the back of the plane, where he was punched several times. He was told not to talk to anyone and not to look anywhere. In about thirty to fifty minutes, his mask was taken off, the meal was served and he ate for the first time that day. Then [the officers] searched his belongings and questioned him.",

Furthermore, the search and arrest warrant and extradition request submitted by the Uzbek authorities were clear as to their basis, namely that he was accused of religiously and politically motivated crimes. The Russian authorities were therefore presented with evidence capable of proving that the applicant belonged to a vulnerable group of persons who were systematically exposed to a practice of ill-treatment in Uzbekistan in breach of Article 3 of the Convention and whose removal would expose them to a real risk of such ill-treatment (Mamazhonov v.

Furthermore, given the lack of access to documents and to his lawyer and the haste with which his deportation was carried out, the Court considers that the applicant did not have any meaningful opportunity to have the domestic courts review his case and assess his claims in the context of refugee status or deportation proceedings (see paragraphs 8, 21, 26 and 31 above). The perfunctory review of the applicant\u2019s request for refugee status together with absence of any possibility for the applicant to lodge an appeal against such decision or against the deportation order cleared the way for the applicant\u2019s deportation.

The Court notes that the applicant has been charged with participation in a banned religious organisation by the Uzbek authorities. The Court has previously established that individuals whose extradition was sought by Uzbek authorities on charges of religiously or politically motivated crimes constituted a vulnerable group facing a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention in the event of their removal to Uzbekistan (see Mamazhonov and follow-up cases of N.M.; S.S.\u00a0and others; B.U. and others; T.M. and others, all cited above). The present case is identical to those cases, given the nature of the charges against the applicant, the manner in which the indictment was issued against the applicant, the way the deportation was carried out and lack of sufficient safeguards against the arbitrary actions of the authorities. The Court finds no reason in the present case to depart from its earlier findings on the matter. While the Court notes with attention the cautious indications of improvement included in the independent reports (see paragraph 42 above), nothing in the parties\u2019 submissions in the present case or the relevant material from independent international sources provides at this moment a sufficient basis for a conclusion that the persons prosecuted for religiously motivated crimes no longer run such a risk.",

In that report he described in detail the circumstances in which his deportation had been carried out and the ill-treatment to which he had been allegedly subjected (see paragraph 35 above). The authorities thus were placed under an obligation to conduct an effective inquiry of the applicant\u2019s plausible claim of ill-treatment, satisfying the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention (see Lyapin v. Russia, no. 46956/09, \u00a7\u00a7 125-27, 24\u00a0July 2014). However, the Court observes from the material of the case file that no significant procedural steps were taken to examine the applicant\u2019s report of crime for almost seven months. Only on 21\u00a0February 2019 the pre-investigation inquiry in connection with the complaint concerning the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant was opened and on 24 February 2019 it was extended until 23 March 2019, owing to the need to collect additional documents and carry out additional investigative steps (see paragraphs 36-37 above). The Court was not informed whether the officers of the MVD in Lipetsk Region or other persons were questioned in connection with the applicant\u2019s alleged ill-treatment, whether the requisite inquiries were made or documents collected and examined. The progress and/or outcome of those proceedings remain unclear to the Court, given that the parties did not submit any arguments or evidence in this regard (see paragraph 38 above).",

Article 34 will be breached if the authorities of a Contracting State fail to take all steps which could reasonably have been taken in order to comply with the interim measure indicated by the Court. In examining a complaint under Article 34 concerning the alleged failure of a Contracting State to comply with an interim measure, the Court will not re-examine whether its decision to apply interim measures was correct. It is for the respondent Government to demonstrate to the Court that the interim measure was complied with or, in an exceptional case, that there was an objective impediment which prevented compliance and that the Government took all reasonable steps to remove the impediment and to keep the Court informed about the situation (see Kamaliyevy v. Russia, no. 52812/07, \u00a7\u00a7 71-74, 3\u00a0June 2010).",

In particular, the Court notes at least two delays in the domestic proceedings that were unjustified, that cannot be attributed to the applicant and that, in the Court\u2019s opinion, facilitated the applicant\u2019s deportation in spite of interim measures indicated by the Court. Firstly, the Court notes that it took the applicant\u2019s lawyer Ms R., for reasons independent of her actions, two weeks to obtain a certified power of attorney from the administration of the correctional colony and she obtained it only two days before deportation (see paragraph 18 above). This delay prevented her from dealing on the applicant\u2019s behalf with migration authorities and/or domestic courts in a timely manner. Secondly, a copy of the deportation order was provided to the applicant and his lawyers belatedly, which, together with lack of any official explanation on the matter from the migration authorities, precluded the applicant from submitting in time a substantiated request under Rule 39 to the Court (see paragraphs 8, 19-21 and 26 above). The Court also finds alarming the fact that the applicant\u2019s whereabouts on the day of his deportation were unaccounted for and he was deprived of any contact with his lawyers who were unsuccessfully trying to locate him. In addition, the Court notes the applicant deportation took place despite the order of the domestic court that had suspended it (see paragraph 32 above).",

Russia, no. 20999/14, \u00a7 92, 21 May 2015, with further references). Furthermore, in the recent case of O.O. v. Russia, cited above, in which the applicant\u2019s transfer to Uzbekistan had also occurred in the course of enforcement of a deportation order, the Court held that the Russian Government had not complied with an indication of an interim measure and nothing had objectively impeded that compliance (see O.O. v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059-63). Against this background, the Court considers that the deportation of the applicant in the present case did not result from the applicant\u2019s alleged tardiness or shortage of processing time as the Government claimed. The conduct of the domestic authorities in respect of the applicant, including delays in certifying the power of attorney and failure to provide timely a copy of deportation order to him showed, in the Court\u2019s opinion, their strong determination to deport the applicant immediately upon his release from the correctional colony.",
