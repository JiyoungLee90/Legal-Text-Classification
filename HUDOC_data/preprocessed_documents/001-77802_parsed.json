The Court also notes a delay of approximately two and a half years caused by the Court's inability to obtain an expert report in 2002-2005 (see paragraphs 16-21 above). The Court is not called upon to determine the reason for the delay in the preparation of the report (either there were certain difficulties in financing the expert work or the expert report was merely lost in September 2002, etc.), because Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v. , no. 30546/96, \u00a7\u00a057, 3 October 2000).

He also did not provide the Court with any document (copies of contracts with a lawyer or a translator, vouchers or receipts) to substantiate his claims relating to legal and translation expenses. Therefore, the Court makes no award in respect of those claims.
