He stated that their village had been subjected to unprovoked shelling by the military unit stationed next to Engenoy in the Nozhay-Yurt district. As a result of the deliberate actions of the military servicemen who had launched around twelve to fifteen bombs, four families and their houses had been destroyed, six people had been wounded and two had been killed.

He provided information about the people who had been killed and wounded during the shelling and stated that on 24\u00a0August 2001 he and a number of other representatives of the local community had gone to the military base in Engenoy and spoken with them in an effort to prevent any bombing.

In the case at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigation has been ongoing for years without there being any significant developments as to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of the applicant\u2019s brother. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that the investigation has been plagued by a combination of defects similar to those described in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012325). The proceedings included several decisions to suspend the investigation; those suspensions were followed by periods of inactivity, which further diminished the prospects of solving the crime. No prompt and thorough measures have been taken to identify and question the servicemen who could have witnessed the abduction from the checkpoint or military commander\u2019s office or could have been involved in it.",
