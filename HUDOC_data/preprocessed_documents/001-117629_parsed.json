Absent a relevant and sufficient reason, a person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial (see Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2003IX (extracts); Becciev v. Moldova, no. 9190/03, \u00a7 53, 4 October 2005; and Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no. 5829/04, \u00a7 182, 31 May 2011). Where such relevant and sufficient grounds exist, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings, since the initial grounds for pre-trial detention become less and less relevant over time (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a0772/95, \u00a7 153, ECHR 2000IV). The State must consider alternative preventive measures, such as bail, to ensure appearance before the court (see Jablonski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7 83, 21 December 2000). It is of particular importance that people not be exposed to dubious police and prosecutorial practices even if charged with a serious crime. Sheer lack of proper promptness in the handling of criminal affairs, irrespective of the reason, cannot normalise long pre-trial detention. The requirement that the length of detention pending trial be limited is closely related to the presumption of innocence. There is a clear danger that this detention will be misused; its continuation cannot be used to anticipate a custodial sentence. Even if an accused makes use of his right not to \u201ccooperate with the authorities,\u201d although this may indeed delay the \u201cprogress of the investigation\u201d it is not acceptable that he should be made to \u201cbear the consequences\u201d by having his detention prolonged (see dissenting opinion of Judge De Meyer, W. v , 26 January 1993, Series A no. 254A). In determining whether the detention of an accused person exceeds a reasonable limit, it is for the national judicial authorities to seek all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty (Neumeister v. Austria, 27 June 1968, [Law Part] \u00a7 4, Series A no. 8). In the evaluation of continuing detention it is crucial to recall at all times that the public interest considerations of continued detention should be understood as a \u201cdeparture from the rule of respect for individual liberty\u201d (Yagci and Sargin v. Turkey, no. 16419/90, \u00a7 50, 8 June 1995). Bearing in mind the force of inquisitorial habits in many legal systems, these considerations must animate the above rules and should guide the Court in the application of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in all cases.",

They must examine all the facts that support or oppose the existence of the public interest which justifies a departure from the rule in Article 5, and must explicitly set out these reasons in their decisions on applications for release.

But domestic authorities cannot make this assessment in the abstract; they must assess a number of case-specific factors, among them the person\u2019s character, morals, home, occupation, assets, family ties and links with the country in which he is prosecuted. The mere possibility of a heavy sentence and the weight of the evidence are not in themselves sufficient to offset these factors (see Neumeister, cited above, \u00a7 10, and Piruzyan v. Armenia, no. 33376/07, \u00a7 94-95, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). Furthermore, when the only remaining reason for continued detention is the fear that the accused will abscond and thereby subsequently avoid appearing for trial, his release pending trial must be ordered if it is possible to obtain from him guarantees that will ensure such appearance (see Wemhoff v. Germany, 27 June 1968, \u00a7 15, Series A no.\u00a07).

While the reasonable time cannot be assessed in the abstract (see, mutatis mutandis, the St\u00f6gm\u00fcller judgment cited above, p. 40, \u00a7 4), in a review of 69 Article 5 \u00a7 3 judgments provided by S. Trechsel, former President of the European Commission of Human Rights, there is only one case where a 4year detention was not found to have resulted in a finding of a violation (W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, Series A no. 254A). Governments have often leaned on their own assessments of the complexity of the case, or made unfounded allegations about the risk of witness tampering, in order to excuse a lengthy delay \u2013 and the Court has often rejected those arguments (for one such list of violations, in a case where a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 was found because of lengthy detention despite complexity, see Dirdizov v. Russia, no. 41461/10, \u00a7\u00a7 102-08, 27 November 2012). Indeed, this Court has found violations in complex cases when the applicant was detained for far less time. For instance, in Toth v. Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7\u00a7 74-78, Series A no. 224, the Court found that a violation of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 arose from 11 months of inactivity before trial, and the complexity of the case (voluminous evidence spanning several countries, as well as multiple charges and defendants) did not justify the unreasonably long detention.",

In that case (which involved a period of detention shorter than in the present case), the applicant was a resident of another country, had absconded once already, and had tried to exert pressure on two other accused parties (ibid. \u00a7\u00a7 8-10). The Tomecki Court qualified its reasoning by pointing out that \u201cin the special circumstances of the case, the risk flowing from the nature of the applicant\u2019s criminal activities actually existed and justified holding him in custody for the relevant period\u201d (\u00a7 35, emphasis added). That case is a poor analogy; \u2013in the present case the applicant was eventually granted bail, and arguments about the possibility of his absconding were largely speculative.",

Russia, no. 45100/98, \u00a7 106, 8 February 2005). Having in mind the nature of the case (namely, a serious corruption case), it was reasonable to believe that the risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding persisted throughout his pre-trial detention. The domestic courts\u2019 reasoning that the contacts with other customs officers, which the applicant had through his work made in Serbia and abroad, might have enabled him to abscond does not appear arbitrary.\u201d",

Moreover, the Court itself relies on the contrary finding of the Supreme Court, which already on 19 November 2007 held that the grounds of the serious nature of the offences with which the applicant had been charged and the severity of the penalty which could be imposed had not been satisfied in the applicant\u2019s case (paragraph 51).",

Spain, 13 July 1995, \u00a7 64, Series A no.\u00a0321). But the risk of absconding is generally a more specific one: for example, in Van der Tang, the applicant (just like Tomecki, see above) was a non-resident foreigner, lacking links or property in the country, and with a family and roots in another country. (Moreover, he did abscond later.) These are facts \u2013 unlike the mere speculation of the Serbian courts \u201cthat the applicant might have had\u201d foreign contacts as a customs officer. More importantly, such assumption about the risk of absconding based on foreign links cannot in itself be considered to be a sufficient ground to justify the detention. It remains to be ascertained whether the national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (see Van der Tang, \u00a7 67). This matter is simply not discussed in the judgment. Instead the Court is satisfied with a reference to the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning, in the sense that in the light of the applicant\u2019s [assumed] contacts with other customs officers abroad that reasoning \u201cdoes not appear arbitrary\u201d. But appearance of lack of arbitrariness (consisting in the \u201cnot unreasonable\u201d nature of assumptions) is certainly not the same as \u201csufficient\u201d when it comes to justifying 45 months of pre-trial detention, especially if one realises that the very institution of detention is a \u201cdeparture from the rule of respect for individual liberty.\u201d Even if the evaluation of the applicant\u2019s flight risk was based on the assessment that he had contacts abroad, rather than on stereotyped generalities, this in itself should justify neither the excessive delay in determining bail, nor the failure to consider alternative preventive measures (see Jablonski, cited above, \u00a7 83).",
