The court sentenced the applicant to three months' imprisonment and to a fine of 54,525,000\u00a0Turkish Liras (TRL). In the same judgment, the court commuted the sentence of imprisonment to a fine. The applicant was therefore fined to a total of TRL 381,495,000. On 20 May 2004 the \u0130zmir Criminal Court of General Jurisdiction dismissed the applicant's appeal without holding a hearing. This decision was served on the applicant on 7 September 2004. The applicant paid the fine on 5\u00a0December 2004.",
