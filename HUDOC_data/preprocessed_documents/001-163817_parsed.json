This was confirmed by the positioning of her mobile phone at the time of the accident, her phone call records and P.\u2019s statement. It was established that the applicant together with the other accused had submitted false information to the insurance company concerning the occurrence of an insured event, the persons who had been involved in the traffic accident, and the circumstances of the accident.

It was established by the Tartu County Court\u2019s ruling of 3 December 2008 ... that the [applicant] had not been at the scene of the traffic accident and that it had been staged. Nevertheless, ... the [applicant] submitted to the [insurance company] a statement containing false information and a claim for compensation for damage caused by an alleged insurance event. The [applicant] was charged with an offence under Article 212 \u00a7 1 of the [Penal Code], namely intentionally causing an insured event to happen and creating the illusion of the occurrence of an insured event with the intention of obtaining compensation from the insurer.

Under the rule of law, only the commission of an act having the characteristics of an offence justifies \u2012 under certain conditions \u2012 the imposition of obligations of a penalising nature on a suspect or an accused without their having been convicted by a court.",

The court went on to state that discontinuance of criminal proceedings under Article 202 of the CCrP therefore has a certain inculpatory effect in respect of the person concerned. The Supreme Court also explained that even though the discontinuance of criminal proceedings under Article 202 of the CCrP has an inculpatory effect of this nature in respect of the person, a ruling on the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings under Article 202 of the CCrP is not founded on the same kind of evidentiary basis and legal analysis as that required for court judgments. Therefore, when making a judgment on the merits (in respect of another party to the proceedings), it may emerge that the prosecution version on the basis of which the criminal proceedings were discontinued was not in fact true and the person\u2019s behaviour did not actually involve any elements of a punishable act. In this situation, relying on the principle of legality, it is necessary that the person against whom the ruling ordering discontinuance of the criminal proceedings has been made should have the possibility of requesting revision of that ruling. Such revision is possible through a reopening of the proceedings.",

The fact that the ruling in question was not subject to appeal was justifiable first and foremost by the consent given by the accused. Giving consent meant that the accused was entirely aware of all the consequences of the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings \u2013 by giving consent to the discontinuance of the proceedings the accused also agreed that his case would not be examined in general or summary proceedings and no substantive judgment concerning the issue of their guilt would be made. Thus, the decision made under Article 202 of the CCrP meant arrival at a final consensus and the achievement of a legal settlement in the particular case. Giving a party the right of appeal for the purpose of contesting such a decision would have been contrary to the aims sought by the legislator. The Supreme Court observed that the precondition for such an interpretation is that in cases of discontinuance of criminal proceedings for reasons of expediency, the accused must be notified of all the circumstances with regard to which the court must express an opinion. If the court has any doubt with regard to the notification in question, it has the right to return the criminal case to the prosecutor\u2019s office for continuation of the proceedings. Also, as regards the right of appeal against a ruling on the discontinuance of criminal proceedings under Article 202 of the CCrP, regardless of the general prohibition on appeal, appeal lies against a ruling \u2012 or a part thereof \u2012 which was made without the consent of the accused.",

The civil case had been decided by a different composition of judges and according to the rules of civil procedure. Under those rules, it had been for the parties to present evidence to the courts to support their claims and allegations. A decision delivered in criminal proceedings was \u2012 according to these rules \u2012 treated as documentary evidence on an equal footing with any other piece of evidence. The civil courts relied on the aforementioned decisions only because the applicant had not presented in the civil proceedings any evidence on her part to prove that an insured event had in fact occurred, even though she had been at liberty to do so.

It could therefore have become apparent in the subsequent proceedings that she had not committed the offence of which she had been accused. The applicant also stressed that she had never pleaded guilty to the charges against her. She alleged that the only reason she had consented to the discontinuance of the proceedings and had never contested the imposition of public law obligations was to prevent a long trial, additional discomfort and further costs. She had done so because at the time she had been raising a small child on her own. As to the subsequent civil proceedings and, more precisely, to the burden of proof in those proceedings, the applicant considered that, in the light of the foregoing, the decisions delivered in the criminal proceedings had not constituted sufficient evidence to prove that she had staged the traffic accident.

The Government further explained that the decisions delivered in the criminal proceedings concerning the accident had been treated as documentary evidence in the civil proceedings (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above). In the civil proceedings the applicant had not submitted any information to the domestic courts to prove the opposite of what had been established about the events in the ruling ordering discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against the applicant and the judgment of 3 December 2008. She had merely stood by her argument that the ruling ordering discontinuance of the proceedings had meant that she had not been involved in an insurance fraud. However, this position had been incorrect in the light of the applicable law and her consent to the discontinuance of the proceedings. The domestic courts had thus had only two pieces of evidence concerning the alleged insured event: the 3 December 2008 ruling ordering discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against the applicant and the judgment of the same date whereby the three co-defendants were convicted. On the basis of the evidence put before them, the domestic courts had rightly found that the applicant had not succeeded in proving her allegations about the traffic accident.

The Court observes that this disagreement concerns a question of interpretation of domestic law. It is primarily a matter for the national authorities, in particular the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. The Court is required to verify whether the way in which domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the principles of the Convention, as interpreted in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 190-91, ECHR 2006-V). It has to examine the circumstances of how this provision was applied in the applicant\u2019s case. That is to say that the Court has to examine how exactly the criminal proceedings against the applicant were discontinued in practice (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above). Nevertheless, it can be gleaned from the plain wording of the article in question (see paragraph 19 above) that the discontinuance required, among other things, an assessment of whether or not an offence had been committed and the conclusion that the guilt of the accused had been negligible. It also required the consent of the accused and that the ruling ordering discontinuance be delivered by a judge acting at the request of a prosecutor. Domestic case-law shows that, while discontinuance under this provision does not amount to conviction, it does not amount to an acquittal either, and that discontinuance has some inculpatory effect (see paragraphs 20\u201323 above). The Court is satisfied that the applicant, who was represented by a defence counsel of her own choosing, was aware, or at least ought to have been aware, of the potential nature of the discontinuance in accordance with this provision.",

In those proceedings it had been established that the applicant\u2019s car had been involved in a staged accident and that the applicant had submitted false information about the event to the insurance company and the authorities. The applicant\u2019s civil action also followed the performance of the obligations imposed on her in the ruling ordering discontinuance of the criminal proceedings. It is because of this and the circumstances referred to in paragraphs 47 to 49 above that the present case differs from cases where the subsequent proceedings followed on from a discontinuance of criminal proceedings because of insufficient evidence (Capeau v. Belgium, no. 42914/98, ECHR 2005I) or because of want of proof and the prosecution having been time-barred (Grabchuk v. Ukraine, no. 8599/02, 21 September 2006). For the same reasons the present case is different from Panteleyenko v. Ukraine (no. 11901/02, 29\u00a0June 2006), where the proceedings were discontinued because of the insignificance of the offence, but where the decision to discontinue was taken at the pre-trial stage by a prosecutor, and the applicant at all times actively denied having committed the offence.",

The task of the civil courts was to assess, based on the evidence put before it in adversarial proceedings, whether on the balance of probabilities the applicant\u2019s allegations that a genuine traffic accident had happened were supported by sufficient proof. The Court does not find it unreasonable that the applicant was required to prove the truth of her allegations. The discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against the applicant could not result in a dispensation from the obligation of having to prove her insurance claim in accordance with the applicable domestic rules regarding the burden of proof.",

The applicant argued that the fact of the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings had in itself amounted to sufficient proof of her position. As is apparent from the documents submitted to the Court, the applicant did not submit any other evidence in support of her assertion that a genuine traffic accident had taken place. At the same time, the defendant in the civil proceedings, that is to say the insurance company, submitted to the courts the judgment by which the applicant\u2019s co-accused had been convicted. The defendant argued that those two decisions from the criminal proceedings, taken together, were sufficient to refute the applicant\u2019s assertion that there had been a genuine traffic accident. The domestic courts, which were required to decide whether the applicant had properly discharged her burden of proof, were thus faced with mutually exclusive arguments regarding the assessment of the same evidence. As to the evidentiary value in civil proceedings of the decisions delivered in criminal proceedings, the Court accepts that those decisions must be treated on an equal footing with other types of evidence (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above). It also notes that the findings in those decisions constituted rebuttable positions (see paragraph 26 above).",

Firstly, to a large extent the language simply followed that of Article 202 of the CCrP and the Supreme Court\u2019s understanding of the same provision. Secondly, the domestic courts\u2019 judgments, and especially that of the Court of Appeal, did not refer to the applicant as a convicted person. Thirdly, the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment leaves no doubt that the applicant\u2019s claim was rejected due to her failure to discharge her burden of proof. The Court of Appeal\u2019s clarification of what at first sight appeared to follow from the decisions taken in the criminal proceedings was necessary in order to explain what the applicant had failed to disprove.",
