However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

In the present case, since the trial judgment had ordered that the five-year prison term be counted from the day of the applicant\u2019s arrest on 29 January 2001, in 2005 the national court ordered his early release, noting that he had already served most of his sentence and \u201chad a permanent place of residence\u201d (see paragraph 28 above, and Arefyev v. , no. 29464/03, \u00a7\u00a071, 4\u00a0November 2010).",

The courts should have analysed pertinent factors, such as the advancement of the investigation or judicial proceedings, the applicant\u2019s personality, his behaviour before and after the arrest and any other specific indications justifying the fear that he might abuse his regained liberty by carrying out acts aimed at falsifying or destroying evidence or manipulating victims (see W. v.

In the present case, the detention courts relied on the alleged threats to witnesses in the criminal case. In the Court\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s personal testimony was essential for dealing with this aspect of the case.
