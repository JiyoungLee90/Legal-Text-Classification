The States were free to choose how to correct the breach of individual applicants\u2019 Convention rights, provided that the means chosen were compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment.

A person\u2019s rights could also be secured by administrative decisions and domestic court practices. Both the KGB Act and the Strasbourg Court\u2019s judgment were in force in Lithuania.

It observed that on 21\u00a0February 2007 the \u0160iauliai Employment Office had issued him with a document certifying that he had been registered as a job seeker since 14\u00a0June 1999 and had not been employed because of the restrictions applied to him (see paragraph 17 above). The appellate court noted that in response to its request to explain the reasons for the first applicant\u2019s unemployment in more detail, on 28\u00a0December 2007 the \u0160iauliai Employment Office had provided the appellate court with another document stating that on 14 June 1999 an individual plan for the first applicant\u2019s employment had been prepared with a view to employing him as a lawyer (in-house lawyer; juriskonsultas), because he had more than ten years\u2019 work experience in different companies and institutions in the city of \u0160iauliai. From 1999 to 2004, more than thirty\u00a0posts for in-house lawyers had been created in \u0160iauliai, for which a university degree in law was required and the salary was just higher than minimal salary. The advertisements for those posts had been shown to the first applicant, but he had not been given any of those jobs because the employers considered that he lacked the relevant qualifications. The \u0160iauliai Employment Office could therefore no longer offer the first applicant other in-house lawyer posts. To increase his chances of finding a job, at the end of 2003 the first applicant had attended computer literacy courses and courses for professional training in the field of administrative work. In 2004 a new individual plan had been compiled together with the first applicant, so that, because he so wished, he could obtain the job of business manager (komercijos vadybininkas). The \u0160iauliai Employment Office then named six\u00a0companies which refused the first applicant the job of business manager, administrator and sales manager because other candidates had been chosen or because he lacked knowledge of the English language.",

The court deemed it proper to rely on the report of 28\u00a0December 2007 as it was more recent and, in the court\u2019s opinion, more comprehensive and explanatory. It concluded that the restrictions which the KGB Act imposed on a person\u2019s ability to find employment in certain areas of the private sector had not been applied to the first applicant. The existence of the KGB Act, as such, had not violated his rights and did not entitle him to compensation. The Supreme Administrative Court determined that there was no proof that, after the Court\u2019s judgment of 27\u00a0July 2004, the first applicant had been prevented from obtaining a private sector job because of the restrictions related to the KGB Act. Furthermore, he had not provided any particular information as to who had refused to employ him on the basis of those restrictions and when. It followed that the first applicant had not managed to secure a job because of the local labour-market situation. Moreover, there was no information that he had attempted to find a job in another manner, that is to say not only relying on the assistance of the \u0160iauliai Employment Office, but had been refused a job because of the legislative restrictions. To give rise to a violation of the Convention, a breach of a person\u2019s rights had to be real, and not hypothetical. Given that there was no proof that after the Court\u2019s judgment of 27 July 2004 the first applicant could not obtain a job because the KGB Act remained unchanged, and having concluded that his right to work in the private sector could no longer be restricted because of the direct applicability of the Convention, the first applicant\u2019s claim for damages had to be dismissed.",

During that time the third\u00a0applicant had worked in companies specialising in other fields, such as railways and television. Moreover, the activities of the telecommunications company had also evolved. In the court\u2019s view, because he lacked appropriate qualifications and foreign language skills, after such a long time the third applicant would no longer be competent to work as a lawyer in that company. The court also noted that at that time the third applicant was working in another company, without specifying what that company was, and therefore had a source of income. The Regional Court also noted the continuing conflict between the third applicant and the company, which could be another reason not to reinstate him to his former job at Omnitel. Lastly, the court observed that the KGB Act was still in force. In the court\u2019s view, should the third applicant be reinstated, the question of his dismissal could arise de novo, or his employer would face the risk of administrative penalties.

However, it was to be noted that the Court had already awarded him more than LTL 120,000 for both past and future pecuniary loss. Moreover, after his dismissal from Omnitel, the third applicant had worked in different jobs and had received more than LTL 90,000 in salary.

In the third applicant\u2019s case the salary in Omnitel would amount to LTL 145,440 (LTL 4,040 a month for thirty-six months).

This was all the more likely to happen since the Constitutional Court had recognised Article 2 of the KGB Act as constitutional in its ruling of 4\u00a0March 1999, that is before the third applicant was dismissed. Even though the Court had found a violation in the third applicant\u2019s case, the KGB Act was still in force, and therefore the third applicant\u2019s reinstatement was barred. Furthermore, in the judgment of 17\u00a0March 2005 the Court had not ordered Lithuania to amend the KGB Act. Nor had the Court ordered the Lithuanian courts to have the third applicant reinstated in his previous job. In his written reply to this last argument, the third applicant observed that the Republic of Lithuania, by not appealing against the Court\u2019s judgment to the Grand Chamber, had shown its agreement with the interpretation and application of the Convention in the Rainys and Gasparavi\u010dius judgment.

This circumstance is not to be questioned when resolving the dispute in the domestic court. Despite the fact that there was no fault in the actions of [the State Security Department or Omnitel], which were implementing the obligations stemming from the KGB Act, the undertaking to implement the provisions of the Convention constituted a legal ground for the courts of the first and appellate instances to conclude that the applicant\u2019s dismissal was unlawful.

For that reason, the first applicant lodged complaints with the administrative courts in 2000, asking to be reinstated in the civil service. Similarly, in 2006, after the Court\u2019s judgment in his favour, he had again sued the State for damages. In contrast, should a private sector employer refuse to hire a person, he or she would have to address the courts of general jurisdiction, beginning with a district court and, if need be, going up to the Supreme Court as the court of cassation. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s position, as regards the rights of former KGB employees under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention, after the Court\u2019s judgment of 27\u00a0July 2004, was plain: while the KGB Act was still in force, the question of reinstating the third applicant to his job could not be resolved favourably (see paragraph 58 above). The first applicant had no knowledge of any Supreme Court case-law to the opposite effect. That being so, and taking into account that the lower courts of general jurisdiction were bound to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law and guidelines, the first applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life would not be defended in court.",

He disputed the Government\u2019s argument that the provisions of the Lithuanian employment legislation were unfavourable to his reinstatement.

The Government also considered that the private companies that had refused the first applicant a job did not fall within those areas of the private sector mentioned in Article 2 of the KGB Act. On this last point, the Government also suggested that the first applicant had merely speculated on the basis of the non-amendment of the KGB Act. In reality, he himself had often refused various job offers. Lastly, he had terminated his employment search with the \u0160iauliai Employment Office several days before the formal restrictions ceased to be valid.

For the Supreme Court, reopening the civil proceedings, in accordance with Article 366 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code, was one such means. Above all, when modifying the reasoning of the lower courts, the Supreme Court had directly relied on the Court\u2019s judgment of 7\u00a0April 2005 and acknowledged that the third applicant\u2019s dismissal because of his status as a former KGB employee had been unlawful under the Convention (see paragraph 58 above).",

The Government also pointed out that the Court\u2019s judgment in no way implied an obligation to reinstate the third applicant in his previous job in the private telecommunications company. On the contrary, the Court had awarded just satisfaction to the third applicant not only for unlawful dismissal, but also in respect of future pecuniary loss. Furthermore, under the domestic law there were two alternative means to remedy unlawful dismissal. If, following unlawful dismissal, reinstatement was not possible, Article 297 of the Labour Code provided for compensation. Both alternatives were considered to be equal and could be availed of when defending the employment rights of an unlawfully dismissed employee. To that end, the courts examining the case, when choosing between the alternatives, were not bound by the demands of the parties to the case. Under Article 418 of the Code of the Civil Procedure, the courts had the power to choose, on their own initiative, to apply the alternative means to defend the rights of the employee and to pay compensation instead (see paragraph 68 above). The Supreme Court even addressed the issue of compensation for the Convention violation, but given that that compensation had already been paid by the State following the Court\u2019s judgment, there was no basis for making a second award on the same grounds.",

Furthermore, the Court has previously held, both in the reasoning and in the operative part, that there had been a violation of a substantive provision of the Convention \u2013 in that instance Article 8 \u2013 taken together with Article 46, in a follow-up case after the Court had previously found a violation in the same applicant\u2019s case (see Emre v. Switzerland (no. 2), cited above). As in the present case, the solution adopted in Emre (no. 2) was in line with the Court\u2019s Grand Chamber judgment in Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v.\u00a0Switzerland (no. 2) (cited above), in so far as the Court found that it had jurisdiction to examine whether a decision delivered by a domestic court following the finding of a violation in Strasbourg satisfied the requirements of Article 46. However, it went further, since in the Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) case, the Grand Chamber did not formally find a violation of Article 46. The findings of the Court in Emre (no. 2) were made within the context of new proceedings at domestic level which directly confronted the national courts with interpreting and applying the Court\u2019s previous judgment in the applicant\u2019s case. The Court thus considered that \u201cthe most natural execution of its judgment, and that which would best correspond to the principle of restitutio in integrum, would have been to annul purely and simply, with immediate effect, the exclusion measure ordered against the applicant\u201d (see Emre (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 75).",

Although the Court can examine whether measures taken by a respondent State in execution of one of its judgments are compatible with the substantive clauses of the Convention (see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 6168 and 7898), it has consistently ruled that it does not have jurisdiction to verify, by reference to Article 46 \u00a7 1, whether a Contracting Party has complied with the obligations imposed on it by one of the Court\u2019s judgments (see Akdivar and Others v.

Secondly, although the abrogation of the KGB Act of 1999 must have constituted the most appropriate general measure for the Government to remedy the domestic legal situation forming the basis of the Court\u2019s judgments of 2004 and 2005, it is for the Committee of Ministers under Article 46 of the Convention to supervise the execution of such general measures.",

However, the Court emphasises that the State-imposed restrictions on a person\u2019s opportunity to find employment with a private company for reasons of lack of loyalty to the State cannot be justified from the Convention perspective in the same manner as restrictions on access to their employment in the public service (see Sidabras and D\u017eiautas, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58). Moreover, the very belated nature of the Act, imposing the impugned employment restrictions on the applicants a decade after the Lithuanian independence had been re-established and the applicants\u2019 KGB employment had been terminated, counts strongly in favour of a finding that the application of the Act vis-\u00e0-vis the applicants amounted to a discriminatory measure (loc. cit., \u00a7 60). The respondent Government have thus failed to disprove that the applicants\u2019 inability to pursue their former professions as, respectively, a lawyer in a private telecommunications company and barrister, and their continuing inability to find private-sector employment on the basis of their \u201cformer KGB officer\u201d status under the Act, constitutes a disproportionate and thus discriminatory measure, even having regard to the legitimacy of the aims sought after (see, mutatis mutandis, Sidabras and D\u017eiautas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51-62).",

The Court cannot overlook the fact that the first document issued by the \u0160iauliai Employment Office mentioned that the first applicant \u201chad not been employed because of applicable restrictions\u201d (see paragraph 17 above). That being so, the reasons for his unemployment were explained in more detail in the \u0160iauliai Employment Office\u2019s 28 December 2007 written response to the Supreme Administrative Court. On the basis of that information the Supreme Administrative Court concluded that there was no proof that, after the Court\u2019s judgment of 27\u00a0July 2004, the first applicant had in fact been prevented from obtaining a private sector job because of the restrictions contained in the KGB Act. Furthermore, the first applicant had not provided any particular information as to who had refused to employ him as a result of those restrictions, or when (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). Having regard to the documents in its possession, the Court perceives nothing to contradict the conclusion of the domestic court to the effect that after August 2004, that is after the Court\u2019s judgment in his case, the first applicant was unemployed for justified reasons, specifically because he lacked the necessary qualifications (see paragraphs 17 and 23 above). At this juncture it is also important to note that the applicant himself had turned down a number of job offers, thus further compounding his situation (see paragraph 25 above).",

Although the Government and Omnitel have insisted that the reasons for not reinstating the third applicant in his former job at the telecommunications company were economic, technological and organisational (see paragraphs 55 and 99 above), the Supreme Court not only left those other reasons unexamined, but even declared that the other arguments made by the parties in their appeals on points of law were legally irrelevant (see paragraph 60 above).

In fact, the Grand Chamber had already stated in VgT (no. 2) that the Convention must always be read as a whole and that the examination of whether there has been a fresh violation of a substantive Article must take into account the importance in the Convention system of effective execution of the Court\u2019s judgments in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention (see VgT (no. 2), \u00a7 83). In the same judgment, the Grand Chamber also made reference to Article 32 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, according to which the Court\u2019s jurisdiction extends \u201cto all matters concerning the interpretation and application of the Convention and the Protocols thereto which are referred to it as provided in Articles 33, 34 and 47\u201d. Moreover, Article 19 of the Convention provides that it is the Court\u2019s task \u201cto ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties\u201d to the Convention, one of which also appears to be the obligation to comply with the Court\u2019s judgments (Article 46 \u00a7 1 of the Convention). In light of VgT (no. 2) and the above-cited provisions of the Convention, I am not convinced that the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider an admissible followup application also under Article\u00a046 of the Convention is necessarily dependent on the prior recognition of an individual right under the said Article. Contrary to what my concurring colleagues suggest, the introduction of the infringement procedure under Article 46 \u00a7 4 of the Convention seems, in fact, to confirm that the Court may examine the execution of a judgment under Article 46, despite the absence of an individual right in that regard.",

Arguably, we could have addressed this question in greater detail in the judgment. Although we conclude that the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 46 of the Convention is closely linked to the complaint under Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 8 (see paragraph 105 of the judgment), by distinguishing it from Emre (no. 2) we decided to examine the complaint solely under the latter provisions. One may ask whether the distinction we employ between the present application and Emre (no. 2) is fully convincing (see paragraph\u00a0104 of the present judgment). For instance, the statement that the abrogation of the KGB Act of 1999 is a general measure and therefore to be supervised by the Committee of Ministers seems to imply that the Court can only examine individual measures under Article 46. In my view, such a differentiation would have warranted more careful reasoning.",

First, one can rely on the material link between the fresh application and the issue of non-execution. The argument here is that whenever a fresh or continuing violation of the Convention is the (direct) result of the failure by a State to comply with a previous judgment by the Court, it becomes highly artificial, if it is even possible, to separate the occurrence of the fresh or continuing violation from questions of implementation. Therefore, the Court should be in a position not only to examine the substantive rights under the Convention but also to make an incidental finding under Article 46 of the Convention on the execution of a judgment. Such an approach would, however, imply that the Emre (no. 2) precedent has so far been applied in an overly restrictive manner (see, in particular, Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2), no.\u00a022251/08 [GC], \u00a7\u00a7 33\u201339, 5\u00a0February 2015). A second approach would be to link the Court\u2019s competence in follow-up applications to its practice under Article 46 (compare \u00a7 9 below). One could argue, for instance, that the Court can only make a finding under Article 46 in conjunction with a substantive provision in those cases in which it actually indicated specific measures under Article 46 (individual or general) in a previous judgment. The Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review incidentally the execution of its judgments could then be justified in that, in such cases, the leeway of the Committee of Ministers in exercising its supervisory functions has already been considerably reduced by the fact that the Court had identified certain measures necessary to execute the first judgment. However, the problem of this second approach is that Emre (no. 2) itself was, in fact, a case in which the Court, in its first judgment, did not give any indications as to how it was to be executed.",

In the Convention system today, securing judgment compliance is increasingly perceived as the shared responsibility of a multitude of actors, including the Court. The Court\u2019s case-law under Article 46 has, in certain situations, continuously evolved towards indicating to the respondent State the specific individual or general measures required for implementing a judgment (see, for instance, Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine, no. 21722/11, 9\u00a0January 2013, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0193 et seq.). An interesting formulation in this regard was chosen by the Court very recently in the case of Mukhitdinov v. Russia (no.\u00a020999/14, 21 May 2015, not final yet). In \u00a7 109 of that judgment, \u201cbeing concerned with ensuring binding force and execution of the present judgment\u201d, the Court saw itself \u201ccompelled to examine certain aspects of the present case under Article 46 of the Convention.\u201d The question with which we are confronted in the present case and the Court\u2019s role in the post-judgment phase must be viewed within this evolving context, in which the complementary role of the Court during the execution of its own judgments has gradually become acknowledged.",

Whilst such an approach may neither correspond to the traditional \u201cConvention wisdom\u201d nor to the interpretation offered by my concurring colleagues, it is in line with the evolving role of the Court under Article 46 of the Convention and the current trend of interpreting implementation as a shared responsibility.

Therefore, a practical attempt to circumvent such legislation cannot necessarily be required. This would be particularly problematic in situations where such an attempt could expose the applicant (or any cooperating persons) to a criminal or administrative penalty.
