In their observations, the Government argued that the European inspectors had found that the applicant company had failed to comply with the European standard that their place of principal activity be in the State that had delivered the AOC. According to the Government, the interference had a basis in domestic law, namely under Section 5 of the Law on Civil Aviation (see paragraph 15 above) and was proportionate to the aim pursued.",
