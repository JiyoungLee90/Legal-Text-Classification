It also notes that the applicant was dismissed shortly after she had been found guilty by the first-instance court and that she remained unemployed thereafter (see paragraph 10 above). While the Court cannot speculate as to the outcome of the proceedings against her had the Court of Appeal heard her in person, it considers that the failure to give her the chance to state her position caused her damage which cannot be compensated only by a finding of a violation in the present case. Accordingly, and deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 1,000 on this account.",
