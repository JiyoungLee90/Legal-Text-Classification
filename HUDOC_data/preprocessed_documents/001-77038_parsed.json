Against this background, the Court finds that the applicant obtained adequate redress for the alleged violation of his right under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention to the determination within a reasonable time of the criminal charges against him. Accordingly, he can no longer claim to be a victim, for the purposes of Article 34, of a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 in this respect. This complaint is therefore manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4 of the Convention (see Morby v.

In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no.\u00a030544/96, \u00a7\u00a028, ECHR 1999I).",

In particular, the Court notes that the charge of subornation to perjury was contained in the bill of indictment filed on 19 September 1995, a copy of which the applicant had been entitled to. The applicant has not substantiated his claim that he was only informed of it in April 2000. Moreover, once convicted, the applicant had the possibility to challenge his conviction on this charge before the Regional and Supreme Courts, which both made a full review of the case. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that Article 6 cannot be interpreted as giving a defendant the right to have an infinite number of witnesses called. In the circumstances, it is satisfied that the fact that the courts heard some five witnesses and convicted the applicant of subornation to perjury, relying on clear documentary evidence, did not render the proceedings unfair as a whole. These complaints are therefore also to be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",
