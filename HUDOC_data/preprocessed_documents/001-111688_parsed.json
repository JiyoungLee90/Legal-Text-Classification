In particular, he lodged three supervisory appeals, which were unsuccessful. He cannot use the compensation claim until the proceedings are finally resolved (see \u017duni\u010d v.  (dec.) no.\u00a024342/04, \u00a750, 18 October 2007). As to the Government\u2019s argument that he could lodge a claim under the first paragraph of section 4 of the Administrative Dispute Act (see paragraph 72 above), the Court notes that this claim is conditional on a number of elements, one of them being that the result of the action is unlawful hindrance, limitation or prevention of the enjoyment of a human right, and another being the absence of any other judicial protection. It is not for the Court to speculate on the possible interpretation of the provisions concerned in the context of the issues raised in the present case. The Court would limit itself to observing that it is unaware of any decision that would demonstrate that a claim could be brought directly before the Administrative Court with any prospect of putting a timely end to the violation alleged by the applicant in the present case (see, mutatis mutandis, Mandi\u0107 and Jovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 112, and Belinger v. Slovenia (dec.), no. 42320/98, 2 October 2001). This Government\u2019s objection must therefore be rejected.",

This part of the application has therefore been rejected due to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies (see paragraphs 72-77 above). However, the Court should note the guiding principle whereby a care order should be regarded as a temporary measure, to be discontinued as soon as circumstances permit, and that any measures implementing temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parents and the child (see K. and T. v. Finland [GC], no. 25702/94, \u00a7\u00a0178, ECHR 2001VII). Therefore, after the aforementioned measures had been imposed the authorities remained under an obligation to take all reasonable steps to reunite the applicant with his children (see, mutatis mutandis, Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania, no. 31679/96, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2000-I, and Iglesias Gil and A.U.I. v. Spain, no. 56673/00, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2003-V).

In March 2008 the applicant began to refuse all cooperation with the welfare authorities (see paragraphs 32 and\u00a034 above) and therefore no supervised visit has taken place since then. The applicant, apart from choosing his own ways to make contact with the children, lodged a formal request for his children to be returned as well as to have contact rights determined by the court (see paragraphs 45 and 63 above).",

In particular, the court\u2019s ruling was directly relevant to the return of the children to the applicant, as his request made in this connection to the welfare authorities was adjourned pending the outcome of the court proceedings (see paragraphs 63 and 64 above). Moreover, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s relationship with M. appeared to have played an important role in the administrative decisions by which the children were removed and contact with them restricted (see paragraphs 13, 19 and 22 above). Therefore, his separation from M., no later than 2009 (see paragraphs 36, 37, 49, 54 and 57 above) became a relevant factor to be considered for the first time by the court.",

It would appear that a certain responsibility for not appointing an expert was placed on the applicant\u2019s failure to pay expert fees (see paragraph 46 above). However, justifying the interference with the applicant\u2019s family life, such as divesting him of parental relationship with his biological children, should be primarily the responsibility of the authorities, and not the applicant. Although the court finally appointed an expert in January 2011, the latter submitted her report only six months later. No final decision has been delivered on the matter so far. The court, however, issued an interim order prohibiting the applicant from having contact with his children on 9 July 2011. This order is now being considered on appeal.",
