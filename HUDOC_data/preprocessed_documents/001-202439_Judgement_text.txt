The case concerns a complaint under Article 2 of Protocol No. 7. The applicant complained that he had been unable to appeal against a first­instance judgment, imposing on him a short-term deprivation of liberty for sport hooliganism.
The applicant was born in 1992 and lives in Sofia. He was represented by Ms T. Chobanova, a lawyer practising in Sofia.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Dimova of the Ministry of Justice.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 25 March 2012 the applicant and other supporters of a Sofia football club travelled to Plovdiv to attend a football match. According to the accusation, upon their arrival they got into a fight with supporters of the opposing club and threw glass bottles and stones at passers-by. The police arrived and the applicant and other people were arrested.
Proceedings under the Preservation of Public Order During Sporting Events Act 2004 (hereinafter “the 2004 Act”, see paragraph 9 below) were opened against the applicant, and on the next day, 26 March 2012, he was brought before the Plovdiv District Court.
In a judgment of the same day the Plovdiv District Court found that the applicant was guilty of sport hooliganism, as defined in section 21 of the 2004 Act (see paragraph 10 below), and imposed on him the following punishments provided for under section 25(1) of the same Act (see paragraph 11 below): a fine of 300 Bulgarian levs (BGN, the equivalent of 153 euros – EUR), thirteen-day detention in a police facility, and a one-year ban on attending sporting events in Bulgaria and abroad.
The judgment stated that it was final. It was immediately enforced and the applicant was brought to a facility in Plovdiv, where he remained in detention until 8 April 2012.
In September 2012 the applicant applied for the reopening of the proceedings, arguing that they had concerned a “criminal charge” against him and had been in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. He complained also of the impossibility to appeal against the judgment of 26 March 2012, referring to the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 4 May 2011 (see paragraph 16 below). In a decision of 22 October 2012 a VicePresident of the Supreme Court of Cassation refused to institute reopening proceedings, pointing out that sport hooliganism proceedings under the 2004 Act were not subject to reopening under the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The 2004 Act (Закон за опазване на обществения ред при провеждането на спортни мероприятия) provides for different measures for the preservation of public order during sporting events and for punishments for breaches of that order.
Under section 21 of the Act, the administrative offence of sport hooliganism (спортно хулиганство) is defined as disorderly conduct during or in relation to a sporting event, where such conduct does not constitute a criminal offence. Sport hooliganism comprises, among others, the uttering of swearwords and insults, the throwing of objects and the participation in a fight.
By section 25(1) of the 2004 Act, as worded at the relevant time, sport hooliganism was punishable by detention in a police facility for up to fifteen days, a fine of between BGN 200 (EUR 102) and BGN 500 (EUR 256), and a ban on attending sporting events during a period of up to two years.
At the relevant time, such measures were to be ordered by the respective district court, whose judgment would be final (section 34(1) of the Act). In August 2018 section 34(1) was amended and now provides that district courts’ judgments are subject to appeal before a regional court.
The Decree on Combating Minor Hooliganism (Указ за борба с дребното хулиганство, hereinafter “the Decree”) was adopted in 1963. It defines acts of minor hooliganism, namely not amounting to the criminal offence of hooliganism, as, among others, uttering swearwords or insults in a public place, a quarrel or a fight that breach the peace. After 2004 the Decree is not applicable to acts of sport hooliganism (section 1(5)).
Under section 1(1) of the Decree, minor hooliganism, if perpetrated by persons older than sixteen, carry a penalty of up to fifteen days’ detention in a police facility or a fine.
Such penalties are to be decided upon by the district courts. Until May 2011 section 7 of the Decree provided that their judgments were final.
On 4 May 2011 the Constitutional Court declared the latter rule unconstitutional, finding in addition that it contradicted Articles 5 § 4 and 6 § 1 of the Convention. It observed in particular that minor hooliganism was an act of breach of public order and that it was punishable by deprivation of liberty, which meant that a person charged with such an offence was subject to a “criminal charge” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (Решение № 3 от 4.04.2011 г. на Конституционния съд по к. д. № 19 от 2010 г.).
As a result, in November 2011 section 7 of the Decree was amended and now provides that district courts’ decisions to impose an administrative penalty may be appealed against before a regional court.
In a judgment of 4 July 2011 the Sofia Administrative Court accepted for examination an appeal against a district court’s judgment imposing a punishment under the 2004 Act. It referred to the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 4 May 2011 (see paragraph 16 above) and found, for the same reasons as exposed therein, that section 34(1) of that Act providing for no such appeal contradicted the Constitution (Решение № 3315 от 4.07.2011 на АССГ по д. № 3711/2011 г.).
However, in a decision of 16 March 2012 the Supreme Court of Cassation refused to examine an appeal against a judgment of a district court under the 2004 Act, finding that the developments described in paragraphs 16-17 above – the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 4 May 2011 and the subsequent amendments to the Decree – did not affect the procedure under the 2004 Act, and in particular did not give rise to a right to appeal. It pointed out that the Decree’s applicability to acts of sport hooliganism was expressly excluded under its section 1(5) (Определение № 149 от 16.03.2012 г. по к. н. д. № 223/2012 г., ВКС, I н.о.).
In a judgment of 12 March 2012 the Sofia City Court also declared inadmissible an appeal against a district court’s judgment under the 2004 Act, dismissing comparable arguments (Решение № 331 от 12.03.2012 на СГС по в. а. н. д. № 484/2012 г.).
Subsequently some regional courts started examining appeals against judgments of the district courts imposing punishments under the 2004 Act, considering that the arguments given by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 4 May 2011 regarding the Decree were applicable by analogy to the 2004 Act, and that consequently section 34(1) of the Act, as worded before 2018, had to be held to contradict the Constitution, as well as Articles 5 § 4 and 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 2 of Protocol No. 7. They noted that both the Decree and the 2004 Act concerned acts of minor hooliganism, the only difference being that the ones under the 2004 Act had been committed during sporting events.
The Government submitted several judgments in which the above conclusions were made, delivered between 3 December 2012 and 11 November 2013. The majority of them are of the Sofia City Court, and one is of the Silistra Regional Court (Решение № 1342 от 3.12.2012 г. на СГС по в. а. н. д. № 5245/2012 г.; Решение № 1374 от 7.12.2012 г. на СГС по в. а. н. д. № 5037/2012 г.; Решение № 1398 от 11.12.2012 г. на СГС по в. а. н. д. № 5244/2012 г.; Решение от 15.04.2013 г. на ОС Силистра по в. а. н. д. № 108/2013 г.; Решение № 1281 от 11.11.2012 г. на СГС по в. а. н. д. № 3924/2013 г.). In one of the cases it was noted that the judicial practice on the matter remained contradictory.
