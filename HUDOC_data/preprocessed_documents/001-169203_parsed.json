The principle of immediacy is an important guarantee in criminal proceedings in which the observations made by the court about the demeanour and credibility of a witness may have important consequences for the accused (see Beraru v. Romania, no. 40107/04, \u00a7 64, 18 March 2014; and Cutean v.\u00a0Romania, no. 53150/12, \u00a7 60, 2 December 2014).",

However, this cannot be deemed to constitute a prohibition of any change in the composition of a court during the course of a case (see P.K. v. Finland ((dec.), no. 37442/97, 9 July 2002). Very clear administrative or procedural factors may arise rendering a judge\u2019s continued participation in a case impossible. The Court has indicated that measures can be taken to ensure that the judges who continue hearing the case have the appropriate understanding of the evidence and arguments, for example, by making transcripts available, where the credibility of the witness concerned is not in issue, or by arranging for a rehearing of the relevant arguments or of important witnesses before the newly composed court (see Cutean, cited above, \u00a7 61).",
