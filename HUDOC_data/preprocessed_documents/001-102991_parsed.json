The legal representative's arguments related, notably, to statements made by a number of police officers during the trial, according to which at 6.00\u00a0a.m. on 3 June 2001 the applicant had been taken to a number of locations by police officers in order to search for the objects used in the killing.

The legal representative pointed out that his client could not have been in two different places at the same time. He also argued the applicant had not known the dates on which he had been questioned, and that on 5\u00a0June 2001 the police officers had simply asked the applicant to sign a number of pre-prepared statements.",
