The court held that, on the basis of the evidence available in the file, the applicant had made false statements in an official document and had been aware of the legal consequences of his statements. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (recurs) against the judgment. He argued that the criminal investigation against him had been politically motivated, a fact confirmed by the alleged failure of the domestic courts to take into account and to examine the evidence submitted by him in his defence. In addition, the applicant argued that the domestic courts had wrongfully assessed the evidence, had misinterpreted the applicable legal provisions and had ignored the fact that the indictment brought against him had been null and void because the investigating prosecutor had failed to inform him of the charges brought against him prior to sending the case before the domestic courts.",

At the same time, the Court notes that press coverage of current events is an exercise of freedom of expression, guaranteed by Article\u00a010 of the Convention. If there is a virulent press campaign surrounding a trial, what is decisive is not the subjective apprehensions of the suspect concerning the absence of prejudice required of the trial courts, however understandable, but whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, his fears can be held to be objectively justified (see, mutatis mutandis, Castillo Algar v. Spain, 28\u00a0October\u00a01998, \u00a7\u00a045, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII).",

The applicant was convicted and sentenced by a judgment of the Bucharest County Court on 14\u00a0November\u00a02002.

D.I.C.\u2019s press statement of 3\u00a0July\u00a01997 had not assessed the applicant\u2019s guilt and had not been in breach of the professional conduct requirements applicable to prosecutors.

The presumption of innocence enshrined in paragraph 2 of Article\u00a06 is one of the elements of the fair criminal trial that is required by paragraph\u00a01 (see Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10\u00a0February\u00a01995, \u00a7\u00a035, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0308). It not only prohibits the premature expression by the tribunal itself of the opinion that the person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d is guilty before he has been so proved according to law (see Minelli v. Switzerland, 25\u00a0March\u00a01983, \u00a7\u00a038, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a062), but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no.\u00a042095/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-43, ECHR\u00a02000-X; and Samoil\u0103 and Cionca v. Romania, no.\u00a033065/03, \u00a7\u00a092, 4\u00a0March\u00a02008). The Court stresses that Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 cannot prevent the authorities from informing the public of criminal investigations in progress, but it requires that they do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038).",

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Khuzhin and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a013470/02, \u00a7\u00a094, 23\u00a0October\u00a02008, with further references). Whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Butkevi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no.\u00a048297/99, \u00a7\u00a049, ECHR\u00a02002-II).",

The statements at issue were made at a time when the criminal investigation in respect of the applicant had just been started. It was particularly important at this initial stage not to make any public allegations which could have been interpreted as confirming the guilt of the applicant in the opinion of State authorities.
