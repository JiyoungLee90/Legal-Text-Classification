The Court observes that it was called upon to deal with a similar situation in SfinxImpex S.A. v. the Republic of Moldova (no.\u00a028439/05, \u00a7\u00a016, 25\u00a0September 2012), where it ruled that the six-month time-limit started to run not from the date on which the request for review request had been granted but from the date on which the courts had finally dismissed any appeal against the decision to grant it. The fact that in the present case the Economic Court indicated in its decision of 22 March 2011 that the decision could not be challenged appears to have been a mistake since the superior court did examine the appeal subsequently lodged by the applicant company and dismissed it on 7\u00a0June 2012.",

This principle states that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two\u00a0views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ro\u015fca, cited above, \u00a7\u00a025).",
