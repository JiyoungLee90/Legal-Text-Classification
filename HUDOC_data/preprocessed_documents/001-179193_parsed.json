As the Government in fact noted in their observations, on his arrival in prison on 4 March 2013 the applicant was already suffering from a disease which would be fatal in the short term because of its spread to his skeleton (see paragraphs 9 and 73 above). The Court has already found that, apart from the shortcomings pointed out by the senior medical officer of the oncology department of Bac\u0103u Hospital, the applicant had been treated in accordance with the doctors\u2019 prescriptions (see paragraph 53 above). However, it does not transpire from the case file that the domestic authorities ever considered the possibility of providing all the different types of treatment in the same place, which would have spared the applicant some of the transfers, or at least limited their number and reduced the harmful consequences for the patient\u2019s well-being. Furthermore, the Court has already expressed the view that during the final stages of the illness when there is no further hope of remission, the stress inherent in prison life can have repercussions on the prisoner\u2019s life expectancy and state of health (see, mutatis mutandis, G\u00fclay \u00c7etin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0110).",

The Court reiterates that it has already voiced doubts as to the adequacy of assigning unqualified persons responsibility for looking after an individual suffering from a serious illness (see G\u00fclay \u00c7etin, cited above, \u00a7 112, with the references therein). In the present case, it cannot be ascertained whether the prisoner who agreed to assist the applicant was qualified to provide support for an end-of-life patient or whether the applicant actually received proper moral or social support. Nor does it transpire from the case-file that the applicant received appropriate psychological support during his periods in hospital or prison, given that he was displaying symptoms of depression (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).",

However, it cannot be overlooked that the court of appeal, in rejecting the request for an interruption of the sentence, put forward no arguments concerning a possible threat posed to law and order by the applicant\u2019s release, having regard to his state of health (see paragraph 17 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, G\u00fclay \u00c7etin, cited above, \u00a7 122). Moreover, the Court notes that the applicant had at first been sentenced to a fairly short prison term, a third of which he had served (see paragraph 15 above). It also observes that the applicant had displayed good behaviour during the trial, that he had been afforded the most favourable detention regime (see paragraphs 15 and 23 above) and that because of his state of health the risk of reoffending could only have been minimal.",

According to the case file, however, in the present case the authorities called upon to act did not have proper regard to the realities imposed by the applicant\u2019s individual case and failed to consider his real capacity for remaining in prison under the impugned conditions of detention. Even though in its judgment of 29 August 2013 the court of appeal found that the applicant could be provided with the prescribed treatment in detention (see paragraph 17 above), it did not consider the practical conditions and methods for administering the complicated treatment in the applicant\u2019s specific situation. It failed to assess the material conditions under which the applicant was being held or to ascertain whether, in view of his state of health, those conditions were satisfactory in the light of his specific needs. Nor did it have regard to the conditions of the transfers to the various prisons and hospitals, the distances to be covered between these establishments or the number of hospitals attended by the applicant in order to receive his treatment, nor again the combined effect of all these elements on his already precarious state of health. The fact is that under such exceptional circumstances as those encountered in the present case, the said elements should, if only on humanitarian grounds, have been examined by the court of appeal in order to evaluate the compatibility of the applicant\u2019s state of health with his conditions of detention. It was never argued that the national authorities could not have coped with those exceptional circumstances by taking due account of the serious humanitarian considerations at issue in the case. On the other hand, the Court considers that the decisions reached by the domestic authorities show that the impugned proceedings were conducted with the emphasis on formalities rather than on humanitarian considerations, thus preventing the dying applicant to live out his last few days in dignity (see, mutatis mutandis, G\u00fclay \u00c7etin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0120-124).",

Similarly, it notes that the answers provided by the prison authorities, from whom the applicant had requested help in seeking his release, were characterised by their scant consideration of the applicant\u2019s specific situation (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above).",

France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 101, ECHR 1999V). In the instant case, the applicant had been imprisoned despite his end-of-life situation and the effects of serious medical treatment in difficult prison conditions. The Court takes the view that in such a context, lack of diligence on the authorities\u2019 part renders the person even more vulnerable and robs him of his dignity in the face of the fatal outcome towards which his illness is ineluctably progressing (see, mutatis mutandis, G\u00fclay\u00a0\u00c7etin, cited above, \u00a7 122).",
