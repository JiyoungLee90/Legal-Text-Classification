The case originated in an application (no. 24211/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Aydın Adıyaman (“the applicant”), on 14 May 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr M.E. Adıyaman, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 28 November 2008 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1974 and at the time of lodging his application he was serving his prison sentence in the Bolu F-type prison.
On 25 January 2008 the applicant wrote a letter to the Ministry of Justice, in which he had praised the imprisoned leader of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan by using the honorific “sayın”, meaning esteemed.
Pursuant to the Regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicant was found guilty of breaching a prison order by the Bolu F-type Prison Disciplinary Board (referred hereafter as “the board”).
On 1 February 2008 the applicant was sentenced to 11 days’ solitary confinement on the orders of the Board, on account of his statements in the above-mentioned letter.
On 26 February 2008 the Bolu Enforcement Judge rejected the applicant’s objection.
On 11 March 2008 the Bolu Assize Court upheld the judgment of 26 February 2008.
A full description of the relevant domestic law at the material time can be found in Yalçınkaya and Others v. Turkey (nos. 25764/09 and 18 others, §§ 12-13, 1 October 2013).
