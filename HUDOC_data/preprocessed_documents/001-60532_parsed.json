The offence was made out even if the remarks proved accurate, since the relevant case-law precluded evidence of the truth of the allegations as a defence to a charge under section 36, in order to avoid embroiling the head of State in a debate that would undermine the respect due to his or her office.

The Government said that in the present case the applicants had presented the findings of a preliminary report that had been drawn up in 1994 by a private organisation instructed by the European Commission and described as \u201can independent research body\u201d as accurate, thereby giving readers the impression that the report was official and irrefutable. However, the European Commission had published another version of the report; in this version, the names of public figures connected to the government who had allegedly shielded the networks of dealers had been omitted, on the ground that they were entitled to be presumed innocent. Thus, the document described in the articles was not exactly the same as the official final report that was circulated by the Commission. Furthermore, the media coverage of the Moroccan government\u2019s alleged direct responsibility in such trafficking was neither objective nor balanced as the journalists made no reference in their articles to a White Paper that had been published by the Moroccan government in response to the allegations made in the OGD\u2019s report.",

As to the limits of acceptable criticism, they are wider with regard to a politician acting in his public capacity than in relation to a private individual. A politician inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must display a greater degree of tolerance, especially when he himself makes public statements that are susceptible of criticism. He is certainly entitled to have his reputation protected, even when he is not acting in his private capacity, but the requirements of that protection have to be weighed against the interests of open discussion of political issues, since exceptions to freedom of expression must be interpreted narrowly (see, among other authorities, in particular, Oberschlick v.

Unlike the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation, the Court finds that in the instant case the information contained in the OGD\u2019s report was not disputed and its account of the allegations in issue could legitimately be regarded as credible. In the view of the Court, the press should normally be entitled, when contributing to public debate on matters of legitimate concern, to rely on the content of official reports without having to undertake independent research. Otherwise, the vital public-watchdog role of the press may be undermined (see, mutatis mutandis, Goodwin, cited above, p. 500, \u00a7 39). The Court thus finds that it was reasonable for Le Monde to rely on the OGD\u2019s report, without needing to check for itself the accuracy of the information it contained.
