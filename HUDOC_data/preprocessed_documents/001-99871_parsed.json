The Court has also found the provision applicable to judicial decisions taken after the discontinuation of such proceedings (see, in particular, the following judgments: Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62, and Lutz, Englert and N\u00f6lkenbockhoff v. Germany, 25 August 1987, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0123), or following an acquittal (see Sekanina v.

Those judgments concerned proceedings relating to such matters as an accused's obligation to bear court costs and prosecution expenses, a claim for reimbursement of his (or his heirs') necessary costs, or compensation for unlawful detention, matters which were found to constitute a consequence and the concomitant of the criminal proceedings. The scope of Article 6 \u00a7 2 also extends to various administrative proceedings conducted simultaneously with criminal proceedings against an applicant or after the conclusion of criminal proceedings ending without a guilty verdict (see Stavropoulos v. Greece, no.\u00a035522/04, 27 September 2007, Paraponiaris v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a042132/06, 25\u00a0September 2008).",

Nor could the fact that evidence from the criminal trial is used to determine civil law consequences of the act warrant such characterisation. Otherwise, as rightly pointed out by the Government, Article 6 \u00a7 2 would give a criminal acquittal the undesirable effect of pre-empting the victim's possibilities of claiming compensation under the civil law of tort, entailing an arbitrary and disproportionate limitation on his or her right of access to court under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. This again could give an acquitted perpetrator, who would be deemed responsible according the civil burden of proof, the undue advantage of avoiding any responsibility for his or her actions. Such an extensive interpretation would not be supported either by the wording of Article 6 \u00a7 2 or any common ground in the national legal systems within the Convention community.
