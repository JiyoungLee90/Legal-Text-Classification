A refusal by the executive council to ratify a corporate resolution or decision was but one aspect of the liability faced by companies. However, the company's liability did not exclude liability on the part of the executive council, which was also under a duty to follow a specific procedure prior to ratification. The statute laid down, inter alia, an exhaustive list of the documents that had to be lodged with the executive council to enable a resolution altering the memorandum and articles of association or increasing the capital to be ratified and thus validated. One of the documents that had to be produced to the executive council was the minutes of the meeting of shareholders in which the resolution concerned was adopted. That document had to be signed by all the shareholders. In the instant case, the signatures of individual shareholders should also have been legalised by a notary. However, the Executive Council had ratified all the decisions and resolutions for the increases in capital and alterations to the memorandum and articles of association of the Ukrainian company without requiring production of the relevant minutes. In such circumstances, the Executive Council should have turned down the request for ratification of the decisions and resolutions. Its failure to exercise its statutory powers as a public body to supervise the activities of a limited-liability company rendered it liable. If executive councils merely acted as a registration office, their supervisory powers would serve no purpose. In addition, under Ukrainian law, an action could be brought against an executive council in its capacity as \u201ca public entity responsible for its acts\u201d, as compensation for damage sustained as a result of the unlawful acts or omissions of executive councils was guaranteed by both statute and the Constitution (Article 56).",

The interventions of the State executive branch in the judicial process considerably added to that uncertainty. Lastly, the manner in which the litigation ended (see paragraph 81 above) does not appear to have been consistent with the State's obligation to deal with the applicant company's situation in as coherent a manner as possible (see Beyeler, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0120). Consequently, the applicant company had to cope with that uncertainty during the period in which its initial shareholding was reduced, with the consequent changes to its ability to manage Sovtransavto-Lugansk and to control its assets that that entailed (ibid., \u00a7 110).

As a result of the reduction in the value of its shareholding, its ability to manage Sovtransavto-Lugansk had been considerably diminished and, consequently, it had lost control of both the company's activity and assets. Subsequently, having been deprived of the possibility of influencing Sovtransavto-Lugansk's decisions about its assets, it had been unable to prevent the company management from engaging in a massive sale of its assets at considerable undervalue. Consequently, as a result of the illegal actions of the company's management and the Lugansk Executive Council, not only had the applicant company's shareholding fallen from 49% to 20.7%, there had also been a considerable diminution of the company's assets. Finally, following the winding-up of Sovtransavto-Lugansk, the payment received by the applicant company had not been in proportion to its initial 49% shareholding.",
