It considered that his objective had been to ensure the removal from the case file of the documents which emanated from the Syrian authorities. It observed in this regard that although the practice of torture by the Syrian secret services was notorious, the investigating judges had failed to issue an international arrest warrant immediately but had, on the contrary, waited until 1 April 2004 to issue a letter of request to the Syrian military authorities, and \u201cthat letter was, according to S.A.\u2019s lawyers, executed with astonishing speed\u201d. It thus found that \u201cit was on this basis and in support of the request for the exclusion from the case file of the documents from the Syrian authorities that [the applicant] called into question, in the terms for which he is reproached, the conduct of the investigating judges\u201d. The Disciplinary Board further found that the applicant should benefit from judicial immunity in so far as the impugned remarks were not unrelated to the case. Relying on the case-law of the Court of Cassation on this point..., and on the protection under Article 10 of the Convention of the lawyer\u2019s freedom of speech in court (referring to the judgment in Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611/96, ECHR 2002-II), it pointed out that the applicant\u2019s impugned remarks did not constitute personal attacks on the judges, but sought to call into question the manner in which they had conducted the proceedings, and that the remarks were \u201cobviously not unrelated to the facts of the case\u201d. The disciplinary body finally pointed out that the applicant was justified in believing that the argument as to the procedural conduct of the investigating judges had not been without influence on the first-instance decision to exclude the Syrian statements from the case file and that he had been justified in using these arguments before the Court of Appeal, irrespective of their vitriol, whereas the raising of this issue in the court below had not even led to any reaction on the part of the prosecution.",

The Court of Appeal observed that the immunity of the courtroom could not be invoked in disciplinary matters. Stressing that lawyers\u2019 freedom of expression was not absolute, it took the view that the remarks at issue were not merely intended to criticise the conduct of the judicial investigation and challenge the validity of S.A.\u2019s statements during his interrogation, they also called into question the moral integrity of the investigating judges at a personal level. It found that the applicant \u201chad visibly sought to \u2018do as he pleased\u2019 even to the extent of harming his client (whose sentence was extended by a year by the Court of Appeal)\u201d. The court took the view that the accusation of complicity had been pointless in relation to the interests of his client, and gratuitous, since the judges had mentioned in a mission report the difficulties they had encountered with the Syrian authorities, who had prevented them from attending the interviews (see paragraph 14 above). The Court of Appeal pointed out that the documents in question had been excluded by the court below and that \u201cthere was no need for [the applicant], in the interest of S.A., to claim without any proof that the French investigating judges had been complicit in the torture of S.A.\u201d. It concluded that the attacks were not proportionate to the aim pursued and that the impugned remarks constituted a breach of the essential principles of the legal profession, namely dignity, honour, tactfulness and moderation.",

The Court finds in this connection, as did the Paris Court of Appeal (see paragraph 21 above), that the applicant\u2019s conclusions accusing the investigating judges of being complicit in torture were not necessary for the pursuit of his stated aim, namely to have the statements taken from S.A. under torture excluded from the evidence, especially as the first-instance court had already accepted that request (see paragraph 14 above). Nevertheless, it must be ascertained whether the disciplinary sanction imposed on the applicant by the Paris Court of Appeal, as upheld by the Court of Cassation, struck a fair balance between courts and lawyers in the context of a fair administration of justice.",

They were part of his efforts to obtain, before addressing the merits of the case, the exclusion by that court of the statements that had been taken from his client under torture in Syria. The Court notes that the passages identified as offensive by the public prosecutor were not directed at the investigating judges by name but concerned the manner in which they had conducted the investigation. In particular, the applicant had complained about the choice of issuing an international letter of request when the judges should have known that interrogations by the Syrian secret service were conducted without regard for human rights and more specifically in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court took the view that this \u201caccusation\u201d concerned the procedural choice of the judges. The Court finds, moreover, that the national courts did uphold the request to exclude evidence obtained in violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see, for example, G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7\u00a7 107-108, ECHR\u00a02010) whereas that cause of exclusion had not been raised during the judicial investigation, neither by the judges themselves nor by the public prosecutor (see paragraphs 12 ... above). In that procedural context, the Court found that the impugned pleadings directly contributed to the applicant\u2019s task of defending his client, to ensure that the case file going forward would be \u201ccleansed\u201d of any inadmissible evidence.",

It takes the view, however, that the remarks did have some factual basis. It notes that while the judge M.B. was not able to take part in the interviews, he followed them in real time, in Damascus, on the basis of the list of questions contained in the international letter of request and the supplementary questions to which he wished to have answers, in addition to those already recorded (see paragraph\u00a014 above). Moreover, the Court observes that the methods of the Syrian police were notorious, as shown by the witness statements adduced in the Criminal Court in the present case and also by all the international reports on this subject (see, for example, Al\u00a0Husin v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 3727/08, \u00a7\u00a7 40-43, 7 February 2012).",

It observes in this connection that the Paris Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation failed to take this contextual element into account (contrast Fuchs, cited above, \u00a7 42) and did not give consideration to the limited audience to which the remarks had been addressed.",

In addition to the negative repercussions of such a sanction on the professional career of a lawyer, the Court finds that any ex post facto review of offending oral or written submissions on the part of a lawyer must be implemented with particular prudence and moderation. While it is certainly the task of the judicial and disciplinary authorities, in the interest of the smooth operation of the justice system, to take note of, and even occasionally to penalise, certain conduct of lawyers, they must ensure that such review does not constitute for the latter a threat with a \u201cchilling\u201d effect that would harm the defence of their clients\u2019 interests. Thus, in the present case, the President of the Division of the Court of Appeal which examined the case of the applicant\u2019s client had already, at the hearing, invited the applicant to moderate his remarks, and then, deeming them excessive, the Division had indicated in the operative part of its judgment that it dismissed the relevant submissions on the ground that the remarks were dishonourable (see paragraph 16 above). Finding this warning to be sufficient, the judges had not considered it appropriate to ask the Principal Public Prosecutor to refer the matter to the disciplinary bodies. It was only several months after the filing of the impugned pleadings in the Court of Appeal, and after that court\u2019s judgment, that the said prosecutor initiated disciplinary proceedings. In the light of all the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that by going beyond the firm and dispassionate position of the Court of Appeal and imposing a disciplinary sanction on the applicant, the authorities excessively undermined the lawyer\u2019s task of defending his client.",
