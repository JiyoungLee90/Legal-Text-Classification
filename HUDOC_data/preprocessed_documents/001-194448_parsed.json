It followed that the sole purpose of the founders of the second applicant was to insult the morality and the religious feelings of others. Secondly, the distribution of printed, video and other material by the second applicant might incite religious discord because a majority of the traditional confessions in Russia viewed homosexuality negatively. Open propaganda of homosexuality would cause social tension and might provoke a violent response. Thirdly, \u201cnon-traditional sexual orientation\u201d was a broad term that could include paedophilia, which was a criminal offence in Russia. Therefore, the second applicant\u2019s activities might threaten public order. Finally, the support of persons suffering from HIV/AIDS, proclaimed as one of the aims of the second applicant, might violate the rights of those persons to confidentiality and respect for private life.

He argued that the second applicant\u2019s aims were compatible with section 2(2) of the Non-profit Organisations Act.

The first applicant also argued that the remaining grounds for the refusal of registration had not had any basis in law. Paragraph 5.1 of the articles of association did not mention any activities that were prohibited by law for non-profit organisations. Paragraph\u00a011.1 only mentioned the possibility of ceasing activities in the event of a reorganisation in accordance with Russian law; it did not provide for the automatic cessation of activities.

If after a warning by the Court the applicant ceased to use the expressions in question, expressly withdrew them or, better still, offered an apology, the application may no longer be rejected as an abuse of the right of petition (see Miro\u013cubovs and Others, cited above, \u00a7 64, with further references).",

In principle any conduct on the part of an applicant that is manifestly contrary to the purpose of the right of individual application as provided for in the Convention and which impedes the proper functioning of the Court or the proper conduct of the proceedings before it can be considered as an abuse of the right of application (see Podeschi v. San Marino, no. 66357/14, \u00a7 86, 13\u00a0April 2017). For example, the Court found that an applicant\u2019s conduct had been contrary to the purpose of the right of individual petition in cases where the applicant had lodged a succession of ill-founded and querulous complaints, creating unnecessary work which was incompatible with the Court\u2019s real functions, and which hindered it in carrying them out (see M.\u00a0v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a013284/87, Commission decision of 15\u00a0October 1987, Decisions and Reports (DR) 54, p. 214; Philis v. Grece, no. 28970/95, Commission decision of 17 October 1996, Decisions and Reports (DR) 54, p. 214; and Petrovi\u0107, cited above); where the applicant had obtained evidence in support of his case before the Court by force in blatant violation of the rights and the values protected by the Convention (see Koch v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no.\u00a015005/11, 7 March 2017); or where the applicant had not meticulously abided by all the relevant rules of the procedure and thereby had failed to show a high level of prudence and meaningful cooperation with the Court (see, for example, Bekauri v.\u00a0Georgia (preliminary objection), no. 14102/02, \u00a7\u00a7 22-24, 10\u00a0April 2012, and Eskerkhanov and Others v.

According to the Government, it appeared from the minutes of that hearing that the District Court had pronounced the entire text of the reasoned judgment, as it would otherwise have been indicated in the minutes that only the operative part had been pronounced. The applicants\u2019 argument that the time-limit had started to run on 5 March 2012, when a copy of the reasoned judgment had been deposited with the court\u2019s registry, was therefore erroneous. The applicants had been informed about the hearing of 20 February 2012 but had not attended. A copy of the judgment had been sent to them on 27\u00a0February 2012. They had not submitted to the District Court any documents, such as a stamped envelope, showing the date on which they had received it. They had not even claimed, let alone proved, that there had been a delay in providing them with a copy of the judgment of 20\u00a0February 2012. Nor had they asked for an extension of the time-limit. The domestic courts had therefore correctly found that the one-month timelimit had started to run on 20 February 2012, when the reasoned judgment had been pronounced.",

The role of the Court is limited to verifying whether the effects of such interpretation are compatible with the Convention. This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature such as time-limits governing the filing of documents or the lodging of appeals. Rules governing the formal steps to be taken and the time-limits to be complied with in lodging an appeal are aimed at ensuring the proper administration of justice and compliance, in particular, with the principle of legal certainty. Litigants should expect those rules to be applied (see Jensen v.\u00a0Denmark, no. 8693/11, \u00a7 35, 13 December 2016, with further references).",

However, the Court\u2019s case-law does not make any distinction between applicant organisations on the basis of whether they legally exist under the national law at the moment their application is lodged with the Court. The Court has frequently recognised the standing of unregistered or dissolved organisations to submit an application without enquiring into whether the organisation is considered to legally exist in some form under the national law after its dissolution or refusal of registration (see, among many other authorities, Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v.

They had found, in particular, that the aims of Sochi Pride House had been incompatible with basic morality and State family policy and that its activities would amount to propaganda of nontraditional sexual orientation. Such activities might undermine Russian national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity and incite social and religious hatred and enmity; they were therefore extremist in nature. In the Government\u2019s opinion, there was no need to submit any proof for the finding that LGBT advocacy might lead to a decrease in population.

The Court had repeatedly stated that a democratic society was pluralistic, tolerant and broadminded (they referred to B\u0105czkowski and Others v.\u00a0Poland, no. 1543/06, \u00a7 63, 3 May 2007), and those principles were especially important when people were expressing unpopular or minority views. Therefore, though the protection of public morality was a legitimate aim under the Convention, it could not be used to justify interferences with minorities\u2019 rights based on the majority\u2019s disapproval.",

The Court had, however, since changed that approach, finding that an association could be established to pursue a change in the law, including the legalisation of conduct that was illegal, so long as the means to be used and the outcome to be achieved were compatible with fundamental democratic principles, including in particular non-discrimination, pluralism and respect for human rights (the interveners cited United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, 30\u00a0January 1998, Reports 1998I, and Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above).",

The Court reiterates that the concepts of \u201cnational security\u201d and \u201cpublic safety\u201d must be applied with restraint and interpreted restrictively (see Stoll v.

Moreover, it would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority. Were this so, a minority group\u2019s rights to freedom of religion, expression, assembly and association would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective as required by the Convention (see Barankevich v.\u00a0Russia, no. 10519/03, \u00a7 31, 26 July 2007, and Alekseyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081).

There may thus be positive obligations to secure the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of association even in the sphere of relations between individuals. Accordingly, it is incumbent upon public authorities to guarantee the proper functioning of associations or political parties, even when they annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the lawful ideas or claims that they are seeking to promote. Their members must be able to hold meetings without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents. Such a fear would be liable to deter other associations or political parties from openly expressing their opinions on highly controversial issues affecting the community. In a democracy the right to counter-demonstrate cannot extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right of association (see Ouranio Toxo and Others v. Greece, no. 74989/01, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2005X (extracts), with further references).",

Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions \u2013 and to this extent it is autonomous \u2013 there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of them. The prohibition of discrimination enshrined in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and the Protocols thereto require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide. This principle is well entrenched in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, among many other authorities, E.B.\u00a0v. France [GC], no. 43546/02, \u00a7\u00a7 47-48, 22 January 2008).",
