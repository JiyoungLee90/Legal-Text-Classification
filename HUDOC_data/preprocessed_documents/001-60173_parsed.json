The court found that Section 78 of the Copyright Act prohibited publishing a person\u2019s picture if the publication violated that person\u2019s legitimate interests. When considering such interests, account had to be taken of whether the person concerned was known to the public, because the publication of the photographs of unknown persons made it possible to identify them later. The court found that Mr Posch\u2019s face was not generally known, despite his membership of the National Assembly. Therefore, his legitimate interests had been infringed by creating the possibility of identifying him. The applicant company was of course entitled to report on the plaintiff\u2019s activities and financial situation, but there was no legitimate interest in publishing his picture as it had, per se, no information value.

Therefore the court should have also taken evidence \u2013 as had been offered by the applicant company \u2013 in order to prove the truth of the articles. Furthermore, the plaintiff was known to the public as he was Carinthian and had participated in several events during the election campaign there.

The limits of acceptable criticism are wider with regard to a politician acting in his public capacity than in relation to a private individual, as the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must display a greater degree of tolerance. A politician is certainly entitled to have his reputation protected, even when he is not acting in his private capacity, but the requirements of that protection have to be weighed against the interests of the open discussion of political issues (e.g. Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 26, \u00a7 59).",

This is without doubt a matter of public concern which does not fall wholly within his private sphere. The reasons relied on by the Austrian courts for issuing an injunction prohibiting the applicant company from publishing the picture of Mr Posch were essentially that they did not consider Mr Posch a person known to the public and that the publication of his picture in connection with the reporting of his financial situation would make it possible to identify him, which infringed his interests. The applicant company had no legitimate interest in publishing the picture as it had no information value per se and it was irrelevant whether the facts alleged in the accompanying article were true or not.

The Austrian courts failed to take into account the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society and its duty to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest (Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no.\u00a021980/93, \u00a7 59, ECHR 1999-III). Moreover, it is of little importance whether a certain person (or his or her picture) is actually known to the public. What counts is whether this person has entered the public arena. This is the case of a politician on account of his public functions (Oberschlick v. Austria judgment (No. 2) of 1 July 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, \u00a7 29), a person participating in a public debate (Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no 23118/93, ECHR 1999-VIII, \u00a7 52), an association which is active in a field of public concern, on which it enters into public discussions (Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, \u00a739, 27.2.2001), or a person who is suspected of having committed offences of a political nature which attract the attention of the public (News Verlags GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria, loc. cit., \u00a7 54). In view of Mr Posch\u2019s position as a politician there is no doubt that he had entered the public arena and had to bear the consequences thereof. Thus, there is no valid reason why the applicant company should be prevented from publishing his picture. In this respect the Court attaches particular importance to the fact that the published photographs did not disclose any details of his private life (see Tammer v. Estonia, no. 41205/98, \u00a7 68, 6.2.2001). Moreover, the Court has noted itself that on the Austrian Parliament\u2019s internet site the curriculum vitae and picture of Mr Posch, who is still a member of the Austrian Parliament (national council), can be seen.",
