Moreover, it appears that the Government refer to a decision which was examined by the Court in the same context and found to be of no relevance for the issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see Petukhov v. , no. 43374/02, \u00a7 74-78, 21\u00a0October 2010, and Ustyantsev v. , no. 3299/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a056-58, 12\u00a0January 2012).
