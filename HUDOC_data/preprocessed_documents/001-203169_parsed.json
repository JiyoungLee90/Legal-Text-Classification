Thus, the applicant\u2019s allegations had had a significant impact on him.

According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an accused\u2019s statements in criminal proceedings may concern his freedom of expression under Article 10 (see, albeit in a somewhat different context, Zdravko Stanev v. Bulgaria (no. 2), no. 18312/08, \u00a7 31, 12 July 2016, concerning defamatory statements made by an accused against the first-instance judge in the context of the subsequent appeal proceedings). However, an issue in this context may also arise from the perspective of an accused\u2019s right to defend himself effectively in proceedings, under Article 6 of the Convention (see paragraphs 54-56 below). Thus, the Court\u2019s approach to the examination of a particular case will depend on the circumstances of a case and the nature of the complaint made by the applicant. In the present case, having regard to the fact that the applicant specifically complained about his criminal conviction for defamation of I.P., and that the domestic courts considered the case from the perspective of an attack on I.P.\u2019s honour and reputation, the Court will address the applicant\u2019s conviction for defamation as an interference with his freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention, having in mind the implications of his right to defend himself effectively in criminal proceedings.",

The concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition, which covers also the psychological well-being and dignity of a person.

Accordingly, a high level of protection of freedom of expression, with the authorities thus having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation, will normally be accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest, as is the case, in particular, for remarks on the functioning of the judiciary, even in the context of proceedings that are still pending (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0125). The potential seriousness of certain remarks (see Thoma v.\u00a0Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2001-III) does not obviate the right to a high level of protection, given the existence of a matter of public interest (see B\u00e9dat, cited above, \u00a7 49).",

It may therefore prove necessary to protect such confidence against gravely damaging attacks that are essentially unfounded. The phrase \u201cauthority of the judiciary\u201d under Article\u00a010 \u00a7 2 of the Convention includes, in particular, the notion that the courts are, and are accepted by the public at large as being, the proper forum for the resolution of legal disputes and for the determination of a person\u2019s guilt or innocence on a criminal charge; further, that the public at large have respect for and confidence in the courts\u2019 capacity to fulfil that function. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire not only in the accused, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, but also in the public at large (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0128130).",

The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article\u00a010. However, where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient \u201cfactual basis\u201d for the impugned statement: if there is not, that value judgment may prove excessive. In order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment, it is necessary to take account of the circumstances of the case and the general tone of the remarks, bearing in mind that assertions about matters of public interest may, on that basis, constitute value judgments rather than statements of fact (see, for instance, Morice, cited above, \u00a7 126, with further references).",

In the Court\u2019s view, that accusation was clearly capable of tarnishing I.P.\u2019s reputation and causing him prejudice in his social environment, particularly given his status as a military officer and disabled war veteran who was very active in the process of discovering war crimes committed during the war in Croatia (see paragraphs 10 and 24 above). Moreover, there is no reason to call into question the domestic court\u2019s findings that I.P. had felt seriously affected by the statements made, which had even made him seek medical help for the distress he had suffered (see\u00a0paragraph 24 above).",

This would above all allow the domestic authorities to examine the applicant\u2019s complaints at the relevant time, and ensure that his or her rights were respected. The Court thus emphasised that the failure of an applicant to do this would prevent it from concluding that the alleged procedural defect complained of had interfered with the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial, which accordingly would render his or her complaints inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded (see also Sigur\u00f0ur Einarsson and Others v.

Instead, it was for the applicant to raise arguable concerns concerning her alleged lack of impartiality by asking for her removal (otklon) from the case (see paragraph 34 above, Article 36 \u00a7 2 and Article 38 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).

In paragraph 47 of the judgment two separate aims are juxtaposed in order to legitimise the interference. On the one hand, the protection of the reputation or rights of others. On this point I have nothing to say, since a conviction for defamation is indeed designed precisely to protect the good reputation of another person. On the other hand the majority, on their own initiative, add a second aim, namely that of maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. My conceptual difficulties centre on this second aspect.",

Austria, 29 August 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997V). The clause relating to this safeguard is designed primarily to protect the judiciary against gravely damaging attacks that are essentially unfounded (see Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7 128, ECHR 2015), but also to protect the rights of litigants (see Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, \u00a7 56, Series A no. 216).",

The majority refer to the Municipal Court judgment of 21 March 2012 (see paragraph 24 of the judgment), but unfortunately do not cite any specific passage. As a result, the judgment loses something of its readability. But the real issue here is quite different. In fact, the applicant was not convicted in the present case for criticising the Croatian judicial system or influencing a judge. No: he was found guilty of the offence of defamation with regard to a war veteran (see paragraph 10 of the judgment), I.P., who had no connection to the machinery of justice. It is true that, according to the Municipal Court\u2019s assessment, the applicant attributed unlimited powers to I.P. to have him convicted. Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that the applicant\u2019s conviction was based solely on his defamatory statements concerning I.P. and not on any remarks attacking the justice system or an individual judge. What is more, there is nothing to suggest that I.P. ever faced any legal action for allegedly exerting pressure on prosecution witnesses in the context of the applicant\u2019s trial for war crimes (see paragraph 77 of the judgment). Had that been the case, I would agree that his prosecution or conviction could be justified on the basis, among other elements, of the protection of the authority of the judiciary, which concerns all \u201cpersons involved in the machinery of justice\u201d (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, \u00a7 56, Series A no. 30).",

Consequently, the right to a fair trial may come into play (see paragraph 64 of the judgment). Nevertheless, the paragraph in question comes under the section dealing with the violation of Article 10. This does not warrant what, in my humble opinion, is the questionable introduction of extraneous elements aimed at further justifying the interference. Freedom of expression applies across the board and does not stop at the courtroom door.",
