Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see Immobiliare Saffi v.

The remaining part of the debt, however, has not yet been honoured. In the course of the enforcement proceedings the applicant proposed two alternative means of enforcement: public sale of the debtors\u2019 movable property or transfer of the amount due from the company\u2019s account. Since the latter means lacked any prospect of success, the enforcement continued against the debtors\u2019 movable property. Indeed, a public sale of the vehicle was fixed by the first-instance court to that end (see paragraph 11 above). The applicant was even granted, by a final decision, an enforcement title over that vehicle. A third party who was in actual possession of the vehicle was also ordered to transfer it in the applicant\u2019s possession (see paragraph 11 above). Instead of completing the enforcement against the vehicle, the same court later authorised the third party to register it in his possession (see paragraph 12 above). The subsequent confiscation order of the vehicle was unsuccessful because, as the Supreme Court found, the police had failed to enforce the order (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above). Given the third party\u2019s residence, on 16\u00a0February 1999 the applicant\u2019s case was reassigned to the \u0160tip Court of First Instance (see paragraph 19 above). The Court finds that that court did not take any measure to enforce payment of the remaining debt. It was only on 16 January 2006, that is seven years after the reassignment of the case, that the first-instance court made queries about the state of affairs regarding the enforcement of the applicant\u2019s claim.
