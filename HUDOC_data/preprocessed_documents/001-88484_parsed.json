Greece, judgment of 26 February 1998, Reports\u00a01998-I, \u00a7\u00a097). The Court observes that, in the present case, the enforcement was not formally stayed or suspended pending the outcome of those proceedings. Finally, it further took over a year for the enforcement court to call the applicants to come forward with another means and assets of enforcement (see paragraph 28 above).",
