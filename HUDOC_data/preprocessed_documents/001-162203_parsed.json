Besides, while it is true that the second investigation into the death of the applicants\u2019 son is ongoing, more than nine years and seven months have elapsed since his passing. In the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds no reason to depart from the general rule that domestic remedies to be exhausted are those that applied on the date the application was lodged before the Court. As a result, the applicants were not required to avail themselves of the remedy before the Constitutional Court (see \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Y\u0131ld\u0131z v.

An autopsy was carried out on the deceased\u2019s body. Gendarmerie officers took statements from the deceased\u2019s relatives, including the applicants. Signature analysis was carried out, at the end of which it was concluded that the signature at the bottom of the suicide note found in the deceased\u2019s car belonged to the deceased. The Ankara public prosecutor then concluded that H\u00fcseyin Ba\u015fbilen had committed suicide and decided to close the investigation. The Sincan Assize Court, upon an appeal lodged by the applicants, asked the Forensic Medicine Institute to prepare a report concerning the injuries found on the deceased\u2019s body and dismissed the appeal when the Forensic Medicine Institute\u2019s report concluded that it was possible that H\u00fcseyin Ba\u015fbilen had killed himself.",

Besides this, the first section of expertise of the Forensic Medicine Institute only opined that it was possible that Mr\u00a0Ba\u015fbilen had committed suicide.
