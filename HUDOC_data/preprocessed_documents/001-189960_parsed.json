Furthermore, although on 20 February 2007 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office informed the second applicant that her complaint concerning the first applicant\u2019s alleged ill-treatment had been transferred to the Baku City Prosecutor\u2019s Office (see paragraph 24 above), the investigator in charge of the case ordered the first applicant\u2019s forensic examination only on 7 April 2007, which was carried out on 12 April 2007. No explanation for this delay was given by the Government. Moreover, despite the Court\u2019s explicit request to the Government to submit copies of all the documents relating to the domestic proceedings, the Government failed to provide the Court with a copy of forensic report no. 32/TM. The Court also cannot overlook the fact that medical record no. 353, which did not contain references to any injury on the first applicant\u2019s body during his initial examination upon his arrival at the MNS pre-trial detention facility, was not correctly dated and signed in its part concerning the first applicant\u2019s initial examination.",

The Court notes that it is undisputed by the second and third applicants that the first applicant refused to be transferred to the medical facility at least on two occasions between 6 March and 28 July 2009 (see paragraphs 59-60 above). It further appears from the submissions of the head of the medical department of prison no. 15 at the hearing of 6\u00a0March 2009 before the Nizami District Court that, although the first applicant had already been informed of the necessity of his transfer to a specialised medical establishment, the first applicant had rejected that suggestion (see paragraph 56 above). In that connection, the Court cannot accept the argument put forward by the second and third applicants that the first applicant had refused such a transfer because of his financial situation and the quality of medical care in the medical facility, as under domestic law prisoners were provided with medical care free of charge and there is no evidence in the case file that money was demanded for his transfer or the quality of medical care in the medical facility was not adequate. Moreover, the present case should be distinguished from the cases in which the applicants, suffering from a potentially life-threatening disease, interrupted their medical treatment and were consequently deprived of life-saving treatment without sufficient grounds (compare Karakhanyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45-50).
