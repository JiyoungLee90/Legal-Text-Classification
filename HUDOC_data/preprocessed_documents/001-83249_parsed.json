It further observes that the dispute related to a right which was civil by its very nature, since it was a dispute between the State and the applicants as to the determination of the latter\u2019s property rights under the Property Acts. Through the competent Commission\u2019s decisions at issue, the State recognised that the applicants were entitled to receive compensation. Notwithstanding the fact that domestic law omitted to specify a time for their becoming final, the Court observes that, after more than twelve years, the merits of such decisions were not challenged before any court and, in law, nothing therefore prevented their immediate enforcement. Consequently, the Court will consider the rights thus generated to be final and enforceable. In addition the rights arising from such decisions and the subsequent enforcement proceedings were closely bound up with each other (the effectiveness of the former ultimately depended on the success of the latter).",

These measures should include the adoption of the maps for the property valuation in respect of those applicants who are entitled to receive compensation in kind and the designation of an adequate fund in respect to those applicants who are entitled to receive compensation in value, this in order to make it possible for all the claimants having successful Commission\u2019s decisions in their favour to obtain speedily the lands or the sums due.
