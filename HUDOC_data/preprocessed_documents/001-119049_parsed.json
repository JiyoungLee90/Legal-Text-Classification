Both NIPO and the Board of Appeals found that the application did not involve any novelty in respect of aviation, though the reasoning differed. Unlike NIPO, the Board of Appeals found that the application could have succeeded in a limited area of sea transport. The applicants had been advised that in order to succeed, the patent requirements would have to be defined so as to exclude aviation but had not been willing to do so.

The case-officer handling their application to the NIPO had displayed bias and hence a lack of impartiality. The applicants further complained that pending a final decision by the Board of Appeals it would have served no purpose for them to exercise a remedy in respect of the above. In a situation of administrative delay such as that in the present instance, the rule whereby patent rights were protected for twenty years from the date of the filing of the patent application had the effect of undermining the possibility of having such rights established through the use of legal remedies.",

However, whilst average processing time was two to three years, in the present case it took eighteen years to have the matter processed by the competent bodies.
