In a further series of decisions the Supreme Court considered that it would be unfair for the legally-aided party to be penalised for the fact that legalaid applications could not be processed quickly enough to make it possible for a cassation appeal to be lodged within a period of thirty days counted from the day of service of the judgment on the party. The parties waiting for legal-aid services cannot be held at fault for shortcomings in the system. A party who was obliged to have recourse to legal aid should not be put in a worse situation than that of a person who did not seek it. A request to appeal out of time should therefore be submitted within seven days from the date on which the legal-aid lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file or had an effective possibility of drafting an appeal (4\u00a0March 2005, II UZ 72/04; 27\u00a0June 2000, I CZ 62/00), or from the date when the lawyer was informed that he had been assigned to the case by the local Bar Association (11\u00a0October 2001, IV CZ 163/01; 17\u00a0November 1998, II UZ 122/98; 11\u00a0October 2001, IV CZ 163/01;",

The court was of the view that applications for leave served the purpose of making access to the Supreme Court for legally-aided parties genuine and effective. Hence, the beginning of the time-limit could not be determined in a mechanical manner in all cases.

These divergences had been reviewed and acknowledged by the Supreme Court in its resolution of 17 February 2009 (see paragraph 18 above). The relevant request had therefore not offered any reasonably foreseeable prospects of success to the applicant as the application by the courts of the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure at the material time had been haphazard. It had only been the resolution of February 2009 which offered to the courts guidance as to the proper manner of handling such requests, in a way which would have respected the procedural fairness and the parties' rights to avail themselves of legal assistance under the legalaid scheme.
