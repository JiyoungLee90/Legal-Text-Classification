In Kudla v. Poland (judgment of the Grand Chamber, 26 October 2000, application no.\u00a030210/96) the ECtHR expressed the view that the domestic remedy that was available to the applicant for protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time can be considered effective in terms of Article 13 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ... if it prevents the alleged violation or its continuation or provides adequate redress for any violation that had already occurred (\u00a7 158). In the ECtHR\u2019s view, Article 13 of the Convention offers an alternative: a remedy is effective if it can be used to either expedite a judicial decision before the violation occurs, or ensure adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (\u00a7 158).",
