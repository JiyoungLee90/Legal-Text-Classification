The case originated in two applications (nos. 30953/09 and 53174/10) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Mahmud Sami Özsoy and Mr Serdar Yıldırım (“the applicants”), on 27 April 2009 and 8 July 2010 respectively.
The first applicant was represented by Mr K. Tangülü, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 22 September 2015 the complaints concerning the alleged unfairness of the proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court on account of the applicants’ inability to access the classified documents submitted by the Ministry of Defence, and the alleged independence and impartiality of the tribunal because of the presence of two military officers sitting on the bench who did not enjoy the same judicial guarantees as the other military judges, were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the applications by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants were born in 1987 and 1986 respectively and live in Ankara.
The applicants were cadets in military schools. Based on classified investigation reports, they were expelled from their schools. None of the applicants had access to these classified reports. They all filed actions against the Ministry of Defence with the Supreme Military Administrative Court to have annulment of the impugned decisions.
Relying on the classified investigation reports, the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicants’ requests and their subsequent requests for rectification on different dates shown in detail in the attached list.
A description of the domestic law at the material time can be found in Tanışma v. Turkey (no. 32219/05, §§ 29-47, 17 November 2015), and Yavuz v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 29870/96, 25 May 2000).
