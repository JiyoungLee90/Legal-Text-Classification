It further observes that the proceedings complained of lasted 16 years, 5 months and 25 days, out of which 13 years, 10 months and 15 days fall within the Court's competence ratione temporis. The proceedings before the administrative authorities lasted from 1 May 1993 until 27 October 2000, that is 7 years, 5 months and 27 days. Before the courts the proceedings lasted from 27 October 2000 until 13 March 2007, that is 6 years, 4 months and 16 days. Thus the length of proceedings before the courts constituted almost half of the entire period. The Court admits that the time the proceedings lasted before the courts was considerable and that it cannot be excluded that the applicant, if she had lodged a complaint under the 2004 Act, would have been granted just satisfaction. At the same time, however, the Court notes that the domestic courts would not have been able to examine the long period of almost 7.5 years when the proceedings were pending before the administrative authorities. Thus, in any event, the overall period of the domestic proceedings would not have been taken into account. It follows that in the particular circumstances of the present case a\u00a0complaint under the 2004 Act cannot be regarded as an effective remedy with a sufficient degree of certainty.",
