However, Austrian criminal law in practice deprives this fundamental principle of all effect. What comes before a judge is decided by the public prosecutor, who is subject to instructions from the private office of the Minister of Justice. Prosecutors know that their career may depend on the click of a minister's fingers. That turns them into cowering vacillators rather than energetic investigators. Instead of raking through the muck and carrying out painstaking investigative work, they look upwards so as not to fall down. Justice ministers from all parties know why they do not wish to relinquish their right to issue instructions.",

Kabas admitted having met at Plachutta but denied having taken possession of a file.

It therefore ordered the applicant company to pay 2,500 euros (EUR) in compensation to Mr Kabas, to publish the judgment and to pay Mr Kabas' costs of the proceedings. It found that the article taken as a whole was based on the assumption that there were persons whose guilt was established but only some of them were prosecuted. The article's statements concerning the misconduct of the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Minister of Justice could only be understood in the way that the Public Prosecutor's Office, against its better judgment, had refrained from prosecuting clearly guilty criminal offenders. The article suggested that Mr Kleindienst's statement heavily charged Mr Kabas and conveyed that - if everything was perfectly above-board - Mr Kabas should now also be convicted. By calling the situation that Mr Kabas was not convicted \u201cgrotesque\u201d the article not only established the juridical not maintainable presumption that a person who had received a file obtained in abuse of office had also committed an offence, but also suggested that this dealing with the matter was against all legal practice. The article conveyed to the reader that under duly conducted criminal prosecution the filing of an indictment against Mr Kabas and his conviction would merely be a matter of form. This message was presented as quasi established fact which was strengthened by the repeated reference to the judge who had considered Mr Kleindienst's statements as absolutely credible. The reader was given the impression that Mr Kabas was undoubtedly guilty and that his conviction was inevitable. The article had therefore crossed the threshold of the simple utterance of suspicion against Mr\u00a0Kabas.",

Furthermore, the interpretation of section 7b of the Media Act in conformity with Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention called for an extensive understanding of the protection of the presumption of innocence. While there was certainly public interest in the discussion of the \u201cpolice information affair\u201d, Mr\u00a0Kabas' right in the presumption of his innocence outweighed the applicant company's right to freedom of expression. In the impugned article the applicant company depicted Mr Kabas as already convicted and did not inform the reader that the charges against him had already thoroughly been examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office which had closed his file months ago. When weighing the respective interests, the domestic courts had furthermore had regard to the fact that Mr Kabas was not given the opportunity to comment.

It referred to the evidence given by Mr Kleindienst and reproduced these statements, allegedly charging Mr Kabas, in its text. The article further informed the reader that Mr Kleindienst had been considered credible by the judge concerned and had also been convicted on the basis of his testimony. The Court finds that in the light of these facts, which remained uncontested by the domestic courts and the Government, it appears indeed not digressive to question the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against Mr Kabas.",

In this regard the Court observes that the article reported Mr Kabas' own disavowing testimony at the trial in the proceedings against Mr Kleindienst and expressly informed its reader that Mr Kabas was not prosecuted. Moreover, at the time the article was published, investigations against Mr Kabas had already been discontinued so that the article at issue could not possibly influence the outcome of a pending criminal trial (see mutatis mutandis Worm v. , judgment of 29\u00a0August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997V).",

Having in mind that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest, the Court finds that the domestic courts overstepped the narrow margin of appreciation accorded to Member States, and that the interference was disproportionate to the aim pursued and thus not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
