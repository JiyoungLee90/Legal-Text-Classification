The case originated in an application (no. 4801/13) against the Republic of Albania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Albanian national, Mr Gëzim Brahimaj (“the applicant”), on 8 January 2013.
The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms A. Hicka of the State Advocate’s Office.
On 22 September 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government failed to submit any observations on the admissibility and merits of the case within the time-limit allowed.
The applicant failed to submit claims for just satisfaction within the time-limit allowed (Rule 60 of the Rules of Court).
The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Vlora.
On 30 May 2007 the Vlora District Court ordered the Vlora Construction Police (Policia e Ndërtimit dega Vlorë) to pay the applicant 2,795,956 Albanian leks (“ALL”) for the unjustified destruction of his property.
On 11 June 2008 the decision was upheld by the Vlora Court of Appeal and became final.
On 11 September 2008 an enforcement writ was issued.
From 2009 to 2012 the bailiff unsuccessfully sought the enforcement of the decision from the Vlora Construction Police and the National Urban Construction Inspectorate (Inspektorati Ndërtimor Urbanistik Kombëtar).
To date, the final decision has remained unenforced.
The relevant domestic law and practice has been described in the cases of Qufaj Co. Sh.p.k. v. Albania (no. 54268/00, §§ 21-26, 18 November 2004) and Gjyli v. Albania (no. 32907/07, §§ 19-28, 29 September 2009).
In addition to the Constitutional Court’s case-law as regards the length of proceedings mentioned in the Court’s judgment in the case of Luli and Others v. Albania (nos. 64480/09, 64482/09, 12874/10, 56935/10, 3129/12 and 31355/09, §§ 63-64, 1 April 2014), the Constitutional Court has delivered three subsequent judgments finding a breach of the appellants’ rights on account of the length of terminated court proceedings (decisions nos. 3/15 of 26 January 2015, 56 of 21 July 2015 and 69/15 of 17 November 2015). No award was made to the appellants in those judgments.
.  Furthermore, the Constitutional Court has reaffirmed its longestablished practice of finding a breach of the appellants’ rights on account of the length of non-enforcement proceedings (decisions nos. 9/14 of 27 February 2014; 16/14 of 21 March 2014; 32/14 of 26 May 2014; 46/14 and 47/14 of 30 July 2014; 14/15 of 30 March 2015; 24/15 of 27 April 2015; 25/15 of 22 May 2015; 52/15 of 20 July 2015; 61/15 of 23 September 2015; 72/15 of 27 November 2015). No award was made to the appellants in those judgments, nor was any other means of redress provided in relation to the continued non-enforcement.
