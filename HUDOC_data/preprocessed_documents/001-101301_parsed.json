They argued that the proceedings related to the examination of defects in construction of real property, an area that was particularly complex and where difficulties arose in particular as regards the establishment of facts. The Government pointed out that the observations submitted by the parties were exceptionally voluminous and that the expert opinions had to deal with a large number of detailed questions. As regards the importance of what was at stake in the proceedings, the Government, while accepting that the dispute was a source of great strain for the applicant, adduced that her case did not fall within the category of cases that required particularly swift action because or their pre-eminent importance. In respect of the conduct of the proceedings the Government conceded that the Regional Court had scheduled hearings over a period of around five months on two occasions and that between the applicant\u2019s submissions dated 8 December 2006 and the court\u2019s order for the taking of evidence of 16 May 2007 another five months elapsed. They further acknowledged that the changes in the person of the judge rapporteur required some time for the new judge to familiarise with the case and necessitated new consultation of the parties and additional deliberations. However, the Government invoked that notwithstanding these difficulties and the fact that the  had been subject to an overload of work, it was also the applicant\u2019s conduct that had significantly contributed to the duration of the proceedings. The parties themselves had asked for suspension of the proceedings on the occasion of the hearing of 21 April 2005. The applicant had extended his claim and had submitted new submissions on the occasion of the hearing of 10 November 2005 which thus had to be postponed. Her numerous applications for extension of the deadlines set for the submission of written observations had also contributed to the duration of the proceedings as well as her repeated objections to the expert opinions and her requests for supplementary expert opinions.",

However, as regards the proceedings before the Cologne Regional Court at first instance, the Court, while noting that the case was of a certain complexity and that the applicant contributed to the length of the proceedings to a certain extent, cannot ignore that there have been several periods of delay attributable to the Regional Court. It observes in this context that the hearings of 21 April 2005 and 11 May 2006 were scheduled over periods of approximately five months in advance in each case. Following changes in the person of the judge rapporteur in 2007 which led to further delays, the  ordered the taking of a first expert opinion on 16 May 2007 more than two-and-a-half years after the proceedings had been instituted. A second expert opinion was ordered on 1\u00a0April 2008. Even though both expert opinions had been the subject of an extensive exchange of written submissions and objections by the parties, it was only on the occasion of the hearing of 23 April 2009 that the parties were given the opportunity to put questions directly to the expert with a view to expediting the proceedings. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",

She claimed an additional loss of rent of EUR 1,923 per month for the period from 2005 to 2008, amounting to 118,620.60 in total, on the ground that her involvement in the proceedings and their financial implications prevented her from renting out another property owned by her but not related to the one in dispute. The applicant further alleged that due to the financial problems encountered by her as a result of the proceedings she had to sell a car below value causing her a loss of EUR\u00a033,000 as well as hunting equipment at an estimated value of EUR\u00a07,000. She finally claimed an amount of EUR 17,033.29 for diverse costs related to bank loans, insurances, operating expenses etc.",

Furthermore, the Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damages alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, it considers that the applicant must have sustained non-pecuniary damage. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards her EUR\u00a02,800 under that head.",
