In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.  [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I). The Court stresses that the guarantees contained in Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as granting a defendant the right to have an infinite number of witnesses called.",

However, such reassessment has never taken place in the first applicant\u2019s case, which means that the travel ban was in reality an automatic, blanket measure of indefinite duration. The Court considers that this ran counter to the authorities\u2019 duty under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to take appropriate care to ensure that any interference with the right to leave one\u2019s country remains justified and proportionate throughout its duration, in the individual circumstances of the case.",
