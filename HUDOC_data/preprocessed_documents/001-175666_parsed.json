In particular, Article 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to which the District Court referred in its decision of 28 February 2009, did not spell out\u00a0the procedure to be followed when ordering or extending the detention of a person whose extradition was sought or established a time-limit for detention pending extradition. In so far as the decision of 28 February 2009 also referred to Article 109 of the Code, the Court notes that Article 109 limited the initial detention period to two months. That period expired on 28\u00a0April 2009 but no extension had been sought by the prosecutor or approved by a Russian court in breach of that provision. As it happened, the applicant stayed more than seven months in custody without any limit having been imposed on its duration. It follows that the applicant\u2019s detention cannot be considered \u201clawful\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 of the Convention. In these circumstances, the Court does not need to consider separately whether the extradition proceedings were conducted with special diligence (see Ismoilov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 140).",

Russia, no. 66317/09, \u00a7 115, 3 March 2011). It also emphasised that Article 110 did not provide for a clear mechanism of applying for cancellation or varying the preventive measure in the context of detention pending extradition (see Kadirzhanov and Mamashev v. Russia, nos. 42351/13 and 47823/13, \u00a7 131-32, 17 July 2014). Moreover, Article\u00a0125 conferred standing to bring complaints solely on \u201cparties to criminal proceedings\u201d, whereas the applicant was not party to any criminal proceedings against him in Russia. The Court finally notes that the present case, in which there was no periodic judicial review of the applicant\u2019s detention, must be distinguished from those in which such review was available at reasonable intervals (see, for example, Nabid Abdullayev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 8474/14, \u00a7\u00a7 89-93, 15 October 2015).",
