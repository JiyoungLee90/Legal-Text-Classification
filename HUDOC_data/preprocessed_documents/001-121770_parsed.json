In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element to torture, as recognised also in the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which in Article 1 defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering for such purposes as obtaining information or a confession, punishing, intimidating, coercing, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity (see Dikme v.

Nor did the judge at the initial hearing request that the applicant\u2019s clear physical discomfort be investigated. Accordingly, it was reasonable for the applicant to consider that, his defence to the criminal charges apart, other domestic remedies were ineffective (see G\u00f6\u00e7men v.

Italy, no. 34896/97, \u00a7 99, 5 December 2012; and, Pullicino v. Malta (dec.), no. 45441/99, 15 June 2000). Not only do the media have the task of imparting information and ideas concerning matters that come before the courts just as in other areas of public interest; the public also has a right to receive them (see, amongst others, The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26\u00a0April 1979, \u00a7 65, Series A no. 30; and Worm v. Austria, 29 August 1997, \u00a7 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997V). Provided that it does not overstep the bounds imposed in the interests of the proper administration of justice, reporting, including comment, on court proceedings contributes to their publicity and is thus perfectly consonant with the requirement under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that hearings be public (see Pullicino, cited above). Article 6 \u00a7 2 cannot therefore prevent the authorities from informing the public about criminal investigations in progress, but it requires that they do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (see, amongst others, Pe\u0161a v. Croatia, no. 40523/08, \u00a7 139, 8 April 2010).",

Ever since that judgment, the Court has repeatedly confirmed that \u201cin order for ill-treatment to fall within the scope of Article 3 it must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim\u201d. The Court has added that \u201cfurther factors include the purpose for which the treatment was inflicted together with the intention or motivation behind it ..., as well as its context, such as an atmosphere of heightened tension and emotions\u201d (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 88, ECHR 2010).

                        "content": "For me, the problem lies in the way the Chamber applied these general principles in the concrete case. First of all, the judgment accepts \u201cthe lack of any description of the injuries sustained\u201d by the first applicant (paragraph 95 of the judgment). Further on in the same paragraph it is suggested that the first applicant\u2019s allegations \u201ccreated a presumption of fact that the applicant had been subjected to ill-treatment proscribed by Article 3 at the hands of State agents\u201d. Given that these allegations were not investigated by the authorities, the Chamber rightly finds a violation of the procedural limb of Article 3. The fact that no medical or other evidence was provided led to the conclusion that these allegations remained a mere \u201cpresumption of fact\u201d. Subsequently, one finds in the judgment the expressions \u201cinferences can be drawn\u201d that the treatment was intentional (paragraph 98 of the judgment), or \u201cmost likely\u201d for assessing the length of the ill-treatment, its nature and even the purposive element. I am not convinced that this analysis is compatible with the \u201cproof beyond reasonable doubt\u201d requirement. In a situation where the first applicant has not specifically complained of torture, and such has not been established at national level or from any other source (paragraph 91 of the judgment), for our Court to jump in and to conclude that the applicant had been tortured produces, to my mind, an extremely far-reaching and unsafe conclusion. The standard of proof, namely \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d, and the related evidentiary considerations set out above, must, in my opinion, be very carefully applied when it comes to allegations of torture \u2013 the gravest form of treatment proscribed by Article 3 \u2013 and therefore cannot be established by presumption, inference nor likeliness (compare with Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7\u00a7 91-106, ECHR 1999V; G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 94; Dedovskiy and Others v.

My reading of the case-law of this Court is that, in such cases, the failure of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation for injuries sustained by a person under their control leads to a conclusion that there has also been a substantive violation of Article 3 (see, among others, Tomasi v. France, 27 August 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 108-11, Series A no. 241A; Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 336; and, Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 87). However, in order to ascertain whether torture has been used, the other evidentiary standards and requirements explained above must also be fulfilled. In view of our Court\u2019s case-law and of the factual circumstances of this case, I am unable to conclude that the applicant was tortured, although I fully agree that there has been a substantive violation of Article 3 of the Convention .",

Thus, the admission of statements obtained as a result of torture or of other ill-treatment in breach of Article 3 as evidence to establish the relevant facts in criminal proceedings renders the proceedings as a whole unfair, irrespective of the probative value of the statements and irrespective of whether their use is decisive in securing the defendant\u2019s conviction\u201d (paragraph 117 of the judgment).",

Two Grand Chamber judgments have either left open the question whether the use of real evidence obtained by an act classified as inhuman and degrading treatment, but falling short of torture, always rendered a trial unfair (Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7\u00a7 106-07, ECHR 2006IX) or avoided answering directly the question in general terms, due to the particular circumstances of the case and the lack of a causal link between the prohibited methods of investigation and the applicant\u2019s conviction and sentence (G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 180). As in the joint dissenting opinion in the G\u00e4fgen judgment of several Judges of that Grand Chamber composition, I would reiterate that \u201cthe Court could have answered that question categorically by asserting, in an unequivocal manner, that irrespective of the conduct of an accused, fairness, for the purpose of Article 6, presupposes respect for the rule of law and requires, as a self-evident proposition, the exclusion of any evidence that has been obtained in violation of Article 3. A criminal trial which admits and relies, to any extent, upon evidence obtained as a result of breaching such an absolute provision of the Convention cannot a fortiori be a fair one. The Court\u2019s reluctance to cross that final frontier and to establish a clear or \u201cbright-line\u201d rule in this core area of fundamental human rights is regrettable.\u201d",

This is more so because, unlike in G\u00e4fgen (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 147), no subsequent statements were made by the first applicant confirming in court the incriminating statements made by him earlier in custody. On the contrary, the first applicant insisted that these statements had been obtained from him as a result of the use of force (paragraphs 28, 31, 33 and 49 of the present judgment). This is all the more so in a situation where the allegations of the first applicant about being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention met with the total silence and passivity of the Albanian authorities, notwithstanding their procedural obligations under Article 3 and their awareness of the allegations including at the time of the criminal proceedings against the two applicants. In my opinion, especially in such case where the first applicant made statements incriminating the second applicant, we should have asked ourselves whether, leaving aside the issue of torture, a lesser form of ill-treatment proscribed by Article 3 used against the first applicant in order to obtain those statements may be sufficient for concluding that the fairness of the second applicant\u2019s trial was compromised on account of their use. In my view, the Chamber should have opted for a broader application of the scope of the exclusionary rule in respect of evidence obtained as a result of a breach of Article 3. This would also have led to a clarification of our case-law on the matter and would have strengthened the consistency of its application.",

As already pointed out in the above-mentioned partly dissenting opinion in the G\u00e4fgen judgment, it would be difficult for a Court that has accepted that the absence of a lawyer in the initial stages of an investigation renders the entire trial unfair (Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, 27 November 2008), to limit the scope of the exclusionary rule only to evidence obtained by torture. Or, to put it differently, not to have the courage to broaden the scope of the exclusionary rule so as to cover all evidence obtained in violation of Article 3. The facts of the present case offered the Court the advantage, or indeed the disadvantage, of having both Salduz and G\u00e4fgen elements. While the Chamber in paragraph 120 of the judgment accepts that the absence of a lawyer in the initial stages of the proceedings against the first applicant rendered the entire trial unfair, according to the Salduz principle, it seems to require the impugned acts to be qualified as torture in order to conclude that there has been a violation of the fair trial guarantee. Does this mean that the Salduz principle is more stringent that the Jalloh or G\u00e4fgen one? This would be difficult, if not impossible, to assert considering the nature of the Articles in play, Article 6 guaranteeing non-absolute rights on the one hand and, on the other hand, Article 3 and its absolute character.",

The fact that the first applicant was ill-treated contrary to Article 3 would have been of itself sufficient to ground a breach of Article 6 in respect of both applicants. This solution would not have changed anything for the applicants, but it would have produced a result which would have been clearer and more consistent with our case-law under Articles 3 and 6.",
