The use of the first applicant\u2019s plot had been determined by the provisions of law and the local development plan long before 10 October 1994. On that date the first applicant had not possessed, in particular, the right to build other houses on his plot. After 10 October 1994 no provision of law and no act of the domestic authority had limited any property rights of the applicants. Consequently, the Government submitted that the application should be declared incompatible ratione temporis with the Convention. Alternatively, they maintained that in respect of the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction only the period after 11 February 2000 should be taken into consideration by the Court as only on that date had the applicant submitted his grievances to the authorities",

It rather refers to continuous restrictions imposed on the exercise of their ownership and arising from various legal measures, adopted both before and after that date. In this respect, the Court considers that it cannot be said that the restrictions at issue which had had their origin in the period prior to 10 October 1994 remained unchanged after that date. It further observes that the 1994 Act, which entered into force on 1\u00a0January\u00a01995, maintained the impugned restrictions and extended their effects until 31\u00a0December 2003. Furthermore, the Court notes that the arguments raised by the Government are the same as those already examined and rejected by the Court in previous cases against Poland (see Rosi\u0144ski v. Poland, no.\u00a017373/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a042-43, 17\u00a0July 2007) and the Government have not submitted any new arguments which would lead the Court to depart from its previous findings.

They also pointed out the temporary nature of the prolongations. The Court observes that it is not in dispute that the 1994\u00a0Act was intended to improve the situation of owners to be expropriated in the future in that a right to compensation was foreseen for them for the first time in Polish law. However, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures complained of, the Court cannot overlook the fact that, when enacting the 1994 Act, the legislature on the one hand introduced compensatory measures, but at the same time excluded the application of those provisions in respect of plans adopted before 1\u00a0January\u00a01995. What is more, the legislature subsequently prolonged this situation on three occasions, for an overall period of nine years. Consequently, until 31 December 2003 the applicant could not make any claim for compensation against the municipality in respect of his particular situation obtaining up to that date.",

Such claims can be pursued before civil courts. However, it observes that these provisions started to operate only after the 2003 Act had entered into force and only in respect of local land development plans adopted after that date. It has not been argued or shown that the 2003 Act provides for any retrospective right to compensation for the prejudice suffered by the applicant, before its entry into force, as a result of restrictions originating in land development plans adopted in the past. Consequently, the entry into force of the 2003 Act did not alter the applicant\u2019s situation.",

The Court is aware that the difficulties in enacting a comprehensive legal framework in the area of urban planning constitute part of the process of transition from a socialist legal order and its property regime to one compatible with the rule of law and the market economy \u2013 a process which, by the very nature of things, is fraught with difficulties. However, these difficulties and the enormity of the tasks facing legislators having to deal with all the complex issues involved in such a transition do not exempt the Contracting States from the obligations stemming from the Convention or its Protocols (see Schirmer v. Poland, no. 68880/01, 21\u00a0September 2004, \u00a7 38 and Skibi\u0144scy, cited above, \u00a7 96).",

However, at the time when the applicant made his request there were no good grounds on which to believe that the 1988 plan would be implemented promptly. As a result, the de facto blocking of any construction on the applicant\u2019s property until 31 December 2003 did not serve any immediate or medium-term purpose in the interest of the community.",
