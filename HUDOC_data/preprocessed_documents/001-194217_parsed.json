The Court has held that an effective investigation should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, such as witness testimony and forensic evidence. The investigation\u2019s conclusions must be based on thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all relevant elements. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is an important factor. There must also be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation, the degree of which may vary from case to case. Moreover, notwithstanding its subsidiary role in assessing evidence, the Court reiterates that where allegations are made under Article 3 of the Convention the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny, even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place (see Y. v.

In our view, the fact that a complaint concerns an alleged failure by the respondent State to comply with procedural obligations arising under Articles 3 and 8 in a specific context (such as the present one) cannot entail that the Court may, of its own motion, examine and adjudicate on aspects of the investigation going (well) beyond the factual elements relied on by the applicant in his or her original complaint.

Furthermore, an examination by the Court of matters going beyond the factual scope of the applicant\u2019s complaint would also risk contradicting the limitations deriving from the admissibility requirements laid down in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, according to which the Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.",

On the one hand, those in which she repeated the very same arguments that were put forward by A in the initial complaint, together with those in which she merely further elaborated upon the initial submissions of A related to the investigation into the alleged sexual abuse of B and the protection of the rights of a child during that investigation on the basis of the facts alleged in the initial complaint as subsequently clarified and elaborated upon in observations by the Government and the applicant; and, on the other hand, those comments that were not directly based on such facts.",

However, only the first type of comments raised by the special representative would satisfy the requirements of Radomilja. Regarding the second type of arguments (those listed in footnote 3), an issue arises as to whether they could fall at all within the scope of the case and thus whether they could be addressed by the Court, or whether they are inadmissible under the six-month rule or because they would be considered to be ultra petita, or possibly for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. This is a novel issue in our case-law, which deserves special attention. In this connection, we agree with the concurring opinions of our colleagues Judges Koskelo, Eicke and Ilievski as well as with the concurring opinion of Judge Wojtyczek. We will further elaborate upon that issue below, when addressing the role of the special representative, taking into consideration the principle of the best interests of the child, which the Court itself is obliged to apply. It is regrettable that the present judgment did not attempt to distinguish between these two types of arguments by the special representative and to take a position in this respect on the scope of the case. This criticism is equally as pertinent for the majority as for the minority.",

The Court noted in the present judgment that there were three aspects to the applicant\u2019s complaint: adequacy of the legal framework, effectiveness of the investigation and sufficient protection of victims\u2019 rights during an investigation related to the alleged sexual abuse of B (see paragraphs 105 and 115 of the judgment). We agree with such assessment. Accordingly, our criticism of the majority position is actually based on the arguments cited under the parties\u2019 submissions in the judgment (paragraphs 94-96 and 98-100 of the judgment) except for the one related to the lack of an effective investigation into the alleged emotional abuse of the child (paragraph 97 of the judgment) upon which we reflect separately under the role of the special representative.",

This is so because very often applicants do not have an accurate overview of the prosecution file and thus cannot be aware of all possible deficiencies in an investigation. Thus, it is sufficient for them to make an arguable claim that an investigation was ineffective and then the burden of proof is on the Government to demonstrate that the investigation was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Court\u2019s case-law related to an effective investigation, otherwise the Court might draw adverse consequences on the basis of the facts as presented by the applicant and clarified by the Government in their observations. However, in the present case the submissions by the applicant are rather exhaustive and our criticism of the majority position actually, in our view, fully reflects the applicant\u2019s arguments related to the positive obligation of the State to protect her rights as a victim during the investigation and to the effectiveness of an investigation into the alleged sexual abuse of a child. As emphasised before, all of these arguments have been submitted for comment to the Government. They are cited in summary form in paragraphs 94-96 and 98-100 of the judgment.",

The applicant alleged a failure to protect her \u201cvictim rights\u201d during the investigation as an issue to be examined by the Court (see paragraphs 105 and 115 of the judgment). We note that a person should be considered to be a victim regardless of whether an offender is identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted and regardless of the familial relationship between them (see Article 19 of the EU Directive on the minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, paragraph 76 of the judgment). In our view the judgment should have examined the complaint related to the protection of victims\u2019 rights from the perspective of the child alleged to be a victim of sexual abuse. For this it is not sufficient to meticulously cite, in the judgment under the headings European Union Law and International Materials, criteria related to the protection of victims\u2019 rights during a criminal investigation in general and the rights of children who are (alleged) victims of sexual abuse in particular, as developed in international documents (see paragraphs 76, 78, 79 and 81-83, compare also Y.\u00a0v.\u00a0Slovenia, \u00a7 104), but in reviewing the circumstances of the case these criteria should have been taken into account.",

We further note that at the same time C alleged that A had been physically punishing B, about which he had lodged a criminal complaint (see paragraphs 15 and 25 of the judgment) and that he had instituted court proceedings against A seeking custody of B (see paragraphs 23, 27 and 35 of the judgment).

As confirmed by the special counsellor to the State Attorney\u2019s Office in her report dated 3\u00a0December 2014, the domestic authorities had been well aware of the fact that A had exposed B to additional psychological assessments (see paragraph 43 of the judgment), but they did nothing to prevent and/or avoid such secondary victimisation of the child (see, in this sense, the relevant international material, in particular Articles 30 (2) and 35 of the Lanzarote Convention, cited at paragraph 77 of the judgment, and the explanatory report thereto, cited in paragraph 78 of the judgment, and paragraphs 77 and\u00a078 of the report of the Lanzarote Committee cited in paragraph 80 of the judgment). In fact, the authorities themselves ordered the last psychological assessment, with a view to the child\u2019s \u201ccriminal protection\u201d (see paragraph\u00a039 of the judgment). In G.U. v.

The function of videotaping is not only to secure the rights of the defence, as it seems to be understood and interpreted by the majority (see paragraph 125 of the judgment), but the main or at least equally important objective of videotaping interviews with a child victim of sexual abuse is to protect children against the risk of being further traumatised by repeated unnecessary interviews. Its aim is to limit the number of interviews as far as possible. The videotaped interview can serve multiple purposes, including for medical examination and therapeutic services. Such a practice has been successfully developed in numerous countries (see Article 35 (1) (e) of the Lanzarote Convention with the explanatory report thereto, cited in paragraphs 78 and 79 of the judgment, together with the relevant part of paragraphs 77 and 78 of the first report by the Lanzarote Committee cited in paragraph 80 of the judgment).

This obligation is all the more stringent when the victim of the alleged crime is a child (see Article 22 and 24 of the EU Directive cited at paragraph 83 of the judgment). To be sure, Protocol 2, under the duties of social welfare centres, provides that they are obliged to provide victims with help in obtaining legal aid and counselling and psychological support (see paragraph 71 of the judgment; and see in this connection C.A.S. and C.S. v.\u00a0Romania, no. 26692/05, \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 78, 20 March 2012).

We do not in any way call into question the conclusion reached by the prosecution authorities, nor do we believe that the Court should assess in any respect the responsibility of C.

This is so since the obligation to investigate is specifically intended to refute or confirm the responsibility of the alleged perpetrator (compare Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Facire Tun\u00e7 v.

In actual fact, as was emphasised in the judgment itself, where arguable allegations are made under Article 3 of the Convention the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny regardless of how the investigation in the concrete case has ended (see paragraph 108 of the judgment). In our view, in doing so, the Court should in particular take into consideration special standards that should guide domestic authorities in conducting an effective investigation into alleged sexual abuse of a child (see Article\u00a030\u00a0(5) of the Lanzarote Convention).",

However, the alleged victim was neither promptly interviewed nor examined, in order to avoid any risk of undue pressure on the child (see paragraph 90 of the judgment; in this respect see Article\u00a030\u00a0(3) and 35 (1) (a) of the Lanzarote Convention, cited at paragraph\u00a077 of the judgment).

No justification for such delay was provided (see Article\u00a035\u00a0(a) of the Lanzarote Convention, cited in paragraph 78 of the judgment). On that occasion the father, the alleged perpetrator, was on the premises of the Polyclinic and interacted with the applicant contrary to the established international and domestic standards (see paragraph 7 above). Moreover, this interview did not have the nature of a forensic interview. Actually, no forensic interview with the child for the purposes of deciding A\u2019s criminal complaint had ever been conducted, although her complaint was arguable and although at a certain point such an interview had been specifically requested by the applicant\u2019s lawyer (see paragraph 41 of the judgment).",

Romania, no. 36934/08, \u00a7 51, 24 May 2016; and C.A.S.\u00a0and\u00a0C.S., cited above). Finally, although it was indicated in the second report that \u201cin order to determine the forensic issues, in light of the complicated status of the child and the overall circumstances of the \u2018case\u2019, it would be necessary to obtain an expert opinion, which could sufficiently determine the psychiatric and psychological characteristics of both parents and their causal link with the behaviour of the child or possible manipulation of the child ...\u201d (see paragraphs 40 and 96 of the judgment), this was never done during the criminal investigations. We note that the authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, forensic evidence (see C.A.S. and C.S., cited above, \u00a7 70).",

Thereafter the police submitted reports with updates on the investigation on a monthly basis although they were obliged to do so immediately after any enquiries undertaken and not later than 24 hours thereafter (see paragraph 63 of the judgment, see also footnote\u00a04 above). Even after being informed of the case and the activities of the police, the Attorney\u2019s Office remained rather passive in the proceedings. There is no indication that they gave any instructions to the police or undertook any activities by themselves except for ordering two expert reports, one by a defectologist and another one by a Polyclinic in which B was being treated at that time (see paragraph 38 and 39 of the judgment). It appears that neither the police nor the Attorney\u2019s Office have ever seen B or were in any way involved in her interviews by the multidisciplinary team or subsequent experts. There is no indication that police officers and the members of the Attorney\u2019s Office had any special training in conducting cases of sexual abuse of children (as required by Protocol 1, see paragraph 68 of the judgment; see also Article 34 (1) of the Lanzarote Convention, cited in paragraph 78 of the judgment).",

But ultimately, the judgment failed to analyse the complaint raised by the applicant in the light of the standards identified in international documents (see paragraphs 76-83 of the judgment, in particular Chapter VII of the Lanzarote Convention), some of which, as demonstrated above, have already been acknowledged by the Court as prerequisites for the effectiveness of an investigation in cases of sexual abuse of children (see, for example, C.A.S. and C.S. v.

The Government remarked that a legal representative had been appointed without consulting the State beforehand, and circumventing the competent State authorities, namely the Social Welfare Centre and domestic courts, which under domestic law are authorised to appoint a special representative for a child in domestic court proceedings or the Centre for Guardianship, whose employees are specialised for representing interests of children. We agree with the Government that the Court should, with time, establish in its Rules of Court more detailed criteria and a procedure for the appointment of special representatives for children. However, in so doing the Court should avoid situations in which the very same authority implicated as responsible for the alleged violation of the Convention might be called upon to appoint a special guardian for the child. Further, the Court should take into consideration that the interests of the Government and of a child do not necessarily coincide.",

One of the important issues to resolve is the extent to which a special representative could in his or her submissions raise issues which, strictly speaking, are not within the facts covered by an initial complaint, but are related to the protection of the best interests of the child in connection with the facts as presented in an original complaint and further clarified in observations by the Government and applicant(s). In other words, should the \u201csix-month rule\u201d, the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies and the \u201cultra petita rule\u201d be adapted to ensure the protection of the best interests of a child before the Court in such cases? This is of particular importance in cases of alleged sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a child/children, in view of their extreme vulnerability and in many cases their de facto inability, especially if they are of a very young age, to bring such cases, both before domestic courts and before the Court, without adult assistance. The applicant in this case at the time of the alleged event was only four and half years old and at the time the case reached the Court was six years old, and as we have explained above, the Court identified a possible conflict of interest between the applicants, the mother and the child (see paragraphs 1, 3 and 8 of the judgment).",

In our view, this approach of the Lanzarote Convention, that has introduced certain flexibility to domestic criminal proceedings, could be instructive for the Court in devising its own proceedings related to the protection of human rights of children before the Court in a more flexible manner.",

However, the special representative indicated that she was basing this complaint on the report of the multidisciplinary team of the Polyclinic, which was extensively cited and used in the submissions and observations both by A and by the Government.

In our view, the Court should carefully take into consideration those standards, while reviewing the rights of children and obligations of States under the Convention in these types of cases in particular since the Lanzarote Convention, which is the main international instrument in this area, has been signed by all Council of Europe member States and ratified by all but three. The Court\u2019s case-law may need to be further reflected upon so as to ensure that investigation and criminal proceedings are carried out in the best interests of the child and respecting the rights of the child, and that a protective and child-friendly approach towards children who are victims of alleged sexual abuse is adopted, ensuring that the investigations and criminal proceedings do not aggravate the trauma experienced by the child or cause the trauma, and that the criminal justice response is followed by assistance, where appropriate. Of course, the Court should ensure that any such measures are not prejudicial to the rights of the defence and the requirements of a fair and impartial trial guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention.",
