The Committee is therefore of the view that a State party may not implement development measures or provide humanitarian assistance as a substitute for redress for victims of torture or ill-treatment. The failure of a State party to provide the individual victim of torture with redress may not be justified by invoking a State\u2019s level of development. The Committee reminds that change of government as well as successor states still have the obligations to guarantee access to the right of redress.",

In addition, the failure of a State party to execute judgments providing reparative measures for a victim of torture, handed down by either national, international or regional courts, constitute a significant impediment to the right to redress. States parties should develop coordinated mechanisms to enable victims to execute judgments across State lines, including recognizing the validity of court orders from other States parties and assisting in locating the assets of perpetrators.",

Such factors may have the effect of rendering the victim incapable of taking the necessary steps to bring proceedings against the perpetrator without delay.

Moreover, the Government have not adduced other examples of case-law in support of the decision given in this case. The Court also considers that the conclusion to the effect that the miners no longer had an enemy against whom to fight on 14 June 1990 (see paragraph\u00a0161 above) appears doubtful, since it manifestly disregards the violence which occurred on 13 June 1990 in the presence of large numbers of servicemen, equipped with heavy ammunition and tanks, as attested to in the above-cited decision itself. Furthermore, this conclusion is contrary to the facts established by the same decision, which describes in detail the acts of violence perpetrated on 14 June 1990 by the miners, who targeted, without distinction, the demonstrators, students who were present on the university premises and passers-by. In addition, in its judgment of 9 March 2011 dismissing Mr Stoica\u2019s appeal against the decision not to bring a prosecution, the High Court of Cassation and Justice made no assessment whatsoever of the question of the applicability of Article 358 of the Criminal Code, and merely verified how the rules on statutory limitation had been applied in this case.",

Criminal punishment of the offender many years after the commission of the crime, when the personal circumstances of the alleged offender have changed, is counter-productive in terms of preparing the offender to lead a law-abiding life in society. In addition, tardy punishment of the alleged offender is per se incompatible with the pursuit of negative special prevention (that is, incapacitation of the offender), which is intended to avoid future breaches of the law by the sentenced person, by keeping him or her away from the community. Furthermore, it has no deterrent effect on would-be offenders and, a fortiori, no impact on reinforcement of the social strength of the breached norm. The deterrent effect of punishment not only diminishes over time, it comes to nought. Thus, neither positive general prevention (that is, reinforcement of the breached norm), which aims at strengthening social acceptance and compliance with the breached provision, nor negative general prevention (that is, the deterrent effect on would-be offenders) justify punishment without any limit of time.",

Regardless of the degree of State responsibility for the tardiness of a criminal investigation, there must come a day when society\u2019s claims against an offender cease to be legitimate. Otherwise, the alleged offender would become a mere object of the executive\u2019s power, sacrificed on the altar of an illusory absolute justice which reflects nothing but blind retributivism. Any State interference with liberty must be limited by the principles of proportionality and necessity, of which the principle of the least intrusive interference is one of the corollaries.

This is due not only to considerations based on the weighting of the principles of legal certainty and a fair trial and the purposes of criminal punishment against the need for a firm criminal policy of accountability for torture, but also to the uncertain conceptual borders of the crime of torture, especially when contrasted with the concepts of inhuman and degrading treatment. Although it is undisputed that there exists a universal consensus on the criminalisation of torture, it has not yet been established in international law that the prosecution and punishment of this offence must not be subject to statutory limitations. Only Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights (2004) provides for such a principle. Principle 6 of the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law, adopted by General Assembly Resolution\u00a060/147 of 16 December 2005, establishes that \u201cstatutes of limitations shall not apply to gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law which constitute crimes under international law\u201d, which might include torture. The Committee against Torture (CAT) has repeatedly stressed that, under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the crime of torture should not be subject to any limitation period. The same position is taken by the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC). The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism (2010), the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture (2009) and the United Nations Independent Expert to update the Set of principles to combat impunity (2005) share the same view. Among scholars, the imprescriptibility of torture has been sustained, for example, by Principle 7 of the Brussels Principles against impunity and for international justice, adopted by the Brussels Group for International Justice (2002), and Principle 6 of the Princeton Principles on universal jurisdiction (2001).",

With regard to his application, the Chamber had previously considered that, just as it was imperative that the relevant domestic authorities launch an investigation and take measures as soon as allegations of ill-treatment were brought to their attention, it was also incumbent on the persons concerned to display diligence and initiative. Thus, the Chamber attached particular importance to the fact that the applicant had not brought his complaint concerning the violence to which he was subjected on 13 June 1990 to the authorities\u2019 attention until eleven years after those events. Although the Chamber could accept that in situations of mass violations of fundamental rights it was appropriate to take account of victims\u2019 vulnerability, especially a possible inability to lodge complaints for fear of reprisals, it found no convincing argument that would justify the applicant\u2019s passivity and decision to wait eleven years before submitting his complaint to the relevant authorities. Accordingly, the Chamber concluded that there had been no violation of the procedural aspect of Article 3 of the Convention. In contrast, the Grand Chamber considers that the applicant\u2019s vulnerability and his feeling of powerlessness, which he shared with numerous other victims who, like him, waited for many years before lodging a complaint, amount to a plausible and acceptable explanation for his inactivity from 1990 to 2001.",

I do not share the view that when it becomes, ex post facto, probable that the tardiness of a complaint has not led to a deterioration in the quality of the Court\u2019s examination, this would excuse the failure to display diligence in lodging a complaint in due time.",

However, the reason given for not filing complaints on the domestic level for a number of years after 1994, that is, when Romania had already become a Party to the Convention, was a lack of confidence in the effectiveness of the ongoing investigations. That state of affairs should normally have triggered the beginning of the six-month rule on filing a complaint with the Court. An applicant has to become active once it is clear that no effective investigation will be provided, in other words, once it becomes apparent that the respondent State will not fulfil its obligation under the Convention (see Chiragov and Others v. Armenia (dec.) [GC], no. 13216/05, \u00a7 136, 14 December 2011, and Sargsyan v. Azerbaijan (dec.)

The temporal scope of a treaty is a matter of substantive law, while the extent of an international body\u2019s jurisdiction ratione temporis is governed by the rules on jurisdiction. The jurisdiction ratione temporis of an international court does not necessarily coincide with the temporal scope of the treaty which it is required to apply. A legal rule defining the extent of the jurisdiction of an international court may indeed restrict this jurisdiction with regard to events which fell within the temporal scope of the treaty in respect of which it is required to verify compliance.

In fact, the rules of treaty law occupy a special position, in that they are meta-regulatory in nature and guarantee the coherence of international law. Before resorting in this case to the substantive rules applicable in interpreting and applying the Convention, due account should firstly have been given to the various meta-rules governing treaties, particularly those concerning their entry into force, their binding force, their interpretation, their application and the Convention\u2019s temporal and territorial scope.",

Article 28 of the Vienna Convention sets out the principle that treaties do not have retroactive effect in the following terms: \u201cUnless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party\u201d.

The States Parties could in consequence devise actions to ensure protection of human rights, notably by determining priorities and assigning the necessary resources.

It also requires loyalty on the part of those bodies. Attribution of retroactive effect to a treaty by means of the case-law, following several decades of well-established case-law upholding the principle that the treaty is not to be applied retroactively, may undermine the trust that is necessary for the effective functioning of this international instrument.

If the Convention is to remain a living and effective instrument, it seems that the optimal solution for resolving the various problems created by the \u0160ilih case-law consists in returning to a strict application of the law of treaties, the primary condition for judicial certainty and the foreseeability of the law.

The obligation to carry out an investigation is separate from, but instrumental and subsidiary to, the substantive protection. The procedural obligations are an instrument for implementation of the substantive obligations.
