The prosecutor noted that in January 2005 the hostel occupants had lodged previous complaints with his office. After examining the case the prosecutor concluded that the hostel\u2019s privatisation in 1995 had been unlawful. He argued that section 2(2) of the State Housing Stock Privatisation Act (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u00ab\u041f\u0440\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044e \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0442\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0443\u00bb) prohibited the privatisation of rooms in hostels. The transfer of ownership of the hostel and its subsequent sale breached the Act, other legal provisions and the \u201cmoral principles of society\u201d, since the occupants\u2019 constitutional rights to housing had been violated. It also adversely affected the economic interests of the State and the housing rights of G., who was a single mother with a young child and was therefore unable to lodge a claim herself.

The applicants submitted that they had informed the prosecutor\u2019s office of the matter and requested S. to provide housing to the hostel occupants. The prosecutor\u2019s office had failed to protect the rights of the new owners despite the fact that the hostel was in an alarming state, the drainage and water supply systems were not functioning and the rooms were being heated by stoves. Moreover, the premises could no longer be classed as a hostel as it had become a normal multi-family apartment building.

The Government submitted copies of court decisions in two commercial law cases concerning what appeared to be private companies, one of which was awarded damages by the courts pursuant to Article 216 of the Civil Code of Ukraine. Therefore, the national law provided the applicants with an avenue to receive not only reimbursement of their costs, but also compensation for losses incurred as a result of being deprived of their property, including loss of income. The applicants did not submit any evidence that they had claimed such damages through the national courts. In the Government\u2019s view, that proved that the applicants had regarded as sufficient the amount of compensation awarded to them on 8 June 2006. Lastly, the Government noted that the existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which was not obviously futile was not a valid reason for failing to exhaust domestic remedies (see Dzizin v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 1086/02, 24 June 2003). The Government thus contended that the applicants had not exhausted the effective remedies available to them at national level.",
