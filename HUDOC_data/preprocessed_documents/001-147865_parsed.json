The principle of proportionality further dictates that where the purpose of detention is to secure the fulfilment of an obligation provided for by law, a balance must be struck between the importance in a democratic society of securing the immediate fulfilment of the obligation in question, and the importance of the right to liberty (see Vasileva v. Denmark, no.\u00a052792/99, \u00a7 37, 25\u00a0September 2003). The duration of the detention is a relevant factor in striking such a balance (ibid.)",
