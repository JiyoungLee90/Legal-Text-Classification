It had solely and intrinsically served private interests, specifically those of the third parties who had been leasing the property merely for commercial purposes, irrespective of the fact that the snack bar had been regularly used by bus drivers. Furthermore, the applicants had received no compensation in forty-five years, and the offer made to them in 2010 (solely after constitutional redress proceedings had been commenced) had been based on a valuation from 2005. In the court\u2019s view, based on the rent as submitted by the Commissioner, \u201ccapitalised\u201d at the rate of 3.5% applicable in such cases, the value of the property was approximately EUR\u00a060,000, that is to say five times the sum offered by the Commissioner. The situation was made even worse by the lack of procedural safeguards (as mentioned above) through which they could challenge their situation, which also meant that they had not had any access\u00a0to court in order to claim compensation, as required by Article\u00a06 of the\u00a0Convention.",

It was true that use of that plot of land had changed in 1972, as it had been decided to build a snack bar (and later to lease it) to see to the needs of the users of the square, as well as the civic centre, government offices, and a bus terminus. Thus, in the Constitutional Court\u2019s view the fact that it had been rented out to third parties had not diminished the public interest in the taking. Nevertheless, there had been a violation of the applicants\u2019 property rights in so far as they had been deprived of their property for a number of years without any compensation. In particular they had received no compensation whatsoever for the part of the property taken and not used, which had been returned to them only after twenty-three years, and in respect of the remaining part which was used, the applicants were still awaiting compensation. The Constitutional Court however disagreed with the redress given by the first-instance court, in so far as that court had also awarded pecuniary damage. It considered that that court should have awarded compensation without prejudice to the pecuniary damage due in accordance with the relevant law (Article\u00a012 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Ordinance, specifically interest of 5% on the value of the property). Thus, without prejudice to any such claim for pecuniary compensation in respect of the property taken and the relative interest, the Constitutional Court awarded EUR\u00a010,000 in nonpecuniary damages for the violation suffered, bearing in mind that the value of the property was EUR\u00a013,000, and it annulled the return order for the property.",

While the Government noted that persons had to prove their title before a notice to treat or judicial letter could be issued (see paragraph 40 below), the Court notes that not only were the applicants sent the relevant letter in 2015, but a part of the property expropriated had also been returned to their predecessors in title in 1988 (see paragraph\u00a09 above). In the Court\u2019s view, these facts indicate that the applicants have been at least tacitly acknowledged as having title to the land by both the authorities and the domestic courts. Moreover, it has not been contested that the applicants were the rightful heirs of their ancestors, as also evidenced by documents submitted to the Court which have not been contested by the Government.

The Government noted that no consideration had to be given to the time prior to 1967 before the Convention had become applicable to Malta; and that since a new declaration had been issued in\u00a02010 the value of the property had to be taken to be that in 2005 in accordance with the law (see paragraph 24 above).

In this connection, the Court has already found that the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference and a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol \u00a0No.\u00a01 only in exceptional circumstances (see Frendo Randon and Others v.\u00a0Malta, cited above, \u00a7 54). The Court reiterates, however, that the adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value, such as unreasonable delay. Abnormally lengthy delays in the payment of compensation for expropriation lead to increased financial loss for the person whose land has been expropriated, putting him in a position of uncertainty (see Akku\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, 9 July 1997, \u00a7 29, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV). The same applies to abnormally lengthy delays in administrative or judicial proceedings in which such compensation is determined, especially when people whose land has been expropriated are obliged to resort to such proceedings in order to obtain the compensation to which they are entitled (see Aka v. Turkey, 23\u00a0September 1998, \u00a7 49, Reports 1998  VI).",

In particular it took fortyfive years for the Commissioner to make such an offer, time during which the applicants had no possibility of initiating proceedings, as a result of which they remained without compensation. In the Court\u2019s view, the Government have not provided any convincing justification for the failure of the authorities to pay such compensation to the applicants over time. In so far as the Government relied on Article 1078 of the Civil Code (see paragraph\u00a040 above), the Court notes that according to the Land Acquisition (Public Purposes) Ordinance, at the relevant time, it was up to the authorities to initiate the relevant compensation proceedings (see Frendo\u00a0Randon and Others, cited above, \u00a7 65).

The Court further reiterates that while deprivation of property effected for no reason other than to confer a private benefit on a private party cannot be \u201cin the public interest\u201d, the compulsory transfer of property from one individual to another may, depending on the circumstances, constitute a legitimate means of promoting the public interest (see James and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a098). Moreover, the taking of property effected in pursuance of legitimate social, economic or other policies may be in \u201cin the public interest\u201d, even if the community at large has no direct use or enjoyment of the property taken (ibid., \u00a7\u00a045).",

In the circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that, given the use made of the property after 1972, a reduction in the amount of compensation is not warranted and that the applicants are entitled to compensation representing the value of the land at the time of the taking, converted to the current value to offset the effects of inflation, plus simple statutory interest applied to the capital progressively adjusted (see Frendo Randon and Others v. Malta (just satisfaction), no.\u00a02226/10, \u00a7 20, 9 July 2013 and Schembri and Others v.\u00a0Malta (just satisfaction), no. 42583/06, \u00a7 18, 28 September 2010) and further adjusted to the title held by them (see, by implication, Azzopardi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a020 and\u00a069, where the Court\u2019s calculation was based on the LAB\u2019s evaluation of the utile dominium of the land). In this connection the Court reiterates that the applicants are not the owners of the land but are the holders of the utile dominium of the land by way of sub-emphyteusis which expires in 2047. The Court further notes that on the one hand the applicants have not submitted any valuation as to the sale value of the land, relying solely on rental values; on the other hand the Government reiterated that the value of the utile dominium of the land in 2005 had been EUR\u00a013,000, on which the applicants were also due interest at 5% in accordance with domestic law, and also submitted the levels of rent applicable according to their expert. The Court considers that rental values provide an indication of the value of the land. However, it also notes that the property was rebuilt by the Government around thirty years ago. Thus the rental values of subsequent years have definitely benefitted from the amelioration of the said property. Furthermore, in assessing the amount due to the applicants the Court has, as far as appropriate, considered information available to it on land values on the Maltese property market today (see, for example, Vassallo v.\u00a0Malta (just satisfaction), no. 57862/09, \u00a7 21, 6 November 2012).",
