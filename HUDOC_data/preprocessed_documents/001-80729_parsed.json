Following the Supreme Court's decision of 30\u00a0October 1996, the proceedings resumed before the trial court nearly eleven months later of which five months fall within the period under consideration. It further observes a total delay of over a year resulting from the trial court's requests for two expert reports (see paragraph 18). In this respect, the Court notes that the principal responsibility for a delay caused by the expert examinations falls ultimately on the State (see Capuano v.\u00a0Italy, judgment of 25\u00a0June 1987, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0119, \u00a7\u00a032). In addition, the expert was working in the context of judicial proceedings, supervised by a judge, who remained responsible for the preparation and the speedy conduct of the trial (see Scopelliti v. Italy, judgment of 23 November 1993, Series A no. 278, \u00a7\u00a023). A further four months lapsed between the hearings scheduled in December 1998 and March 1999 (see paragraphs 20 and 21). In addition to that, it observes that it took nearly ten months for the trial court to fix a hearing after the case had been referred back for re-examination by the Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 23 and 25).",
