Moldova (nos. 32844/07 and 41378/07, \u00a7 20, 14 February 2012), it found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in respect of the poor conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention in Prison no. 13 between March 2007 and April 2008. The Court further notes that the Government adduced no evidence in support of their submission to the effect that considerable improvements in Prison No. 13 had taken place in recent years. Against this background, the Court notes that the poor conditions of detention in the same detention facility were acknowledged in the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of the United Nations and by the Moldovan Ombudsman (see paragraphs 9-11 above). In such circumstances, the Court considers that there are no reasons to depart from the conclusions reached in Hadji. The Court thus considers that the hardship endured by the applicant during his detention between April 2008 and September 2010 went beyond the unavoidable level of hardship inherent in detention, and reached a threshold of severity contrary to Article\u00a03 of the Convention. Accordingly, there has been a violation of that provision.",
