Serco would apply the same approach to a member of a similar political party, which confined its membership to black people. The dividing line of colour or race was not made by Serco, but by the BNP which defines its own composition by colour or race. Mr Redfearn cannot credibly make a claim of direct race discrimination by Serco against him on the ground that he is white by relying on the decision of his own chosen political party to limit its membership to white people. The BNP cannot make a non-racial criterion (party membership) a racial one by the terms of its constitution limiting membership to white people.

They submitted that in assessing the extent, if any, of the State\u2019s positive obligation, the Court should consider whether the nature of the interference struck at the \u201cvery substance\u201d of the right or freedom concerned (Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 44, S\u00f8rensen and Rasmussen v.  [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2006I). However, it did not necessarily follow from the fact that someone was dismissed from their employment as a consequence of manifesting certain political views that there would be an interference with their rights under Article 11 which struck at the very substance of the right so as to engage the State\u2019s positive obligation. In this regard the Government relied, by analogy, on Stedman v the , application no. 29107/95, decision of 9 April 1997, in which the Commission rejected as inadmissible a complaint under Article 9 of the Convention by a Christian applicant who had been dismissed because she refused to work on Sundays. The Commission noted that there had been no pressure on the applicant to change her religious views or to prevent her from manifesting her religion or beliefs. It followed that the Government could not be expected \u201cto have legislation that would protect employees against such dismissals by private employers\u201d.",

If an employer was able to identify one of these two criteria, a fact-sensitive balancing exercise would have to be carried out.

The question whether a dismissal would breach Article 11 turned on a number of factors, including the role of the employee, the degree of contact he or she had with the public and whether or not it involved public trust and confidence, whether the employee had direct contact with or provided services to individuals against which the relevant group or party had expressed hostility, the extent of his involvement with the party or group, the effect his continued employment would have on the employer\u2019s reputation, and the employee\u2019s conduct during the period of employment.",

Nevertheless, once he was elected as a local councillor for the BNP and complaints were received from unions and employees, he was summarily dismissed without any apparent consideration being given to the possibility of transferring him to a non-customer facing role. In this regard, the Court considers that the case can readily be distinguished from that of Stedman v. the United Kingdom (cited\u00a0above), in which the applicant was dismissed because she refused to work the hours required by the post. In particular, the Court is struck by the fact that these complaints, as summarised in paragraph 10, were in respect of prospective problems and not in respect of anything that the applicant had done or had failed to do in the actual exercise of his employment.",

It is also to be borne in mind that what the Court is called upon to do in this case is not to pass judgment on the policies or aims, obnoxious or otherwise, of the BNP at the relevant time (the BNP is, in any case, not a party to these proceedings), but solely to determine whether the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 11 were breached in the particular circumstances of the instant case. In this connection it is also worth bearing in mind that, like the Front National-Nationaal Front in F\u00e9ret v. Belgium (no. 15615/07, 16 July 2009) the BNP was not an illegal party under domestic law nor were its activities illegal (see, by way of contrast, Hizb Ut-Tahrir and Others v.

Thus, the purpose of the one-year qualifying period was to benefit the domestic economy by increasing labour demand. The Court has received no submissions on the length of the qualifying period but it accepts that one year would normally be a sufficient period for an employer to assess the suitability of an employee before he or she became well-established in a post.

The Court has accepted that Contracting States cannot guarantee the effective enjoyment of Article 11 rights absolutely. In assessing whether such positive obligations arise and, if so, to what extent, the Court must determine whether a fair balance was struck within the legal system between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole. In a case where sensitive social, economic and political issues are involved, in achieving a proper balance between those interest and, in particular, in assessing the appropriateness of State intervention, the Contracting States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in the choice of means to be employed.",

Like the House of Lords in the case of R v. Secretary of State for Employment, ex parte Seymour-Smith and another, we consider that it was and is in principle reasonable and appropriate for the State to lay down a qualifying period and that the period set in the United Kingdom cannot be said to fall outside any acceptable margin of appreciation (see, in the context of a complaint under Article 6 of the Convention, Stedman v. the United Kingdom, application no. 29107/95, decision of 9 April 1997, in which a restriction on access to an industrial tribunal for unfair dismissal to employees of two years\u2019 standing was held to pursue a legitimate aim and not to be arbitrary or to impair the very essence of the right of access to a court). The justification for a qualifying period is not in our view affected by the fact that in an individual case there may be no justifiable grounds for the dismissal or that the dismissal may lead to particular financial or other hardship on the part of the employee concerned. It is the balance struck by the legal system as a whole and not the effect of dismissal in any individual case to which regard must be had.",

In this regard reliance is placed by the majority on the fact that in the United Kingdom the qualifying period is not absolute, certain exceptions having been created in the case, inter alia, of claims by an employee that he has been dismissed on grounds of race, sex or religion but that no exception has been made in the case of a claim of dismissal on grounds of political opinion. It is argued that it is incumbent on the United Kingdom to protect employees, including those with less than one year\u2019s service, from dismissal on grounds of political opinion, either through the creation of a further exception to the one-year qualifying period or through the creation of a free-standing claim for unlawful discrimination on grounds of political opinion.",

This, in our view, is to press the positive obligation too far. In a complex area of social and economic policy, it is in our view preeminently for Parliament to decide what areas require special protection in the field of employment and the consequent scope of any exception created to the general rule. The choice of Parliament of race, sex and religion as grounds requiring special protection can in no sense be seen as random or arbitrary. In this respect we attach importance to the fact that certain grounds of difference of treatment have traditionally been treated by the Court itself as \u201csuspect\u201d and as requiring very weighty reasons by way of justification. These grounds include differences of treatment on grounds of race (D.H. and others v the Czech Republic [GC] no. 57325/10, ECHR\u00a02007), sex (Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, Series A No. 94), religion (Hoffmann v Austria, 23\u00a0June 1993, Series A no. 94) and nationality and ethnicity (Timishev\u00a0v\u00a0Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, ECHR 2005-XII). In addition, the Court has indicated that differences of treatment which are based on immutable characteristics will as a general rule require weightier reasons in justification than differences of treatment based on a characteristic or status which contains an element of choice (Bah v the United Kingdom, no.\u00a056328/07, 27 September 2011).",
