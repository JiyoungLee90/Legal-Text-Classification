However, their decisions comply with the requirements of Article 8 only if they are justified by a pressing social need and, in particular, proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Accordingly, there must be a fair balance between the relevant interests, namely the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private and family life, on the one hand, and the prevention of disorder and crime, on the other.",

The main obstacle to expulsion in such cases is the length of the applicant\u2019s stay in, combined with his family ties to, that country. In a considerable proportion of the cases the Court has not found a violation of Article 8 even where the applicant has lived all or most of his life in the country and has fairly close family ties there: see Boughanemi v. France, judgment of 24 April 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II; C. v. Belgium, judgment of 7 August 1996, Reports 1996-III; Bouchelkia v.

We attach particular importance to the facts that the offence was committed in April 1994 and that, according to the information available, the applicant has not committed further offences since then and now seems to be rehabilitated. Even if we are not fully convinced that it would be impossible for his spouse to live in , we accept that it would cause her obvious and considerable difficulties.
