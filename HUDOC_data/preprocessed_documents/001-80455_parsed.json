With regard to the sales contract of 1993, the courts stated that Mr B.I. had not been entitled to sell the left part of the house, irrespective of whether he had acted in his capacity as the head of the Society or as a private person.

This reassignment was ordered by the Supreme Court after having expressly disagreed with the findings of the lower courts as to the facts and having stated its position concerning one of the principle aspects of the case, namely the Society's competence to grant property, even before the new assessment of facts and taking of evidence by the lower courts took place (see paragraph 31 above). Considering in addition the Supreme Court's failure to provide reasons for the reassignment, the Court is of the opinion that the applicant's fears that the judges of the Supreme Court, including its Deputy President, had a prefixed idea concerning the outcome of the case and that the judges to whom the case had been transferred on 9\u00a0October 2000 would have to consider the case in accordance with the Supreme Court's view could be held to be objectively justified.",

The Court further recalls that, although the right to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses is guaranteed by Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(d) of the Convention to those who are charged with a criminal offence, Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed in civil cases, leaving these matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see, among other authorities, Garcia Ruiz v.
