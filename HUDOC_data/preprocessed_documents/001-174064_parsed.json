She argued that the owner of \u015eenocak Ltd. \u015eti. had made it clear in his police statement that the truck had been loaded with his company\u2019s goods, which had consisted of chafing fuel. Moreover, in response to the compensation request she had made to the Sultanbeyli Civil Court of First Instance (see below paragraph 30 for further details), the owner of \u015eenocak Ltd. \u015eti. had stated, inter alia, that he had also suffered a loss as a result of the accident as he had lost all of his merchandise. A\u00a0representative of Salihli Ltd. \u015eti. had similarly told the Sultanbeyli Civil Court of First Instance that the truck involved in the accident had been sent to \u015eenocak Ltd. \u015eti. for loading, accompanied by a delivery note prepared by them on 4 August 2006. In the applicant\u2019s opinion, those statements provided sufficient proof that the inflammable goods loaded in the truck had belonged to \u015eenocak Ltd. \u015eti. On the basis of that information, and having regard to the legal requirements in the relevant legislation on the packaging, labelling, storing and transportation of inflammable goods, none of which had been observed in the instant case, it was clear that both \u015eenocak Ltd. \u015eti. and Salihli \u015eti., as well as the owner and driver of the truck, had been responsible for the accident.",

The examination in the instant case therefore had to focus not on the technical cause of the accident per se, which was what the second report had done, but on the reasons and the responsibility for the fire that had claimed her husband\u2019s life. The experts stated in that connection that the fire had been caused by chafing fuel, which was a \u201chighly inflammable liquid\u201d, according to the Regulation on the Transport by Land of Dangerous Goods and which therefore had to be transported in accordance with the relevant legislation concerning the transportation of such dangerous substances. The truck in which the chafing fuel had been loaded in the instant case had, however, not been suitable for the transportation of dangerous goods: it had not been equipped with an electrical system to prevent short circuits and fire; it had had no warning signs; and the driver had not been trained in the transportation of such goods. \u015eenocak Ltd. \u015eti., as the producer of the chafing fuel, bore the principal liability (40%) for the fire on account of its failure to ensure the safe transportation of its merchandise in accordance with the relevant legal requirements. Salihli\u00a0Ltd. \u015eti., which had procured the truck in question, and A.S., the owner and operator of the truck, were each 20% liable for agreeing to transport such dangerous goods in a vehicle unfit for the job. A.S. was further liable because he had accepted additional cargo in the truck. The remaining responsibility lay with the deceased driver, who had not kept a safe distance from the vehicle in front.

There are, nevertheless, circumstances where a civil remedy alone may not suffice to satisfy the requirements of an effective judicial response under Article 2 of the Convention. The Court has so far adopted this approach in the context of dangerous industrial activities, such as the operation of wastecollection sites (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7 71), in the public health sphere (see Mehmet \u015eent\u00fcrk and Bekir \u015eent\u00fcrk v.

The Court observes that the circumstances of the present case differ from the aforementioned examples, notably because the activity in question, although undoubtedly dangerous, were not carried out by or under the responsibility of public authorities. The Court nevertheless considers that an effective criminal investigation was necessary to satisfy the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention on the present facts for the following reasons.",

It appears from the applicant\u2019s unrefuted allegations, which also found support in the expert opinions obtained during the civil proceedings (see paragraphs 32 and 37 above), that the truck in question had not been equipped with an electrical system to prevent short circuits and fire, that it had borne no warning signs, and that the driver had not been trained in the transportation of dangerous goods, contrary to the clear requirements of the law in these respects. The Court further notes that no licence had been obtained for the transportation of such goods and the shipment was incorrectly described as \u201craw material\u201d in the invoice and delivery note, in a possible attempt to evade inspection by public authorities. All these elements taken together suggest that while it was certainly not caused intentionally, the death in the instant case resulted from the responsible parties\u2019 voluntary and reckless disregard of their legal duties under the relevant legislation, as opposed to a simple omission or human error, which in the Court\u2019s opinion sets this case apart from other cases of non-intentional deaths where it has found civil remedies to be sufficient. The Court stresses that by their apparently reckless conduct, the persons responsible for the shipment caused the kind of serious harm that the legislation in question was intended to prevent in the first place. Such action, in the Court\u2019s opinion, requires a criminal-law reaction to ensure effective deterrence against similar threats to the right to life in the future.",

The Court considers that this criminal law provision had been introduced in order to ensure, inter alia, the effective enforcement of the regulatory framework on the transportation of dangerous goods, having regard to the serious public safety risks posed by such activity. In these circumstances, a criminal investigation into the accident was necessary in the instant case, if for no other reason than to determine whether the death had been caused on account of the unlawful transportation of one of the dangerous substances referred to in section\u00a0174\u00a0\u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.",

It notes, first and foremost, that the public prosecutor appears to have treated the incident as an ordinary traffic accident caused by negligent driving. Although it was evident from the autopsy report that the applicant\u2019s husband had died as a result of burns, and also evident from the sceneofincident report that the truck had been loaded with some type of fuel, the investigation was from the beginning geared towards establishing the immediate cause of the accident, that is the responsibility of the truck driver for the collision from a technical point of view, without paying attention to the cause of the fire that claimed the applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s life. In that connection, even after the scope of the investigation had been expanded following the decision of the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Assize Court (see paragraph 19 above), and despite the applicant\u2019s persistent requests, the public prosecutor paid no particular attention to the dangerous nature of the truck\u2019s cargo, nor did he discuss in any way the extensive legal requirements that the transportation of such material triggered under domestic law for different parties involved in the transportation. According to the information in the case file, the public prosecutor did not take any steps to determine the composition and the chemical properties of the truck\u2019s cargo, despite the important legal implications of that information particularly under Article 174 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code, nor did he seek to identify the individuals or companies who had been involved in the transportation of such material and who could thus have had liability for the fatal accident under the relevant law. The Court notes that the Sultanbeyli public prosecutor\u2019s significant omissions in taking these basic investigatory steps were disregarded by the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Assize Court as well, despite the applicant\u2019s objections.",

The Court reiterates that the obligation under Article 2 that an official investigation into a death cover all crucial elements that may shed light on the circumstances of the death equally applies in respect of expert reports, particularly where such reports form the main basis of the investigating authorities\u2019 decisions as in the present case (see, mutatis mutandis, Aydo\u011fdu v. Turkey, no. 40448/06, \u00a7\u00a096, 30\u00a0August 2016). The Court notes that the Forensic Medicine Institute report at issue did not only fall short of shedding light on the circumstances of the death, but appears not to have taken into account the evidence that was readily available in the case file. The Court observes in this connection that, in complete disregard of the evidence in the case file pointing to the contrary, including the sceneofincident report, the delivery note and the statements by representatives of the suspect companies themselves (see paragraphs 8, 13 and 26 above), the Forensic Medicine Institute\u2019s experts were somehow unable to identify \u015eenocak Ltd. \u015eti. as the producer or distributor of the dangerous goods in question. Moreover, they declared that Salihli Ltd. \u015eti. had not been at fault for the accident, without giving any reasons whatsoever for such a finding. The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s objections to the experts\u2019 unjustified findings were not taken into consideration by the public prosecutor, who accepted what was a clearly defective report without any reservations. The Court stresses that even if the public prosecutor had not been able to find any evidence regarding the specific involvement of \u015eenocak Ltd. \u015eti. and Salihli Ltd. \u015eti. in the shipment in question, as suggested by the expert report, he was still under an obligation to pursue the investigation, if necessary by commissioning another expert report, to establish the identities of the producer, the distributor and the transporter of the dangerous goods, whoever they were.",

Although the applicant had from the very beginning brought complaints against the producer of the chafing fuel, the transport company and the truck owner A.S., the public prosecutor initially confined the investigation solely to the liability of the driver for the accident in disregard of the applicant\u2019s complaints. The applicant was, moreover, not notified of the expert opinion submitted to the file, or of the decision against prosecution delivered by the public prosecutor. Even after she had found out about those developments through her own efforts, her objections against the public prosecutor\u2019s decision were not taken into consideration by the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Assize Court. The Court notes from the information in the case file that the applicant was not recognised as a \u201ccomplainant\u201d by the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Assize Court, which expanded the investigation only in line with the complaints of A.S., although A.S. had not even objected to the public prosecutor\u2019s decision (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above). As a result, the applicant\u2019s complaints against A.S. were never pursued. Moreover, the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Assize Court\u2019s decision was not notified to the applicant, although she alone had carried the matter before the assize court with her objection (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above), and she was once again left to her own means to find out about the developments in the case.",

It must be emphasised that although there is no right under Article 2 to have third parties prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence, the criminal investigation conducted by the domestic judicial authorities must nevertheless have been capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible, to the extent that this was justified by the findings of the investigation.",

The Court has, however, already established that the appropriate judicial response in the instant case was a criminal-law remedy (see paragraphs 62-65 above). For that reason, contrary to the Government\u2019s allegations, civil remedies aimed at awarding damages alone would not be sufficient for the fulfilment of the respondent State\u2019s obligations under Article 2 in the present circumstances.

While it is true that the authorities should endeavour to make sure that the legislation on storing and transporting dangerous substances is implemented in practice, this does not mean that their obligation to initiate a criminal investigation is automatically triggered in every case where life is lost or is put in danger by accidents related to dangerous substances. Importantly, there is no evidence of any shortcomings in the supervision on the part of public authorities, in the sense that they were aware of or in control of the situation when the accident took place, or that they should have been aware of the violation of the applicable rules by the transport company.
