On 23 October 1996 the  decided not to launch proceedings for constitutional review (\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430) of section 19-a of the Restructuring Act. It held that that provision had been based on Article 32 \u00a7 5 of the Constitution and that it had been adopted in a specific context concerning the Bank\u2019s restructuring. It concluded that the specific terms and criteria for dismissal of the Bank\u2019s employees as redundant could not be regarded as discriminatory compared to employees of other employers.",

The excessive workload of the Supreme Court that the Government referred to in their observations, cannot justify the length of the proceedings for the reasons detailed in the Lickov and Mihajloski cases (see Lickov v. the , no.\u00a038202/02, \u00a7\u00a031, 28\u00a0September 2006, and Mihajloski, cited above, \u00a7 40), which likewise apply to this case. This is so, in particular, since that court already has established jurisprudence on the matter (see paragraph 18 above). Finally, the Court notes that the domestic law (see section 408 of the Civil Proceedings Act above) and the Court\u2019s jurisprudence (see Ziberi v. the , no.\u00a027866/02, \u00a7\u00a047, 5\u00a0July 2007) required employment-related disputes to be conducted with special diligence.",
