The chanting of slogans by the applicants also disturbed the officials\u2019 work.

The notification was to mention the purposes, type, location or itinerary of the assembly, the time of its beginning and end, the expected number of participants, and the names and addresses of the organisers (section 2). The authority was to give its response no later than five days before the assembly. It could, if necessary, suggest another venue or time for the assembly (section 3). An assembly could be banned if its purpose was contrary to the Constitution or threatened public order or the security of citizens (section 6). An assembly was to be stopped at the request of the authorities in the following cases: (1) if no prior notification of the assembly had been given; (2) if a decision banning the assembly had been issued; (3) if the established procedure for the conduct of public assemblies had been breached; (4) if there was a danger to citizens\u2019 life or health; or (5) if the public order was breached (section\u00a07).",

The courts granted their claims, acknowledging the delays and awarded them compensation covering inflation losses sustained as a result of the belated enforcement.

Second, the demonstration had presented a danger to security because there was a high risk of terrorist activity in the region at the time. They listed eight terrorist acts that had been committed in the Severnaya Osetiya-Alaniya Republic between 1999 and 2003, five of which had been in Vladikavkaz. Lastly, the organisers of the demonstration had not indicated in the notification the end date of the demonstration as required by Russian law. The Government emphasized that the area in front of the Tkhapsayev theatre had been proposed as an alternative venue for the demonstration but the applicants had rejected that proposal. The restrictions imposed on the demonstration had been therefore justified.",

The reference to the threat of a terrorist act had therefore been a pretext for banishing the demonstration from the town centre to the outskirts. The applicants further submitted that their demonstration had not impeded public access to public transport or the nearby cinema. Nor had it disrupted the work of the regional government offices, because the protesters had not chanted any slogans or made any other noise. Their act of protest had consisted of displaying placards criticising the authorities for their unlawful actions.",

The term \u201crestrictions\u201d in Article 11 \u00a7 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin v.\u00a0France, 26 April 1991, \u00a7 39, Series A no. 202). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in an assembly and thus amount to an interference, even if the assembly subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see B\u0105czkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, \u00a7\u00a7 66-68, 3 May 2007). An order to change the time or the place of the assembly may constitute an interference as well (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Ivanov v.

The same applies to measures taken by the authorities during an assembly, such as dispersal of the assembly or the arrest of participants (see, for example, Oya Ataman v.

The protection of the expression of personal opinions, secured by Article 10, is one of the objectives of the freedom of peaceful assembly enshrined in Article 11 (see Ezelin, cited above, \u00a7 37). In view of the essential nature of freedom of assembly and its close relationship with democracy there must be convincing and compelling reasons to justify an interference with this right (see Ouranio Toxo and Others v.

Unlike in national jurisdictions, the emphasis of the Court\u2019s activity is on passing public judgments that set human-rights standards across Europe. For this reason, in cases involving many similarly situated victims a unified approach may be called for. This approach will ensure that the applicants remain aggregated and that no disparity in the level of the awards will have a divisive effect on them (see Ryabov and 151 other \u201cPrivileged pensioners\u201d cases v. Russia, nos. 4563/07 et al., 17 December 2009).
