Commune de Lesparre-M\u00e9doc and Pr\u00e9fet de la Gironde (C-650/13, EU:C:2015:648) the compatibility with Article 39 (2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of the exclusion, by operation of French law, from those entitled to vote in elections to the European Parliament persons who were convicted of a serious crime. In Delvigne, the Court of Justice held that the French limitation of prisoners\u2019 voting rights did not call into question the essence of those rights since it had the effect of excluding certain persons, under specific conditions and on account of their conduct, from those entitled to vote in elections to the Parliament, as long as those conditions are fulfilled. In addition, it considered the French limitation was proportionate in so far as it takes into account the nature and the gravity of the criminal offence committed and the duration of the penalty (see Delvigne, cited above, paragraphs 48-49).",

Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 of the Convention did not imply any other conditions relating to electoral rights, apart from the State having to guarantee the free expression of the people and not to impose arbitrary restrictions on voting. In this connection, this Convention provision did not suggest that States had to guarantee to absolutely all of their citizens the right to vote, as long as their electoral systems provided conditions for the holding of free elections in which people could freely express their will when electing the legislature. The Convention member States were therefore entitled to provide criminal conviction as a ground for disenfranchisement.",

In Bulgaria disenfranchisement applied only in respect of individuals effectively serving sentences of imprisonment on the basis of a final judgment. This restriction did not apply in cases of suspended prison sentences, or in respect of detained suspects or those accused. The number of prisoners who could not exercise their right to vote was relatively low when compared with the general population, respectively 8,614 in January 2009 and 6,996 in July 2015; as such, it did not represent a threat to the democratic foundations of the State.

This prohibition was unambiguous and categorical, stemmed directly from the Constitution (see paragraph 10 above) and was reproduced in several ordinary laws applicable at different points in time during the period in question (see paragraphs\u00a01215 above). The situation in the present case is therefore comparable to that examined in the case of Anchugov and Gladkov, cited above, \u00a7 101, second sentence, and \u00a7 105, last sentence, where the Constitution imposed a blanket ban on voting on all convicted prisoners serving prison sentences and which the Court found to be in breach of the Convention requirements. The Court reiterates in this connection that removal of the right to vote without any ad hoc judicial decision does not, in itself, give rise to a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see Scoppola (no. 3) [GC], cited above, \u00a7 104). With a view to securing the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Contracting States may decide either to leave it to the courts to determine the proportionality of a measure restricting convicted prisoners\u2019 voting rights, or to incorporate provisions into their laws defining the circumstances in which such a measure should be applied. In this latter case, it will be for the legislature itself to balance the competing interests in order to avoid any general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction (ibid., \u00a7 102; and also Anchugov and Gladkov, cited above, \u00a7 107). The Court finds that in the present case, unlike the situation examined in Scoppola (no. 3), cited above, where the law provided for a prohibition on voting only in respect of individuals sentenced to a prison term of three years or more, the constitutional and legislative provisions at issue do not adjust the voting ban to the circumstances of the particular case, the gravity of the offence or the conduct of the offender.",

A general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction of the right protected under Article 3 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1 must be seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of appreciation, however wide that margin may be in this field (see Hirst (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7 82).",

Thirdly, the applicants could obtain a reduction of their sentence by working in prison, given that under the applicable legislation two days worked equalled three days served (see paragraph 18 above). The termination of the effective sentences in case of early release and reduction of sentence, albeit conditional, would have the legal effect of permitting the individuals in question to exercise their right to vote, as they would not then be serving sentences of imprisonment.
