The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until July 2010, the \u201cMRT\u201d was only able to continue to exist, and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region, because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Ivan\u0163oc and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116-20; Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 121-22; and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110).

Therefore, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision, there must be a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention, but the remedy must in any event be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the State (Mozer, cited above, \u00a7 207; Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7 268; and De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, \u00a7\u00a0179, ECHR 2017 (extracts)). However, Article 13 of the Convention requires that a remedy be available in domestic law only in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (Mozer, cited above, \u00a7 207; and De Tommaso, cited above, \u00a7 180).",
