It found that the applicant was not facing any real risk of illtreatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention upon his return to Greece. The authority referred to a number of country reports, in particular those of the UNHCR of April 2008 and of the Swedish Migration Board. It acknowledged the ongoing criticism with regard to proceedings and treatment of asylum-seekers in Greece, but did not consider the applicant\u2019s story of his experiences in Greece credible. The Asylum Office noted the UNHCR\u2019s concern about the difficulties with which many asylum-seekers in Greece were confronted. This applied particularly to the facilities for asylum-seekers, access to asylum proceedings and the quality of the proceedings. On the other hand, the Asylum Office noted that Norway was the only country to have declared that it would no longer transfer asylum-seekers to Greece under the Dublin Regulation. The Asylum Office also mentioned a recent decision by the Aliens Litigation Council, according to which there was no reason to suspend further transfers to Greece. The Asylum Office quoted the UNHCR position paper, which welcomed Greece\u2019s reform attempts aimed at strengthening its asylum system. It further noted that a working group had been established, including members of the Greek authorities and the UNHCR, to tackle the \u201cmost burning\u201d problems with the asylum system. Furthermore, the Asylum Office held that the relevant European directives were binding for Greece. Lastly, the Asylum Office referred to a fact-finding mission conducted by the Swedish Migration Board in April 2008 reacting to the harsh criticism voiced by various NGOs. The final report of that mission had concluded that there were no humanitarian or other reasons to refrain from returning asylum-seekers to Greece under the Dublin Regulation. In view of the fact that the asylum authorities of the other EU countries had not stopped transferring asylum-seekers back to Greece, the Asylum Office concluded that it was not necessary to make use of the sovereignty clause in the present case. It further noted that people who had never before lodged an asylum application in Greece and had been transferred to Greece under the Dublin Regulation had full access to asylum proceedings.",

It found that an accumulation of proceedings under the sovereignty clause would endanger the \u201ceffet utile\u201d principle of Community law. Furthermore, the Dublin Regulation was based on the assumption that all member States were safe countries and that a deportation to one of them could not constitute a human-rights violation. Therefore, arguments against such a deportation would need to be especially substantiated. Referring to the report of a mission of the Swedish Migration Board to Greece in April 2008 that showed that all twenty-six monitored cases had had access to Greek asylum proceedings, it found that there were no deficiencies in the conditions of access to asylum proceedings in Greece. With regard to the present case, the Greek authorities had already stated that the applicant would have access to asylum proceedings once he returned to Greece. Again referring to the mission report of the Swedish Migration Board, it found that the support of asylum-seekers in Greece was acceptable. Asylum-seekers were allowed to work in Greece. Lastly, there would be no risk of refoulement. In conclusion, the applicant would not be at real risk of treatment contrary to Article\u00a03 on being returned to Greece.",

The report described the increasing challenges faced by the Greek asylum system because of the increasing number of cases it had had to deal with in recent years. It referred to problems with the provision of housing for asylum-seekers, and stated that more often than not they had to arrange housing for themselves. The report concluded by stating that the risk of refoulement was minimal. However, a particular problem had arisen in relation to unaccompanied minors: there was a risk that such asylum-seekers would be placed in a reception unit in Amygdaleza, a closed facility. This was regarded as a radical measure, comparable to placing minors in custody. In the light of the report\u2019s conclusions, the director general\u2019s guidelines of 7 May\u00a02008 (Generaldirekt\u00f6rens riktlinjer avseende till\u00e4mpningen av Dublinf\u00f6rordningen i f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till Grekland) established that asylum proceedings in Greece were generally acceptable for adults, but that there were problems regarding the reception of unaccompanied minors in relation to the above-mentioned reception facility.

That State is required, in accordance with the Court\u2019s well-established case-law, not to transfer a person where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if transferred, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. Furthermore, the Court has held that where States cooperate in an area where there might be implications for the protection of fundamental rights, it would be incompatible with the purpose and object of the Convention if they were absolved of all responsibility vis-\u00e0-vis the Convention in the area concerned (see, among other authorities, Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a026083/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999I). In applying the Dublin Regulation, therefore, States must make sure that the intermediary country\u2019s asylum procedure affords sufficient guarantees to avoid an asylum-seeker being removed, directly or indirectly, to his country of origin without any evaluation of the risks he faces from the standpoint of Article 3 of the Convention (see T.I. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 43844/98, ECHR\u00a02000-III, and K.R.S. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, both summarised in M.S.S. v.

The Court has acknowledged the existence of a wide range of reports from various sources appearing at regular intervals since 2006 and more frequently in 2008 (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece and paragraph\u00a033 above), in particular those published by the UNHCR in late 2007 and early 2008 and by the CPT on the detention conditions in Greece. From those reports it appears that the overall situation for asylum-seekers in Greece at the relevant time was volatile and rapidly developing. While the information at issue undeniably drew an increasingly alarming picture of the conditions of access to asylum proceedings in Greece and the living and detention conditions of asylum-seekers there, there were, at the time, also conflicting signals, such as the report of a fact-finding mission conducted by the Swedish authorities and the departure of the Norwegian authorities from their decision to suspend transfers to Greece. The Court therefore concludes that, at the relevant time, the information available to the Austrian authorities was ample, but also partly conflicting in its recommendations and results. Furthermore, while the UNHCR position paper of 15 April\u00a02008 unequivocally recommended that governments refrain from returning asylum-seekers to Greece until further notice, it again undeniably welcomed the steps taken by the Greek Government to strengthen its asylum system. Those reports, which come from different backgrounds, be it governmental or non-governmental organisations, show that there were concerns about the situation for asylum-seekers in Greece. However, the Court points out that the information was not coherent and open for the exercise of particular discretion.",

The Court also emphasised in that decision that an applicant could, if necessary, turn to the Court and lodge an application or request under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court against Greece. That decision was issued on 2 December 2008, shortly before the Constitutional Court in the present case decided, on 30\u00a0January 2009, not to deal with the applicant\u2019s complaint. The removal of the applicant to Greece on 8 April 2009 also occurred after the Court\u2019s decision had been adopted and therefore was not in contrast with the Court\u2019s case-law at the time.",

Norway, the only country to have done so in February 2008, reverted to examining such requests on a case-by-case basis in September 2008. Furthermore, at the relevant time the UNHCR had not addressed a letter to the Austrian authorities unequivocally asking them to refrain from transferring asylum-seekers to Greece, as it had done with Belgium in April\u00a02009. Even though the UNHCR sent the letter to Belgium on 2\u00a0April 2009, there is no indication that the Austrian authorities had any knowledge of that letter when the applicant was removed to Greece.
