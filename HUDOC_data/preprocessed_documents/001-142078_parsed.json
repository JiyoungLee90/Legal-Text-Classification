The Plenary reiterated that any party to criminal proceedings or any other person whose rights and freedoms were affected by actions or the inaction of the investigating or prosecuting authorities in criminal proceedings could rely upon Article 125 of the CCrP to challenge a refusal to institute criminal proceedings or a decision to terminate them. The Plenary stated that whilst the scope of the decisions amenable to judicial review under Article\u00a0125 included decisions to institute criminal proceedings, refusals to admit defence counsel or to grant victim status, a person could not rely on Article\u00a0125 to challenge a court\u2019s decision to apply bail or house arrest or to remand a person in custody. It was further stressed that in declaring a specific action or inaction on the part of a law-enforcement authority unlawful or unjustified, a judge was not entitled to quash the impugned decision or to oblige the official responsible to quash it, but could only request that he or she rectify the shortcomings identified. Should the impugned authority fail to comply with the court\u2019s instructions, an interested party could complain to a court about the authority\u2019s inaction and the latter body could issue a special ruling (\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435), drawing the authority\u2019s attention to the situation. Lastly, the decision stated that a prosecutor\u2019s decision to place a person under house arrest or to remand him or her in custody with a view to extradition could be appealed against to a court under Article 125 of the CCrP.",

The judicial authorisation of remand in custody in that situation was to be carried out in accordance with Article 108 of the CCrP and following an application by a prosecutor for that person to be remanded in custody. In deciding to remand a person in custody, a court was to examine if there were factual and legal grounds for the application of that preventive measure. If the extradition request was accompanied by a detention order of a foreign court, a prosecutor was entitled to remand the person in custody without a Russian court\u2019s authorisation (Article 466 \u00a7 2 of the CCrP) for a period not exceeding two months, and the prosecutor\u2019s decision could be challenged in the courts under Article 125 of the CCrP.

This conclusion is further strengthened by the fact that both decisions by the district prosecutor\u2019s office ordering the applicant\u2019s remand in custody did not set any time-limit on his detention or refer to any legal provision establishing such a time-limit. This is incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and the protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see, mutatis mutandis, Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7\u00a056, ECHR 2000III). The deprivation of liberty to which the applicant was subjected during that period was not circumscribed by adequate safeguards against arbitrariness (see Niyazov, cited above, \u00a7 124). The applicable Russian law therefore fell short of the \u201cquality of law\u201d standard required under the Convention. The Court therefore finds that the applicant\u2019s detention between 3 May 2009 and 30\u00a0April 2010 was arbitrary and thus not \u201clawful\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention.",

If such proceedings are not conducted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013229/03, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2008).
