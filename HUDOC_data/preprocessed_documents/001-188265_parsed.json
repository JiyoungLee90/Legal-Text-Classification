The applicants\u2019 representative was not allowed to pursue the line of questioning concerning a racial motive for Mr J.\u2019s actions since a civil party could raise only issues concerning a claim for damages (see paragraph 53 above). Moreover, an injured party claiming damages could not prevent the court from delivering a simplified judgment under Article 172 \u00a7 2 of the CCP; nor could that party lodge an appeal with the appellate court as regards the ruling on Mr\u00a0J.\u2019s guilt and sentencing (see paragraph 56 above).",

It is only the public prosecutor who supervises the investigation conducted by the police authority in the pre-trial stage of the\u00a0criminal proceedings (see paragraph 56 above), outlines in principle, on the basis of the bill of indictment, the extent of the trial court\u2019s adjudication (see paragraph 57 above), and has a right to commence full review before the appellate court (see paragraph 58 above). In the present case, there is no indication that the prosecution gave any instructions to police in the course of the investigation in relation to a possible racist motive of Mr J., even though already his very first statement of 16 June 2012 contained an apparent racial motive for his action (see paragraph 11 above). Further, Mr\u00a0J. was not charged with a\u00a0racially motivated crime (see paragraph 9 above) and the public prosecutor did not correct this lacuna on the part of the investigation authorities (see paragraph 56 above). In addition, the public prosecutor failed to discuss in the bill of indictment a possible racial motive (see paragraphs 27 and 88 above) which became even more apparent from the evidence collected in the course of the investigation, and in particular gave no reasons why the previous violent behaviour of Mr\u00a0J. and his own statement, together with the findings of the clinical psychologist, could not be linked to racial motives for the attack (contrast Stoica v.\u00a0Romania, no. 42722/02, \u00a7 120, 4 March 2008). Moreover, because the prosecutor (with the defendant) had waived his right to appeal, a full appeal was no longer possible before the appellate court.",
