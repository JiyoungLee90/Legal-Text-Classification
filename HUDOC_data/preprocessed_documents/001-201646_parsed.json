The Roma from the Gori\u010da vas settlement initially agreed to the Municipality\u2019s plan and expressed their readiness to contribute their labour to the project.

Subsequently, in May 1997, the first applicant, in his capacity as representative of the Roma living in Gori\u010da vas, declared in writing that the group was not willing to move to the proposed location. It follows from the internal communication of the Municipality that the opposition to the proposed plan partly resulted from the fact that two separate Roma groups were to be settled in Lepov\u010de, between whom disagreements existed.

The second applicant had had that name since birth; therefore the Government argued that his application had been lodged under a false identity and should be considered anonymous and an abuse of the right of application. In support of the latter grounds for inadmissibility, the Government further submitted that the second applicant lived with his mother, in accordance with a custody agreement between his parents.

It therefore takes the view that any person who is entitled under domestic law to represent the second applicant in that type of proceedings can also act on his behalf before the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Scozzari and Giunta v.

In this connection, the Court observes, without prejudging the merits of the present case, that in the case of Moldovan and Others v. Romania (no.\u00a02) (nos. 41138/98 and 64320/01, \u00a7\u00a7 107-109, ECHR 2005 VII (extracts)), comparable complaints of poor living conditions, albeit in combination with a number of other factors pertaining to the applicants\u2019 rights to respect for their private and family life and their homes, were found by the Court to amount to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention of a continuing nature. The Court considers that in this case also the alleged prolonged failure of the authorities to ensure access to water and sanitation, which according to the applicants persists to date, amounts to a continuing situation. The Court further reiterates that in cases where there is a continuing situation against which no effective domestic remedy is available, the six-month period runs from the cessation of that situation (see Oliari and Others v.\u00a0Italy, nos.\u00a018766/11 and 36030/11, \u00a7\u00a7 96-97, 21 July 2015, with further references).

In the cases of Dubetska and Others (no.\u00a030499/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0109-123, 10 February 2011) and Dzemyuk v.

Furthermore, upon examination of the environmental concerns in question, the Court found that the elevated risk to the applicants\u2019 health had constituted an interference with their private lives and homes which had attained a sufficient degree of seriousness to trigger the application of Article 8 of the Convention (see Dubetska and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0118119, and Dzemyuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84).

If the latter approach is at stake, the threshold of severity assumes crucial importance and it is for the applicant to show convincingly that the threshold was attained in his or her case. The Court reiterates in this connection that the consequence-based approach applies also in the context of positive obligations incumbent on the State under Article 8 of the Convention (see, for example, Fadeyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a055723/00, \u00a7\u00a7 68-69, ECHR 2005IV, where the Court stated that a certain minimum level of adverse effects of pollution on the individual\u2019s health or quality of life must be demonstrated to engage Article 8).",

A persistent and long-standing lack of access to safe drinking water can therefore, by its very nature, have adverse consequences for health and human dignity effectively eroding the core of private life and the enjoyment of a home within the meaning of Article 8. Therefore, when these stringent conditions are fulfilled, the Court is unable to exclude that a convincing allegation may trigger the State\u2019s positive obligations under that provision. Existence of any such positive obligation and its eventual content are necessarily determined by the specific circumstances of the persons affected, but also by the legal framework as well as by the economic and social situation of the State in question. The Court considers that the question whether any positive obligations were triggered in the present case and the scope of such obligations, which are the core issues to be examined on the merits, are closely linked to the specific circumstances of the case and their level of seriousness.

Without claiming to be representative of the situation of the Roma in any given country, the research had been designed to demonstrate that a significant number of Roma communities had suffered problems in relation to access to water, and that those conditions had often amounted to racial discrimination. An earlier research paper, \u201cThe Housing Situation of Roma Communities: Regional Roma Survey 2011\u201d, conducted by the United National Development Programme (UNDP), had shown that a high proportion of Romany households in selected European countries had not been connected to a public water supply system: in Romania it had been 72%, in Moldova\u00a066%, in Slovakia 38%, in Croatia 35%, in Hungary 30%, and in Albania 30%.",

Their water sources had often been far from home, with the burden to secure water falling disproportionately on women and girls. The water sources had often not been tested to ensure their safety and had been exposed to a wide range of contaminants, including dry toilets (pit latrines), insects, and wild animals. Roma often had not been able to afford public water service pipes and water charges, even if they had been otherwise available. In seventyfive of the sites investigated (81%), the Romany settlements had not been connected to the public water supply systems. Moreover, in sixty-three places (68%), none of the Romany households in the neighbourhood or settlements had been supplied with tap water and a functioning sewerage system. If the houses had been built on land with unclear ownership or the occupants had lacked a construction permit or similar documents, the local authorities had generally refused to connect them to the public water system.",

When the water source was more than 1 km away from the home or required more than thirty minutes collection time, the likely volumes of water collected were very low, typically less than 5 litres per person per day; basic consumption and hygiene practice were compromised to an extent that the risk to public health from poor hygiene was very high.",

Social groups such as the Roma may need assistance in order to be able effectively to enjoy the same rights as the majority population. As the Court has stated in the context of Article 14 of the Convention, that provision not only does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between them but, moreover, in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of Article 14 (see D.H. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 175; Thlimmenos v.

In this connection, the domestic and international materials referred to by the parties (see paragraphs -, - and - above) show that a considerable part of the Roma population in Slovenia, who live in illegally built settlements that are often removed from the densely populated areas with a public water-distribution system, face greater obstacles than the majority in accessing basic utilities.

In this connection, the Government argued that the applicants\u2019 respective buildings could not be legalised because they were erected on land not intended for residential use (see paragraph 128 above). In the absence of legalisation, the buildings could not be connected to water and sanitation services. Instead, the Court notes that a water tank, co-financed by the Ribnica Municipality, was purchased in 1999 for Gori\u010da vas settlement, and water was delivered there by the local fire brigade upon request, while the costs of the water itself were borne by the Municipality (see paragraph  above). Although it is not clear whether there were any such periods when no tank was available in the settlement, the applicants asserted that several water tanks had eventually become inappropriate for use (see paragraph  above). On this basis, as well as on the basis of the information provided by the Government concerning water deliveries for the period of 2010-16 (see paragraph  above), the Court accepts that one or several water tanks were installed in the settlement in the period from 1999 to 2016 into which supplies of drinking water were placed.",

While the applicants assert that the water tank became unusable due to mould and other fungi, the Government claim that the tank was subsequently sold by the members of the Roma community (see paragraph 18 above). Be that as it may, it is worth noting that no financial or other assistance, such as the purchase of another water tank, appears to have been requested by the applicants from the municipal authorities since 1999 for the purpose of acquiring a more regular water supply. Furthermore, the applicants did not assert that their own investment in the solution provided by the Municipality constituted a disproportionate financial burden that they could not afford. Neither did the applicants allege that the water delivered to the Gori\u010da vas settlement by the local fire brigade (see paragraphs 18-20 above) was not safe for drinking, or complain of any specific dangers to health or diseases in this respect. In the light of this, the Court concludes that the above arrangement provided the applicants from the Gori\u010da vas settlement with the possibility of accessing safe drinking water.",

Nine individual connections were installed from the distribution connection to the individual users\u2019 homes in the settlement, supplying water to seven of them (see paragraph 30 above). The applicants did not join the water supply system, allegedly owing to obstruction by hostile neighbours. However, it must be noted that they did not even apply to have water installed in their previous home (see paragraph  above). Neither is it clear from the applicants\u2019 submissions whether they took any steps towards obtaining an individual water connection after moving to a new location (ibid.). In this connection, given that the applicants not only chose their new location, but had also bought the land on which they built their home, even if only to avoid further disputes with their neighbours, in the Court\u2019s opinion they were themselves responsible for verifying whether they would be able to connect to the public water supply system and for taking steps to ensure their individual connection.",

In the absence of such submissions, the Court can only refer to the information supplied by the parties, whereby more than 10% of the population residing in the Ribnica municipality do not have access to drinking water from the public water-distribution system (see paragraph  above), and also some residents of the \u0160kocjan Municipality do not have such access, but instead supply themselves with water from the village fountain (see paragraph  above). In this connection, the Court further notes that undisputed information provided by the Government shows that a non-negligible proportion of the Slovenian population living in remote areas do not have access to the public water supply system and have to rely on alternative means of private water supply, such as water tanks (see paragraph 125 above).",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, the positive steps taken by the respective municipalities allow for the conclusion that they have acknowledged the disadvantages suffered by the applicants as members of a vulnerable community and shown a degree of active engagement with their specific needs. It is true that those steps did not entail the provision of household connections that are generally considered the ideal solution (see paragraph  above), or, in the case of the water tank installed in the Gori\u010da vas settlement, even made that possible. However, the applicants were not prevented from making use of their social benefits that allowed them to provide for their essential needs (see paragraph 149 above) to employ alternative solutions such as installing private water tanks or systems for collecting rainwater. As regards the State\u2019s own legal and financial obligations in this regard, the Court takes the view that, while it falls upon the State to address the inequalities in the provision of access to safe drinking water which disadvantage Roma settlements, this cannot be interpreted as including an obligation to bear the entire burden of providing running water to the applicants\u2019 homes.",

According to the undisputed submissions of the Government, in the Ribnica Municipality only the town of Ribnica and the Hrastje area were at the material time connected to such a system, while the \u0160kocjan Municipality had no public discharge or facility for treatment of urban wastewater. Considering the limited access to sanitation in the two municipalities, it would be difficult, in the absence of proof to the contrary, to conclude that the applicants\u2019 respective situations were accorded less importance than those of the majority population. Furthermore, taking account of the inherently progressive nature of the development of public infrastructure and the State\u2019s wide discretion in the prioritisation of resources for urban planning (see paragraph 144 above), in the Court\u2019s opinion only particularly convincing reasons such as a serious risk to health could justify imposing a burden on the State to take any steps with regard to the applicants\u2019 respective situations. However, while the applicants complained of frequent diseases (see paragraph 109 above), they neither made any concrete submissions to that effect nor presented evidence in support of their claims (see, mutatis mutandis, Denisov v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7 114). In that connection, it is worth noting that the applicants did not argue that they were in any way, financially or otherwise, prevented from installing their own septic tanks or employing other solutions alternative to the public sewerage system.",

Such a right cannot, of course, be absolute \u2013 very few Convention rights are \u2013 and could be restricted on reasonable grounds of balancing against competing public interests, such as the remoteness of a particular dwelling or settlement, or other factors that may render the applicants\u2019 connection to the public water supply (assuming one is available in the first place) unreasonably burdensome on the public purse or otherwise impractical. The grounds for restricting Article 8 rights, as listed in the second paragraph of that provision and which ought naturally to inform the scope of any positive obligations imposed on States, include \u201cthe economic well-being of the country\u201d, \u201cpublic safety\u201d and other relevant considerations. In conducting its assessment, the Court might even confine itself to reviewing the national legal framework on access to water, ensuring that it is generally consistent with Article 8 obligations and that it has not been applied in an arbitrary or discriminatory fashion in the individual case before us. Where a sufficient public water supply is not available in the vicinity of a particular settlement, it may be reasonable to expect its inhabitants to rely on other sources of clean water and sanitation, possibly with support from the national authorities or on a cost-sharing basis.",

In this respect, the Court, without prejudging the merits of a particular case, cannot ignore the fact that the denial of access to basic public services to Roma settlements has been used historically by less-than-friendly local authorities as a method of pressuring the Roma to move elsewhere, or with similar discriminatory motives. This point was made forcefully by Judge Pettiti in his dissenting opinion in Buckley v. the United Kingdom (no. 20348/92, 29 September 1996), the first case decided by this Court involving Roma rights. The third-party brief of the European Roma Rights Centre in the present case makes similar arguments from a more recent, comparative perspective (see paragraph 138 of the judgment), suggesting that these discriminatory practices against the Roma continue to persist. Finally, the applicants have specifically claimed in the present case that discriminatory attitudes played \u201ca major role\u201d in the refusal of the local authorities to connect them to the public water supply (see paragraph\u00a0160 of the judgment). In view of this historical context, the Court should apply close scrutiny to any justifications put forward by national authorities for the denial of basic public services to Roma communities.

This is not a remote community by any reasonable definition of the term, and the Government have not argued that connecting them to the water grid would require any considerable expenditure.

Since the tanks were exposed to the elements year-round, the applicants and other independent sources have asserted that they developed mould, froze in winter and became generally unsafe for human consumption in between fresh deliveries. It is, of course, not a simple matter for an international court to make factual findings on the adequacy of water deliveries, especially in the absence of any judicial findings at national level.

The most important one, in my view, is the willingness shown by the local authorities to go some way towards providing a sustainable and safe water solution for the settlement, namely by installing a collective water-distribution connection as of 2011, that is some three years before the lodging of the second application. While the family is in principle eligible to install an individual connection to the collective access point, it appears that they have not been able to do so, in part due to conflicts with their neighbours, which forced them to relocate within the settlement. The Government have indicated that it is nevertheless possible for them to establish an individual connection through alternative routes. While one ought to be sympathetic to their ongoing predicament, I agree with the majority conclusion that, on the basis of the record before us, the second series of applicants have not sufficiently established the existence of any prohibitive barriers in this respect that can be imputed to the national or local authorities. There has therefore been no violation of the Article 8 rights of the second series of applicants.",

Furthermore, there are indications that discriminatory attitudes, including de facto discrimination, may have contributed to some extent to this state of affairs. Be that as it may, in view of my conclusion under Article 8 that the authorities did not sufficiently take into account the special needs and situation of the applicants in the first application, as members of a Roma community, in their decision to deny them access to the nearby public water supply, I do not find it necessary to consider whether there has been a separate violation of Article 14 of the Convention.",

Of particular relevance in this respect are the applicants\u2019 claims that the lack of access to basic sanitation and related amenities had an especially serious impact on their children, who as a result felt ostracised, stigmatised and rejected by the general community, to the point that it affected even their ability to attend school. The psychological impact on Roma children of being treated as less than equal members of society with respect to something as elementary as access to water may, in itself, generate feelings of humiliation which could rise to the threshold of degrading treatment. Therefore, I would not exclude that a denial of, or a failure to provide, access to clean water and sanitation for extended periods of time might, in principle, constitute treatment prohibited by Article 3, especially where families with children are involved.",

Furthermore, in Moldovan and Others v. Romania (no. 2) (no. 41138/98, 12\u00a0July 2005), the Court found a violation of Article 3 in circumstances where the applicants, whose houses had been destroyed by anti-Roma mob violence, were left to endure for over ten years poor living conditions with detrimental effects on their health and well-being, coupled with a discriminatory and dismissive attitude of the authorities. It does not require a great leap to extend these rationales to State action or inaction \u2013 including due to a flawed legal framework \u2013 that exposes children and other vulnerable persons, including those belonging to disadvantaged communities, to prolonged distress and humiliation as a direct result of lack of access to safe water and basic sanitation.",
