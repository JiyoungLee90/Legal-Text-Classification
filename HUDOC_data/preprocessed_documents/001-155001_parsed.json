Instead of that, domestic law provided for such issues to be resolved in separate proceedings. The Court has already criticised this approach for prolonging the restitution process and causing individuals who find themselves in a situation such as the applicants\u2019 to be left in a state of uncertainty for a protracted period (see Sivova and Koleva, \u00a7\u00a7 11516; Nedelcheva and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 78-82; and Karaivanova and Mileva, \u00a7 81, all cited above). While acknowledging that States should be accorded a wide margin of appreciation in regulating important social and economic reforms such as the ones introduced in Bulgaria after the fall of communism, the Court reiterates that they nevertheless remain duty-bound to organise their judicial and administrative systems in such a way as to guarantee the rights provided for under the Convention (see Sivova and Koleva, cited above, \u00a7 116). In the case at hand, requiring the fourth applicant and his sister, and later the four applicants, to participate in two sets of proceedings, firstly a restitution procedure and then civil proceedings aimed at resolving the conflict between them and the third parties with rival claims to the land, unjustifiably delayed the effective exercise of the applicants\u2019 right to have the scope of those expectations finally determined.",

In addition, before deciding whether or not there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the Court must take into account the \u201cproceedings as a whole\u201d (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16\u00a0December 1992, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 247B; Mirilashvili v.

It thus notes that the argument about the plot\u2019s identification was not the only decisive argument in the case, since the rei vindicatio action brought by the fourth applicant and his sister was dismissed on the basis of the additional argument that the defendants, Ms D.S., Ms E.H. and Mr N.R., had validly obtained title to their plot pursuant to the 1972 exchange and the 1996 contract of sale, and were entitled to hold the land as its owners (see paragraph 14 above).
