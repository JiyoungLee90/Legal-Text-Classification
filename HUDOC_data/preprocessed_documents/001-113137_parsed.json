No such conclusion as had been made by Judge\u00a0I.K. could have been validly based on what K. had said. In addition, the statements of the two witnesses from the coffee shop had been unclear and contradictory and ought not to have led to the conclusion that the statements of K. had been wrong or contradictory.

By reason of the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with journalistic ethics (see Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999I and, as a recent authority, Eerik\u00e4inen and Others v. Finland, no. 3514/02, \u00a7 60, 10\u00a0February 2009).",

Denmark, 23\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 298), editorial discretion is not unbounded. Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d (Observer and Guardian v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, \u00a7 59, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0216; Thorgeir\u00a0Thorgeirson v.

Spain, no. 16023/07, \u00a7 25, 1 June 2010). This undoubtedly includes questions concerning the functioning of the system of justice, an institution that is essential for any democratic society. The press is one of the means by which politicians and public opinion can verify that judges are discharging their heavy responsibilities in a manner that is in conformity with the aim which is the basis of the task entrusted to them (Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, \u00a7 34, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0313). The freedom to criticize judges and the judiciary clearly falls within the scope of Article 10.",
