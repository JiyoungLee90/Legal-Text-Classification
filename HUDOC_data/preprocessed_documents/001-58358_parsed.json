Under this general authorisation, and in order to clarify the obligations arising from section 25 of the Private Business Activities Act, the Ministry of Finance issued the Rules, which defined two possible forms of book-keeping, and the Regulations, which established, inter alia, the obligation for businesses to increase their income tax base when they passed from single to double-entry book-keeping.

The Court considers that \u0160pa\u010dek SW, when changing from single to double-entry book-keeping, had been aware of the way in which the Ministry of Finance published its accounting principles and could easily have sought information about any possible transitional provisions, if necessary with the advice of specialists (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Cantoni v.\u00a0France judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, p. 1629, \u00a7 35).
