In particular, on 13\u00a0July 2007 the Leninskiy District Court of Cheboksary found the inaction on the part of the Regional Department of the Federal Treasury to be in contravention of the law and compelled the latter to transfer the monies to the plaintiff within one working day.

The applicant received the monies on 28\u00a0December 2006. Accordingly, it took the domestic authorities one and a half years to enforce the judgment in the applicant's favour.

The respondent State authority must be duly notified of the judgment against the State and is thus well placed to take all necessary initiatives to comply with it or to transmit it to another competent State authority responsible for compliance. This especially applies where, in view of the complexities and possible overlapping of the execution and enforcement procedures, an applicant may have reasonable doubts about which authority is responsible for the execution or enforcement of the judgment (see Akashev v. Russia, no. 30616/05, \u00a7\u00a021, 12 June 2008).",

Nevertheless, even assuming that the applicant could have been more diligent when contacting various state bodies, the Court cannot but notice that the state bodies themselves were not in agreement as to the way in which the judgment was to be enforced and advised the applicant in a contradictory manner on the issue. Furthermore, the judgment and the writ of execution contained certain defects which had to be corrected. Lastly, the Court notes that, when reapplying to the Ministry of Finance on 10\u00a0May 2006, the applicant indeed failed to provide his bank details. However, it took the Ministry of Finance another six months to advise him of that omission on his part. The relevant letter to the applicant was not sent until 9\u00a0November 2006. It appears that the applicant promptly responded submitting the information requested and the judgment debt was paid on 28\u00a0December 2006.",
