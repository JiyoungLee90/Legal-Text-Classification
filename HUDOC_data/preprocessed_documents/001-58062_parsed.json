Most of them describe the events of 6\u00a0April 1993 in an almost identical manner.  In the recorded statements the villagers refer to the fact that the terrorists had made a previous attack on the village during which three persons had been killed and three others injured, this general formula being used even in the statements of the applicants Ahmet \u00c7i\u00e7ek and Abdurrahman Aktas whose close relatives, including the latter's father, had been killed on that occasion.  The statements also contain a declaration about the villagers' respect for the State and their willingness to help the State.  All in all, the recorded statements give the impression of having been drafted in a uniform manner by the gendarmes rather than reflecting spontaneous declarations by the villagers.  This may also explain why some of these statements are in complete contradiction to what the same persons have stated on other occasions (see Ahmet \u00c7i\u00e7ek's statements referred to in paragraphs 61 and 89-90 above, Abdurrahman Aktas's statements referred to in paragraphs 54 and 98 above, and Abdullah Karabulut's statements referred to in paragraphs 66, 67 and 111 above).

The Delegate submitted that it might, in practice, be impossible for villagers such as the applicants to institute and pursue such proceedings.  In the first place, there would be considerable practical difficulties.  For example, it was unlikely that a villager whose property had been destroyed would be able to pay for the services of a lawyer himself.  Secondly, the success of proceedings based on accusations of this kind depended on an impartial investigation being made by the authorities.  In the prevailing circumstances it was highly doubtful whether such an investigation would be made.  Moreover, in South-East Turkey, where the security forces had to carry out their difficult tasks under much strain and insecurity, the delegation of the Commission had detected a desire amongst the representatives of the State whom they had questioned to protect the military and a clear reluctance to accept that accusations be levelled against the security forces.

The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26) obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial or arbitral organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system.  Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system.  The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13) - with which it has close affinity -, that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law.  In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see the Handyside v. the  judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 22, para. 48).

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success.  However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see, inter alia, the Commission's decision on the admissibility of application no. 788/60, Austria v. Italy, 11 January 1961, Yearbook, vol. 4, pp. 166-168; application no. 5577-5583/72, Donnelly and Others v. the United Kingdom (first decision), 5 April 1973, Yearbook, vol. 16, p. 264; also the judgment of 26 June 1987 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez case, Preliminary Objections, Series C no. 1, para. 88, and that Court's Advisory Opinion of 10 August 1990 on \"Exceptions to the Exhaustion of Domestic Remedies\" (Article 46 (1), 46 (2) (a) and 46 (2) (b) of the American Convention on Human Rights), Series A no. 11, p. 32, para. 41).  One such reason may be constituted by the national authorities remaining totally passive in the face of serious allegations of misconduct or infliction of harm by State agents, for example where they have failed to undertake investigations or offer assistance.  In such circumstances it can be said that the burden of proof shifts once again, so that it becomes incumbent on the respondent Government to show what they have done in response to the scale and seriousness of the matters complained of.

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see the above-mentioned Van Oosterwijck judgment, p. 18, para. 35).  This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants.

In such a situation it must be recognised that there may be obstacles to the proper functioning of the system of the administration of justice.  In particular, the difficulties in securing probative evidence for the purposes of domestic legal proceedings, inherent in such a troubled situation, may make the pursuit of judicial remedies futile and the administrative inquiries on which such remedies depend may be prevented from taking place.

Nevertheless, like the Commission, the Court considers it significant that the Government, despite the extent of the problem of village destruction (see paragraph 13 above), have not been able to point to examples of compensation being awarded in respect of allegations that property has been purposely destroyed by members of the security forces or to prosecutions having been brought against them in respect of such allegations.  In this connection the Court notes the evidence referred to by the Delegate of the Commission as regards the general reluctance of the authorities to admit that this type of illicit behaviour by members of the security forces had occurred (see paragraph 63 above).  It further notes the lack of any impartial investigation, any offer to cooperate with a view to obtaining evidence or any ex gratia payments made by the authorities to the applicants.  ",

Not only did the applicants not apply to any court (or any other competent national authority), they took no steps whatever whose result could be regarded as a fact suggesting that effective and sufficient domestic remedies did not exist.  In short, the applicants' argument is based on assumptions about the attitude of the State authorities.  It is, however, astonishing that a Court which was so strict and meticulous in the way it applied the exhaustion rule in the Van Oosterwijck and Cardot cases should be so tolerant in the present case.  If the existence of domestic remedies is required, as the Court has held, to be \"sufficiently certain\", should not the same Court also require the lack of such remedies (or their insufficiency or ineffectiveness) to be established to an equal extent, that is to say, proved to be \"sufficiently certain\"?  The respondent Government pointed out, and pertinently so, that in the Finnish Ships Arbitration case it had been established that the exhaustion rule was applicable \"unless there is an obvious futility or inefficacity which is manifest\", and that in the Panavezys-Saldutiskis case concerning Lithuania \"the argument was put forward that it was absolutely uncertain in Lithuanian law whether it was possible to take proceedings in the Lithuanian courts against the Government where the Government had carried out acts iuris imperii.  The court in  replied: `This does not dispense you from taking proceedings.  You have to have recourse to the Lithuanian courts, which are the only courts that can confirm whether such a remedy is acceptable or not'\" (verbatim record of the hearing on 25 April 1996, Cour/Misc (96) 243/III, p. 11). Similarly, the Commission has said: \"If there is doubt as to the effectiveness of a domestic remedy, the point must be taken before the domestic courts\" (see application no. 10148/82, Florentino Garcia v. , decision of 14 March 1985, Decisions and Reports 42, p. 98).  The applicants talk incessantly about \"compensation for the damage they have sustained\", when there are hundreds of judgments of the administrative and civil courts awarding compensation to victims in almost identical cases.  Is it possible to say, in the light of these facts, that the non-existence of domestic remedies was certain? Neither in the Commission's report nor in the Court's judgment, which is based on the Commission's suppositions, is there any factual evidence or legal argument that dispels the \"doubt\" as to the existence of domestic remedies to such an extent as to make the lack of such remedies \"certain\".

The witness evidence taken during the Commission's investigation (see the Commission's report of 26 October 1995, paragraphs 40 et seq.) shows that inquiries were made by the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakir National Security Court and that the applicants - and the other villagers - were not able at the time to identify any member of the security forces as being responsible for the acts complained of. In addition, the Court, referring explicitly to the allegations made by the Delegate of the Commission, notes the lack of any impartial investigation, any offer to cooperate with a view to obtaining evidence, or any ex gratia payments made by the authorities (see paragraph 71, third sub-paragraph in fine, of the judgment).  I wish to emphasise that the Turkish judiciary perform their duties with as much independence and impartiality as the judges of the other States party to the Convention throughout Turkish territory.

In addition, it should not be forgotten that where the offenders in a criminal case are not identified the strict liability principle is inoperative.

In the first place, as I have already said (see paragraph 8 above), that assertion is not correct.  Secondly, one can criticise the conduct of the administrative authorities if one wishes to do so.  Under a political regime where there is a separation rather than an amalgamation of powers and where the judiciary is independent and impartial vis-\u00e0-vis the other branches of State authority, I wonder how the conduct of the administrative authorities can influence the administration of justice.  If at the same time the immobility of the courts is criticised, how is it possible for a court to deal with a case of its own motion or for the prosecuting authorities to perform their duties if those directly concerned do not help them to do so in such situations?
