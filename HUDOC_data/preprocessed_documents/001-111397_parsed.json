It therefore lacked both sufficient detail and the company\u2019s formal certification. Further, the applicant stated that he had been unable to earn his living as a taxi driver until he bought a new car on 1 January 2008. However, it remains unclear whether or not the applicant could have bought this car at some point earlier, or indeed, absent any evidence to this effect, whether the said car had indeed been bought as claimed on 1 January 2008. Lastly, the applicant\u2019s implied claim that, effectively, he would have been on the streets almost every day between 6 May 2004 and 1 January 2008 seems unrealistic.",
