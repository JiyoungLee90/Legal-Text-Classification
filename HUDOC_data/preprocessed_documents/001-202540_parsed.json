They submitted that the premises where the recordings had been made had not been where parliamentary work that was to be sheltered from the public eye and would have involved any confidential information took place. Rather, Parliament was the venue for the most prominent political debates and its premises were open to the public, including journalists. Likewise, MPs shown in the recordings had had a duty to report on issues of public interest and tolerate questions concerning the main topics of current political debate. The presence of the Prime Minister and other senior politicians could not justify the interference either, since they had to withstand the closest public scrutiny.

It was not only the question they had put to the MPs, but also the MPs\u2019 reaction that had been a matter of public interest. Furthermore, legislative work had to be extensively covered by the media, since it had a direct effect on the lives of citizens and MPs were expected to have to answer questions put by journalists.

The primary role of parliamentary reporting was to document the functioning of Parliament, that is to say, to provide information about plenary sessions and committee meetings. There were few possible restrictions on such activities and Article 5(1) of the Fundamental Law and the Parliament Act ensured public access to these meetings and ensured their broadcasting. However, further reporting, press conferences and interviews related to parliamentary work did not entail the same level of protection. Moreover, expressive activities unrelated to parliamentary activities and merely conducted in Parliament were even less protected. The Government submitted that the applicants\u2019 interviews had fallen into this latter category and that the question put to the parliamentarians had not related to the work of Parliament. The Government emphasised that the recordings had not been made with a view to presenting the opinion of MPs on a matter of public concern either, but rather with the intention of presenting them in an unfavourable light. The applicants had not therefore been fulfilling their role as public watchdogs providing balanced information, but had been seeking the public\u2019s attention in a sensationalist manner, in line with the latest media trends.",

In any case, MPs did not have to answer a particular set of questions or maintain contact with members of the press. Given the particular characteristics of the applicants\u2019 interviewing techniques, the MPs had understandably been unwilling to answer their questions. In that connection, the Government emphasised that the applicants\u2019 conduct had verged on abusing the right to freedom of expression.

They pointed out that sanctions had only been applied to knowingly unlawful and recurrent recording and after repeated warnings. They also argued that the suspension of the right to entry had had no bearing either on the right of the media to report on issues of public interest or on the right of the public to receive information, since other journalists not concerned by the decision had remained free to access the building and the applicants themselves could continue to follow the plenary sessions through broadcasting, and interview MPs at other locations. Any chilling effect would have only been produced if the journalists had been forbidden from publishing the recordings, intimated or subjected to retaliation or prohibited from reporting on matters related to the National Assembly altogether. In any case, according to the Government, the sanction imposed on the applicants had been the least restrictive one and any other measure (e.g. a fine or warning) would not have provided the same result.",

The Court observes that the recordings intended to document the reaction of MPs on alleged illicit payments linked to the National Bank (see paragraph 6 above), a matter of considerable public interest which attracted significant media attention. In this context, the Court has already held that freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion on the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders. In particular, it gives politicians the opportunity to reflect and comment on the preoccupations of public opinion; it thus enables everyone to participate in the free political debate which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society (see Castells v.\u00a0Spain, 23 April 1992, \u00a7 43, Series A no. 236). Furthermore, it is not for the Court, nor for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted by journalists (see Stoll v. Switzerland [GC], no. 69698/01, \u00a7 146, ECHR 2007V). The Court thus accepts that the subject matter of the applicants\u2019 recordings was journalistic coverage of an issue of public interest. As regards the applicants\u2019 interest in being allowed entry to Parliament for further reporting, the Court has no difficulty in considering that this was related to matters of which the public had a legitimate interest in being informed.",

On the other hand, having regard to the circumstances of the present case, namely that the allegedly disruptive conduct occurred outside plenary sessions or any other political discussion within Parliament, the present case is to be distinguished from situations where measures have been taken in response to speech or conduct interfering with the orderly conduct of parliamentary debate (see Kar\u00e1csony and Others, and Selmani and Others, both cited above). The Court however accepts that parliaments are entitled to some degree of deference in regulating conduct in Parliament \u2013 by designating areas for recording \u2013 to avoid disruption in parliamentary work without such disruption being manifest, and that the Court\u2019s scrutiny of such regulations should be limited. In any case, in the present circumstances, the prohibition on recording was limited to clearly defined areas in Parliament that appeared to be directly relevant to the functioning of the legislature. Furthermore, the Court cannot but agree with the Government that by not respecting the regulations on recording, the applicants knowingly risked being sanctioned for breaching the Speaker\u2019s Order (see paragraph 34 above).",
