In particular, the court observed that labour legislation at the material time distinguished between ordinary open-ended employment agreements (\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0440), which could be concluded orally, and special written employment contracts (\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442), which, to be valid, had to comply with a number of formalities prescribed by law. The court held that the applicant had been hired on the basis of an oral employment agreement, since the contract of July\u00a01992 lacked a number of essential clauses and had not been executed in accordance with necessary formalities. Furthermore, the contract falsely referred to the applicant as the Company co-founder and to Mr\u00a0G. as the Company director. The court further found that the annulment of the contract of July\u00a01992 entailed the annulment of the contract of August\u00a01997, which referred to it, and that, furthermore, Mr\u00a0G. needed the consent of the other co-founders to execute it.",

Although the Court has previously rejected some similar cases concerning repeated remittals, having observed that the judicial authorities had acted diligently in handling a complex matter (see e.g. Zhurba\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a011215/03\u00a0, 19\u00a0June\u00a02007; Bespalov\u00a0v.\u00a0 (dec.), no.\u00a011484/05, 15\u00a0January 2008), it cannot find a similar justification for remittals in the present case.",
