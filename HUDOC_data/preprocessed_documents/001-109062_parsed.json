As in Nalbantski, that situation could not have been remedied in the judicial review proceedings (ibid.) seeing that the Supreme Administrative Court exercised only limited judicial review over the formal lawfulness of the ban while holding that the manner in which the police authorities exercised their discretion to assess the necessity of imposing the restriction was not subject to judicial review (see paragraph 18 above). Such rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 on the Bulgarian authorities to ensure that any interference with an individual\u2019s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the circumstances (see Gochev v. , no. 34383/03, \u00a7 50, 26 November 2009).",
