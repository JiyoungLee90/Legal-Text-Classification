The court thus found that granting the application would in effect deprive the plaintiff, who had won at first instance, of the benefits of his success. Moreover, the court considered the applicants' prospects of success regarding their appeal in the main proceedings and found that the applicants had failed to establish that they had a good chance of succeeding. The court considered that their grounds of appeal were, at least prima facie, unfounded. In this connection, the court noted that the applicants had not put forward any evidence proving that the first instance judge had not had jurisdiction when he had tried the case. Furthermore, the court noted the second applicant had made a very negative impression when he had given testimony. His allegations had been held to be false and unreliable.
