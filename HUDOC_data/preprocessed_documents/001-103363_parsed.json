According to the UNHCR's press release of 25\u00a0April\u00a02008, there were witness reports that the Turkish authorities had attempted to deport sixty persons to  through the official border crossing on 23 April 2008. As the Iraqi border authorities only accepted Iraqi nationals and refused to admit eighteen non-Iraqi refugees, the latter had been forced to cross a fast-flowing river by the Turkish police. Four of them had been swept away by the strong river current and had drowned. Their bodies could not be recovered (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia, cited above, \u00a7 47).",

The arrest record, which was signed by the applicant, indicated that the arrest had been effected on account of the applicant's attempt to leave  by illegal means, pursuant to Law\u00a0no.\u00a05682. Following his arrest, the applicant was requested to make a statement to gendarmerie officers regarding his illegal attempt to leave the country. Later on the same day, an administrative sanction was imposed on the applicant by the Ku\u015fadas\u0131 public prosecutor for infringing section 33 of Law no. 5682 by attempting to leave  without a passport. He was, nevertheless, kept in detention, despite the lack of any evidence in the case file to indicate that any further charges had been brought against him that could justify his continued detention. It therefore appears that, from 15\u00a0September 2008 onwards, the applicant had not been detained on account of a criminal charge, but in the context of immigration controls. In these circumstances, the Court must assess whether the applicant was informed of the reasons for this detention in accordance with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

Although the applicant had apparently signed a form following his arrest explaining his rights as an arrested person, including his right to appoint a lawyer, the effectiveness of such a form is highly debatable in view of the applicant's very limited knowledge of Turkish. The Court observes that the applicant only gained access to a lawyer eleven days into his detention through the intervention of his brother, who lived in the , which is contested by the Government. Furthermore, the applicant was removed from the gendarmerie station with a view to deportation immediately after meeting the lawyer, before he had had any meaningful opportunity to challenge his detention.",
