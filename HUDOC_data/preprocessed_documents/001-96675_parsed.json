In the present case, the bulk of the delay occurred when the applicant\u2019s two cases were pending before the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 8, 10, 14, 21 and 24 above). In view of the fact that there was no higher court, and a \u201ccomplaint about delays\u201d is to be made to the president of the higher court (see paragraph 15 above), it is questionable whether this avenue of redress was available to the applicant.

Indeed, had she been eligible for legal aid, she would have been entitled to a similar sum in respect of normal secretarial expenses without being required to provide proof of actually incurring them.
