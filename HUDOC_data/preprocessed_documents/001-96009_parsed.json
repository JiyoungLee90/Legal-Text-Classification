It appears from the applicant's submissions that he had lodged the application solely in his own name and complained about violations of his personal rights as the owner and director of the Company. In this regard, the Court reiterates that the term \u201cvictim\u201d in Article 34 of the Convention denotes the person directly affected by the act or omission which is at issue (see, for example, Eckle v. Germany, 15 July 1982, \u00a7 66, Series A no. 51). To this effect, the Court notes that the sole owner of a company can claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention in so far as the impugned measures taken with regard to his or her company are concerned (see Nosov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30877/02, 20\u00a0October 2005). Having regard to the absence of competing interests which could create difficulties, for example, in determining who is entitled to apply to the Court and in the light of the circumstances of the case as a whole, the applicant can, in the Court's opinion, reasonably claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, in so far as the impugned measures taken with regard to his company are concerned (see\u00a0Ankarcrona v. Sweden (dec.), no. 35178/97, ECHR 2000VI).",

However, that right would be illusory if a 's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see\u00a0Hornsby v. , 19 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II).",

The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85). Having regard to the violation found, the Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well.

In this connection, the Court points out that its judgments are essentially declaratory in nature. In general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention (see Shofman v.\u00a0Russia, no. 74826/01, \u00a7 53, 24 November 2005, with further references). By finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the present case, the Court has established the Government's obligation to take appropriate measures to remedy the applicant's individual situation, that is to ensure compliance with the applicant's enforceable claim under the judgment of 31 May 2001 (compare with Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2005-...). Whether such measures would involve restoring the applicant's right of use of the plot in question or providing him with an equivalent plot or, if this proves impossible, granting him reasonable compensation for non-enforcement, or a combination of these and other measures, is a decision that falls to the respondent State (see, mutandis mutadis, Tarverdiyev v. Azerbaijan, no. 33343/03, \u00a7 66, 26 July 2007). The Court, however, emphasises that any measures adopted must be compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment (see Assanidze v.\u00a0Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 202, ECHR 2004-II, with further references).",
