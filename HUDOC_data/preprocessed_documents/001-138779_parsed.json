They took the view, however, that where the judicial authorities were confronted with such a situation they had to reconcile this principle with the presumption of innocence enjoyed by the accused officers. In the present case, there was nothing to prove that the injuries established by the medical certificates produced by the applicants had been caused by a slap on the face by police officers. The Government observed in particular that the police officers concerned had always denied behaving in such manner and that the findings of the investigation had not called their position into question. In their view, the applicants had filed a complaint with the aim of discrediting the officers; in support of this view they indicated that \u2013 as noted in the social inquiry report of Committee P\u2019s investigation department \u2013 the members of the Bouyid family had filed a number of complaints against the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode police, and that those complaints had always been situated in a context of confrontation between them.",

They referred in particular to the judgments in Salman v. Turkey ([GC] no.\u00a021986/93, ECHR 2000VII), Esen v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 29484/95, 22 July 2003), Rivas v.

Pointing out that those principles applied to their case, as they had produced medical certificates to show that they had been found to have injuries after being within the control of the police, they argued that the Government had not adduced any evidence capable of rebutting the presumption. In their view, such evidence should have emanated in particular from an \u201ceffective investigation\u201d. However, the investigation conducted in the present case could not be described as such, especially as the investigators had failed to organise a confrontation between the applicants and the accused police officers, as no fresh medical examination had been ordered, as their request for additional measures had been almost completely rejected even though the measures in question had been necessary to establish the truth, and as the judicial investigation had been closed before the investigating judge had received a statement which he had previously ordered for inclusion in the case file. They further pointed to the fact that, in its report on a visit to Belgium from 18 to 27 April 2005, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment had indicated that the risk of a person being ill-treated by the police while in custody could not be ruled out. Moreover, the social inquiry report drawn up by the investigation department of Committee P, which was based on the police reports emanating from the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode police force and was biased against the applicants, had not helped in any way to explain the cause of their injuries. As to the question of respect for the presumption of innocence enjoyed by the officers in question, it was devoid of pertinence in that connection. The applicants concluded that, as the Government had failed to rebut the presumption that they had been slapped on the face by police officers, it was proven that the slaps had indeed been inflicted on them.",

Moreover, there was apparently an atmosphere of tension between the members of the applicants\u2019 family and police officers in their neighbourhood. In those circumstances, even though one of the applicants was only 17 at the time and whilst it is comprehensible that, if the events really took place as the applicants described, they must have felt deep resentment, the Court cannot ignore the fact that these were one-off occurrences in a situation of nervous tension and without any serious or long-term effect. It takes the view that acts of this type, though unacceptable, cannot be regarded as generating a sufficient degree of humiliation or debasement for a breach of Article 3 of the Convention to be established. In other words, in any event, the above-mentioned threshold of severity has not been reached in the present case, such that no question of a violation of that provision, under either its substantive or its procedural head, arises.",
