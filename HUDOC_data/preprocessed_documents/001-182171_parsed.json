In particular, it was noted that the applicant had been found in a vehicle on the road and arrested. He had refused to step out of his vehicle, so S.D. had grabbed him by his left wrist and had applied the socalled \u201cwristlock\u201d technique in order to get him out of his vehicle. At that point police officer L.D. had grabbed the applicant by his right hand in order to apply the so-called \u201celbow-lock\u201d technique, but due to the fact that the applicant had continued to resist all three of them had fallen to the ground. The applicant had tried to stand up and L.D. had kept him on the ground by pressing his knee against his back. The applicant had then been handcuffed and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle. In the police vehicle the applicant had continued to resist and the police officer S.D. had applied the \u201celbow-lock\u201d technique and leaned him forwards in order to restrain him. By the time they had parked in front of the police station, one handcuff had come loose, so L.D. and I.R. had applied the \u201celbow-lock\u201d technique again. When they had entered the police station the applicant had once again fallen to the ground. Then the applicant had been seated in a room and had ceased to resist, so the police officers had stopped using force and removed his other handcuff. Lastly, it was noted that during the application of coercive measures the applicant and S.D. had sustained injuries which, according to the doctor\u2019s report, had been minor.",

In the Court\u2019s view the fact that the applicant gave an oral statement only at the end of the trial did not mean that he could not have brought this complaint earlier in the proceedings. This is particularly so given that prior to the hearing held on 1 July 2011 the applicant and his lawyer, D.P., attended two hearings during which the trial court took statements from the accused, heard witnesses and examined other evidence, without the applicant or his lawyer ever mentioning the issue of the applicant having allegedly been denied access to a lawyer during his questioning by the police (see paragraphs 21-22 above).",
