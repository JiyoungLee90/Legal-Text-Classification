The lack of complexity of the proceedings could also be inferred from the length of the judgments given by the courts, comprising a maximum of twelve pages. Considerable delays had been caused by the tax authorities before the bill of indictment was drawn up by the Public Prosecutor. In particular, it took the Salzburg Tax Office more than three years, namely from 31 January 1990, when he submitted his comments on the suspicions of tax evasion, before it requested the Oberwart Tax Office to transfer the tax file on 22 March 1993. Subsequently, more than one year elapsed from that date until the file was transferred to the Salzburg Tax Office on 25 May 1994. In the applicant's view, there was no explanation why the authorities could not have made copies of the tax file while the Salzburg and Vienna Tax Offices for the Audit of Large-scale Companies were examining the \u201cWEB/IMMAG\u201d group. Compared to the delays caused by the authorities, his own motions did not contribute significantly to the overall duration. ",
