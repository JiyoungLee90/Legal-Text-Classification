The defendant had every reason to impede the normal judicial procedure, given that its ultimate intention was to compel him to abandon his case by exerting psychological and financial pressure on him. As regards his applications to amend his statements of claim, he submitted that amendments were necessary for two reasons: firstly, because of the passage of time and, secondly, because of his repeated need to change lawyers as a result of the reprehensible conduct of the defendant. The request for the adjournment of the hearing of 19 February 1987 was made by the defendant, and not by both sides.

It also must be shown that the costs were actually and necessarily incurred by the applicant and that they are reasonable as to quantum (see Philis v. Greece (No. 1), judgment of 27\u00a0August 1991, Series A no. 209, p. 25, \u00a7 74). In the present case, the Court notes that the costs incurred in the domestic proceedings have no connection with its finding of a violation of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement in Article 6. Furthermore, the Court notes that the applicant, who was not represented by a lawyer in the proceedings before the Court, has not submitted any claims in connection with the Convention proceedings. Consequently, the Court rejects the applicant\u2019s claims under this head.",
