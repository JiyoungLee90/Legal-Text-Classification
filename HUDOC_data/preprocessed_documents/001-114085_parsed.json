In that case he was to be escorted by three armed prison guards wearing bullet-proof vests. Those recommendations were endorsed by the Penitentiary Commission.",

Frequently, prison officers applied the same restrictions to the whole category of prisoners classified as \u201cdangerous detainees\u201d without making individual assessment of danger posed by specific prisoners. He drew particular attention in his letter to the practice adopted by prison officers of putting shackles on detainees classified as dangerous every time they moved around their ward. The Ombudsman pointed out that such practice had already been disapproved by the CPT in their report on the 2000 visit. Such practices had been observed in the  and Pozna\u0144 Detention Centres.",

However, the Court notes that they relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 28\u00a0February 2007 in which it was established that a detainee\u2019s personal rights could be infringed on account of overcrowding and inadequate living and sanitary conditions in a detention establishment. Further cases cited by the Government concerned the alleged infringement of detainees\u2019 personal rights which derived from various situations, such as overcrowding in prison, detention with inmates who smoked, risk of HIV infection, food poisoning and bodily injury caused by an inmate. The Court observes that none of the examples quoted by the Government is directly relevant to the applicant\u2019s situation, namely the fact that he continued to be unlawfully held in a special cell for dangerous detainees. Furthermore, the judgments referred to were delivered in the period subsequent to the applicant\u2019s placement. In any event, in cases concerning prison overcrowding the Court has established that civil-law remedies could be considered effective only as from 17 March 2010 (see \u0141atak v.

In any event, the Court recalls that it has already considered two important limitations of the Polish model of constitutional complaint, namely its scope and the form of redress it provides and held that the constitutional complaint could be recognised as an effective remedy only where: 1) the individual decision, which allegedly violated the Convention, had been adopted in direct application of an unconstitutional provision of national legislation; and 2) procedural regulations applicable to the revision of such type of individual decisions provided for the reopening of the case or the quashing of the final decision in consequence of the judgment of the Constitutional Court in which unconstitutionality had been found. Consequently, the Court found that the exhaustion of the procedure of the constitutional complaint should be required under Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in situations in which both above-mentioned requirements had been met (see Szott\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Medy\u0144ska v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 47414/99, 9 October 2003, and \u0141aszkiewicz v. , no. 28481/03, \u00a7 68, 15 January 2008). Even assuming that the applicant was successful before the  and obtained a judgment declaring the provisions regulating the imposition of the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime unconstitutional, the Government did not provide any information about the possibility of having decisions imposing such regime subsequently revisited. In other words, the Court considers that the Government did not prove that by lodging a constitutional complaint the applicant would have been able to secure adequate redress in respect of his individual situation. For the above reasons, the Court considers that a constitutional complaint cannot be regarded as an effective remedy in the present case.",

Despite his classification as a dangerous detainee, the applicant could receive visits from his relatives. In addition, he was granted rewards for good behaviour in the form of additional visits. He had contact with prison officers, including prison wardens and could send and receive correspondence. He was also seen by a psychologist who did not find any indication against his confinement in a solitary cell. Therefore, they maintained that the applicant\u2019s conditions of detention were similar to those of Ramirez Sanchez (see Ramirez Sanchez v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 59450/00, \u00a7\u00a7 129-130, ECHR 2006IX). The applicant received visits, was not placed exclusively in a one-person cell and could participate in the life of the detention facility. He could not be considered to have been in complete sensory or social isolation. In addition, he \u2013 unlike Ramirez Sanchez \u2013 was later declassified as a \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d and moved to an ordinary prison wing. In any case, having regard to the existence of a structural problem of overcrowding in detention facilities at the material time, the Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s possibility to use the cell exclusively for himself should be seen as an advantage in comparison with an average detainee.",

The Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s explanation, taking into account that the applicant was detained under the special regime in respect of which the authorities\u2019 duty to keep detailed records would appear particularly stringent and that they should normally be able to provide relevant prison records in order to prove their assertion.

A similar formulation was later adopted in Articles 212a and 212b of the CECS which were applied to the applicant as from 1 September 2003. The legal formulation of the rule and exception to it could generally result in an over-inclusive regime as already indicated in the cases of Piechowicz and Horych (see, \u00a7 168 and \u00a7 93 respectively, both cited above). This conclusion matches the findings of the 2004 CPT report, which underlined that the procedure for allocating a prisoner to \u201cN\u201d status should be reviewed with a view to ensuring that such status was only applied and maintained in relation to prisoners who genuinely required to be placed in such category (see paragraph 91 above). Also, given the absence of any provisions linking that status with a person\u2019s actual behaviour in prison, the legal framework of the \u201cN\u201d regime seems to be too rigid and not sufficiently oriented towards the individual circumstances of a particular detainee (see Piechowicz, \u00a7 168 and Horych, \u00a7\u00a093, both cited above).",

Furthermore, on 6 February 2006 the Lublin District Court discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant with regard to the charge of leading an organised group engaged in fraud (see\u00a0paragraph 15 above).

For those reasons, the present case cannot be compared to cases of persons linked to Mafia-type organisations or other cases concerning organised crime (compare and contrast, Piechowicz, \u00a7 169 and Horych, \u00a7 94, both cited above). Furthermore, the alleged risk of corrupting prison or administration of justice officials and of escaping were not substantiated by any concrete facts.

It does not appear that there was a permanent need to do so in the applicant\u2019s case, given that in the prison he remained in a secure environment. Nonetheless, the Prison Service deemed it appropriate to adopt a general practice to the effect that all \u201cN\u201d detainees should wear shackles on account of their presumed dangerousness. This practice remained in place despite the criticism voiced by the Ombudsman who called for individual assessment of dangerousness posed by each detainee (see paragraph 80 above).",

The obligation to undergo these checks was expressly laid down in paragraph 64 of the 1998 Ordinance and subsequently in Article 212b of the CECS. The strip-search, involving an anal inspection, was carried out as a matter of routine and was not linked to any concrete security needs, nor to any specific suspicion concerning the applicant\u2019s conduct. It was performed despite the fact that outside his cell and the \u201cN\u201d ward the applicant could move around the remand centre only by himself, his mobility was restricted due to his wearing shackles all the time and he had to be permanently and directly supervised by at least 2\u00a0prison guards.
