Various tests conducted revealed close relationships between A. and her mother and her elder sister and a rejection of her father. The main reasons for the rejection were expressed by A. as follows: \u201che offends T. (the elder sister)\u201d, \u201cit is bad with him\u201d and \u201che is mean\u201d. According to M., the latter statement could be understood to mean that the applicant had an excessive tendency to preach. M. further stated that A.'s rejection of her father was of a stable psychological and motivated nature, which might have been caused by a previous traumatic experience and was not inspired by another person. At the same time, A. willingly accepted the father of her elder sister, her maternal grandfather, sports coaches and a male psychologist. M. concluded that there had been a positive development in A. over the three years that had passed since her first examination: the fears had disappeared, the anxiety had eased, she displayed optimism and emotional stability. A phobic reaction to men, which had previously been observed, had also disappeared. M. stated that, in his view, it was necessary to take into account A.'s opinion concerning the choice of parent so as not to cause repeated psychological trauma.",

The values and behavioural motives of the applicant and Ms B. differed significantly. The applicant typically had formal relationships with people devoid of pronounced emotional involvement, which were based on certain rules, worked out in the course of his life. His approach to parenting was based on control, implying significant restrictions to the child's conduct. The applicant did not recognise his daughter's right to her own interests and independent choice.

Her own values and opinions were being developed in the course of communication within the family. Furthermore, it is typical for children to copy the conduct of other persons, primarily the parent of the same sex. Therefore, it might be asserted that A.'s perspective of the issue was nearly identical to her mother's.

In the first seven years of a child's life, communication with the mother is more important, irrespective of the child's gender. The child forms an image of the father through the prism of the mother's perception and his/her own communication with him, which A. had been deprived of for the last four years. At the time in question, A. saw the applicant as an incomprehensible stranger, whose actions had subverted her feeling of safety. Her mother and grandmother, in compliance with the court order, had effectively forced A. to communicate with her father, whom she did not love and was afraid of. As a result, A.'s immediate family (mother and grandmother) and relatives (father), instead of being the safety factor, became the danger factor. A.'s negative emotional stress, brought about by the meetings with her father was expressed in affective reactions (shouts, tears, obsessive movements) observed after the meetings. The increase of the duration of the meetings, especially in the mother's absence, would entail the risk of the child's persistent neurosis or depression, due to the impossibility of avoiding the subjectively distressing situation. The extreme manifestation of such a condition is self-aggression (suicidal tendencies, thoughts and actions).",

Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned. It follows from these considerations that the Court's task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities regarding custody and access issues, but rather to review, in the light of the Convention, the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see Hokkanen v.\u00a0Finland, judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, p. 20, \u00a7\u00a055, and Kutzner v.

However, a stricter scrutiny is called for as regards any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by those authorities on parental rights of access, and as regards any legal safeguards designed to secure the effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between a young child and one or both parents would be effectively curtailed (see Sahin v.

The reports pertaining to the period from 1998 to 2001 showed that, while in 1998 A. had displayed increased anxiety and a wide range of fears, in the course of the subsequent period, during which she had had no contact with the applicant, she displayed optimism and emotional stability. At the same time, she continued to reject her father. Upon the resumption of contact with the applicant in 2002, pursuant to the court order, A. was referred to a psychologist. The psychologist stated that after the meetings with the applicant the girl had been highly agitated, irritable and suffered from nightmares. The same psychologist examined the applicant and stated that he had had no genuine parental interest in or affection for his daughter and that his perception of A. was \u201cinadequate\u201d. Furthermore, according to the report of the expert examination of A., ordered by the court, the applicant sought to see his daughter only to boost his self-esteem and not to establish a genuine relationship with her. The same report stated that further compulsory contact between the applicant and A. could have irretrievable adverse effects on the latter's health and psychological well-being as the girl was afraid of her father and did not love him. The expert feared that spending more time with the applicant in the absence of her mother could entail A.'s persistent neurosis or depression. The local custody and guardianship office also submitted that all meetings between the applicant and A. should be discontinued having regard to the latter's interests. Finally, the courts took into account A.'s statement before the District Court to the effect that she did not like her father and did not wish to see him or talk to him.",

The applicant then requested his second representative to leave the courtroom and requested the judge to appoint counsel for him. His request was refused. Firstly, there is no indication that the order to the applicant's first representative to leave the courtroom was arbitrary. Secondly, in the present circumstances the Court does not find that the domestic courts were under an obligation to provide the applicant with legal assistance. The complaint concerning the alleged bias of the judge is unsubstantiated. Accordingly, there is no indication of unfairness within the meaning of Article\u00a06 of the Convention.",
