It reasoned that Article 263 of the CCP provided for three time-limits: the first running from the date of an accused\u2019s arrest to the date the file is transferred to the first-instance court (Article 263 \u00a7 1 of the CCP); the second running from then to the date of delivery of the decision by that court (Article\u00a0263\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the CCP); and the third running from then to the date of delivery of the appellate court\u2019s decision (Article 263 \u00a7 3 of the CCP). According to the Supreme Court, in the applicant\u2019s case, the first time-limit ended on 13\u00a0March 2009 when the case was sent to the Supreme Court (Article 263 \u00a7 1 of the CCP). On that date, the second time-limit before the first-instance court began to run (Article 263 \u00a7 2 of the CCP), since the Supreme Court was hearing the case as a first-instance court, one of the co-accused being an MP and a Cabinet Minister. Even though the proceedings against the MP were disjoined from those against the applicant and other co-accused, the period between 13 March 2009 and 11 June 2009, the date on which the case file against the applicant was registered with the District Court, should be taken into account for the purposes of the time-limit prescribed by Article 263 \u00a7 2 of the CCP. The Supreme Court indicated that the time-limit set out in Article 265 of the CPP should be deducted from the running of the time-limit prescribed by Article 263, if the stay was attributed, inter alia, to one of the co-accused or his lawyer. For the above reasons, the Supreme Court remitted the case for re-hearing by a different bench.",

The Court observes that the District Court gave no reasons for its decision to place the applicant under house arrest.

By lodging appeals, the applicant was aware that the consideration of his case by the higher courts required some time. On appeal, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court could not examine the merits of the applicant\u2019s request for release. They examined the case on the basis of the documents considered by the District Court and could not assess whether the time-limits had expired following the District Court\u2019s decision. The case was complex in that it was directed against 29 co-accused and many procedural actions were taken to ensure the conduct of the proceedings within a reasonable time. These factors contributed to the length of the proceedings.",

This was not the position in the present case, though, since Article 131 (f) of the Albanian Constitution limited the remedy made available to complaints of violation of the right to a fair trial and did not at all, on its face, extend to complaints concerning deprivation of liberty (the right to liberty). Hence the Albanian Government needed to adduce evidence of the effectiveness of the remedy relied on in relation to the specific grievance raised by the applicant (deprivation of liberty); and their failure to do so entailed the conclusion that they had not made out the existence of an available remedy capable of addressing the applicant\u2019s complaint.",

I am aware that there is some support in the Court\u2019s case-law for such reasoning, but that does not make it any less flawed. If an available domestic remedy is capable of providing the same redress for unjustified deprivation of liberty (a finding of unlawfulness and an award of compensation) as the necessarily after-the-event application to this Court, that perfectly adequate domestic remedy should be exhausted. Otherwise, the principle of subsidiarity is simply being ignored. And for what reason?",

Article 5 provides for several different rights relating to deprivation of liberty in addition to the right stated in paragraph 1. If the national law does not adequately embody, as required by paragraph 5 of Article 5, an enforceable right to receive compensation for unlawful detention, a separate complaint can be made to this Court and separate just satisfaction can be obtained under that head. However, if there does exist under domestic law an enforceable right to compensation for unlawful detention contrary to paragraph 1, then there is an effective domestic remedy that must first be exhausted by an applicant.",

Any failure by the domestic legal system to secure the right to have the lawfulness of a deprivation of liberty examined by a court can be the subject of a separate complaint under the Convention. Paragraph 61 of the judgment would here appear to be confusing the issue of ex-post-facto exhaustion of domestic remedies for unlawful detention with the quite separate obligations imposed on the Contracting States by Article 5 (notably under its paragraphs 3 and 4) to provide certain kinds of contemporaneous, preventive remedies relating to deprivation of liberty. I fail to see how, logically, this provision by Article 5 of a range of differing procedural rights can have any incidence on the obligation incumbent on an applicant to exercise an effective, after-the-event domestic remedy for unlawful detention \u2013 in so far as the respondent Government concerned have succeeded in demonstrating the availability of such a remedy, which, according to paragraph 62 of the judgment, they did not do in the present case.",
