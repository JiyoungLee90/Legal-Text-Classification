Accordingly, States must not only safeguard the right to assemble peacefully, but must also refrain from applying unreasonable indirect restrictions upon that right. In view of the essential nature of freedom of assembly and its close relationship with democracy there must be convincing and compelling reasons to justify an interference with this right (see Ouranio Toxo v. Greece, no. 74989/01, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2005X (extracts), and Adal\u0131 v. Turkey, no. 38187/97, \u00a7 267, 31 March 2005, with further references).",

The domestic authorities also held that the police had not applied any force against any of the participants in the assemblies, let alone the women.\u00a0Furthermore, they concluded that the applicants had been removed by the police from the venue of the demonstrations in question for violating public order and not complying with the police order to disperse. In this connection, the Court reiterates that demonstrators, as actors in the democratic process, should respect the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2006XIV). However, the Court observes that the case file does not contain any information to indicate that the applicants acted in a violent manner, contrary to the allegations made by the Government.
