The list of exceptions set out in the aforementioned provision is an exhaustive one, and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty (see Khayredinov v. Ukraine, no. 38717/04, \u00a7 26, 14 October 2010, with further references). No detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1, the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in this context extending beyond a lack of conformity with national law. As a consequence, a deprivation of liberty which is lawful under domestic law can still be arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention, in particular where there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see Mooren, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 72, 77 and 78, with further references) or where such deprivation of liberty was not necessary in the circumstances (see Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v. Slovakia, no. 65559/01, \u00a7 74, 27 February 2007). The Court reiterates that when the maximum period of detention is absolute, laid down by the law, and thus known in advance, the authorities responsible for the detention are under a duty to take all necessary precautions to ensure that the permitted duration is not exceeded (see K.-F. v. Germany, 27 November 1997, \u00a7 72, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VII).",

In the present case, the applicant claimed that he had been deprived of his liberty for more than the said period before the court had ordered his detention. Neither the domestic authorities within the criminal proceedings against the applicant, nor the Government in the proceedings before this Court, denied that the applicant had been held in detention for more than seventy-two hours without a judicial decision. The domestic courts merely replied to the applicant\u2019s complaints by saying that they did not discern any violation in this respect, without giving any details. For the Court, however, it is clear that this guarantee against arbitrariness of detention, enshrined in the Constitution, was not respected in the present case, and the authorities made no attempt to acknowledge this breach or to provide any explanation as to the reason for it. In this respect, the Court considers that the case-law quoted by the Government shall not be understood as requiring no justification whatsoever for a period of less than four days between the applicant\u2019s arrest and his appearance before the judge. The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that the applicant\u2019s detention outside the seventy-two-hour period without a court decision rendered such detention both arbitrary and unlawful. Furthermore, it considers that by failing to bring the applicant before the judiciary within the time-limit envisaged by the domestic law, and also by failing to provide any justification for the delay, the domestic authorities fell short of the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3.",
