In sum, the Old Town Evangelical Church considered that the sixmonth time-limit should be calculated from the date when the tenants had actually moved out of the flat, 25\u00a0February\u00a02015, and that accordingly its application to the Court of 13\u00a0July 2015 was in time.",

The Court observes that in reply to that argument the Old Town Evangelical Church submitted that the occupants had remained in the flat, paying no more than the equivalent of regulated rent and disrespecting the expiry of the notice period. The Court fails to see how the Old Town Evangelical Church\u2019s counter-argument should serve to rebut that of the Government. To the contrary, the Old Town Evangelical Church\u2019s course of action appears rather to support it, in particular in as far as the Old Town Evangelical Church sought an eviction order before the courts. There is nothing to\u00a0suggest that it was prevented from complementing that action by a claim for damages.
