This approach was found to satisfy Convention standards, provided that the applicant has been properly informed about his/her procedural rights at the time when the lawyer\u2019s refusal was communicated to him or her (see Kulikowski v. Poland, no.\u00a018353/03, \u00a7 69-71, ECHR 2009-... (extracts), and Antonicelli v. Poland, no.\u00a02815/05, \u00a7 44-45, 19 May 2009).",

Thus, service on the party of notification that a legal-aid lawyer has refused to prepare an appeal does not trigger the running of the time-limit de novo. That approach was regarded by the Court as incompatible with Convention standards, save for situations where the refusal of the legal-aid lawyer to prepare an appeal has been notified to the applicant well before the time-limit was due to expire (see Smyk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63-65).",

He explained why an appeal would not have offered reasonable prospects of success. The Court further observes that the second-instance judgment was served on the applicant\u2019s legal-aid lawyer between 12 and 24 February 2007. At the material time, under the applicable provisions of the Code of Civil procedure, the sixty-day time-limit started to run on the date of service of the appellate court judgment on the lawyer. The lawyer informed the applicant that he was refusing to prepare an appeal in a written legal opinion dated 25 February 2007. On that date, the time-limit for lodging the appeal was to expire in, at the earliest, six weeks. It cannot therefore be said that the applicant was left with so little time to have an appeal prepared in his case as to be deprived of a realistic opportunity to have his case brought to, and argued before, the appeal court (compare and contrast with Sia\u0142kowska, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 11-155, where the applicant had only three days left).",
