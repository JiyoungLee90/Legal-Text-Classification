Mr Yunus Askharov was asked questions about the Chechen fighters and their bases. At some point he heard his brother answering about himself that he was 46\u00a0years old and a truck driver. He therefore concluded that his brother was still with them.

Moreover, the Government have not demonstrated that the remedy indicated by them would have been capable of providing redress in the applicant\u2019s situation, namely that it would have led to the release of Mr Sharani Askharov and the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Musayeva and Others v.

The applicant also referred to the fact that several other residents had been apprehended on that date and submitted statements by two of them who had subsequently been released. They confirmed that they had been out in an APC together with Mr Sharani Askharov and then interrogated in relation to Chechen rebel fighters. In her applications to the authorities the applicant consistently maintained that her husband had been detained by unknown servicemen and requested the investigators to look into that possibility.",

Furthermore, the investigation has been resumed by the prosecuting authorities themselves a number of times due to the need to take additional investigative measures. However, they still failed to investigate the applicant\u2019s allegations properly.
