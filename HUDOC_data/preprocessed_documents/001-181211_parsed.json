The claimant (V.L.) had to prove that the first three circumstances had existed, whereas the defendants (the applicant and her brothers) had to prove that the fourth circumstance had not (see paragraph 34 below).",

As for the fourth statement (see paragraph 5 above), it considered that allegations of ejecting the pharmacy owners onto the streets and suing them for a wooden bench \u2013 an item of movable property of low value \u2013 had created the impression of V.L.-\u017d. as someone with low moral standards and a lack of respect for others, and that that statement had therefore been insulting as well, not only to V.L.-\u017d. himself, but also to his family.",

On the one hand, the victim could ask the court to order the author of the work to retract the disputed statements, which would be a personal obligation on the part of the author which could not be transferred to his or her heirs. On the other hand, the victim could ask the court to declare that the disputed statements were erroneous and defamatory (insulting to the victim\u2019s honour and dignity), in other words to request an objective assessment of those statements. Such an assessment could be made without the involvement of the author and would thus not constitute a personal obligation on the part of the author. Accordingly, the court held that, since V.L. had made the latter request (see paragraph 15 above), domestic law permitted the transfer of civil liability to the author\u2019s heirs.",

In the court\u2019s view, the average reader, even when reading the disputed statements as part of the entire book and not \u201cout of context\u201d (see paragraph 13 above), would perceive them as statements of fact and not as value judgments.",

It observed that, in line with the case-law of the domestic courts, dissemination of factually inaccurate statements about a public figure did not attract civil liability when such statements concerned that person\u2019s public activities and when their author had acted in good faith, seeking to inform society about such activities (see paragraph 35 below). Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal stated that this could not justify dissemination of falsehoods which were insulting to a person\u2019s honour and dignity, even when they concerned a public figure. It held that, in the case at hand, the first-instance court had thoroughly examined the evidence collected during the criminal proceedings and the sources indicated by the author himself (see paragraph\u00a020 above), and had reached the conclusion that, on the balance of probabilities, the events described in the disputed statements \u201cwere more likely not to have happened than to have happened\u201d. The Court of Appeal also examined additional sources referred to in the defendants\u2019 appeal, but found that they did not contain any information which would enable it to reach a different conclusion than that reached by the firstinstance court. It therefore held that the factual accuracy of the disputed statements had not been proved. The Court of Appeal also upheld the firstinstance court\u2019s conclusion that those statements had been insulting to the honour and dignity of V.L.-\u017d. and V.L. (see paragraph 21 above).",

Although in her submissions before the Court the applicant argued that she had never agreed to inherit any rights related to the book, the Court observes that the domestic law did not allow heirs to accept an inheritance in part only (see paragraphs 39 and 43 above), and the applicant did not provide any evidence that that rule had not been applied in her case, nor did she raise that argument in the domestic proceedings (see paragraphs\u00a017,\u00a024 and\u00a029 above). The Court therefore concludes that the applicant had accepted her late father\u2019s inheritance, including certain rights to the book and, as a result, she stood to receive pecuniary gain from its continued dissemination. Accordingly, the domestic courts\u2019 decision to replace the deceased initial defendant with the applicant (and her brothers, who were in the same situation) cannot be regarded as arbitrary or unjust.",

That assessment was not dependent on any findings made against the applicant\u2019s father before his death, and she was able to dispute all the aspects of the case (see, a\u00a0contrario and under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Vulakh and Others, cited above, \u00a7 49; see also Lagard\u00e8re v.

In this connection, the Court notes that Article 10 of the Convention includes not only the freedom to hold opinions but also the freedom to impart information and ideas, and it has been applied numerous times in cases concerning interference with the rights of publishers who were not themselves the authors of the impugned publications (see, among many other authorities, Axel Springer\u00a0AG v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, \u00a7\u00a075, 7\u00a0February 2012; Novaya Gazeta and Borodyanskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a014087/08, \u00a7\u00a031, 28\u00a0March 2013; and Satakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v.\u00a0Finland [GC], no.\u00a0931/13, \u00a7\u00a7 139-40, ECHR 2017 (extracts)). In the present case, the Supreme Court stated that, in their quality of legal successors of the author of the book, the applicant and her brothers had the obligation to ensure that the disputed statements, which were held to be erroneous and defamatory, would no longer be disseminated (see paragraph\u00a031 above). In the Court\u2019s view, this amounted to a limitation to the applicant\u2019s right to reprint the book. Accordingly, the Court finds that the domestic proceedings directly affected the applicant\u2019s right to impart information and ideas under Article\u00a010, and that she must be considered a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. The Government\u2019s objection of lack of victim status should therefore be dismissed.",
