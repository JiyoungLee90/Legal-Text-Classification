The list of procedural guarantees in Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention shows that the intention was to enshrine rights of the citizen and duties of the State which ensure a fair trial. This obviously means that the accused (or person charged) should be able to call for the assistance of an interpreter if he does not understand or speak the language used in court and that such assistance should be in no way dependent on the question of costs. But it certainly does not mean that even a convicted person may not have the costs of interpretation awarded against him. A fair trial is guaranteed in this respect insofar as the accused must be assisted by the interpreter he needs. The question whether he may later be required to bear the costs is not of the same order as the problem of guaranteeing human rights and fundamental freedoms but, both in theoretical and practical terms, is of lesser moment. It cannot be assumed that the Convention is intended to provide a piecemeal solution of the question of costs in criminal proceedings. Nor does the consideration that a foreigner should not receive worse treatment in the matter of costs than a national, dictate the conclusion that permanent exemption from costs is necessarily implied by the object of the Convention ...

In point of fact, the waiver of recovery of the sums due by Mr. Ko\u00e7 is not prompted by reasons deriving from Article 6 para. 3 (e) (art. 6-3-e) of the Convention; the waiver results simply from the practical difficulties and cost of recovery, as well as from consideration of the applicant\u2019s family and financial situation.

The Government do not, by their above-mentioned declaration, admit that the German law and its application to Mr. Ko\u00e7 contravene Article 6 para. 3 (e) (art. 6-3-e). On the contrary, they maintain that the law and its application comply with the Convention.

The Government submitted that what are involved are certain minimum rights which - in specifying the content of the right to a fair trial as enshrined in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) - are granted only to an accused (\"everyone charged with a criminal offence\", \"tout accus\u00e9\"). The Government likewise place reliance on the presumption of innocence, which is enunciated in Article 6 para. 2 (art. 6-2) and which is rebutted on the final and binding conviction of the accused. Their reasoning is that the various guarantees of a fair trial, because they are intended to enable the accused to preserve the presumption of innocence, lapse at the same time as that presumption.

Nonetheless, it does not thereby follow, as far as sub-paragraph (e) is concerned, that the accused person may be required to pay the interpretation costs once he has been convicted. To read Article 6 para. 3 (e) (art. 6-3-e) as allowing the domestic courts to make a convicted person bear these costs would amount to limiting in time the benefit of the Article and in practice, as was rightly emphasised by the Delegates of the Commission, to denying that benefit to any accused person who is eventually convicted. Such an interpretation would deprive Article 6 para. 3 (e) (art. 6-3-e) of much of its effect, for it would leave in existence the disadvantages that an accused who does not understand or speak the language used in court suffers as compared with an accused who is familiar with that language - these being the disadvantages that Article 6 para. 3 (e) (art. 6-3-e) is specifically designed to attenuate.",

Making such an appointment admittedly eliminates in principle the serious drawbacks that would arise were an accused to defend himself in person in a language he did not master or fully master rather than incurring additional costs. Nevertheless, as was pointed out by the Delegates of the Commission, the risk remains that in some borderline cases the appointment or not of an interpreter might depend on the attitude taken by the accused, which might in turn be influenced by the fear of financial consequences.",

However, Mr. Ko\u00e7\u2019s legal interest to continue the proceedings before the Court subsists since there may be consequences which that declaration has not eliminated and which would give rise to an award of just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention. This ground for retaining the case on the list is also stressed by the Chamber (at the end of the second sub-paragraph of paragraph 36) but its main reason is that the declaration would not remove the applicant\u2019s legal interest to have established the incompatibility with the Convention of the Cologne Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment ordering him to pay the interpretation costs. In fact, the Government maintain that the German law and its application by the German courts to Mr. Ko\u00e7 comply with the Convention. As the judgment notes, the declaration is not prompted by reasons deriving from Article 6 para. 3 (e) (art. 6-3-e) of the Convention.",

In my opinion, it then follows from the wording of sub-paragraph (c) (art. 6-3-c) that the accused, subsequent to his conviction, must be exempted from having to pay for the legal assistance granted to him, at least for such time as he has not sufficient means to pay for it. If a higher court or authority finds on appeal that legal assistance was not in fact required in the interests of justice, the individual concerned should not be obliged to pay for such assistance, even if he acquires sufficient means.",
