The Regional Prosecutor principally referred therein to numerous case files of adoption proceedings in which the applicant had acted as a representative of foreigners who had sought to adopt children. The prosecutor also had regard to testimony given by numerous witnesses. It was established that in many cases the prospective adoptive parents had given the applicant a power of attorney a long time before adoption proceedings had been instituted, or even before a child was born. The biological parents had had full parental rights and had given their consent to adoption exclusively by foreigners. The applicant, knowing their financial situation, which was usually difficult, had been inciting them to give their children for adoption in exchange for financial reward. It had been either the applicant himself or other persons assisting him who had later been taking new-born children from hospital and placing them with third parties. The biological parents had not had any further contact with the children and had not participated in caring for them. However, they had remained in permanent contact with the applicant. Subsequently, at court hearings in the adoption proceedings, they had been waiving their parental rights and assenting to adoption. The prosecutor further considered that there was also a strong suspicion, supported by the evidence gathered in the investigations, that the applicant had been inciting the biological parents to give false evidence in the proceedings, in particular as regards the circumstances in which they had met the adoptive parents. On most occasions they had testified that they had met the would-be adoptive parents through common friends. Moreover, the applicant had exerted undue pressure on policemen taking certain measures in the proceedings against him. The prosecutor further noted that the applicant had received remuneration for his services which in certain cases was inordinately high. The prosecutor concluded that the circumstances of the case as a whole justified a suspicion that the applicant had been involved in the crime of trading in children within the meaning of Article IX of the transitional provisions of the Criminal Code and that he had committed the offence of incitement to give false testimony.",

It first acknowledged that the case was without precedent and raised difficult questions of fact and law. The court stated that in examining the decision under appeal, it had limited itself to assessing, from the point of view of provisions governing ordering and maintenance of detention on remand, in particular Article 209 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence gathered against the applicant for ordering detention on remand. However, it stressed that it had refrained from examining closely the substantive-law issues involved in the case. The court further categorically observed that the evidence gathered so far did not justify a suspicion that the applicant had tried to exert undue pressure on policemen involved in the proceedings. However, the evidence in the case file did support a reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence punishable under Article IX \u00a7 2 of the transitional provisions of the Criminal Code, which covered abduction of and trading in children for any purpose and in any form, including, in the court's opinion, situations in which offenders were motivated solely by profit. The court further considered that this provision should be interpreted in the light of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which had been ratified by  in 1991. The court disagreed with the applicant's argument that he had been acting exclusively in his capacity as a lawyer, having regard to the fact that it transpired from the evidence that in his activities undertaken in connection with the adoption cases he had largely overstepped the limits of what would normally be expected from a lawyer in such cases. In particular, the applicant had been acting as a representative before the courts, but had also been actively seeking children for adoption. He had also been taking de facto and legal steps in order to create artificial situations, which would comply with the requirements of laws governing adoption. The court further agreed with the prosecutor's conclusion that in many cases the applicant's remuneration was improperly high, which seemed to contravene Article 21 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. This, in the court's view, indicated that the applicant had been motivated solely by profit. ",

Firstly, the voluminous evidence showed that the suspicions against the applicant were well-founded. Secondly, the complexity of the case and the need to take further timeconsuming measures, such as questioning further witnesses and examining numerous documents, argued in favour of the applicant's continued detention in order to safeguard the proper conduct of the proceedings. The court finally considered that there was a risk that the applicant's release would jeopardise the proceedings, having regard in particular to the nature of the charges against him which had included fabricating false evidence for the purposes of adoption proceedings in order to mislead the courts.",

The court stated that the acts with which the applicant had been charged could not reasonably be qualified as trading in children within the meaning of Article\u00a0IX of the transitional provisions of the Criminal Code. This was so because, in the assessment of what could constitute an offence of \u201ctrading in children\u201d, regard had necessarily to be had to the fact that adoption was in a child's best interests, whereas the notion of trading in human beings inherently involved acts to the detriment of its victims. Whereas it was true, the court continued, that adoption did, to a certain extent, limit the liberty of the person to be adopted, its purpose was to improve the child's living conditions and to enhance its prospects of well-being. Therefore, the adoption in itself had to be perceived as beneficial for the child. In the case under examination, it had not been established by the investigating authorities that the acts with which the applicant had been charged had caused any harm to any children or to other persons. The court attached particular importance to the fact that Article IX of the transitional provisions of the Criminal Code, which penalised trading in human beings, was to be replaced, following a proposal of a committee charged with drafting a new code, by a separate offence of organising adoptions for commercial purposes. This indicated, the court emphasised, that it was impossible to charge the applicant with the offence laid down by Article IX of the transitional provisions, as the offence of trading in human beings was considered by a unanimous opinion of eminent legal scholars, members of the drafting committee, to constitute an offence separate from that of organising adoptions for commercial purposes. The court concluded that the fact that the applicant had acted as a lawyer in many adoption proceedings, and had received fees for doing so, was of itself not sufficient to found a reasonable suspicion that an offence punishable under Article IX had been committed. The applicant was released on the same day.",

As a result, approximately one thousand children had left the country for good. This data should be considered as disturbing, the more so as it had been mainly small children that had been adopted. Public opinion was alarmed by the growing numbers of foreign adoptions. It was true that Polish law laid down the same requirements for adoptions, regardless of the nationality of the future adoptive parents, and that the children's welfare was a consideration of paramount importance for all adoption cases. However, the notion of a child's welfare should also include protection of its national identity. Hence, foreign adoptions should take place only in exceptional cases and the courts should first examine whether the child could not find adoptive parents in . The presidents of the courts were invited to consider whether in cases in which the same persons were repeatedly acting as intermediaries in connection with the adoption proceedings, it was not advisable to inform the prosecution authorities accordingly. The presidents were finally requested to supervise closely this category of cases and to take measures in order to eliminate the climate favouring foreign adoptions. ",

It was emphasised that in view of the historical background to this provision, dating back to international treaties of 1910 concluded for the purposes of combating international networks deriving profits from prostitution, it could not be applied to situations concerning adoptions of children in which no allegations were made of there being any links or intentions related to organising prostitution.",

The court considered that this qualification could not be upheld. There were no grounds for accepting that the notion of \u201ctrading in children\u201d also included the acts in question, which could only be regarded as organising illicit adoptions. It was only under the new Criminal Code, in force from 1 September 1998, that organising illicit adoptions had become a criminal offence.

The court recalled that the accused had been indicted with trading in children on the basis that they had, with a view to profit, visited hospitals, orphanages and hostels for single mothers, trying to persuade the biological parents to place their children for adoption, in certain cases for money. Their actions had further been described as taking children away from their biological parents and taking further care of them, followed by taking steps to institute adoption proceedings. The accused had allegedly also arranged transfers of children to foreign citizens and made payments to the biological parents. The court considered that these acts could be qualified neither as trading in children within the meaning of the repealed Article IX of the transitional provisions of the old Code, nor as trading in human beings within the meaning of Article 253 \u00a7 1 of the new Criminal Code. Such acts could only be construed, regard being had to their nature, as organising foreign adoptions, in certain cases for commercial motives. As a result, these acts at the time of their commission, that is, from 1990 to 1993, had not constituted criminal offences, given that it was only under the 1997 Criminal Code, which had entered into force on 1 September 1998, that they could have been qualified as falling within the ambit of Article 253 \u00a7 2 of that Code, penalising the organisation of adoptions for commercial motives. Consequently, the proceedings should have been discontinued on the ground that the acts concerned had not coincided with the constituent elements of the offence of trading in children as defined by the Polish law at the material time, and not on the ground that the charges against the accused had not been made out.",

It transpired from the written grounds of the decision to bring charges against the applicant that he had actively sought children for adoption, by looking for parents or mothers and, knowing their difficult financial situation, inciting them to give their children away against financial reward. The applicant had been undertaking all necessary factual and legal measures in order to organise lawful transfers of babies abroad. In particular, he had been acting as a representative of adoptive parents in adoption proceedings before Polish courts. The evidence gathered by the prosecuting authorities had shown that the applicant, by inciting biological parents to give false evidence in the adoption proceedings, had intended to mislead the courts as to the circumstances which had led them to waive their parental rights.",

Moreover, on the basis of this testimony given by the applicant's clients, on 18 May 2000 the Cracow Regional Prosecutor had brought new, broader charges against the applicant. In the opinion of the Government, the circumstances known to the prosecuting authorities in September 1994 and relied on in the detention order of 20 September 1994 justified a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence of trading in children, which suspicion constituted a condition for ordering detention on remand, set forth in Article 209 of the 1969 Code of Criminal Procedure.

They stressed that the literal interpretation of this provision, in particular of its paragraph 2, must lead to a conclusion that it did not require that trading in children be undertaken to the detriment of victims of such trade. Such a prerequisite was expressly spelt out only in paragraph 1 of this provision, which provided for a criminal sanction against persons involved in delivering, enticing or abducting other persons for prostitution purposes. The Government relied in this respect on the decision of the Supreme Court of 29 November 1995 in which the court had stated that an intention on the part of the perpetrator to coerce a victim of the offence into practising prostitution was not a constituent element of the offence. Thus, an intention to act to the detriment of a victim was not a prerequisite for the existence of the offence of trading in children. ",

A person may be detained under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) only in the context of criminal proceedings, for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on suspicion of his having committed an offence (see J\u0117\u010dius v.

A \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d, referred to in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention, that a criminal offence has been committed presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed an offence. As a rule, problems in this area arise at the level of the facts. The question then is whether the arrest and detention were based on sufficient objective elements to justify a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that the facts at issue had actually occurred (see the Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, pp. 16-18, \u00a7\u00a7 32-34, and the Murray v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300-A, pp. 24-29, \u00a7\u00a7 50-63).",

The Court notes that until the material time this provision had never been applied by the Polish courts, either in the context of a pre-trial detention or in any proceedings on the merits of a criminal charge. Thus, this provision was then subject to serious difficulties of interpretation as regards the constituent elements of this offence.
