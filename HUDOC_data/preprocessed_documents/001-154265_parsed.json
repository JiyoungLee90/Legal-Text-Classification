Judge M. was criticised for not devoting the necessary care and attention to the case file, leaving it practically untouched for five years; for having recourse to a friendly-settlement procedure which went beyond the jurisdiction of an investigating judge; and for not making copies of all the documents in the case file, thus making it impossible to reconstruct the file after its partial disappearance from her chambers. Judge M. requested that the referral to the CSM be declared null and void, particularly on account of the fact that it had been made public by the director of the Minister\u2019s private office at a press conference, even before she had been personally notified of the decision. In parallel, on 18 October 2000, the Indictments Division of the Paris Court of Appeal upheld a request by the applicant for the withdrawal of the \u201cScientology\u201d case from Judge M.",

It further found that the applicant\u2019s comments concerning the delay in forwarding the video-cassette amounted to accusing the judges of negligence in the handling of the case, thereby discrediting the professional competence of the judges and implying that the latter had deliberately kept hold of the cassette after the case was withdrawn from them, with the intention, at least, of causing obstruction. Allegedly, it was only because the lawyers had raised the matter with Judge P., followed by that judge\u2019s request to Judge\u00a0M., that the item of evidence had finally been obtained on 1\u00a0August 2000. The Court of Appeal added that such assertions, attributing to those judges a deliberate failure to perform the duties inherent in their office and a lack of integrity in the fulfilment of their obligations, constituted factual accusations which impugned their honour and reputation. It found this to be all the more true as the applicant, referring to the handwritten card from the public prosecutor of Djibouti to Judge M., had emphasised this atmosphere of suspicion and the negligent conduct of the judges by stating that this document proved the extent of the \u201cconnivance\u201d between them. The court noted, on that point, that the word \u201cconnivance\u201d represented in itself a serious attack on the honour and reputation of Judge M. and the public prosecutor of Djibouti. It merely served to confirm the defamatory nature of the previous comments, especially as the article added that the applicant had asked the Minister of Justice for an inspection by the General Inspectorate of Judicial Services.",

As his second ground of appeal, he relied on Article 10 of the Convention, asserting that: the impugned comments concerned a case that had been receiving media coverage for some time, involving the suspicious circumstances in which a French judge seconded to Djibouti had been found dead \u201cfrom suicide\u201d and the questionable manner in which the judicial investigation had been conducted, with a clear bias against the civil party\u2019s theory of premeditated murder; having regard to the importance of the subject of general interest in the context of which the comments had been made, the Court of Appeal was not entitled to find that he had overstepped the bounds of his freedom of expression; the Court of Appeal had not examined his good faith in the light of the comments that had been published in Le Monde, but in relation to the content of the letter to the Minister of Justice and it was not entitled to make any assessment concerning the judges\u2019 conduct criticised therein; unless all lawyers were to be banned from speaking about pending cases, no personal animosity could be inferred from the mere fact that he had had a disagreement with one of the judges in the context of another set of proceedings; good faith was not subject to the current situation or to the fact that the issue had been \u201cmade good\u201d by the withdrawal of the case from the judges, the lack of necessity of the comments not being incompatible with good faith; lastly, opinions expressed regarding the functioning of a fundamental institution of the State, as was the case regarding the handling of a criminal investigation, were not subject to a duty of prudence or limited to theoretical and abstract criticism, but could be personal where they had a sufficient factual basis.",

Paragraph 6 of the Commentary on the Charter of Core Principles of the European Legal Profession of the CCBE defines the lawyer\u2019s role as follows: \u2018The lawyer\u2019s role, whether retained by an individual, a corporation or the state, is as the client\u2019s trusted adviser and representative, as a professional respected by third parties, and as an indispensable participant in the fair administration of justice. By embodying all these elements, the lawyer, who faithfully serves his or her own client\u2019s interests and protects the client\u2019s rights, also fulfils the functions of the lawyer in Society \u2013 which are to forestall and prevent conflicts, to ensure that conflicts are resolved in accordance with recognised principles of civil, public or criminal law and with due account of rights and interests, to further the development of the law, and to defend liberty, justice and the rule of law\u2019. As it is stated in paragraph 1.1 of the Code of Conduct for European Lawyers of the CCBE, respect for the lawyer\u2019s professional function is an essential condition for the rule of law and democracy in society. The UN Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers state that adequate protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms to which all persons are entitled, be they economic, social and cultural, or civil and political, requires that all persons have effective access to legal services provided by an independent legal profession. Principle 12 stipulates that lawyers shall at all times maintain the honour and dignity of their profession as essential agents of the administration of justice.",

The ICJ observed in particular that, although the subject of the dispute was described in Djibouti\u2019s application as the transmission by the French authorities of the Borrel case file to Djibouti, taken as a whole the application had a wider scope, which included the summonses sent to the Djiboutian President and those sent to two other Djiboutian officials, together with the arrest warrants subsequently issued against the latter.",

It took the view that those reasons fell within the scope of Article 2 (c) of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which allowed a requested State to refuse to execute letters rogatory if it considered that such assistance would be likely to prejudice the sovereignty, the security, the ordre public or other essential interests of the nation. The ICJ further decided not to order the transmission of the Borrel file with certain pages removed, as Djibouti had requested in the alternative. It held, however, that France had failed in its obligation to give reasons for its refusal to execute the letter rogatory, while rejecting Djibouti\u2019s other submissions concerning the summonses addressed to the President and the two other senior Djiboutian officials.",

The personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see Hauschildt v. Denmark, 24 May 1989, \u00a7\u00a047, Series A no. 154). As regards the type of proof required, the Court has, for example, sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or ill will for personal reasons (see De Cubber v.

Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III).",

As the Court has stated on many occasions, Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention does not compel the Contracting States to set up courts of appeal or of cassation, but a State which does institute such courts is required to ensure that persons having access to the law enjoy before such courts the fundamental guarantees in Article 6 (see, among other authorities, Delcourt v.

That statement had been made at the request of the investigating judge under Article 11, paragraph 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure (permitting the public disclosure of details of the case to avoid the dissemination of incomplete or inaccurate information, or to put an end to a breach of public order).

The Paris tribunal de grande instance had accepted his plea of good faith, even though his comments had been particularly excessive and based only on his personal belief, as \u201cthey came from a passionate lawyer who dedicated all of his energy to defending his client and who could not restrict his freedom of expression on the sole ground that he was referring to his case in front of journalists rather than addressing judges\u201d (final judgment of the Seventeenth Division of the Paris tribunal de grande instance of 20\u00a0October 2010).

Accordingly, a high level of protection of freedom of expression, with the authorities thus having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation, will normally be accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest, as is the case, in particular, for remarks on the functioning of the judiciary, even in the context of proceedings that are still pending in respect of the other defendants (see Roland Dumas v.

Austria (no. 1) (23 May 1991, \u00a7\u00a063, Series A no. 204), the Court drew a distinction between statements of fact and value judgments. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24\u00a0February 1997, \u00a7 42, Reports 1997-I). However, where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient \u201cfactual basis\u201d for the impugned statement: if there is not, that value judgment may prove excessive (see De\u00a0Haes and Gijsels, cited above, \u00a7 47; Oberschlick v.

In order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment it is necessary to take account of the circumstances of the case and the general tone of the remarks (see Brasilier, cited above, \u00a7 37), bearing in mind that assertions about matters of public interest may, on that basis, constitute value judgments rather than statements of fact (see Paturel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037).",

As the Court has previously pointed out, interference with freedom of expression may have a chilling effect on the exercise of that freedom. The relatively moderate nature of the fines does not suffice to negate the risk of a chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of expression, this being all the more unacceptable in the case of a lawyer who is required to ensure the effective defence of his clients (see Mor, cited above, \u00a7 61).

Lawyers are thus entitled, in particular, to comment in public on the administration of justice, provided that their criticism does not overstep certain bounds (see Amihalachioaie, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 27-28; Foglia, cited above, \u00a7 86; and Mor, cited above, \u00a7 43). Those bounds lie in the usual restrictions on the conduct of members of the Bar (see Kyprianou, cited above, \u00a7 173), as reflected in the ten basic principles enumerated by the CCBE for European lawyers, with their particular reference to \u201cdignity\u201d, \u201chonour\u201d and \u201cintegrity\u201d and to \u201crespect for ... the fair administration of justice\u201d (see paragraph 58 above).

Lawyers have the duty to \u201cdefend their clients\u2019 interests zealously\u201d (see Nikula, cited above, \u00a7\u00a054), which means that they sometimes have to decide whether or not they should object to or complain of the conduct of the court (see Kyprianou, cited above, \u00a7 175). In addition, the Court takes into consideration the fact that the impugned remarks are not repeated outside the courtroom and it makes a distinction depending on the person concerned; thus, a prosecutor, who is a \u201cparty\u201d to the proceedings, has to \u201ctolerate very considerable criticism by ... defence counsel\u201d, even if some of the terms are inappropriate, provided they do not concern his general professional or other qualities (see Nikula, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52; Foglia, cited above, \u00a7 95; and Roland Dumas, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

The Court takes the view, in this connection, that a lawyer cannot be held responsible for everything published in the form of an \u201cinterview\u201d, in particular where the press has edited the statements and he or she has denied making certain remarks (see Amihalachioaie, cited above, \u00a7 37). In the above-cited Foglia case, it also found that lawyers could not justifiably be held responsible for the actions of the press (see Foglia, cited above, \u00a7 97). Similarly, where a case is widely covered in the media on account of the seriousness of the facts and the individuals likely to be implicated, a lawyer cannot be penalised for breaching the secrecy of the judicial investigation where he or she has merely made personal comments on information which is already known to the journalists and which they intend to report, with or without those comments. Nevertheless, when making public statements, a lawyer is not exempted from his duty of prudence in relation to the secrecy of a pending judicial investigation (see Mor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 55-56).",

His defence of good faith was also rejected. On that point, the Criminal Court and the Court of Appeal took the view, in particular, that the attacks on the professional and moral integrity of Judges M. and L.L. clearly overstepped the right of permissible criticism (see paragraphs 40 and 50 above). In addition, while the Criminal Court took the view that the profound disagreements between Mrs Borrel\u2019s lawyers and the investigating judges could not justify a total lack of prudence in their expression, the Court of Appeal concluded that the decision in the applicant\u2019s favour to discontinue the proceedings brought against him by the two judges did not rule out bad faith on his part. It held that the applicant\u2019s personal animosity and the wish to discredit the judges, in particular Judge M., stemmed from the excessive nature of his comments and from the fact that the article on the Borrel case had been published at the same time as the bringing of proceedings against Judge M. before the Indictment Division in connection with the \u201cScientology\u201d case (ibid.).",

That fact was not only established but it was also sufficiently serious to justify the drafting by Judge P. of a report in which he recorded the following: firstly, the video-cassette did not appear in the investigation file and was not registered as an exhibit; and secondly, it had been given to him in an envelope, which showed no sign of having been placed under seal, bearing the name of Judge\u00a0M. as addressee and also containing a handwritten card with the letter head of the public prosecutor of Djibouti, written by him and addressed to Judge M.

In the present case, the background can be explained not only by the conduct of the investigating judges and by the applicant\u2019s relations with one of them, but also by the very specific history of the case, its inter-State dimension and its substantial media coverage. The Court would observe, however, that the Court of Appeal attributed an extensive scope to the impugned remark of the applicant criticising an investigating judge for \u201cconduct which [was] completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness\u201d, finding that this was in itself a particularly defamatory accusation, tantamount to saying that there had been a breach of professional ethics and of the judicial oath on the part of that judge (see paragraph 47 above). That quotation should, however, have been assessed in the light of the specific circumstances of the case, especially as it was in reality not a statement made to the author of the article, but an extract from the letter sent by the applicant and his colleague, Mr L. de Caunes, to the Minister of Justice on 6 September 2000. In addition, at the time when the applicant answered his questions the journalist had already been informed of the letter to the Minister of Justice, not by the applicant himself, but by his own sources, as the Criminal Court acknowledged (see paragraph 40 above). The applicant further argued, without this being in dispute, that the article\u2019s author was solely responsible for the reference to the disciplinary proceedings against Judge M. in the context of the \u201cScientology\u201d case. In that connection, the Court reiterates that lawyers cannot be held responsible for everything appearing in an \u201cinterview\u201d published by the press or for actions by the press.",

In any event, since the courts acknowledged the existence of conflicts between the two protagonists, and in view of the particular circumstances of the present case, such a reproach of personal animosity could have been made as much to Judge M. as to the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Paturel, cited above, \u00a7 45), especially as before filing a complaint against the applicant for complicity in defamation Judge M. had already unsuccessfully filed a complaint against him for false accusation (see paragraph 35 above). The Court of Appeal\u2019s reliance on the applicant\u2019s personal animosity is also at least undermined, if not contradicted, by other factors. Firstly, the remark concerning \u201cconduct which [was] completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness\u201d was directed not only at Judge M., but also at Judge L.L., in respect of whom the applicant was not accused of showing any personal animosity. Furthermore, while the proceedings against the applicant concerned the above-cited extract from the letter to the Minister of Justice, that letter had in reality been signed and sent by two lawyers, the applicant and his colleague, Mr L. de Caunes. In the case of the latter, however, not only has he not been prosecuted for remarks that were attributable as much to him as to the applicant, he has not been accused of showing any animosity towards Judge M. or Judge L.L.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, that fact is capable of supporting the idea that the remarks were not part of any personal action on the part of the applicant, out of a desire for vengeance, but rather formed part of a joint professional initiative by two lawyers, on account of facts that were new, established and capable of revealing serious shortcomings in the justice system, involving the two judges who had formerly been conducting the investigation in a case in which the two lawyers\u2019 clients were civil parties.",

It is true that the particular task of the judiciary in society requires judges to observe a duty of discretion (see paragraph 128 above). However, that duty pursues a specific aim, as noted by the third-party interveners: the speech of judges, unlike that of lawyers, is received as the expression of an objective assessment which commits not only the person expressing himself, but also, through him, the entire justice system. Lawyers, for their part, merely speak in their own name and on behalf of their clients, thus also distinguishing them from journalists, whose role in the judicial debate and purpose are intrinsically different. Nevertheless, while it may prove necessary to protect the judiciary against gravely damaging attacks that are essentially unfounded, bearing in mind that judges are prevented from reacting by their duty of discretion (see paragraph 128 above), this cannot have the effect of prohibiting individuals from expressing their views, through value judgments with a sufficient factual basis, on matters of public interest related to the functioning of the justice system, or of banning any criticism of the latter. In the present case, Judges\u00a0M. and L.L. were members of the judiciary and were thus both part of a fundamental institution of the State: they were therefore subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than ordinary citizens and the impugned comments could therefore be directed against them in that capacity (see paragraphs 128 and 131 above).",

It first notes that the use of available remedies, on the one hand, and the right to freedom of expression, on the other, do not pursue the same aim and are not interchangeable. That being said, the Court takes the view that the defence of a client by his lawyer must be conducted not in the media, save in very specific circumstances (see paragraph 138 above), but in the courts of competent jurisdiction, and this involves using any available remedies. It notes that in the present case the referral to the Indictments Division of the Paris Court of Appeal patently showed that the initial intention of the applicant and his colleague was to resolve the matter using the available remedies. It was, in reality, only after that remedy had been used that the problem complained of occurred, as recorded by the investigating judge P. in his official report of 1\u00a0August 2000 (see paragraph 32 above). At that stage the Indictments Division was no longer in a position to examine such complaints, precisely because it had withdrawn the case from Judges M. and L.L. The Court further notes that, in any event, four and a half years had already elapsed since the opening of the judicial investigation, which has still not been closed to date. It also observes that the civil parties and their lawyers took an active part in the proceedings and, in particular, that they succeeded, according to the judgment of the Versailles Court of Appeal of 28 May 2009, in having a material witness examined in Belgium in spite of a lack of interest in him on the part of the investigating judges M. and L.L.

The Court notes in this connection that the domestic judges themselves, both at first instance and on appeal, took the view that the letter could not enjoy the immunity afforded to judicial acts, the Criminal Court having found that its content was purely informative (see paragraphs 38 and 46 above). The Court observes that it has not been argued that this request was acted upon and, in addition, it notes that Judges M. and L.L. clearly did not see it as the normal use of a remedy available under domestic law, but as an act justifying the filing of a complaint for false accusation (see paragraph 35 above).",

France, no.\u00a064915/01, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2004-VI; and Mor, cited above, \u00a7 61). In the present case, the Court of Appeal sentenced the applicant to pay a fine of EUR 4,000. This amount corresponds precisely to that fixed by the first-instance court, where the judges had expressly taken into account the applicant\u2019s status as a lawyer to justify their severity and to impose on him \u201ca fine of a sufficiently high amount\u201d (see paragraph 41 above). In addition to ordering the insertion of a notice in the newspaper Le Monde, the court ordered him to pay, jointly with the journalist and the publication director, EUR 7,500 in damages to each of the two judges, together with EUR 4,000 to Judge L.L. in costs. The Court notes, moreover, that the applicant alone was ordered to pay a sum to Judge M. in respect of costs, amounting to EUR 1,000.",

The Court has emphasised on many occasions that interference with freedom of expression may have a chilling effect on the exercise of that freedom (see, mutatis mutandis, Cump\u0103n\u0103 and Maz\u0103re v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, \u00a7\u00a0114, ECHR 2004XI, and Mor, cited above) \u2013 a risk that the relatively moderate nature of a fine would not suffice to negate (see Dupuis and Others v. France, no. 1914/02, \u00a7 48, 7 June 2007). It should also be noted that imposing a sanction on a lawyer may have repercussions that are direct (disciplinary proceedings) or indirect (in terms, for example, of their image or the confidence placed in them by the public and their clients). The Court would, moreover, reiterate that the dominant position of the State institutions requires the authorities to show restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings (see paragraph 127 above). The Court observes, however, that in the present case the applicant\u2019s punishment was not confined to a criminal conviction: the sanction imposed on him was not the \u201clightest possible\u201d, but was, on the contrary, of some significance, and his status as a lawyer was even relied upon to justify greater severity.",

The argument that Judge J.M. was merely one of ten judges in that formation \u201cis not decisive for the objective-impartiality issue under Article 6 \u00a7 1\u201d, it being his \u201cunascertained influence\u201d which is regarded as tainting the impartiality of that court with \u201ca genuine doubt\u201d (see paragraph\u00a089 of the judgment). In this context, the point about impartiality being \u201copen to a genuine doubt\u201d is meant to refer to the objective impartiality of Judge J.M. himself and, by extension, that of the whole bench. The Court is not willing to openly question Judge J.M.\u2019s subjective impartiality; rather it is of the view that the fact that the applicant could have thought that he had some grounds on which to question Judge J.M.\u2019s subjective impartiality had a bearing on the objective impartiality of that judge and of the formation as a whole. Although the Court does not question Judge J.M.\u2019s subjective impartiality explicitly and directly, it does so implicitly and indirectly, because the very hint of that judge\u2019s influence on the outcome of the case suggests that it could also have been such as to determine a conclusion which was unfavourable to the applicant and that, but for that influence, the outcome might have been different.",

Because of this concealment (whatever the reason), the applicant \u201chad no opportunity to challenge [Judge] J.M.\u2019s presence or to make any submissions on the issue of the judicial body\u2019s impartiality in that connection\u201d (see paragraph 90 of the judgment and paragraph 52 referred to therein).",

One could equally speculate on the lack of impartiality of \u2013 as they are routinely called \u2013 \u201cnational\u201d judges of this Court, in cases against the State in respect of which they were elected, because when a case which has been decided by the Chamber is referred to the Grand Chamber under Article 43 of the Convention, such judge finds himself or herself in the situation where he or she has already sat in that case as a member of the Chamber. However, such speculation is rebutted by reference to Article\u00a026\u00a0\u00a7 4 of the Convention, which explicitly requires that the judge elected in respect of the High Contracting Party concerned be an ex officio member of the Grand Chamber.

Even had such a statute been in place, it probably would have been legally reproachable. However \u2013 and not merely in theory \u2013 there can be other reasons (not only of a formal legal but also of a factual nature) which would compel the inclusion of a particular judge in the composition of a bench or, to put it in a somewhat milder way, justify his or her non-exclusion therefrom. In the Court\u2019s case-law, one can find decisions and judgments where the previous involvement of a judge in the same case had not amounted to a violation of the right to a fair trial protected by the Convention. To give just a couple of examples, even the mere fact that a judge had already taken decisions regarding a particular person \u201ccannot in itself be regarded as justifying doubts as to his or her impartiality\u201d (see \u00d6kten v. Turkey (dec.), no. 22347/07, \u00a7 41, 3 November 2011); in an even earlier case the Court had held that \u201cno ground for legitimate suspicion [could] be discerned in the fact that three of the seven members of the disciplinary section had taken part in the first decision\u201d (see Diennet v. France, 26 September 1995, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 325-A). Every case has to be decided on its own merits. In the present case, had the issue of Judge J.M.\u2019s \u201cpartiality\u201d been raised by the applicant in the proper course, such allegation would have been authoritatively dismissed as based on an illegitimate suspicion.

Turkey, no. 36073/04, \u00a7 40, 4 March 2014) or, put otherwise, making his non-exclusion from the composition justified. I personally believe that there were no such grounds whatsoever. On the other hand, there could also hardly have been any weighty grounds to exclude that judge from the composition solely on the basis that he had expressed his support for Judge M. many years before and in an entirely different context. The two situations were unrelated, save for the fact that they involved opposition between the same protagonists, but even this formal connection had been erased, or at least substantially alleviated, by the long time-span between the two events and by the fact that even the applicant himself admitted that Judge J.M. had not displayed any personal bias against him (see paragraph 67 of the present judgment). The presumption of judicial integrity should matter. And if it really does, given all the circumstances of the case, allegations as to Judge J.M.\u2019s \u201cpartiality\u201d should have been dismissed, had they been raised in the domestic proceedings. Moreover, it is not unlikely that the applicant, reasonably enough, would not have raised this issue at all, in view of its apparent groundlessness. What really could and did make him legitimately suspicious was the fact that the composition of the judicial body which decided his case had not been made known to him. The Government failed to give any explanation for this non-disclosure. Could the Government have succeeded in respect of this complaint had they provided such an explanation? I am sure that, in any event, they could not have found a plausible one, for even if there may be compelling reasons (however debatable) of a formal legal or factual nature for the inclusion of a given judge in a particular judicial composition, there simply cannot be any reason whatsoever for not making the names of those on the bench known to the person whose case that judicial body is to decide.
