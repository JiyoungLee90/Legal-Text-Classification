However, the Government asserted that there had been valid reasons for holding the applicant in custody. He had been charged with serious offences, based on sufficient evidence. There was a high risk of his absconding, colluding and tampering with evidence, if he had been released. The applicant had clearly contributed to the prolongation of the investigations in that complex case by reading only a few pages a day of the voluminous case-file. His continued detention was subject to permanent and diligent supervision by the domestic courts. Moreover, at some stage of the proceedings, the courts expressed the willingness to release the applicant on bail, but he had not availed himself of that opportunity. In the Government\u2019s view, the bail bond in the form of a mortgage on real estate, belonging to a friend of the applicant, had not provided sufficient guarantees in view of the fact that it formed part of a joint matrimonial property.",

As regards the bail, which was at first fixed in the amount of PLN 20,000 and then in the amount of PLN 15,000 by the Koszalin Regional Court, it exceeded by nineteen and fourteen times the then average monthly salary in Poland, whereas the applicant was in a very difficult financial position, having been declared bankrupt by a decision of the Koszalin District Court of 11 June 1997.
