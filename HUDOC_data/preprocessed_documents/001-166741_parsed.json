Thirdly, the child, between nine and twelve years old at the time, had been unwilling to spend time with the applicant and had made it clear that he wanted to continue living with the respondent. Fourthly, the respondent himself had, for the most part, been uncooperative.

Sixthly, the domestic courts had imposed fines on several occasions in an attempt to secure the respondent\u2019s compliance. Lastly, the enforcement judge had ordered the physical transfer of custody to the applicant on several occasions, but the applicant, although she had acted with much diligence throughout the proceedings, had ultimately been unable physically to assume custody of the child in the absence of his explicit consent to this effect and the applicant\u2019s consistent refusal of the forcible measures.",

Secondly, the Court notes the constructive approach taken by the domestic courts in deciding to run the two sets of proceedings concurrently in order to facilitate re-establishment of the contact between the applicant and the child which was intended to result in their reunion. This also provided the domestic authorities with additional possibilities, such as in-school counselling of the child, corrective supervision of parental rights, supervised meetings between the applicant and the child and parental therapy, all of which were implemented in a diligent and timely manner. Thirdly, the domestic courts had resorted to fining the respondent on several occasions in an attempt to secure his compliance. Fourthly, while the domestic courts were unable to enforce all the aspects of the access order because of the respondent\u2019s lack of cooperation and the child\u2019s refusal to be alone with the applicant, they gradually re-established the contact between them.

Besides, the economic capabilities\u00a0of the father are not known to the Court. Regardless of this, the fines came very late (I deduce that the sums were paid, at the earliest, during the first half of 2010, whereas the order was supposed to be executed on 8 July 2008). Furthermore, despite the reluctance of the father to voluntarily execute the civil decisions adopted against him, the civil judge did not even consider initiating any criminal proceedings against him.

As the majority find in the judgment, there was a lack of cooperation on the part of the respondent (see paragraphs 56 and 67) \u201cand the applicant\u2019s contact with the child improved only after the threat of the transfer of custody ceased, following the 2011 Agreement on Access Rights and the revision of the 2009 judgment\u201d (see paragraphs 47 and 58). The above observations by the majority show the influence the father had on his child, as well as his passive resistance towards the enforcement of the courts\u2019 orders. The judicial ascertainment of a person\u2019s subjective interest or of the purpose motivating actions or omissions on his part is frequently difficult and it is not the task of this Court to decide on such matters. But the above observations by the majority are well justified, especially having regard to the following facts: (a) the national court granted the applicant custody of the child, considering her the most suitable parent to have custody; (b) the respondent did not encourage the child to have contact with his mother and because of this omission, or passive conduct or inaction, was repeatedly found to be in contempt and was punished by the civil enforcement court; and (c) the child started having contact with his mother only after the father had obtained what he wanted. So, the maxim that facts are sometimes more powerful than words (facta sunt potentiora verbis) may be relevant here, as may the maxim that outward acts or actions sometimes indicate the thoughts and the intention hidden therein (acta exteriora indicant interiora secreta, 8 Coke\u2019s Reports 146). The fact that the applicant lodged her application with the European Court of Human Rights is a clear indication or proof that she signed the above-mentioned agreement not out of her free choice, but only when she realised that all of her requests for enforcement of the access and custody orders in her favour had proved unsuccessful, and that the only way for her to see her child was to sign the said agreement. It may not be irrelevant at all, here, while dealing with how the applicant was feeling when she signed the above-mentioned agreement, to refer to an allegation she made in the statement of facts set out in her application (especially in paragraphs 4-7), to the effect that the respondent was threatening her with physical and mental violence, which led her to live the matrimonial home. Similarly, it is mentioned in the statement of facts in the Court\u2019s decision to communicate the application to the Government (\u00a7\u00a04) that \u201c[t]he applicant allegedly did not dare to take her son with her because of the threats made by the respondent, of which the police had been informed\u201d.

Since no other domestic legal or other measures proved effective, this omission or gap in the Serbian civil legal framework deprived the applicant, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, of a substantive method of securing the enforcement of decisions in her favour, which could have acted as a preventive, repressive or corrective measure or a deterrent to ensure that the father did not intentionally continue failing to prepare the child for reunification with his mother, and, in so doing, continue refusing to abide by the orders of the court. The issue here is not whether or not there is a consensus in the member States as to the penalties required for civil or criminal contempt of court. The issue is the examination of the effectiveness of the Serbian legal system in pursuing the State\u2019s positive obligation in relation to the facts of the case to protect the rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 and Article 8 of the Convention, and it is only in this respect that the efficiency of all the measures taken and the available legal provisions may be relevant.",

Thus, in effect the method provided for in Article 224 was followed, but it did not work, despite the best efforts of the enforcement judge and the Social Care Centre. This can be explained because the father was present during the attempt to hand the child to the mother, and, by his very presence, was in a position to exert a negative psychological influence or pressure on the child.",

Without an arrest warrant or the fear of being imprisoned, there was nothing to deter the respondent from abiding by the court orders, even on 22 December 2008, when, among other people, the enforcement judge, a bailiff, two uniformed policemen and three plain-clothes policemen, all entered the courtyard of his house, expecting that the child would be surrendered (see also paragraph 23 of the judgment). What he did instead was to remain inactive and uncooperative. Two of the four fines imposed on him were at the highest level permissible by the legislature, namely 150,000 Serbian dinars (RSD) (around 1,217 euros), and on the fourth occasion, when a fine was imposed on him in the amount of RSD 100,000, an added condition was made by the Judge that should the respondent fail to surrender the child voluntarily to the applicant within three days from the date of the receipt of the order, he would have to pay a further fine of RSD 150,000. No penalty, however, of such a monetary character, irrespective of the amount involved, deterred the respondent from disobeying the orders.

                        "content": "The non-compliance by the respondent with the court orders began on 8\u00a0July 2008\u201a when the interim access order was issued, and lasted until 20\u00a0June 2012, when custody was given to him, that is, for a period of almost four years. However, the relevant period for the issues under examination lasted until 13 July 2010, when the custody order in favour of the applicant became final. Again, this period of two years without the applicant seeing her child was too long. I consider that this delay and the protraction of proceedings, through no fault on the applicant\u2019s part, was too long and unreasonable, thus impairing her rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1. The enforcement measures taken were bound to be futile, under the circumstances, without the availability of strict deterrent provisions on civil contempt and without any attempt to enforce the fines or to initiate the procedure under Article 224 of the Enforcement Procedure Act. As regards the criminal procedure, it took the first-instance criminal court about four and three years respectively to reach a final decision on 20 June 2012 on the criminal complaints filed by the applicant on 29 August 2008 and 23 June 2009 against the respondent for: (a) parental child abduction, and (b)\u00a0continuous non-compliance with the interim access and custody orders. It is a remarkable coincidence that on the same date the first-instance criminal court acquitted the respondent (20 June 2012), the first-instance civil court granted the respondent custody of the child, following the agreement made by the parties on 23 March 2011 for the revision of the judgment of 24 November 2009, which, after a hearing, had granted the applicant custody. The decision of the Constitutional Court dated 22 July 2010 finding that there had been no delay in the criminal proceedings was given almost two years before the decision of the first-instance criminal court was taken, and thus did not consider this further delay of two years, which, however, cannot be taken into account for the purposes of the present proceedings, since domestic remedies have not been exhausted in relation to this delay. Even without taking into account this further delay of two years, the original two-year delay was in itself lengthy and unreasonable, violating Article 6 \u00a7 1, especially having regard to the nature of the complaints and the interests affected, as well as the fact that the enforcement of the access and custody orders remained unsuccessful, despite the repeated decisions requiring the respondent to pay fines.",

                        "content": "18. Since the access and custody orders were positive (and not declaratory) orders, thus ordering the respondent to surrender the child to the applicant, it should have been the duty of the respondent to find a proper means of preparing the child and of obeying the orders. Though it may have been a defence to show that compliance with the orders was impossible, the burden of proving such impossibility should have been on the respondent and on the respondent State in accordance with the positive obligation it has to fulfil, irrespective of whether the proceedings for contempt were civil or criminal. Any other approach, I believe, would have led to the undesirable results encountered in the present case: (a) making the orders ineffective and letting them be disregarded; (b) damaging the interests of the child to whom the orders related, as well as the relations between mother and child; and (c) endorsing, in effect, the respondent\u2019s above-mentioned unacceptable behaviour in manipulating the child. Here, it should be borne in mind that according to the Court\u2019s case-law, the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other\u2019s company constitutes a fundamental element of \u201cfamily life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 60 of the judgment). No evidence was provided that contact between the child and his mother was impossible because of any inappropriate behaviour by the mother towards the child. On the contrary, the civil court decided on 24\u00a0November 2009 that it was for the benefit of the child to grant custody to the mother\u201a finding her to be the most suitable parent in that respect. In addition, before the separation of the parents, the child did not appear to have had any problem with his mother. This shows that it was not impossible for the child to have contact with his mother, unless, of course, the father did not wish this to happen and influenced the child in this direction or displayed apathy in that regard. The fact that the enforceability of the order was solely or mainly dependent on the will of the respondent does not make the issue objectively impossible or complex, but rather necessitates the imposition of strict sanctions on him. The Government admitted in their observations that the respondent \u201ccertainly contributed to such an attitude of the child to a great extent\u201d (\u00a7 13). Even more importantly, when dealing with the \u201cmeasures available to domestic authorities\u201d, they accepted (see the observations, \u00a7 33) that the passive behaviour of the parent the child was with \u2013 in the present case, the respondent \u2013 \u201cimplies behaviour that may be qualified as disturbance or aggravation or prevention of enforcement ... which should be sanctioned\u201d:",

Especially in view of this admission, and without, of course, taking on the role of a national court, one may wonder whether such passive behaviour in relation to compliance with a positive order by a court could not, by itself, be sufficient to constitute mens rea in any contempt proceedings, whether civil or criminal. One may also wonder whether any other approach would not run the risk of indirectly impairing the essence of the rights guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 and Article 8 of the Convention, by leaving behaviour which violates these rights unpunished indefinitely.

It is obvious that the criminal-law enforcement machinery, by dropping the charges against the respondent, did not assist, even indirectly, in ensuring that the court orders were complied with and that the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her family life was secured.",

Unfortunately, there was (and there still is) no Children\u2019s Commissioner in Serbia who could have been appointed as the special representative of the child in the present case so as to assist in the unification of the family and to make sure that the child\u2019s rights were implemented correctly at all times.",

Obedience is the essence of the rule of law (\u201cobedientia est legis essentia\u201d, 11 Coke\u2019s Reports 100) and the effect of the rule of law consists in its execution (\u201cjuris effectus in executione consistit\u201d, Coke on Littleton 289). I believe, without taking on the role of a first-instance court, that the disobedience by the respondent of the two interim orders, a finding which the civil court had already made, undermined the very administration of justice and the rule of law. It rendered the orders literally nugatory and totally deprived the applicant \u2013 the most suitable parent to have custody of the child \u2013 of her rights guaranteed under Article 6 \u00a7 1 and Article 8 of the Convention. Such behaviour, by any parent, is very serious and should entail strict sanctions, provided for in both civil and criminal contempt proceedings, with the aim not only of punishing the offender, but also of operating as a means of coercion ensuring compliance with such orders, while at the same time promoting, or preventing undue interference with, the administration of justice. It is totally unacceptable to allow a situation, as in the present case, where a parent who, despite having been found in a court judgment to be unsuitable or not the most suitable parent to have custody of the child, was actually left to enjoy sole custody, making the child not wish to have any contact at all with the other parent, who had nevertheless been deemed the most suitable parent to have custody. And eventually, this bad or unsuitable parent, who was in continuous civil contempt of court, managed not only to be left unpunished by the criminal court, but also to be given custody of the child. The rule of law and the administration of justice lose their authority and validity if they are left, or appear to be left, at the whim of any person, as in the present case, who refuses to abide by the orders of a court.",

It is to be noted that punishment or coercion in respect of a parent who does not comply with an access or custody order, thus acting against the interests of his or her child, differs from, and should not be confused with, coercion of a child, which should be avoided in all circumstances. Quite appropriately, the majority note (in paragraph 65 of the judgment) that, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, \u201calthough coercive measures against children are not desirable in this sensitive area, the use of sanctions cannot be ruled out in the event of unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the child lives\u201d. But for such sanctions to be imposed, it would be necessary first for them to be provided for by law. It should also be clarified that the enforcement of a court\u2019s access or custody orders should not be taken as a measure contrary to the idea of child-friendly justice, the most appropriate form of justice in the interests of children.",

In the present case, however, the rights of the individuals were regulated by the domestic courts\u2019 orders; all that remained was to enforce those orders and maintain the rule of law. The rule of law should be respected not only by the parties concerned but by all the authorities of the State, which in the present case had the positive duty to enforce the courts\u2019 orders and reunite the applicant with her child.",

This observation, however, with which I fully agree, is particularly important when the Court finds a violation of Article 8, as I have done in the present case. Family relations are continuous and sensitive human relations and cannot be repaired retrospectively. Any obstruction to their continuity by one parent not abiding by a court order regulating family relations may destroy these relations, and may also flagrantly violate the right to respect for family life and the human dignity of the child and the parent whose contact with his or her child has been seriously damaged. The guarantees afforded by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention would be illusory if a Contracting State\u2019s national legal system allowed court orders granting access and custody to remain inoperative to the detriment of a child and his mother, as happened in the present case.",
