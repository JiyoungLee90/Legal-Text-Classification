The Court notes that the applicant alleged before the domestic authorities that he had been seriously ill-treated by the police. The Court notes that the credibility of that allegation could have been verified on the basis of the applicant\u2019s medical documentation of January 2004. However, the relevant documents had not been seized and evaluated by the prosecutor. This omission makes it more difficult for the Court to determine whether there was a reasonable suspicion underlying the applicant\u2019s allegation which would engage the authorities\u2019 obligation effectively to investigate it. At the same time, the Court is mindful of the fact that the responsibility for the aforementioned difficulty \u2013 the failure to seize the documents \u2012 lies with the State authorities. Furthermore, the Court is mindful of the fact that the District Court repeatedly ordered the investigating authorities to verify the credibility of the applicant\u2019s complaints. In sum, there is nothing in the case file material to convince the Court that the applicant\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment before the domestic authorities is so devoid of any reasonable suspicion that it merited no investigation.

The Court does not rule out that such a delay could in principle have a negative impact on the efficiency of the investigation. There are, however, no reasons to regard it as a prima facie impediment to the establishment of the truth in the present case, for the investigation could have relied on the applicant\u2019s medical documentation dating from January 2004, or alternatively it could have arranged for new X-rays to find out if there were any traces of possible injuries. In any event, none of these measures has ever been undertaken. It is also noteworthy that, firstly, the applicant did not fail to comply with any time-limit in raising his complaint, and, secondly, the investigation authorities themselves never cited his delay as an obstacle to the investigation.",

It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2000-III). The expression \u201clawful\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 essentially refers back to national law and lays down an obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. The Court may review whether national law has been observed for the purposes of this Convention provision; however, it is first and foremost up to the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see\u00a0Oleksiy Mykhaylovych Zakharkin v. Ukraine, no. 1727/04, \u00a7 84, 24\u00a0June 2010). The Court further reiterates that the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention under domestic law is the primary, but not always the decisive element. The Court must, in addition, be satisfied that, during the period under consideration, the detention was compatible with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which is to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary manner (see Yeloyev v. Ukraine, no.\u00a017283/02, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, 6\u00a0November 2008).",

This provision did not enumerate exhaustively the grounds for an arrest and refers, instead, to several other CCP provisions, none of them having been cited by the police in the applicant\u2019s case. It is therefore unclear from the report which of the provisions of the domestic law served as the exact basis for the applicant\u2019s arrest. Furthermore, apart from noting that the applicant was suspected of an offence, the report presented no reasons whatsoever for the applicant\u2019s arrest and did not explain why it was necessary in the particular circumstances. It did not refer to any factual circumstances that would persuade an independent observer that there had been a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed a crime. In the absence of a clear indication of the legal grounds for the applicant\u2019s arrest and reasons making application of the relevant legal provisions necessary, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention between 22 and 24 January 2004 were not free from arbitrariness (see Korneykova v. Ukraine, no. 39884/05, \u00a7\u00a034, 19 January 2012).",

Furthermore, it appears that the speediness of the review of the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention was dependent on the date set for the hearing in the case against him, which has previously been identified as a recurring problem in cases against Ukraine due to the lack of clear and foreseeable provisions which would provide for such a procedure during the trial stage in a manner compatible with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention (see Molodorych, cited above, \u00a7 108).",
