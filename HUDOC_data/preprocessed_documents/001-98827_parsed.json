It follows from the findings of the domestic courts (see paragraphs 21-22 above) that it was uncontested: (a) that during 1996, 1997 and 1998 the applicant, as a serviceman, occasionally carried out demining work; (b) that his name figured on the monthly lists of members of the 40th Engineering Brigade who carried out demining work, which lists were compiled by the commander of that unit indicating the number of days spent on demining works and related amounts of daily allowances; (c) that those lists were signed by the applicant's commanding officer, then co-signed and certified by the commander of the 3rd Operational Zone of the Croatian Armed Forces, and eventually submitted for payment to the Split Regional Finance Department of the Ministry of Defence. It would therefore appear that all the conditions for acquiring the right to special daily allowances for demining work set forth in the Decision of the Minister of Defence of 18\u00a0September 1995 (see paragraph 36 above) were met in the applicant's case.

On the contrary, the Convention organs have consistently held that income that has been earned does constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see, for example, Bah\u00e7eyaka v. , no. 74463/01, \u00a7 34, 13 July 2006; Erkan v. Turkey (dec.), no. 29840/03, 24 March 2005; Schettini and others v. Italy (dec.), no. 29529/95, 9 November 2000; and St\u00f8rksen v. Norway, no. 19819/92, Commission decision of 5 July 1994). The Court further notes that under Croatian law, in particular section 360(1) of the Obligations Act, a pecuniary right can no longer be enforced through the courts upon the expiration of a statutory limitation period but the right itself is not extinguished (see paragraphs 29 and 33 above). It follows that, even assuming that the statutory limitation period had indeed expired in the applicant's case, it could not be argued that his claims for special daily allowances for demining work did not qualify as \u201cassets\u201d and thus did not constitute \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",

In this respect the Court notes that the applicant was aware that his commanding officer had made enquiries of his own superiors and that the information eventually conveyed to him came, through the commander of the 3rd Operational Zone, from the General Staff of the Croatian Armed Forces. In the Court's view, in the absence of a clear legal provision or publicly accessible documents as to who was authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, it was quite natural for the applicant to believe that the General Staff of the Croatian Armed Forces was an authority of sufficient rank whose statements could be binding on the Ministry.",

Russia, no. 58254/00, \u00a7 35, 24 March 2005; Adzhigovich, cited above, \u00a7 34; and Cazacu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46-47), because the manner in which that court interpreted and applied the relevant domestic law, in particular section 387 of the Obligations Act, was not foreseeable for the applicant, who could reasonably have expected that his commanding officer's statements to the effect that his claims were not in dispute and that payment was to follow once funds had been allocated, constituted acknowledgement of the debt capable of interrupting the running of the statutory limitation period (see, for example and mutatis mutandis, Nacaryan and Deryan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51-60, and Fokas v. , no. 31206/02, \u00a7\u00a7 42-44, 29 September 2009).
