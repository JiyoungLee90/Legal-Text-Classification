The reasons appear to have been limited to paraphrasing the reasons for detention provided for by the Code of Criminal Procedure, without explaining how they applied in the applicant\u2019s case. The courts did not explain why they believed that the applicant would abscond or re-offend, nor did they explain how he could tamper with evidence or witnesses more than two years after the beginning of the proceedings. The automatic and blanket prolongation of the applicant\u2019s detention is further proved by the two last decisions \u2012 of May and August 2011 (see paragraph 8 above) \u2012 in which the courts re-used the same text, simply changing the dates.\u00a0The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that the applicant\u2019s detention on remand for more than twenty-nine months was excessively long and was not based on reasonable and sufficient reasons. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",
