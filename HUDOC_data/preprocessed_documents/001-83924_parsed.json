Consequently, the Court agrees with the Government that the right to an oral hearing in cassation could be outweighed by the demands of diligence and economy (see, Rizhamadze, cited above, \u00a7 39). As to the applicant's arguments that her oral pleadings before the cassation court were indispensable in order to clarify some purely technical issues and prove that she had had standing to challenge the authority of the respondent company's representative, the Court reiterates that legal arguments, as well as those relating to technical factual matters, may be presented effectively in writing rather than orally (see, for example, Pursiheimo v.

Moreover, the Court notes that, by complaining that the Supreme Court did not give reasons for its decision to dispense with an oral hearing, which decisions could not be appealed, the applicant detaches the impugned absence of a hearing in the cassation proceedings from the context of her civil dispute as a whole, and instead challenges the fairness of the procedures under Article 408 \u00a7 3 of the CCP in general. However, the question of whether or not fair trial safeguards have been met under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention can only be answered by examining the specifically impugned judicial proceedings as a whole (see H. v. France, judgment of 24 October 1989, Series A no.\u00a0162 A, p.\u00a023, \u00a7 61). Moreover, the dispute over the appropriateness of an oral hearing is obviously not a dispute about the applicant's \u201ccivil rights\u201d. Nor could its outcome be considered to be directly decisive for the examination of the merits of the applicant's pecuniary action (see, a contrario, Rizhamadze, cited above, \u00a7 24; Zander v.

However, the applicant failed to show the eventual utility of such an exchange. In particular, the Court observes that the relevant provisions of the CCP do not entitle the parties to submit any additional comments on each others' submissions, a matter undisputed by the applicant.
