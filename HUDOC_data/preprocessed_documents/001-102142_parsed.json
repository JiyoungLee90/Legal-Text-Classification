Turkey, 22 October 1997, \u00a7 51, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VI). Neither is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or taken before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or discontinuing suspicions which provide the grounds for detention. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 300A). However, the requirement that the suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention. The fact that a suspicion is held in good faith is insufficient. The words \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d mean the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 182, and Cebotari v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 35615/06, \u00a7 48, 13 November 2007).",

Poland, no. 43748/98, \u00a7 50, 30 May 2006; Labita, cited above, \u00a7 152; and McKay, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

In this connection, the Court notes that, while the severity of the sentence faced is one of the relevant elements in the assessment of the risk of absconding, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81). Moreover, the risk of absconding, which may justify detention, cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the sentence faced. It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Panchenko v. , no. 45100/98, \u00a7 106, 8 February 2005, and Letellier, cited above, \u00a7 43). In the present case, however, the judicial decisions did not go any further than listing the above-mentioned grounds, including the risk of absconding, using a standard formula paraphrasing the terms of the CCrP (compare Giorgi Nikolaishvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 23-24, 28, 76 and 79).

However, the Court observes that in May 2006, when the domestic courts extended the applicant's continued detention relying on the discovery of \u201cnew evidence\u201d concerning his alleged involvement in other crimes, there were no new criminal charges against him in connection with such other alleged crimes. The applicant was not charged with new criminal offences until 13 September 2006, almost four months after the extension order. Therefore, the reasons provided by the domestic courts in their decisions of 16 May and 31 May 2006 for the applicant's continued detention for a period of five months were irrelevant, as they justified his detention with reference to a suspicion of criminal offences with which the applicant was not even charged.",

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A\u00a0fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Khuzhin and Others v. , no. 13470/02, \u00a7 94, 23 October 2008, with further references). Whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Butkevi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2002II).",

However, this circumstance cannot justify a lack of caution in the choice of words used by the authorities in their statement.\u00a0Moreover, in the present case, the statement at issue was made at the time when the criminal investigation against the applicant had just been started.",

In particular, it was stated that \u201cit has been established that Akif Muradverdiyev ... and Fikret Sadygov ... conspired with Rasul Guliyev ..., as well as with ... Ali Insanov, ... Farhad Aliyev, ... Fikret Yusifov and other persons interested in capturing power by force.

The Court considers that that statement, made without the necessary qualifications or reservations, contained wording amounting to a declaration that the applicant had committed certain criminal offences. As such, they prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority and could not but have encouraged the public to believe the applicant guilty before he had been proved guilty according to law.",
