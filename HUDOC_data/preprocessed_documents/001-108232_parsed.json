Subsequently, in Deweer v. Belgium it clarified that the \u201cright to a court\u201d applied to criminal as well as to civil cases (judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35). This right, however, is not absolute; it is subject to limitations permitted by implication, and particularly so where the \u201cconditions of admissibility of an appeal are concerned\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, Garc\u00eda Manibardo v.

In its decision of 31 May 2007, however, the Supreme Court mistakenly rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law as belated, stating that it had been lodged on 5 July 2006 whereas, in fact, this was only the date when the Supreme Court itself had received the said appeal (see paragraphs 11 and\u00a012 above). The Supreme Court thus breached Article 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 20, 17 and 16 above, in that order), as well as the applicants\u2019 right of access to a court under the Convention, it being understood that it is not this Court\u2019s task to determine what the actual outcome of the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law should have been had the Supreme Court accepted to consider it on its merits.",
