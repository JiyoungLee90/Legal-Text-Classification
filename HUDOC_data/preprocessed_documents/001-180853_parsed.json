As regards the first applicant, it transpires from his constitutional appeal that he claimed 40,000 euros in respect of damage suffered because of the excessive length of the impugned proceedings, but that the Constitutional Court failed to examine it. Similarly, as regards the second and fourth applicants, it transpires from their constitutional appeals that they expressly complained, albeit in a succinct manner, about the length of the impugned proceedings (contrast Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 82, in which the applicants did not raise their discrimination complaint before the Constitutional Court, either expressly or in substance). They indicated the key developments and decisions taken in the course of the proceedings. They used words such as \u201cthe applicant filed his claim almost eleven years ago\u201d, \u201cwithin reasonable time\u201d, \u201cthe proceedings lasted more than ten years\u201d, \u201cexcessive length\u201d, in relation to those proceedings on several occasions in their constitutional appeals. The second applicant even claimed a certain amount of money in respect of damage suffered because of the excessive length of the impugned proceedings. They relied on Article 32 of the Serbian Constitution which corresponds to Article 6 of the Convention. Complaints about the length of proceedings, unlike some other complaints under the Convention, normally do not require much elaboration. If, exceptionally, the Constitutional Court needed any additional information or documents, it could have requested the applicants to provide them. It follows that the applicants provided the national authorities with the opportunity which is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, namely of putting right the violations alleged against them (see, amongst many others, Mur\u0161i\u0107 v. Croatia [GC], no. 7334/13, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2016).",
