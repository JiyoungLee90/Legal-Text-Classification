About a year of that time was taken up by efforts to resolve a fairly straightforward issue \u2013 the payment of the court fees due for the appeal (see paragraphs 710 above). The later \u2013 and longer\u00a0\u2013 part of that period was spent in attempts to bring the association's appeal in line with the altered requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraphs 1114 above). While a change in the rules of procedure may justify a certain delay, the Court notes that it took the domestic courts more than two and a half years to settle the problem. A substantial amount of that interval was lost in difficulties \u2013 whatever their cause \u2013 with the service of process (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above).
