Further, the investigator had unlawfully transmitted the alcohol to the regional authorities for destruction. Since the alcohol had been seized as an item of physical evidence, that is as \u201cphysical evidence of a crime\u201d, only the trial court had the power to decide what to do with it. Moreover, when transmitting the consignment the investigator had had at his disposal an alternative expert report, which stated that the alcohol was drinkable; however, he had not even mentioned that report in his decision. The District Court finally found that the destruction of the alcohol had resulted in significant pecuniary loss for the first applicant company.

The Commercial Court concluded, inter alia, that the civil dispute before it could be resolved independently of the criminal proceedings pending against Mr Golovkin. In particular, the criminal proceedings did not aim to establish whether the contract for sale of the first consignment between Uniya and Belcourt had been null and void within the meaning of the Civil Code. On the contrary, the court considered that the sale contract had been entered into by duly authorised persons, and that the parties had begun implementing it, declared the alcohol at the border, paid customs duties, and so on. The contract was therefore valid. The fact that Uniya had no direct contractual relationship with the firms which had produced the alcohol was immaterial. Therefore, Uniya was the legitimate owner of the 120,377 bottles of alcohol seized by the police investigator. As regards the quality of the alcohol, the expert examination of 14\u00a0August 1998 had been unreliable from the scientific point of view. Furthermore, the serial numbers of the bottle labels described in the expert report did not correspond to those of the bottles imported by the applicant company. The Commercial Court also noted that in 1998 that type of alcohol could be imported without any special licence. In conclusion, the court allowed the applicant company\u2019s claim in full, awarding it RUB\u00a027,482,321 in damages. The defendant appealed.",

Paragraph 1 of Article 1070 establishes the principle of strict liability of the State Treasury for damage caused to individuals by (i)\u00a0unlawful conviction; (ii) unlawful institution of criminal proceedings; (iii)\u00a0unlawful application of a preventive measure in the form of placement in custody or an undertaking not to leave their place of residence, and (iv)\u00a0unlawful administrative detention or mandatory labour. In other situations, where damage is caused by an investigative or prosecuting authority within criminal proceedings but not by actions described in Article\u00a01070, Article 1069 of the Civil Code applies. Article 1069 provides for liability of the State Treasury for damage caused to an individual or a legal person by an unlawful action or inaction by a State authority or official. Article 1069 does not provide for strict liability; consequently, the liability of the State arises where the impugned act was, first, unlawful, and, second, where there was a \u201cfault\u201d on the part of the State authority or official concerned.",

In their most recent observations (those of 10 May 2012), the Government indicated that the applicant companies had failed to appeal against the judgments in which they had been awarded compensation for the destruction of the first consignment.",

France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III; Dalban v. Romania [GC], no.\u00a028114/95, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 1999-VI; and Rotaru v.

In the present case the unlawfulness of the destruction of the first consignment of alcohol was acknowledged, first by the decision of 25\u00a0November 2005 by the Leningradskiy District Court (see paragraph\u00a052 above), and then by the judgment of 28 December 2010 by the Baltiyskiy District Court (see paragraphs 77-83 above). Thus, the first condition (\u201cacknowledgment\u201d) has been met. In respect of the \u201credress\u201d, the Court observes that on 28 December 2010 the Baltiyskiy District Court, on the basis of Article 139 of the CCrP, awarded the first applicant company (Belcourt) RUB 74,418,700 in compensation for the destruction of the 337,104\u00a0bottles of alcohol from the first consignment. That sum was paid on 5\u00a0April 2012. In addition, on 27 November 2012 Belcourt received RUB\u00a0596,242 in compensation for the delayed implementation of the judgment of 28\u00a0December 2010.",

In the light of the materials of the case the Court does not consider that the amount of compensation received by Belcourt was inadequate.

As regards the \u201credress\u201d for the property lost, the tort claim by the first applicant company in relation to the destruction of its part of the first consignment resulted in a court award in the applicant company\u2019s favour under Article 139 of the CCrP. Thus, on 27 January 2011 the Baltiyskiy District Court awarded Uniya RUB 52,665,032 for the 120,317\u00a0bottles belonging to it. The first applicant company did not contest the amount of compensation awarded to it in the domestic proceedings, so the Court is prepared to accept that the compensation awarded was adequate. However, by contrast with the second applicant company, the award in favour of the first applicant company has never been paid, since the company was liquidated in the meantime. The question is whether in such a situation it can be said that the first applicant company obtained \u201csufficient redress\u201d for the violation of its rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

That contract provided that Uniya was acting as depositary and agent in respect of the alcohol imported by Belcourt into Russia. Under the 1997 contract Belcourt retained the title to the alcohol until it received payment for it. Since no payment was received by Belcourt, Uniya did not become the owner of the alcohol.

The Court observes that before their destruction both consignments were seized and retained by the investigative authorities for the purposes of the criminal proceedings in Mr Golovkin\u2019s case. In other circumstances such measures as removal or attachement of property within criminal porceedings would warrant a separate examination under Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01. However, in the present case the alcohol seized was, after a certain lapse of time, destroyed for the reasons which had not been directly related to the reasons for its seizure. Thus, a temporary dispossession transformed into a definite loss of the property, which was a significantly more serious interference with the applicant companies\u2019 rights under Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1. Although in the domestic proceedings the applicant companies complained of both types of interference with their possessions, their primary objective was to obtain damages in connection with the destruction of the alcohol. In such circumstances, bearing in mind that the applicant companies\u2019 main grievance about the destruction has been sufficiently addressed above, the Court decides that the question of the seizures of the alcohol do not require a separate examination.",

For all that period the applicant companies were precluded from challenging, under Article 125 of the CCrP, the lawfulness of the investigator\u2019s actions concerning the first consignment of alcohol. The Court stresses that the decisions to seize and destroy the alcohol were taken by the investigator alone, without any involvement of the interested parties and without any prior judicial inquiry. The same investigating authority which had ordered the seizure and destruction of the alcohol also conducted criminal proceedings against Mr Golovkin. Consequently, by protracting those proceedings the investigator delayed the examination of the lawfulness of his own actions, and thus evaded their effective review. This situation was aggravated by the fact that the unlawfulness of the investigator\u2019s actions has already been acknowledged by the \u201cspecial ruling\u201d issued under Article 21.2 of the CCrP; however, the commercial courts refused to consider it as a proper \u201cdeclaration of unlawfulness\u201d required under the domestic law.",

The Court also observes that Belcourt\u2019s operations consisted of wholesale trade in alcohol. Having regard to the price at which the alcohol was purchased in Europe, namely between 1.09 and 1.12\u00a0German marks per bottle (see paragraph 9 above), to the dynamics in the change of prices of alcohol in Russia, taking into consideration the nature of the commercial relations between the first and the second applicant companies, and considering other relevant factors and economic data available to it, the Court considers that the price of USD\u00a07.35 per bottle, fixed in the 1998 agreements, was excessive.",
