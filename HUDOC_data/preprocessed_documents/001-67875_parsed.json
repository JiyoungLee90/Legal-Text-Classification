In the second set of proceedings, the case was pending before the investigating judge for four years and almost four months, namely between 14 April 1993 and 9\u00a0August\u00a01997, while an expert opinion was obtained. Another period of five months elapsed until the subsequent start of the trial on 20\u00a0January\u00a01998. The Court cannot find any satisfactory explanation for these delays.
