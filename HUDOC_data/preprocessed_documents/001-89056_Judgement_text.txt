The case originated in application (no. 29063/05) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Russian nationals, Mr Aleksandr Sergeyevich Kardashin, Ms Svetlana Vladimirovna Kardashina, and Ms Lyudmila Martselinovna Banshchikova (“the applicants”), on 25 June 2005.
The applicants were represented by Mr A. Koss, a lawyer practising in Kaliningrad. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Ms V. Milinchuk, former Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 5 April 2007 the President of the First Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning non-enforcement of a judgment to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants are a family. They were born in 1985, 1964, and 1944 respectively and live in Baltiysk, a town in the Kaliningrad Region.
The applicants’ house became decrepit because of a construction undertaken nearby by Military Unit 53110. On 19 September 2001 the Baltiysk Town Court ordered the Military Unit to provide the applicants with decent dwellings. This judgment became binding on 1 October 2001.
On 30 January 2002 the Town Court forwarded enforcement papers to bailiffs, but on 18 February 2002 the bailiffs returned the papers because of their formal defects.
From 25 March to 30 May 2002 the enforcement proceedings were stayed because the Military Unit contested its liability for the judgment debt.
On 31 July 2002 the bailiffs returned the enforcement papers to the applicants because the judgment had been unclear.
On 13 August 2004 the applicants applied to clarify the judgment, and on 26 August 2004 the Town Court issued a clarification. The applicants disagreed with it and appealed. After a rehearing, on 26 November 2004 the Town Court ordered the Military Unit to
“provide [the applicants] before 1 February 2005 with a decent (in terms of Baltiysk) flat in Baltiysk, measuring at least 47.2 m² and meeting sanitary and technical requirements.”
The applicants appealed, but on 12 January 2005 the Kaliningrad Regional Court rejected the appeal.
On 28 February 2006 the first and second applicants received a flat of 52.8 m² and the third applicant received a flat of 34.1 m².
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months.
