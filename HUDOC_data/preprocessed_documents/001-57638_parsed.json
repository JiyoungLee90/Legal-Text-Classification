This lack of protection was, so the applicants claimed, the more serious because of the alleged misrepresentation (see paragraph 48 above) and the provisions of section 6 of the 1979 Ordinance, according to which the assessment of the property\u2019s value for the purposes of the compulsory resale had to be made in consultation with the County Agricultural Board (see paragraph 37 above).",

The applicants decided in 1979 to bid 240,000 SEK for the estate, whereas its market value was assessed only at 140,000 SEK (see paragraph 8 above). Furthermore, the 1979 Act made it quite clear that a person buying an agricultural estate (with certain exceptions which are not relevant here - see paragraph 32 above) at a compulsory auction needed a permit in order to be able to keep the estate for more than two years. It was not possible to obtain prior to the auction any binding declaration as to the likelihood of obtaining this permit (see paragraph 31 above). Prospective buyers thus had to bear in mind the risk that they might have to resell the estate within two years on the conditions laid down in the 1979 Act. The applicants claimed that they should not have run any such risk having regard to the authorities\u2019 alleged assurances in connection with the 1979 auction (see paragraph 9 above). This allegation has, however, already been rejected by the Court (see paragraph 48 above).",

In exchange for their property the applicants eventually received 155,486.50 SEK (see paragraph 22 above), a sum considerably less than the purchase price they had paid. This figure represented the estate\u2019s estimated market value of 172,000 SEK, as assessed by two specially appointed valuers, less the costs of the valuation and the compulsory sale. There is no substantiated allegation that the valuation, or any other decision regarding the 1985 auction, was not in accordance with the 1979 Act (see paragraph 47 above). Having regard to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the national authorities under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), the Court therefore agrees with the Commission that the price received by the applicants can be considered to have been reasonably related to the value of the estate.",

It appears to me that once it has been held that there was a right to a court in accordance with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) it must follow, in the absence of evidence of a waiver, that the hearing must be a public hearing. The norm is a public hearing. The Code of Judicial Procedure provided for public hearings \"where [this was] necessary for the purposes of the investigation\". Such a discretion is not compatible with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) save in the particular exceptions specified in that provision. This case does not fall within any of those exceptions.",

The fact that there was no express request for a public hearing does not, in my opinion, amount to a tacit waiver of a public hearing. The proof of a waiver lies upon those asserting the existence of a waiver. The absence of an express objection to a departure from the norm cannot amount to the acceptance of such a departure. In my opinion it would radically alter the interpretation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) to hold that the mandatory requirement of a public hearing is to be interpreted as meaning that it is qualified to the extent of being dependent upon an express or tacit request. The public-hearing requirement of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is enshrined in the Convention because the Contracting States thought it was important, not because a party may think that it is important. The administration of justice in public is a matter of paramount importance in every democracy and is one of the cornerstones put in place by the Convention to guarantee the impartial administration of justice and the defence of the rights guaranteed by the Convention. The fact that the public may not manifest any particular interest in a given case is not a consideration. Equally a lack of interest in having a hearing in public on the part of one or both parties to a suit does not alter the matter. Only where both parties agree to a hearing other than in public can the mandatory provisions of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) be waived. Any such waiver of a guaranteed right must be manifested by clear and unambiguous words or by conduct from which the only reasonable inference to be drawn is that both parties were so agreed. There is no such evidence in the present case. In my opinion silence cannot amount to such waiver, particularly, as in this case, where there is no evidence that the applicants ever contemplated a joint or several waiver.",
