In doing so, the Presidium based itself on the part of the judgment of the Oktyabrskiy District Court of 15 March 2006 which had been quashed on appeal by the Arkhangelskiy Regional Court, while ignoring the entire set of proceedings subsequent to that quashing, in which the domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction had reached an opposite conclusion.",
