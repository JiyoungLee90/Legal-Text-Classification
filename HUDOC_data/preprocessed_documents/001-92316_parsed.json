In that connection, supervisory review proceedings were initiated on the application of the Deputy Prosecutor General. On 5 April 2006 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the  quashed the appeal decision of 15 August 2002 and remitted the case for a fresh appeal hearing. A fresh appeal examination took place on 29 June 2006. The applicant and his counsel were duly informed of that hearing by telegrams sent on 4 May 2006. The applicant received that notification on 23 May 2006, however he submitted a request for participation in the appeal hearing only on 4 July 2006. He did not ask to be brought to the appeal hearing in his grounds of appeal. Therefore, taking into account that the applicant and his counsel were duly informed of the hearing, that the applicant failed to make a special request for participation in the hearing in due time, that his counsel failed to appear without any valid reasons and did not ask to postpone the hearing, the appeal court examined the case in their absence. The Government concluded that the applicant had been able to take part in the appeal hearing of 29 June 2006, but had failed to use that opportunity. Consequently, the Russian authorities had complied with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention.",

Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7\u00a086, ECHR 2006...), and it must be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance (see Poitrimol v.

Furthermore, in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial Article 6 of the Convention imposes on every national court an obligation to check whether the defendant has had the opportunity to know of the date of the hearing and the steps to be taken in order to take part where, as in the instant case, this is disputed on a ground that does not immediately appear to be manifestly devoid of merit (see, mutatis mutandis, Somogyi v.

However, according to the applicant, by that date he was not aware that his case had been sent to a fresh appeal hearing as a result of the supervisory review and therefore, he could not know what kind of hearing would be held by the Supreme Court. The Court notes that the Government have not provided any information to prove that the applicant and/or his counsel were duly informed of the supervisory review proceedings or of their outcome. The Court further notes that on 4\u00a0November 2005 it forwarded to the applicant a copy of the Government\u2019s observations in which they submitted that on 26 October 2005 the Deputy Prosecutor had applied for a supervisory review of the appeal decision of 15\u00a0August 2002. On 23 May 2006 the Court forwarded to the applicant the Government\u2019s letter from which it followed that on 5 April 2006 the Presidium of the Supreme Court had quashed the appeal decision of 15\u00a0August 2002 and had remitted the case for a fresh appeal examination. It follows that, at least until the date on which the applicant received the Court\u2019s letter of 23 May 2006 he was not aware of the results of the supervisory review proceedings. It means that on 23 May 2006, the date on which the applicant read the telegram informing him that his case would be heard by the Supreme Court, he could not have known what hearing was to be held by the Supreme Court, a supervisory review hearing or a fresh appeal hearing. In those circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant was not duly notified of the appeal hearing of 29 June 2006. The Court also notes that the Government have not submitted any document which demonstrates that the applicant\u2019s counsel received notification.",
