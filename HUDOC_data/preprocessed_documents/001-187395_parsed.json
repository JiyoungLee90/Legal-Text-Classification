On 3 October 1989 the Minister of Culture issued ministerial decision no. \u03a5\u03a0\u03a0\u039f/\u0391\u03a1\u03a7/\u03911/\u03a6.10/7732/735/3-10-1989, which revoked the decision of the Ephorate dated 25 November 1980 on the basis of which the applicants\u2019 licence to operate the quarry had been granted. The ministerial decision in itself, however, had no effect on the licence granted by the Prefecture. The decision was revoked on the grounds that the applicants had exceeded the limits that had been imposed for the protection of the ancient monuments. Following that decision, on 17 October 1989, 29 January 1990, 9 February 1990 and 11 June 1990 the Ephorate asked the Prefecture to revoke licence no. 205/1981, on the basis of which the quarry was operating, so that the ministerial decision could take effect. However, it appears that the licence was never revoked, even though, according to the applicants, they essentially ceased the quarrying and mining activities. However, some documents indicate that the Ephorate continued to address complaints to the applicants during that period, asking them to stop any mining activities and warning them of the continuing damage to the antiquities.",

In particular, the domestic court held that Article 24 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution referred to the regulatory competence of the State only in respect of cities and urban areas, and therefore only exceptionally could a non-urban area be built on, and, in principle, only for uses assisting its main purpose, namely agricultural activities. It was possible to change the purpose of a property and implement further secondary measures limiting the property\u2019s intended use, in order to achieve constitutionally foreseen aims, such as increased protection of the cultural environment, on the condition that the relevant property did not disappear or become inactive in relation to its purpose. The imposition of such limitations on the right of property meant that an owner had a right to compensation under Article\u00a024\u00a0\u00a7\u00a06 of the Constitution when the limitations caused essential, temporary or definitive deprivation of the use of a property in relation to its purpose, for example in the event of construction on land situated on a town plan being completely prohibited. In order to assess compensation, only the primary purpose of the land was taken into account, and not any other secondary uses that were exceptionally allowed. The use of the property was designated either directly by the Constitution, or by the legislature or the administration. As regards the applicants\u2019 plot of land, it was situated outside the town plan and therefore its main purpose was agricultural. Agricultural activities were not impeded by the limitations imposed by the ministerial decisions. The above-mentioned findings were not affected by the fact that the plot of land had been used as a quarry from 1981 until 1993, because the provisions of Law no. 1428/1984 had only exceptionally allowed that use.",

On 21 November 2003 the appeal court published judgment no. 4634/2003 dismissing the applicants\u2019 appeal, which contained similar reasoning to that of the first-instance court. The appeal court upheld the lower court\u2019s conclusions concerning the primary and secondary use of a plot of land. Based on a document prepared by the Directorate of Agriculture of Fokida Prefecture \u2013 which said that the plot of land was to be used for agricultural activities and not as a quarry \u2013 and taking into account that the land was not in a quarrying region, the domestic court held that the core of the applicants\u2019 right to their property was not affected, nor was their land excessively restricted according to its purpose, which would have been the case if the limitations imposed had concerned prohibiting the cultivation of olive trees or the grazing of sheep, for example. Based on the above factors, the applicants did not have a right to be compensated for the restrictions imposed on the use of their land.",

On the contrary, the use of the plot of land and its purpose should only have been taken into account in relation to the assessment of the amount of compensation. In an additional memorandum, the applicants argued that the ministerial decisions had deprived them of the right to build on the remaining part of their land, which measured 3,800 sq. m, less than the statutory limit defined by law in order to be able to build. On 28 March 2011, by judgment no. 925/2011, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law, holding that it was not competent to rule on what the purpose of the plot of land was, and that that was within the competence of the Administrative Court of Appeal. Given that the lower court had ruled that the land was to be used for agricultural activities, it had correctly applied the law concerning compensation, and had rightly dismissed the applicants\u2019 action for compensation.

According to the Court\u2019s established case-law, the concept of \u201cvictim\u201d must be interpreted autonomously and irrespective of domestic concepts such as those concerning an interest or capacity to act (see Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others v. Spain, no. 62543/00, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2004III), even though the Court should have regard to the fact that an applicant has been a party to domestic proceedings (see Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7\u00a047, ECHR 2009). The word \u201cvictim\u201d, in the context of Article 34 of the Convention, denotes the person or persons directly or indirectly affected by the alleged violation (see Sarl du Parc d\u2019Activit\u00e9s de Blotzheim v. France, no. 72377/01, \u00a7 20, 11 July 2006). Hence, Article 34 concerns not just the direct victim or victims of the alleged violation, but also any indirect victims to whom the violation would cause harm or who would have a valid and personal interest in seeing it brought to an end (see Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], nos. 29381/09 and 32684/09, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).",

As legal owners, all the applicants brought proceedings before the domestic administrative courts, which accepted their legal standing but rejected their action for compensation. Moreover, it has not been contested that the applicants were the rightful heirs of their ancestors. The Court also notes that in addition to the interference with their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their property, the applicants\u2019 complaint extends to the failure to pay them compensation.

In addition, the applicants had not been deprived of their right to exploit their plot of land, which they had been free to use in accordance with its intended use as proved before the domestic courts. More specifically, the domestic courts had examined the available evidence without being bound by any presumption, and had concluded that the rocky part of the plot of land was intended to be used for livestock, and the non-rocky part was intended to be used for crops. That conclusion had been based on a document prepared by the Prefecture stating that the plot of land was not situated in a quarrying region and could be used as described above. While it was true that domestic courts had previously applied the presumption that the intended use of any plot of land situated outside a town plan was agricultural, following the Court\u2019s judgment in Z.A.N.T.E. \u2013 Marathonisi A.E. v.

The Court considers that, although the applicants could not carry on their business or exploit their land as they wished, they were still owners of the land and retained economic rights in the form of the premises and assets of their business. In these circumstances, the classification of their land as a zone of absolute protection is to be seen not as deprivation of possessions for the purposes of the second sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, but as a measure of control of use of property, which falls to be examined under the second paragraph of that Article (compare Anonymos Touristiki Etairia Xenodocheia Kritis v.

In this regard, the Court notes at the outset that the applicants did not adduce a request to renew the exploitation licence which they allegedly submitted to the Prefecture, nor did they adduce a rejection decision in respect of such a request. Having regard to the above, the Court cannot establish whether there was a causal link between the largest part of the applicants\u2019 land being classified as a zone of absolute protection and the non-renewal of their licence, or whether that was the result of repeated breaches of the terms of the first exploitation licence or simply the result of the assessment of the Prefecture\u2019s needs for inert material. In particular, it is not for this Court to speculate on the reasons why the applicants\u2019 licence was not renewed.

In addition, that must have been clear to the applicants and their predecessors in title, given that the Prefect\u2019s licence for the quarry operation was granted following the decision of the Ephorate, which had acceded to the request on the basis that the quarry would operate within specific designated borders so as to protect the monuments, terms which were specifically mentioned in the licence. Moreover, the Court notes that each decision of the Prefecture authorising the exploitation of the quarry specified limits within which the quarry could operate. The first one also included the term that the applicants should take all measures necessary to protect the environment from dust, failing which the licence could be revoked and there would be no grounds whatsoever for the applicants to acquire any right to claim compensation if exploitation of the quarry was forbidden. Furthermore, the second decision of the Prefecture included explicit terms that the applicants should strictly adhere to the terms and conditions set by the Archaeological Service.

That led to the applicants\u2019 criminal conviction for the destruction of antiquities in 1989. The Court additionally takes note of the multiple efforts made by the Ephorate to protect the antiquities between the time when the quarry started its operations and the time when it finally ceased to function in 1993, including the revocation in 1989 of its decision dated 25\u00a0November\u00a01980 which had granted the applicants\u2019 licence to operate the quarry.

Greece (just satisfaction), no. 2998/08, \u00a7 22, 29 January 2013).

On the contrary, it cannot be said that the competent authorities, notably the Ephorate and the competent ministry, demonstrated any negligence as regards the exploitation of the quarry and the impact of this on the antiquities situated in it. While admittedly the Prefecture did not show the same concern at the outset, the Court notes that, having regard to the authorities\u2019 stance as a whole, they started acting as early as 1981 in relation to the risk to the antiquities posed by the applicants\u2019 activities, including by means of criminal law. In this regard, the ministerial decision designating the area as a zone of absolute protection corresponded to a concern about protecting the antiquities that had been severely affected by the mining activities, and to a more general concern for the preservation of the historical, cultural and artistic roots of the region and its inhabitants \u2013 essential values, the protection and promotion of which are incumbent on the public authorities (see Kozac\u0131o\u011flu, cited above, \u00a7 54).",

Their claims for compensation were rejected on the basis that the exploitation licence had been granted exceptionally, and thus the applicants could not claim compensation on the basis of that exceptional use, which had been granted under specific conditions and for a specific period of time. The Court takes note of the applicants\u2019 argument that the domestic courts applied an irrefutable presumption as regards the intended use of the plot of land, and thus erroneously rejected their claims for compensation. While it is true that the Court found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in a series of judgments on the grounds that the domestic courts had applied an irrefutable presumption in respect of the intended use of a plot of land, the Court notes that, following those judgments, the domestic case-law changed. In particular, it is clear from the domestic decisions relied on by the Government that, since the change in case-law, a domestic judge has been free to take into consideration the specific circumstances of the case when considering the intended use of a plot of land, and examine the cases on an ad hoc basis (see paragraphs 30 - 31 above). As regards the circumstances of the present case, the domestic courts examined the intended use of the plot of land and found that the land was not situated in a quarrying area and that the exploitation licence had been granted exceptionally. They based their judgment on, inter alia, a document describing the morphology of the land and the permitted uses in the area. In this regard, the Court reiterates that according to its well-established case-law, it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts, which are in the best position to assess the evidence before them and establish the facts.
