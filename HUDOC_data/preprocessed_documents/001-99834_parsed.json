The State has a positive obligation to organise a system for enforcement of judgments that is effective both in law and in practice and ensures their enforcement without undue delay (Fuklev v. Ukraine, no. 71186/01, \u00a7 84, 7 June 2005).

The Court, therefore, notes that the State's outstanding obligation to ensure the effective enforcement of the judgment in the applicant company's favour is not in dispute. Accordingly, the applicant company is still entitled to recover the remaining part of its judgment debt in the domestic proceedings. The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85). Having regard to the violation found, the Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well.
