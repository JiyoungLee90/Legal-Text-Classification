In September 2001 the prosecutor charged the applicant and M.\u017d. with genocide, pursuant to Article 71 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code then in force (see paragraph 52 below). The prosecutor found it to be established that as of 15 September 1951 the applicant had served as an operational agent in the Kaunas region \u0160akiai district branch of the LSSR MGB. He knew that \u201cthe LSSR MGB\u2019s main purpose was to physically eradicate part of the Lithuanian population belonging to a separate political group [atskira politin\u0117 grup\u0117], namely, the Lithuanian partisans, participants in the resistance to the Soviet occupation\u201d and \u201c[t]he applicant had been active in fulfilling that purpose of the LSSR MGB by killing some of the inhabitants of Lithuania belonging to the above-mentioned political group\u201d. For the prosecutor, the applicant\u2019s guilt was proved on the basis of his service record (tarnybos kortel\u0117) and the applicant\u2019s superiors\u2019 commendation for his persistence when executing search measures, managing the operation and personal participation when apprehending the bandits (pareik\u0161ta pad\u0117ka u\u017e atkaklum\u0105 pravedant agent\u016brines-tyrimo priemones, vadovavim\u0105 operacijai, asmenin\u012f dalyvavim\u0105 sulaikant banditus).

The trial court noted that the information in the case file allowed it to conclude that, in order to compromise the partisan brothers, the Soviet authorities had spread misinformation which indicated that J.A. and A.A. had deserted from the partisan unit, were hiding alone and, thereafter, had no connection with the partisans. Those accusations were untrue. In reality, the partisans, including the brothers, J.A. and A.A., operated in small groups in order to avoid extermination by the Soviets. Lastly, there was no credible evidence in the case which would disprove the assertion that J.A. and A.A. \u201cwere members of the organised resistance and that they belonged to a political group\u201d. The trial court also noted testimony by one witness that the partisan brothers had been hiding in the forest for three to four years, and that his family had given them food.",

In fact, the applicant had been sentenced only for taking part in the operation to eradicate the partisans as representatives of a political group.

The Court of Appeal noted the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the brothers, J.A. and A.A., had been exterminated for belonging to a \u201cpolitical group\u201d. While admitting that the definition of the crime of genocide in Article 99 of the Criminal Code also included social and political groups, and was therefore wider than that established by the Genocide Convention, the Court of Appeal found that the addition of those groups was \u201creasonable and in line with reality\u201d. The Genocide Convention did not contain specific provisions to the effect that the concept of genocide could be interpreted widely; however, neither did the Genocide Convention prohibit such an interpretation. The concept of genocide had been expanded in Criminal Codes of other countries. The Court of Appeal further explained that \u201cpolitical group means people connected by common political views and beliefs, and the goal to physically eradicate such a group also means genocide, because this involves an intention to eradicate part of the people [politin\u0117 grup\u0117 \u2013 tai \u017emon\u0117s, susij\u0119 bendromis politin\u0117mis pa\u017ei\u016bromis ir \u012fsitikinimais, ir siekimas toki\u0105 grup\u0119 fizi\u0161kai sunaikinti taip pat rei\u0161kia genocid\u0105, nes siekiama sunaikinti dal\u012f \u017emoni\u0173]\u201d.

Both V.\u00a0Vasiliauskas and M.\u017d. mention certificate no. 1767 of the Lithuanian Archives Department, dated 13 November 2001. The certificate indicates that the KGB archives contain a criminal case on J.A., and that in the indictment of that case it is written that, when Germany occupied Lithuania, J.A. joined the armed squad of white partisans; he carried weapons and took part in arrests, detention and transportation of active Soviet party members and Jews. Furthermore, he conducted anti-Soviet agitation and made terrorist threats against communists, which means that he has committed the crime provided for in Article\u00a0581a of the Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic [counter-revolutionary crime and treason of the motherland]. On 4 May 1945 J.A. escaped from prison and joined the partisan squad.",

It also indicates that in 1947 J.A. and A.A. left the partisan unit and went into hiding alone: they did not keep in touch with other partisans, and by order of the commander of the Tauras partisan unit were considered deserters. In respect of J.A. the same is indicated in the indictment of 16 March 1945 drawn up by the [MGB]. The specific acts that J.A. was accused of were not detailed. It appears that the above documents contain no data about the brothers\u2019 involvement in particular crimes against humanity. Moreover, given the charges against J.A., it is more likely that he had been accused primarily of carrying out activities against the [USSR] occupying forces themselves. There are no data in the case file about any involvement by the brothers in other criminal acts. Even in KGB documents it is indicated that from 1947 J.A. and A.A. were hiding \u201cwithout committing robberies, and they did not belong to any [criminal] gang\u201d.

Even in the MGB files there is an indication that in August 1952 other partisans were looking for an opportunity to meet J.A. and A.A. in order to form a single squad. The MGB therefore decided to spread the rumour that J.A. and A.A. were MGB agents. Specific plans to discredit J.A. and A.A. are apparent from the plan of 12 September 1952 confirmed by the head of the MGB board of Kaunas district ...

Accordingly, by acceding to the [Genocide] Convention, Lithuania acquired the obligation to punish actions aimed at the total or partial destruction of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, and to prevent such actions. Acceding to the [Genocide] Convention does not deprive a State of the right to define actions which are crimes, and to prohibit them [apibr\u0117\u017eti veikas, kurios yra nusikaltimai, ir jas u\u017edrausti]. This is even truer because Article V of the [above-mentioned] Convention provides that the Contracting Parties undertake to enact, in accordance with their respective Constitutions, the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the Convention and to provide penalties for those guilty of genocide or any of the other acts listed in Article III. In Lithuania, this provision has been put into force by enactment of the Law of 9\u00a0April 1992 on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania. The concept of genocide, as established in Article 1 of that law, corresponds to the concept of genocide established in Article II of the Genocide Convention. At the same time, when joining the Convention, in Article 2 of the Law on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania, the Lithuanian Parliament established that the killings and torture of Lithuanian people and their deportations which took place during the years under Nazi German and Soviet occupation and annexation corresponded to the characteristics of the crime of genocide as established by the norms of international law. The 1998 amendments to the Criminal Code established the elements of the crime of genocide [apibr\u0117\u017eta genocido nusikaltimo sud\u0117tis], and included acts aimed at the physical extermination of some or all of the members of a social or political group. This characteristic of the crime of genocide remained in Article 99 of the Criminal Code. It is clear that adding acts aimed at the physical extermination of some or all of the members of a social or political group to the definition of the crime of genocide amounts to nothing more than the execution of the legal norms of Article 2 of the Law of 9 April 1992 on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania.

The Prosecutor General\u2019s decision states that, taking into consideration the conclusions set out in the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling to the effect that retroactive prosecution for genocide of persons belonging to a political or social group was in breach of the principle of the rule of law, it had to be ascertained whether the applicant and his co-accused, M.\u017d., were to be considered innocent, guilty of genocide or, as another alternative, whether they might have committed some other criminal activity. A prosecutor from the Office of the Prosecutor General was appointed to examine those newly discovered circumstances.",

On the same date the Supreme Council adopted the provisional Constitution \u2013 the Provisional Fundamental Law of the Republic of Lithuania (Laikinasis Pagrindinis \u012estatymas), setting out the constitutional principles of the re-established independent State of Lithuania. In particular, this Law referred to Lithuania as a sovereign democratic republic, power being vested in the people and exercised by the Supreme Council, the government and the judiciary. Moreover, it provided that all earlier laws and legal acts continued to be in force as long as they were not incompatible with this new Law. This Law remained valid until 2 November 1992. On the basis of the plebiscite held on 9 February 1991, on 11 February 1991 the Supreme Council adopted a Constitutional Law stating that the notion that \u201cthe State of Lithuania is an independent and democratic republic\u201d was a constitutional norm of the Republic of Lithuania and a fundamental principle of the State (see Kuolelis and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 64-65 and\u00a071).",

The trial court in that case established that from 15 September 1952 the applicant had served as an operational agent in the occupational structure, the \u0160akiai district MGB, and \u201cknew its main goal, namely to physically eliminate a part of the inhabitants of Lithuania belonging to a separate national, ethnic and political group, that is, the Lithuanian partisans\u201d. On the night of 23 March 1953, the applicant, acting together with the commanding officers of the Kaunas region \u0160akiai district MGB and with the aim of killing or capturing and deporting the partisans who were hiding at a house in the \u0160akiai district, took part in an operation in which partisan J.B. was injured and arrested. On 20 July 1953 the Vilnius region MGB military tribunal sentenced the partisan in question to twenty-five years of deprivation of liberty. In August 1953 the partisan was deported from Lithuania to a special camp within the territory of the former USSR. The trial court thus held that, through those actions the applicant had taken part in the partisan\u2019s deportation from Lithuania to the territory of the occupying State, thereby unlawfully imprisoning the partisan in a prison camp (lageryje).",

Having reviewed the relevant international-law instruments, including the case-law of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the Constitutional Court took the view that States have a certain discretion, because of particular historical, political, social and cultural contexts, to establish in their domestic law a broader definition of the crime of genocide than that which is established in international law. Thus, political and social groups may be included in the definition of genocide (see point 3.7 of the ruling, Chapter II, part of the reasoning).",

As regards the participants (partisans) of the armed resistance of the Republic of Lithuania against the Soviet occupation, account must also be taken of the fact that the Soviet Union, while ignoring the universally recognised norms of international law, neither recognised their status of combatants and prisoners of war nor provided them with the corresponding international guarantees related to such a status; from the conclusions of the historians that investigated documents of the repressive structures of the interior and security of the USSR it is clear that those structures pursued the targeted policy of the extermination of \u2018bandits\u2019, \u2018terrorists\u2019, and \u2018bourgeois nationalists\u2019 to which they also ascribed the Lithuanian partisans, inter alia, special \u2018extermination\u2019 squads were established and they were used in the fight against the Lithuanian partisans and their supporters.\u201d",

A corroborating argument will be the fate of the rest of the group. The character of the attack on the leadership must be viewed in the context of the fate or what happened to the rest of the group. If a group has its leadership exterminated, and at the same time or in the wake of that, has a relatively large number of the members of the group killed or subjected to other heinous acts, for example deported on a large scale or forced to flee, the cluster of violations ought to be considered in its entirety in order to interpret the provisions of the Convention in a spirit consistent with its purpose.

Although the perpetrators of genocide need not seek to destroy the entire group protected by the Convention, they must view the part of the group they wish to destroy as a distinct entity which must be eliminated as such. A campaign resulting in the killings, in different places spread over a broad geographical area, of a finite number of members of a protected group might not thus qualify as genocide, despite the high total number of casualties, because it would not show an intent by the perpetrators to target the very existence of the group as such. ...\u201d",

While the Chamber does not reject that aspect of the definition, which sees the two elements as being alternative, there may be situations in which the inference as to the intent can not be drawn on the basis of the evidence in relation to each element in isolation, but when the evidence in relation to each is viewed as a whole, it would be perfectly proper to draw the inference.",

The drafters of the Convention also gave close attention to the positive identification of groups with specific distinguishing characteristics in deciding which groups they would include and which (such as political groups) they would exclude. The Court spoke to the same effect in 1951 in declaring as an object of the Convention the safeguarding of \u2018the very existence of certain human groups\u2019 (Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 23). Such an understanding of genocide requires a positive identification of the group. The rejection of proposals to include within the Convention political groups and cultural genocide also demonstrates that the drafters were giving close attention to the positive identification of groups with specific distinguishing well-established, some said immutable, characteristics. A negatively defined group cannot be seen in that way.\u201d",

According to the Government\u2019s submission of 11 April 2014, the procedural step taken for the reopening of the applicant\u2019s criminal case should lead to the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s situation was in the process of being resolved at the national level (they referred to Pisano v.

In its ruling of 18 March 2014, the Constitutional Court had noted the significance of partisans for the entire national group, that is, the Lithuanian nation (see paragraph 63 above).",

The repressive USSR institutions had employed a number of severe measures to suppress the underground movement: deportations of families of resistance members, torture of resistance members, acts of psychological warfare or terror and punitive actions against resistance members and their supporters, such as the burning of villages and extrajudicial executions.

Cassese, P. Gaeta, J.R.W.D. Jones (eds), The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: A Commentary, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002).

As well as the obligation on a State to prosecute drawn from the laws and customs of war, Article\u00a02 of the Convention also enjoins the States to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within their jurisdiction and implies a primary duty to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences which endanger life (see Kononov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0241).",

Following its thorough analysis, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegations as unfounded (see paragraph 37 above). That conclusion was fully endorsed by the Supreme Court (see paragraph\u00a041 above).

That provision does not refer to social or political groups. Furthermore, the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires disclose an intention by the drafters not to include political groups in the list of those protected by the Genocide Convention. The ICJ, when examining the drafting history of Article II of the Genocide Convention in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ((Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 February 2007, ICJ Reports 2007), observed that the drafters of the Convention \u201cgave close attention to the positive identification of groups with specific distinguishing characteristics in deciding which groups they would include and which (such as political groups) they would exclude\u201d (see paragraph 105 above). The Court finds no convincing arguments for departing from the treaty definition of genocide as established in 1948, including the list of the four protected groups referred to therein. On the contrary, all references to the crime of genocide in subsequent international-law instruments \u2013 the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity of 1968, the ICTY Statute of 1993, the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) of 1994, as well as in the most recent international-law instrument \u2013 the ICC Statute of 1998 \u2013 describe that crime in similar, if not identical, terms. In particular, genocide is defined as acts committed to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, without reference to political groups (see paragraphs 83 and 85-87 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the fact that certain States decided later to criminalise genocide of a political group in their domestic laws (see paragraphs 36 and 38 above) does not, as such, alter the reality that the text of the Genocide Convention did not do so.",

The indictment of October 1945 before the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, as well as certain prosecutors\u2019 oral submissions, charged the defendants with genocide, the significance of which is not necessarily undermined by the fact that the final judgment made no mention of the crime of genocide. UN General Assembly Resolution 96 (I) of 11 December 1946, adopted unanimously and without debate, affirmed the existence of the international crime of genocide. There followed several references in indictments to the crime of genocide, and convictions for crimes with genocidal purposes in the post-Nuremberg trials under Control Council Law no. 10 as well as in the trials by the Supreme National Tribunal of Poland (1946-48) of Hoess and Greiser.

Certain authors considered that that Resolution reflects a customary jus cogens prohibition of genocide while others have questioned this view. Some authors were also of the view that the final list of groups to be protected by the Genocide Convention was the result of political expediency and not the result of a principled reflection based on some philosophical or other distinction between certain types of groups. In the late 1940s some commentators also expressed concern that the exclusion of political and economic groups would mean that the Genocide Convention could not address acts committed by the Soviet authorities against property owners.

In this connection, the Court notes that in 1953 there was no case-law by any international tribunal to provide a judicial interpretation of the definition of genocide. The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to the Genocide Convention provide little guidance on what the drafters meant by the term \u201cin part\u201d. The early commentators of the Genocide Convention emphasised that the term \u201cin part\u201d contained a substantiality requirement (see paragraph\u00a093 above). The Genocide Convention itself provides that the crime is characterised by an \u201cintent to destroy, in whole or in part, ... [a] group, as such\u201d, and the substantiality requirement is supported by Resolution 96\u00a0(I) according to which \u201c[g]enocide is the denial of the right of existence of entire human groups\u201d. Bearing in mind that the goal of the Genocide Convention was to deal with mass crimes, the ICTY noted the wide acknowledgment that the intention to destroy must target at least a substantial part of the group (see paragraph 98 above). The gravity of genocide is further reflected in the stringent requirements which must be satisfied before a conviction is imposed \u2013 the demanding proof of specific intent and demonstrating that the group was targeted for destruction in its entirety or in substantial part (see paragraph 106 above). The Court therefore considers it reasonable to find that in 1953 it was foreseeable that the term \u201cin part\u201d contained a requirement as to substantiality.",

This argument is inconsistent with the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires which imply that Article\u00a07 \u00a7 1 can be considered to contain the general rule of non-retroactivity and that Article\u00a07 \u00a7 2 is only a contextual clarification of the liability limb of that rule, included so as to ensure that there was no doubt about the validity of prosecutions after the Second World War in respect of the crimes committed during that war (see Kononov, cited above, \u00a7 186). It is thus clear that the drafters of the Convention did not intend to allow for any general exception to the rule of non-retroactivity. Indeed, the Court has held in a number of cases that the two paragraphs of Article 7 are interlinked and are to be interpreted in a concordant manner (see, for example, Tess v.

The fact that certain States later decided to criminalise within their domestic legislation genocide of a political group as such does not change the reality that the text of the Genocide Convention did not do so. In this context, we observe that one of the most recent binding international treaties which refers to the crime of genocide \u2013 the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court \u2013 defines it as a crime directed at the destruction, in whole or in part, of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, without mentioning political groups (see paragraph\u00a087 of the present judgment).",

The Constitutional Court found that Article 2 of the Law of 9 April 1992 on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania corresponded to the features of genocide as provided for in the norms of international law. In summing up, it noted that the inclusion of social and political groups in the definition of Article 99 of the Criminal Code was determined by \u201ca concrete legal and historical context\u201d, namely, the international crimes committed by the occupational regimes in the Republic of Lithuania at the material time (see paragraphs\u00a058-59 of the present judgment).",

Such a group was protected under Article II of the Genocide Convention. The finding of the Court of Appeal confirms that the very raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the partisans was to protect the Lithuanian nation in the face of a regime which intended to destroy its unique and specific identity. For the Court of Appeal, the Soviet genocide had been carried out precisely on the basis of the criteria of the inhabitants\u2019 nationality/ethnicity. These three groups \u2013 \u201cpolitical\u201d, \u201cnational\u201d and \u201cethnic\u201d \u2013 were intrinsically linked (see paragraph\u00a036 of the present judgment).

Radislav Krsti\u0107 (ICTY-98-33-T, trial judgment, 2\u00a0August 2001), the ICTY Trial Chamber observed that the intent to destroy a group, even if only in part, means seeking to destroy a distinct part of the group as opposed to an accumulation of isolated individuals within it. The perpetrators had to view the part of the group they wished to destroy as \u201ca distinct entity which must be eliminated as such\u201d. The very existence of the group was the target. Moreover, when the killing of men of military age took place in combination with the forcible transfer of civilians, thus having a lasting impact upon the entire group, this could not be considered to be a mere elimination of military resistance (see paragraphs 99-100 of the present judgment).",

Schabas, \u201cGenocide and Crimes against Humanity: Clarifying the Relationship\u201d, in H.G. van der Wilt et al., op. cit., p. 4). Indeed, the Court\u2019s own case-law, notably Jorgic v. Germany (no. 74613/01, ECHR 2007III), reflects this reality. In that case, the German domestic courts had adopted a wider interpretation of the definition of acts of genocide. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) stated in Prosecutor v. Radoslav Br\u0111anin (ICTY-99-36-T, trial judgment, 1 September 2004, \u00a7\u00a0682) that the \u201cgroups are not clearly defined in the Genocide Convention or elsewhere\u201d.",

First of all, it should be recalled that the Genocide Convention was adopted in reaction to the proceedings at the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal and to the limitations therein, whereby crimes against humanity were linked to wartime (see Resolution 96 (I) referring to genocide having been committed in the past; see also K. Inku\u0161a, \u201cMass Deportations of 1949 in Latvia as a Crime Against Humanity\u201d, Baltic Yearbook of International Law, volume 9, 2009, p. 83). It was therefore necessary to break out of this situation, since the most heinous crimes could also be committed in times of peace and against a State\u2019s own population. That was the purpose of the Convention prohibiting genocide. Secondly, the entire debate about the definition of genocide is a distinct issue which continues to be examined and developed by international and domestic courts. Despite the many complexities surrounding the definition of genocide, the words of R.\u00a0Lemkin cited above (see paragraph 2) transmit the very essence of the crime. The definition of genocide as adopted in the Genocide Convention prohibiting certain acts with \u201cintent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national ... group\u201d does not limit or contradict R. Lemkin\u2019s description of the essence of genocide.",

Due to the international political climate after the Second World War, the Baltic resistance did not receive any foreign assistance. The purpose of resistance was to fight for the independence and survival of the nations which had just experienced the 1941 Soviet deportations, the Nazi occupation and the unlawful return of Soviet power, accompanied by another wave of mass deportations (see Larionovs and Tess v. Latvia (dec.), nos. 45520/04 and\u00a019363/05, 25 November 2014). At the same time, this war had no prospects of success and was thus even more essential for upholding the national spirit. The Lithuanian Constitutional Court has correctly summed up the purpose and the nature of the resistance war (see paragraph 63 of the present judgment). It is also interesting to note that the MGB (Ministry of State Security), of which the applicant was a member, referred to the fight against bandits and the \u201cnationalist underground\u201d.

The real question before the Court, however, is whether national partisans formed \u2013 in terms of their role and number \u2013 a group whose continuous existence was essential for the survival of the Lithuanian nation. In other words, the Court should have been able to distinguish between, on the one hand, a prominent part of a national group being targeted for political, social or, in any event, discriminatory reasons, and, on the other, a political group, plain and simple. There is nothing in the history of outlawing genocide which would exclude from its scope an intention to destroy in part or as a whole a (national) group for political and otherwise discriminatory purposes.

The Court has taken into account \u2013 among other international case-law \u2013 the ICJ\u2019s two leading judgments as concerns the interpretation of the words \u201cin part\u201d in the Genocide Convention (see paragraph 106 of the present judgment).

I have serious reservations as to whether the Court\u2019s conclusions in paragraphs 176 and 177 are compatible with the ICJ\u2019s explanation of the words \u201cin part\u201d, which in the ICJ\u2019s interpretation are clearly more nuanced.

It is self-evident that the Lithuanian legislation of 1992 or 2004 was not in force on Lithuanian territory in 1953, for the simple reason that the State was occupied by foreign forces. The principle adopted by the Court in comparable cases involving Germany or Latvia is that criminal proceedings brought following a change of regime in respect of crimes committed under the previous regime are, in principle, compatible with the Convention, provided that the Article 7 standard is met. The test under Article 7 in cases involving a change of political regime or State sovereignty over a territory is not a negative one; in other words, a violation of Article 7 occurs where a State brings a prosecution on the basis of the new law because, in formal terms, the law is indeed new unless some special circumstances exclude that violation. Judges Rozakis, Tulkens, Spielmann and Jebens summed up the Court\u2019s principle very correctly in their concurring opinion in Kononov when they stated: \u201cHence no one can speak of retrospective application of substantive law, when a person is convicted, even belatedly, on the basis of rules existing at the time of the commission of the act.\u201d The assessment of compliance with Article 7 begins with the question of which rules, under either domestic or international law, governed the acts under investigation at the time those acts were committed.

Interestingly, the Court itself raises a doubt as to its own limited approach to the interpretation of the words \u201cin part\u201d (see paragraph 17 above). Furthermore, the Court accepts that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s argument is not without weight, namely that his actions, and those of the MGB, were aimed at the extermination of the partisans as a separate and clearly identifiable group, characterised by its armed resistance to Soviet power\u201d (see paragraph 182 of the present judgment). This latter position by the Court is particularly striking. Does it mean that the Court accepts arbitrary killings of combatants, assuming that partisans were combatants, or that it accepts extrajudicial killings? In Kononov, with reference to its long line of case-law, the Court pointed to the due-diligence principle in Article 2 cases. Given the context and the scale of the acts of extermination of the Baltic nations by the Soviet repressive structures following the Second World War, there is no question that investigations and prosecutions could be initiated into crimes against humanity or genocide (with regard to events in Lithuania, see paragraph 62 of the present judgment). In this context, it is particularly strange to find the Court giving weight to the argument that the arbitrary killing of those resisting Soviet power was, as it were, in the nature of political confrontation.",

The Court of Appeal, which had final jurisdiction on the facts, stated that the trial court\u2019s attribution of the Lithuanian partisans to the political group alone was relative and not precise. The Court of Appeal established that, on account of the massive repression of the Lithuanian nation, \u201cLithuanian partisans could be attributed not only to political, but also to national and ethnic groups, that is to say, to the groups listed in the Genocide Convention\u201d (see paragraph 36 of the present judgment). The Supreme Court, which did not have competence to establish facts, did not overrule the interpretation of Article 99 of the Criminal Code and its application to the facts as carried out by the Court of Appeal. It explained further the legislative history of Article 99 and fine-tuned its interpretation. It held that this Article must be read in the light of the Law of 9 April 1992 on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania, which Law had taken verbatim the definition of genocide from the 1948 Convention. Most importantly, the Supreme Court explained that the inclusion expressis verbis of social and political groups in Article\u00a099 had not been intended to expand the definition of genocide of the 1992 Law (see paragraph 38 of the present judgment). This is a perfectly understandable legislative development, given how the Soviet regime targeted the Lithuanian nation. It identified social and active political groups existing within the nation and forming its backbone. I should point out that the groups within the nation as identified by the Lithuanian legislature in Article 99 correspond to the groups identified in the Soviet regime\u2019s detailed plan to destroy the national resistance against its foreign occupation. All this was explained to the Court by the Government in their observations (pp. 9-13) and is clear from the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning, especially that of the Constitutional Court. The latter specifically stated that \u201cthe actions carried out during a certain period against certain political and social groups of the residents of the Republic of Lithuania might be considered to constitute genocide if such actions \u2013 provided this has been proved \u2013 were aimed at destroying the groups that represented a significant part of the Lithuanian nation and whose destruction had an impact on the survival of the entire Lithuanian nation\u201d (see paragraph\u00a059 of the present judgment).",

They do not describe an investigation into certain criminal activities and the bringing of suspects before the courts (see paragraphs 18-19 of the present judgment). I believe that the applicant\u2019s argument before the Court of Appeal is of interest. He did not submit that the killing of the two partisans was a random act. Be that as it may, these questions of fact \u2013 and the interpretation of the domestic law \u2013 are not matters for the European Court of Human Rights. The Court has clearly stated that, in principle, \u201cit is not its task to substitute itself for the domestic jurisdictions. It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation ... This also applies where domestic law refers to rules of general international law or international agreements. The Court\u2019s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention\u201d (see Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999I).
