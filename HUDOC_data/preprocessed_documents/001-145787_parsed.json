He had been unable to explain from where exactly the detainees named by him had seen his search. The Court of Appeal concluded that his privacy had not been violated. It further found that in order to effectively manage a large number of detainees, the prison also had to have the possibility of carrying out a body search of a detainee, when necessary, in a location other than a private room designated for that purpose. In order to conduct such a search it was sufficient that the authorities had a suspicion that a detainee re-entering the building after a walk had hidden cigarettes \u2013 which were prohibited in prison \u2013 in his underwear.",

He considered that it was not decisive whether the third persons had in fact seen the detainee\u2019s body search. It could not be presumed that a person who was being searched was able to establish at the same time whether the search had been seen, what exactly had been seen and by whom. When a body search was carried out in a situation and location where it was not guaranteed that third persons would not see the person\u2019s nudity, the person concerned was bound to feel that his privacy had not been respected and that other persons might have seen the procedure being performed. Such a situation damaged the person\u2019s dignity and could cause feelings of insecurity, anguish and degradation.",

Poland, no.\u00a025196/94, \u00a7 59, 15 November 2001). However, where the manner in which a search is carried out has debasing elements which significantly aggravate the inevitable humiliation of the procedure, Article 3 has been engaged, for example, where a male prisoner was obliged to strip in the presence of a female officer, and his sexual organs and food were touched with bare hands (Vala\u0161inas, loc. cit.), and where a search was conducted in front of four guards who derided and verbally abused the prisoner (Iwa\u0144czuk, loc. cit.). Similarly, where the search has no established connection with the preservation of prison security and the prevention of crime or disorder, issues may arise (see, for example, Iwa\u0144czuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59, where a search of the applicant, a remand prisoner detained on charges of non-violent crimes, was conducted when he wished to exercise his right to vote, and Van der Ven, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62, where strip-searching was a systematic and long-term practice without convincing security needs). Where the treatment in question does not reach the minimum level of severity prohibited by Article 3, it may nevertheless be in breach of the requirements under Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Wainwright, cited above, \u00a7 46; Julin, cited above, \u00a7 185; and Voloshyn v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 15853/08, \u00a7 53, 10 October 2013).",

The Court notes that it has not been argued that the purpose of the body search was to degrade the applicant. Furthermore, it observes that the search was performed by two prison officers of the same sex; the applicant\u2019s sexual organs were not touched by the officers; no allegations have been made about any verbal abuse by the officers who conducted the search; and the applicant was not searched in front of other detainees. Although the applicant, like all detainees, was in a vulnerable position in the hands of the authorities, he was not in a particularly helpless situation (compare and contrast, Wieser v. Austria, no.\u00a02293/03, \u00a7\u00a040, 22\u00a0February 2007, and Wiktorko v. Poland, no. 14612/02, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54, 31 March 2009). Thus, the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s body search in the present case did not involve elements which have led it in several previous cases to find that a prisoner\u2019s or detainee\u2019s strip search amounted to degrading treatment. The Court also notes that the applicant\u2019s complaint relates to a body search on one occasion, unlike in the cases of Ciupercescu v. Romania (no. 35555/03, 15\u00a0June 2010), Van der Ven (cited above), Lors\u00e9 and Others v. the Netherlands (no. 52750/99, 4 February 2003), and McFeeley and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, (no. 8317/78, Commission decision of 15 May 1980, Decisions and Reports 20, p. 44), or a number of searches, as in the cases of El Shennawy v.

At the same time, it considers that a requirement cannot be derived from Article 8 of the Convention that a body search that is not carried out in a special room is in breach of that provision. Rather, regard must be had to the specific circumstances of the case, including the exigencies of prison security as well as the physical features of the location of the search. In this connection, the Court finds that there is some force in the Government\u2019s argument that the search had to be carried out on entry to the building in order to prevent the prisoners from hiding or handing over unauthorised items. Thus, the Court does not exclude that a body search in a corridor or in a stairwell of a prison building immediately after a prisoner\u2019s entry could be acceptable provided that the procedure is carried out with due respect for the prisoner\u2019s privacy.",

The Court reiterates that it is not its task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them (see, for example, Klaas v. Germany, 22\u00a0September 1993, \u00a7 29, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0269). However, the Court considers that the question whether any fellow prisoner actually observed the applicant\u2019s search is not of decisive importance. A person\u2019s perception that he was exposed undressed to the view of others can, in the Court\u2019s opinion, create in him a strong sensation that his privacy has been disrespected, regardless of whether someone in fact saw him. Mindful that the strip search in question was performed in a stairwell accessed through two doors with uncovered transparent glass windows, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s feeling of disrespect for his privacy was not unfounded. It concludes that in the circumstances of the case the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life was interfered with in a disproportionate manner, and there has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.",
