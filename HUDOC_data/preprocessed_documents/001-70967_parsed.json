However, this general rule is subject to an exception when the national authorities have acknowledged either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see, inter alia, Eckle v. Germany, judgment of 15\u00a0July 1982, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a051, p.\u00a030, \u00a7\u00a066; Jansen v.

In\u00a0cases concerning the failure to observe the reasonable-time requirement guaranteed by Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, the national authorities can afford adequate redress in particular by reducing the applicant\u2019s sentence in an express and measurable manner (see Eckle, cited above, p.\u00a030, \u00a7\u00a066; Beck, cited above, \u00a7\u00a027). In the Court\u2019s view, such a mitigation of the sentence is also capable of affording adequate redress for a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 in cases in which the national authorities had failed to hear the case of an applicant held in pre-trial detention within a reasonable time.",

Complying with the decision of the Federal Court of Justice of 11\u00a0September 2003, the  mainly argued that the reduction of the applicant\u2019s sentence had become necessary because his right under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention to a hearing within a reasonable time had been violated.

The Federal Court of Justice\u2019s decision dated 17\u00a0March 2005, which affirmed the \u2019s judgment, does not provide further information on this issue.

In the specific circumstances of the case I consider this to be an artificial approach. In a case like this the violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (a person in detention in remand has the right to a trial within a reasonable time) and Article 6 \u00a7 1 (in the determination of a criminal charge against him everyone has the right to a hearing within a reasonable time) are interconnected. The requirement of a speedy trial, as laid down in Article 5 \u00a7 3 is a kind of lex specialis to the overall requirement of a speedy trial as laid down in the lex generalis of Article 6 \u00a7 1: when a person is detained in remand, the hearing should be particularly speedy. In this case the two periods to be taken into account more or less coincide. In my opinion one overall \u2018overtime\u2019-reduction in the sentence suffices. Further specifications can be kept out of the books.",
