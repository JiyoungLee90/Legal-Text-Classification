It considered that the courts had a duty to examine every two months whether reasons for detention persisted and, depending on the circumstances, extend it or lift it. There was no obligation on the courts to specify how long the detention would last, given their obligation to re-examine the duration of the detention every two months. Those statutory time-limits, however, were not mandatory and the fact that the decision had been issued after two months and four days could not therefore be decisive for concluding that the applicant\u2019s right to liberty had been violated.",

Two exercise bikes in two small single readapted cells could be used for one hour a week by inmates in need of physical rehabilitation.

The Court reiterates that the obligation of the national authorities to ensure the health and general well-being of inmates includes, inter alia, the obligation to properly feed prisoners (see, mutatis mutandis, Ila\u015fcu and Others v.\u00a0Moldova and\u00a0Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, \u00a7 451, ECHR 2004VII, and Moisejevs v.\u00a0Latvia, no. 64846/01, \u00a7 78, 15 June 2006).

This was accepted by the IECS (see paragraph 28 above), and confirmed by the Government (see paragraph 157 above). While it would have been preferable if the prescribed diet could have been provided by the IECS itself, an element which might, viewed alone, be of concern, the Court notes however that the applicant was not left altogether without the adequate food, but that the respondent State took measures in order to overcome the encountered situation, albeit with the assistance of the applicant\u2019s family.",

However, the Court acknowledges that there might be situations where a prisoner has to be taken to a medical facility outside prison to receive treatment which the prison itself does not or cannot provide. Such situations may inevitably entail a risk of prisoners absconding or posing a danger either to themselves or to someone else (for example, medical personnel or other patients). The Court is also mindful of the fact that medical staff in ordinary public hospitals cannot be expected to have the same level of preparedness and training as prison officers to deal with possible risks posed by prisoners\u2019 unpredictable or violent behaviour. The State authorities must be particularly vigilant when they have sufficient prior knowledge about the possible danger the prisoner might pose, in particular those, like the applicant, who have been convicted of the most serious types of offences, like aggravated murder (for example, previous attempts to escape or violent behaviour) (see A.T. v.\u00a0Estonia, no. 23183/15, \u00a7 59, 13 November 2018).",

However, the Court again reiterates that it does not consider, in the particular circumstances of the present case, that it is justified in viewing this aspect in isolation from the entire medical assistance that was indeed provided to the applicant for a considerable period of time. In these circumstances, on the basis of the evidence before it and assessing the relevant facts as a whole, the Court therefore concludes that the presence of prison guards during the medical examinations did not, alone, attain a sufficient level of severity to entail a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kud\u0142a v.

That standard requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Steel and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, \u00a7 54, Reports 1998VII).",

While the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk that an accused might abscond, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Idalov v.

Firstly, when the applicant had first applied for release, on 1\u00a0August 2014, the case had been pending before the Court of Appeal and he had lodged his application with the High Court. Secondly, Article 179 \u00a7 2, on which he had relied, referred only to the proceedings before the first-instance court, and not to those before the Court of Appeal. Thirdly, the application had been forwarded by the High Court to the Court of Appeal on 4 September 2014, and on 13\u00a0February 2015 the Court of Appeal, at one of its hearings, had dismissed it. Therefore, it had ruled speedily on his application, especially given that the applicant had invoked his state of health and the conditions of his detention, and that the court had had to examine all the relevant documentation and hear a medical expert witness. It had been a procedural decision, issued not as a separate document, but as an integral part of the minutes during the main hearing at which the applicant\u2019s representatives had been present. The Government urged the Court to find the applicant\u2019s complaint manifestly ill-founded or, alternatively, that there had been no violation.",

In particular, where a decision depriving a person of his liberty was taken by an administrative body, Article 5 \u00a7 4 obliges the Contracting States to make available to the detained person a right of recourse to a court. There is nothing, however, to indicate that the same applies when the decision is made by a court at the close of judicial proceedings. In the latter case the supervision required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 is incorporated in the decision (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 77, Series A no. 22); this is so, for example, where a sentence of imprisonment is pronounced after \u201cconviction by a competent court\u201d.",

While the Supreme Court, on 2 April 2014, quashed the judgment of the Court of Appeal, it did not quash the judgment of the High Court convicting the applicant (see paragraph 25 above). Therefore, his detention at the relevant time ensued from his \u201cconviction by a competent court\u201d, notably the High Court on 9 October 2012. Accordingly, this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and is rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(a) and\u00a04 of the Convention.",
