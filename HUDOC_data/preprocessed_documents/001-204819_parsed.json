The prosecutor explained that assumption by the following considerations: firstly, that the forensic medical examination of the applicant had taken place about eight days after the end of his detention in the Kitsman police station; and, secondly, that the applicant had not complained of ill-treatment at the time. Neither of those arguments stands up to scrutiny. After his detention in the Kitsman police station the applicant had been transferred to the Chernivtsi ITT and had therefore remained under the control of the police (see paragraph 16 above). The implication that the applicant might have sustained his injuries after his detention in the Kitsman police station still placed an obligation on the State to investigate what had happened and punish those responsible. Furthermore, the Court finds it difficult to understand how the applicant could be reproached for his failure to complain of ill-treatment during a three-day period when he had been under the full control of those who had allegedly ill-treated him and without any legal assistance. He did complain as soon as a lawyer was appointed to represent him (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above).",

A representative\u2019s fees are considered to have been actually incurred if the applicant has paid them or is liable to pay them. The opposite is the case with respect to the fees of a representative who, without waiving them, has simply taken no steps to pursue their payment or has deferred it. The fees payable to a representative under a conditional-fee agreement are actually incurred only if that agreement is enforceable in the respective jurisdiction (see Merabishvili v.
