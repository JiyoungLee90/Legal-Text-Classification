The case originated in two applications (nos. 43899/13 and 43903/13) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Romanian nationals, Mr Florea Iordan (“the first applicant” and Mrs Veronica Iordan (“the second applicant”), on 28 June 2013.
The applicants were represented by Mr I. Matei, a lawyer practising in Bucharest. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 14 February 2014 the complaints concerning the effectiveness of the criminal investigation, the length of criminal proceedings and the lack of an effective domestic remedy were communicated to the Government and the remaining parts of the applications were declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court. As Iulia Antoanella Motoc, the judge elected in respect of Romania, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 § 3 of the Rules of Court), the President decided to appoint Krzysztof Wojtyczek as an ad hoc judge (Rule 29 § 2 of the Rules of Court).
The applicants were born in 1939 and 1944 respectively and live in Dumbrăvița, Timiș County.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, refer to the same context and domestic criminal proceedings as those described in Association “21 December 1989” and Others v. Romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 May 2011) and Şandru and Others v. Romania (no. 22465/03, §§ 7-47, 8 December 2009).
Between 17 and 28 December 1989 many people, including the applicants’ son, participated in anti-communism demonstrations in Timișoara, Bucharest and other cities in Romania.
The applicants’ son was killed by gunfire on 23 December 1989 in Timișoara.
In 1990 the military prosecutor’s office opened several investigations into the December 1989 armed crackdown on the anti-communism demonstrations. A main criminal investigation concerning the use of violence against civilians in Bucharest and other cities was also registered with the highest prosecutor’s office – the military prosecutors section − under no. 97/P/1990 (current number 11/P/2014).
In cases concerning the events in Timișoara, a separate investigation was carried out under file no. 11/P/1996, culminating in the referral to court and subsequent conviction of senior military officers by a decision of the High Court of Cassation and Justice of 3 April 2007, which became final on 15 October 2008. As is apparent from the documents submitted by the parties, the death of the applicants’ son did not form part of this investigation, but in the court proceedings the first applicant nonetheless lodged a civil claim regarding his son’s death during the December 1989 events. The court dismissed it on the grounds that he had failed to submit documents substantiating this claim.
As acknowledged by the Government, both applicants are parties in the main criminal investigation file. On 26 June 2013 they brought civil claims before the prosecutor requesting the right to participate, being civil parties in this file. The applicants had first made statements and raised civil claims in criminal investigation files other than file no. 97/P/1990 (current number 11/P/2014) on 11 January 1990 and 1 March 2000. The parties did not inform the Court whether these files had been joined to the main criminal investigation (see paragraph 8 above).
The most important steps taken by the prosecutors in the main criminal investigation are summarised in Association “21 December 1989” and Others (cited above, §§ 12-41) and AnamariaLoredana Orășanu and Others v. Romania ([Committee] nos. 43629/13 and 74 others, §§ 1011, 7 November 2017). Further developments are as follows.
On 14 October 2015 the prosecutor’s office closed the main investigation, finding that the offences of homicide and instigation to homicide of which the applicants’ son had been a victim had become statutebarred.
Although the parties have not communicated any information regarding the lodging of an appeal against this decision, it is apparent from the prosecutor’s office website that it was subsequently quashed and to date the main criminal investigation is still ongoing (see AnamariaLoredana Orășanu and Others, cited above, § 11).
The relevant domestic laws are mentioned in Association “21 December 1989” and Others (cited above, §§ 95-100); Mocanu and Others v. Romania ([GC] nos. 10865/09 and 2 others, §§ 193196, ECHR 2014 (extracts)); and AnamariaLoredana Orășanu and Others (cited above, §§ 1214).
