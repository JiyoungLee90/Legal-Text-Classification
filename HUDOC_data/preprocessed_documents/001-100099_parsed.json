The use of force had been aimed at driving the applicant into submission and making him confess to criminal offences. As a result of the ill-treatment the applicant had received the following injuries: numerous bruises and abrasions, a rib fracture, a deformation of the left shoulder-blade and feet trauma ultimately resulting in polyarthritis with degenerative-dystrophic changes and functional impairment in both feet. Moreover, the applicant had developed a chronic post-traumatic psychiatric disorder as a consequence of the ill-treatment.

In particular, it had been established that between 22\u00a0January and 7\u00a0April 2001 the applicant had been repeatedly subjected to severe beatings and electric shocks, gas-mask torture, hanging in the air by means of a rope attached to the wrists, and threats of rape and murder, and had been spat at and forced to apologise on his knees for killing a policeman. As a result of the ill-treatment he had suffered considerable pain and humiliation, had received serious injuries, in particular rib fracture and deformation of his feet, and had developed a chronic psychiatric disorder. His health had been seriously undermined and he had become disabled. He had moreover been forced to confess to a crime which he had not committed. The court found that the applicant had been subjected to ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention and awarded him compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage in the amount of RUB 450,000 (about 12,500 euros (EUR)) against the Ministry of Finance.

In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a024888/94, \u00a7\u00a071, ECHR 1999-IX).",

However, in cases of wilful illtreatment the violation of Articles 2 or 3 cannot be remedied exclusively through an award of compensation to the victim. This is so because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful ill-treatment by State agents to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough to prosecute and punish those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Vladimir Romanov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a078 and 79, and Nikolova and Velichkova v. , no.\u00a07888/03, \u00a7\u00a7 55 and\u00a056, 20\u00a0December 2007).

Criminal proceedings were ultimately opened in October 2001, that is eight months after the first complaint about ill-treatment lodged by the applicant. In the Court's view, the belated commencement of the criminal proceedings resulted in the loss of precious time which could not but have a negative impact on the success of the investigation (see Mikheyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0114).",

The investigation into the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment was conducted by the prosecutor's office of the Lipetsk Region. However, according to the applicant, investigators from that office, Mr Andreyev and Mr Ibiyev, had been present during the ill-treatment, had urged him to confess and had threatened that the ill-treatment would continue until he admitted his involvement in the murder. Given that the investigation was conducted by the prosecutor's office, whose officials were allegedly implicated in the mistreatment of the applicant, it cannot be regarded as independent. The Court attaches particular weight to the fact that the applicant's requests for criminal proceedings to be opened against Mr\u00a0Andreyev and Mr Ibiyev were examined by their colleagues who had carried out an internal inquiry and refused to open criminal proceedings against them. The Court considers that the internal inquiry could not be regarded as adequate for the purposes of Article 3 (see Ja\u0161ar v. the  (dec.), no.\u00a069908/01, 11\u00a0April\u00a02006). Accordingly, the scope of the criminal proceedings was limited to the conduct of the police officers of Dolgorukovskoe police station. No independent investigation was ever conducted in respect of Mr\u00a0Andreyev and Mr Ibiyev, the investigators from the prosecutor's office of the Lipetsk Region, that would have allowed the applicant's allegations against them to be verified and their role in the events complained of to be established.",

Thus, the only investigative measure conducted before the end of 2001 was the questioning of two police officers involved in the applicant's arrest. The medical examination of the applicant was performed in January to March 2002, while the applicant and his cellmates were questioned for the first time in May and June 2002, that is more than a year after the alleged ill-treatment. No further action was taken until 2003 when one of the investigators accused by the applicant and counsel for the applicant were questioned and the charges were brought against the police officers of Dolgorukovskoe police station. Several more investigative measures were taken in 2004, but it appears from the documents in the Court's possession that during that same year the investigation was prone to delays, the investigative authorities sometimes remaining idle for months. Further delays accumulated during the trial stage that started in March 2005 and lasted for more than two and a half years, to which was added a new six-month period of inactivity between the pronouncement of the first-instance judgment and the appeal hearing. As a result of those delays the police officers were not finally convicted and sentenced until June 2008, that is about seven years after their wrongful conduct. The Court is not convinced by the Government's argument that the length of the criminal proceedings was accounted for by the complexity of the case. It considers that their inordinate duration was due to the substantial delays in the conduct of the investigation and trial that were attributable to the authorities. This manner of proceeding appears unacceptable to the Court, considering that the case concerned a serious instance of police violence and thus required a swift reaction by the authorities (see Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7 59).",

This is essential for maintaining public confidence, ensuring adherence to the rule of law and preventing any appearance of tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts (see Okkal\u0131 v. Turkey, no.\u00a052067/99, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2006XII (extracts)). The important point for the Court to review, therefore, is whether and to what extent the national authorities have done everything within their powers to prosecute and punish the police officers responsible for the ill-treatment and whether they have imposed adequate and deterring sanctions on them. For this reason, although the Court should grant substantial deference to the national courts in the choice of appropriate sanctions for ill-treatment by State agents, it must exercise a certain power of review and intervene in cases of manifest disproportion between the gravity of the act and the punishment imposed. Were it to be otherwise, the States' duty to carry out an effective investigation would lose much of its meaning, and the right enshrined by Article 3, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 123; Atalay v.

However, the domestic courts chose to impose on the police officers sentences that were below the statutory minimum and to suspend those sentences in respect of four of the officers. The only reason for reducing the sentences was the fact that the police officers had been awarded medals for excellent police service and had positive references from their superiors (see paragraph 75 above). The Court, however, cannot accept those arguments as justifying imposition of lenient sentences on the police officers, who had been found guilty of a particularly serious case of prolonged torture, causing severe and irreparable damage to the applicant's health. The sentences imposed on the police officers must therefore be regarded as manifestly disproportionate to the gravity of the acts committed by them. By punishing the officers with lenient sentences more than seven years after their wrongful conduct, the State in effect fostered the law-enforcement officers' \u201csense of impunity\u201d instead of showing, as it should have done, that such acts could in no way be tolerated (see, for similar reasoning, G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 123 and\u00a0124; Atalay, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040 to 44; Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a073 to 75; and Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060 to 63).",

Secondly, the Court doubts that it was feasible for the defendants, who had been handcuffed in twos and were closely surrounded by the escorts in the limited space of the staircase, to launch an attack. Further, the escorts had an explicit order from the judge to use force against the defendants in order to bring them into the hearing room. In those circumstances, it might be reasonably supposed that the escorts complied with that order and used rubber truncheons as soon as they saw the defendants stop in their pace and turn round, as described by Mr Sh. (see paragraph 93 above). Finally, the Court finds it significant that in his decision not to open criminal proceedings against the escorts the prosecutor refrained from making any clear statements as to the existence or otherwise of an attack on the escorts. Instead he used circumspect wording from which it appears that the force was used in response to the defendants' failure to comply with the escorts' order to proceed to the hearing room rather than in response to an attack on the escorts (see paragraph 96 above). The above considerations lead the Court to regard the Government's version of the events with caution.",

The escorts knew that the defendants were unwilling to proceed to the hearing room and must have foreseen a possibility of resistance on their part. The Court cannot but criticise the arrangements made by the escorts who, in a situation of manifest tension conductive to confrontation, chose to transfer the defendants together instead of conveying each of them separately in order to reduce the risk of aggression. The Court considers that the failure by the escorts to ensure that the defendants' transfer was made in safe and orderly conditions was a factor which by its very nature must have increased the risk of altercation and, consequently, the risk of use of retaliatory force by the escorts.",

An attack by the defendants could not therefore have been very dangerous for the escorts. Although the Court accepts that some physical force might have been necessary to repress an attack and calm the attackers down, it is not convinced that the use of rubber truncheons was warranted in the circumstances. It notes in this respect that the applicant was hit by truncheons at least several times and was also slapped and kicked. The beatings continued after the alleged attack had been repelled and the defendants had resumed their way up the stairs in the direction of the hearing room. Moreover, according to the applicant's mother, who witnessed the incident, the blows did not stop even after the applicant had fallen on the handrail and fainted. He had then been dragged across the floor by the escorts (see paragraph 83 above). The Government did not challenge that aspect of the applicant's factual submissions, although it was open to them to refute these allegations by way of witness testimony or other evidence if they considered them untrue.

Firstly, no forensic medical examination was carried out, and this apparently prevented the establishment of the quantity and nature of the applicant's injuries.\u00a0The Court reiterates in this respect that proper medical examinations are an essential safeguard against ill-treatment. The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and have been allocated a mandate which is sufficiently broad in scope (see Akko\u00e7 v. Turkey, nos.\u00a022947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7\u00a055 and \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000-X). The Court notes with concern that the lack of confirmed injuries was subsequently relied on, in the prosecutor's decision of 15 July 2002, as a ground for the refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the escorts. That finding is unusual as it contradicts the diagnoses contained in the medical certificate issued by the head of  hospital No. 4 (see paragraph 85 above). However, in the absence of any explanations in the decision of 15 July 2002, it is impossible to ascertain whether the prosecutor simply chose to disregard that medical certificate or whether he intended to dismiss it as inadmissible evidence because it had not been analysed or confirmed by a forensic expert. In any event, the failure to perform a forensic medical examination of the applicant seriously undermined the effectiveness of the investigation.",

There were serious contradictions in the testimony of those witnesses as to precisely what had happened, especially as to whether there had been an attack on the escorts by the applicant and his co-defendants. However, despite discrepancies in the witness testimony, the investigating authorities disregarded the importance of establishing the exact circumstances of the incident and did not take any effective steps to clarify the points on which the witnesses either disagreed or failed to provide a complete account. This could have been accomplished by, inter alia, posing specific questions to the witnesses with a view to clarifying specific details of the sequence and timing of how events unfolded, conducting face-to-face confrontations between those witnesses who gave conflicting testimony, seeking to identify and question other eyewitnesses to the incident, such as, for example, counsel for the applicant and his codefendants, court clerks or ushers who were present in the court building at the material time, examining the location in which the incident took place or carrying out a forensic simulation in order to reconstruct the circumstances of the incident and verify the statements by the witnesses.
