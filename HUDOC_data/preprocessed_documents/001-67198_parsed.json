He said that he had been the victim of defamatory statements made by the defendants to the national judicial and other authorities as well as to private persons who had taken part in the proceedings. According to the applicant, the courts involved in the guardianship proceedings had not accepted his repeated requests to be allowed to intensify his contacts with his son, and had not allowed the latter to express his views to the courts. As a result, the applicant's parental rights and his son's rights guaranteed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and by other international treaties had been infringed.",
