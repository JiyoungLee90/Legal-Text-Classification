In this respect the interpretation least favourable to the offender had to be placed on the statement. Objective criticism presupposed that the value-judgment corresponded to unchallenged or proven facts.  The Supreme Court further observed that, under section 1330 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code, the plaintiff had to prove that the discrediting statement was untrue, unless the statement also amounted to an insult; in the latter case, the offender had to prove the truth of the statement concerned. The question whether or not a statement constituted an unlawful interference with a person's reputation could only be assessed by balancing all relevant circumstances.",

The impugned statement had been an answer to a question put by one of the journalists, and, in the circumstances, the Court had no doubt that this statement only related to the particular article of 14 August 1988.  In this context, the applicant's statement was a value-judgment.  In any event, there was no indication as to how the journalist had understood the applicant's reproach \u201cNazi-journalism\u201d.",

The plaintiff could claim an injunction under this provision if, considering all circumstances, the plaintiff's interests were not less important than the applicant's. The Supreme Court found that the plaintiff had an interest not to be associated with National Socialism. The reproach \u201cNazi-journalism\u201d was close to a charge of criminal behaviour under the National Socialism Prohibition Act (Verbotsgesetz). The Supreme Court also noted that the applicant's statement was a reaction to an article published by the plaintiff which contained the assumption that the applicant was suffering from the immune deficiency syndrome, i.e. a contagious disease, which provokes fear and antipathy amongst the majority of the population.  His indignation about the defamatory reporting might appear understandable but could not justify the reproach that the plaintiff's way of reporting came close to criminal behaviour, in particular as he himself could have brought proceedings under section 1330 of the Civil Code against the plaintiff. Balancing all circumstances, the Supreme Court concluded that the applicant's interests did not outweigh the plaintiff's. The right to freedom of expression could not justify such a serious attack on the plaintiff's reputation.  For the same reasons, the impugned statement could not be regarded as permissible political criticism, which is supposed to provoke or shock.  The Supreme Court also noted that, having regard to the applicant's submissions in the course of the proceedings, there was a risk that he would repeat the statement in question.",

He claimed that the \u201cKronen-Zeitung\u201d was, therefore, a \u201cpublic figure\u201d in Austria.

According to the Supreme Court the statement was an answer to a question put by a journalist, related only to the particular article of 14 August 1988, and was a value-judgement.  In the course of the proceedings, the Graz Court of Appeal had relied on expert opinion according to which the defamation of political opponents with an alleged illness was an essential element of the journalism of the Nazi regime.  The Supreme Court noted that Mr Wabl\u2019s statement was a reaction to an article published by the plaintiff which contained the assumption that Mr Wabl was suffering from the immune deficiency syndrome, a contagious disease, which provokes fear and antipathy amongst the majority of the population.  However, the Supreme Court argued that Mr Wabl\u2019s reproach came close to a charge against the publisher of criminal behaviour under the National Socialism Prohibition Act.  The publisher, according to the Supreme Court, had a clear interest not to be associated with National Socialism.  On balance, the Supreme Court concluded that Mr Wabl\u2019s interests did not outweigh the publisher\u2019s.",

In assessing whether such a \u201cneed\u201d exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",

A democratic political debate requires that where a politician is attacked, not for his political views but on a purely personal level, he should not be in a more disadvantageous position than the press, and that he should be allowed sufficient latitude to reply to press attacks.",

Nazism is in essence political although criminalised for its extreme victimisation.  The combat against Nazism can never be only legal, primarily it is a political \u201cbattle\u201d.  The recourse that individuals have to courts - here in Austria - cannot but be a fallback position, especially when the political fight against Nazism and its different methods and manifestations fail or the individuals affected are at a disadvantage in terms of political clout for political confrontation.  I find it necessary in and for a democratic society to permit and encourage a political discourse to prevent the recurrence of Nazism, even if certain statements may be emotional value-judgements.  This is the context in which I consider Mr Wabl\u2019s declaration.  He had participated in a demonstration against the stationing of interceptor fighter planes near the Graz airport when in the course of a police action a police officer charged him with having scratched his right arm.  Where there is blood and infectious diseases can be spread by blood, someone afraid of catching a particular disease may always want a blood-test.  This, however, is a general issue with no special relevance when politician A sees his dentist, politician B is giving birth, etc.  There was absolutely no particular reason in the present case to associate the politician Mr Wabl with the need for an AIDS-test.  This could only be defamatory, and the publisher was convicted for defamation.  There was furthermore expert advice in Austria to the effect that the defamation of political opponents with an alleged illness was an essential element of the journalism of the Nazi regime.",
