However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State\u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants, namely to have proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious, without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see Hornsby\u00a0v.\u00a0, 19 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II).",

The Court notes that the dispute in the present case was between private parties. However, in so far as the judgment of 21 July 2003 ordered the eviction of the IDPs from the applicant\u2019s flat, the situation at hand necessitated action by the State in order to assist the applicant with the enforcement of the judgment when the IDPs, as a private party, refused to comply with it. In the instant case, it is undisputed by the parties that the judgment of 21 July 2003 had been enforceable under the domestic law at least until the delivery of the decision of 2 July 2008 by the Yasamal District Court concerning the postponement of the enforcement proceedings. It appears from the case file that, despite the fact that the enforcement proceedings had been instituted one month after the delivery of the judgment of 21 July 2003, the Government had taken no action in this connection and had not advanced any justification for non-enforcement of the judgment in question during this period.",

Azerbaijan, no. 19853/03, \u00a7\u00a7 45-50, 27\u00a0September 2007). The Court found in that case that the order on the postponement of the judgment\u2019s execution without any lawful basis and justification was in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention; the Court further found that it was not necessary to examine the same complaint under Article 6 in that case. Unlike that case, in the present case the order on the postponement of the execution of the judgment was taken approximately five years after the judgment became final and enforceable. The Court notes that in the instant case the postponement of the execution of the judgment was based on the Presidential Order of 1 July 2004. The Court notes, however, that this Presidential Order did not contain any specific provisions on civil procedure vesting the domestic courts with the competence to postpone indefinitely the execution of judicial eviction orders, which is what happened in the present case. Moreover, the Law of 21 May 1999 provided that if the settlement of the IDPs of their own accord infringed the rights and lawful interests of other persons, the domestic authorities must ensure the resettlement of the IDPs in other accommodation. Accordingly, the relevant presidential order appeared to be contradictory to the legislative act possessing superior force; in such circumstances, a question arises as to the lawfulness of the postponement order based on this Presidential Order. However, from the standpoint of Article 6 of the Convention, the Court is not concerned with the question whether such postponement was \u201clawful\u201d under the domestic law. The Court reiterates that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention would be illusory if the Contracting State\u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party (see \u00a7 32 above). Moreover, a formal postponement of execution of a final judgment for an indefinite period of time without compelling reasons is incompatible with the principle of legal certainty.",

This situation inevitably gives rise to a question which was in fact the root cause of the dispute: how could the competent authorities allocate a flat to the applicant when they knew \u2013 or at least should have known \u2013 that the flat was already occupied by an internally displaced family? Should they not have made sure beforehand that the flat was unoccupied?",
