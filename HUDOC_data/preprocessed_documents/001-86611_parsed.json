However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III, p. 1020, \u00a7 64).",

Hence, they were entitled to an effective domestic remedy in that respect. The Court does not consider that in the circumstances the notion of effective remedy would always go as far as calling for the opening of criminal proceedings against the persons who had carried out the search. Therefore, the refusal of the district prosecutor\u2019s office to investigate the unlawful intrusion into the applicants\u2019 home due to the expiry of the statutory limitation period (see paragraph 54 above) did not in itself amount to a breach of Article 13 (see, mutatis mutandis, Peev v. , no.\u00a064209/01, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2007... (extracts)). However, the Court notes that the Government did not point to any other avenue of redress which the applicants could have used to vindicate their right to respect for their home. They have thus failed to show that any remedies existed in respect of the unlawful search in issue (see, mutatis mutandis, Vereinigung demokratischer Soldaten \u00d6sterreichs and Gubi v.
