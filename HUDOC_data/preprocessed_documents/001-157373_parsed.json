Russia, no. 45100/98, \u00a7\u00a0106, 8\u00a0February 2005, and Letellier v. France, 26 June 1991, \u00a7\u00a043, Series A no.\u00a0207). An important factor in measuring the risk of absconding is the current behaviour of the suspect, and not his formal status as a \u201cperson on a wanted list\u201d (see Yevgeniy Gusev v. Russia, no. 28020/05, \u00a7\u00a085, 5 December 2013).",

In such circumstances the Court has difficulty accepting the argument that there was a risk of interference with the administration of justice. Furthermore, such a risk was bound to gradually decrease as the witnesses were interviewed and the trial proceeded (compare Miszkurka v. Poland, no.\u00a039437/03, \u00a7 51, 4 May 2006). The Court is not therefore persuaded that, throughout the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention, compelling reasons existed for fearing that he might interfere with the witnesses or otherwise hamper the examination of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",
