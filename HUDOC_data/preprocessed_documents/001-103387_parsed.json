Their remains were found on 18\u00a0February 2002, that is, four days later. The Court is not persuaded that in the present case there was a distinct\u00a0long-lasting period during which the applicants sustained the uncertainty, anguish and distress characteristic of the specific phenomenon of disappearances (see, by contrast, Luluyev and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 69480/01, \u00a7 107, ECHR 2006XIII (extracts), and Kukayev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a029361/02, \u00a7\u00a0107, 15\u00a0November 2007). Moreover, there were no specific circumstances in the present case precluding the applicants from burying their loved ones in a proper manner (see, by contrast, Khadzhialiyev and Others v. , no. 3013/04, \u00a7 121, 6 November 2008). The Court thus considers that the moral suffering endured by the applicants has not reached a dimension and character distinct from the emotional distress which may be regarded as inevitably caused to relatives of a victim of a serious human-rights violation (see Nesibe Haran v. Turkey, no.\u00a028299/95, \u00a7\u00a084, 6 October 2005).",
