The court also noted that in the past a family court had handed down a warning and that on 29 May 2012 he had been put under the supervision of a court guardian. In view of those circumstances, it was considered likely that the applicant would be placed in a correctional facility. His placement in the shelter was further justified by the fact that he had threatened one of the victims of the robbery.

The Ombudsman considered that this practice entailed far-reaching consequences for the juveniles concerned. In particular, the lack of a decision prolonging the placement in a detention facility after the case had been referred for a hearing in correctional proceedings implied that such extension could not be appealed against.

The specific deficiencies relating to application of section 27 \u00a7 3 was automatic extension of the detention in the shelter for juveniles in the absence of a separate judicial decision on this matter as well as no specific time-limit for deprivation of liberty.

According to the Ministry of Justice\u2019s data, 340 juveniles who were placed in shelters for juveniles (as of 27 December 2012) may have been affected in a similar way to the applicant. 830 correctional proceedings were initiated in Polish courts per year.

Italy [GC], no.\u00a039748/98, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2004-I). In principle it is not for the Court to determine what may be the appropriate measures of redress for a respondent State to perform in accordance with its obligations under Article\u00a046 of the Convention (see Scozzari and Giunta, cited above; Brum\u0103rescu v.

Furthermore, the amendments to the Juvenile Act introduced by the Law of 30 August 2013 appear not to address the problems identified by the Court in the applicant\u2019s case. In view of the above, the respondent State should undertake legislative or other appropriate measures with a view to eliminating the practice which developed under section 27 of the Juvenile Act as applicable at the relevant time and ensuring that each and every period of the deprivation of liberty of a juvenile is authorised by a specific judicial decision.
