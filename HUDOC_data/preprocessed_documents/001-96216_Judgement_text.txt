The case originated in four applications against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Ukrainian nationals (“the applicants”):
4510/05, lodged on 22 January 2005 by Mrs Zinaida Yevgenyevna Logachova, who was born in 1948 and lives in Illichivsk, Odessa region, ;
13273/05, lodged on 30 March 2005 by Mr Leonid Vladimirovich Ostroverkhov, who was born in 1956 and lives in ;
26704/06, lodged on 20 June 2006 by Mr Aleksandr Ivanovich Gorovenko, who was born in 1937 and lives in Snezhnoye, Donetsk region, ;
30757/06, lodged on 14 July 2006 by Mr Ivan Fedorovich Antipenko, who was born in 1940 and lives in Slovyansk, Donetsk region, .
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 15 October 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to communicate to the Government the applicants' complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention concerning the lengthy non-enforcement of decisions in their favour. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
On various dates each of the applicants received one or more final decisions awarding payments from companies (see appendix for details) in which the State holds at least 25% of the share capital, and instituted enforcement proceedings to collect the payments.
Some of the applicants disagreed with the amounts awarded to them in the above decisions. Mr Ostroverkhov, for instance, appealed against the decision of 26 June 2000 in his favour but it appears that he failed to comply with the procedural requirements and his appeals were rejected. He did not appeal against the decision of 24 May 2002.
After the decisions in the applicants' favour had become final, insolvency or liquidation proceedings against the debtors were initiated. On that account, the State Bailiffs' Service terminated the enforcement proceedings against them and transferred the applicants' writs of enforcement to the relevant bankruptcy trustees or liquidation commissions for further processing. At the end, some of the debtors were liquidated.
The decisions in the applicants' favour remain unenforced.
The relevant domestic law is set out in the judgment of 26 April 2005 in the case of Sokur v. Ukraine (no. 29439/02, §§ 17-22).
