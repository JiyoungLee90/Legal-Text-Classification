It covers, inter alia, the physical and psychological integrity of a person (see, for instance, X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, \u00a7 22, Series A no.\u00a091, Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2002III and G.B. and R.B. v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 16761/09, \u00a7 29, 18\u00a0December 2012). It has also found that \u201cthere is no explicit right in the Convention to a clean and quiet environment, but where an individual is directly and seriously affected by noise or other pollution, an issue may arise under Article 8\u201d (see, for instance, Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1990, \u00a7 40, Series A no. 172, L\u00f3pez Ostra v. Spain, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 303C, Guerra and Others v. Italy, 19\u00a0February 1998, \u00a7 57, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I and Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2003VIII). Moreover, \u201cArticle 8 may apply in environmental cases whether the pollution is directly caused by the State or whether State responsibility arises from the failure to regulate private industry properly. Whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty on the State to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicants\u2019 rights under paragraph 1 of Article 8 or in terms of an interference by a public authority to be justified in accordance with paragraph 2, the applicable principles are broadly similar\u201d (Hatton and Others, cited above, \u00a7 98).",

The question whether a person may still claim to be the victim of an alleged violation of the Convention essentially entails on the part of the Court an ex post facto examination of his or her situation. A decision or measure of the domestic authorities favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive her of her status as a \u201cvictim\u201d unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see, for instance, Ciorap v. Moldova (no.\u00a02), no. 7481/06, \u00a7 18, 20 July 2010). The question whether the victim of a violation of the Convention has received reparation for the damage caused \u2013 comparable to just satisfaction as provided for under Article 41 of the Convention \u2013 is an important issue. It is the Court\u2019s settled case-law that where the national authorities have found a violation and their decision constitutes appropriate and sufficient redress, the party concerned can no longer claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention (see Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 179-181, ECHR 2006V).",

Considering the materials in the file, the Court finds that an interference with the applicant\u2019s rights protected under Article 8 of the Convention has taken place since her physical integrity has been affected by an unhealthy environment (see paragraph 15 above). In assessing whether the Moldovan authorities discharged their positive obligation under that provision, the Court notes that the domestic courts provided a remedy in the form of establishing the company\u2019s responsibility and awarding compensation. Without expressly relying on the Convention but referring to the in-hospital treatment and the physical and mental suffering caused to the applicant (see paragraph 8 above), those courts\u2019 judgments could be interpreted as finding in fact a breach of the applicant\u2019s Article 8 rights, as also argued by the Government (see paragraph 14 above).

However, I do not think that this means that any damage to a person\u2019s health attracts the applicability of Article 8. For that provision to be applicable, I tend to believe that there should be repercussions on the affected person\u2019s private life. It seems to me that in the present case no such repercussions have been put forward (compare, for example, Fadeyeva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 55723/00, \u00a7 88, ECHR 2005IV, where the applicant\u2019s health had deteriorated as a result of her prolonged exposure to an unhealthy situation, thus making her vulnerable to certain health problems).",

Again, in my opinion, not every damage that relates to the environment attracts the applicability of Article 8. For that provision to be applicable, there should be a situation of nuisance which affects the person in his or her private life (see Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1990, \u00a7 40, Series A no. 172; L\u00f3pez Ostra v. Spain, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 303C; and Ta\u015fk\u0131n and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 46117/99, \u00a7 113, ECHR 2004X; see also Kyrtatos v. Greece, no.\u00a041666/98, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2003VI (extracts); and Ivan Atanasov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 12853/03, \u00a7 66, 2 December 2010). Moreover, the nuisance must attain a certain minimum level (Mileva and Others v. Bulgaria, nos.\u00a043449/02 and 21475/04, \u00a7 90, 25 November 2010; Zammit Maempel, cited above, \u00a7 37; Hardy and Maile v. the United Kingdom, no. 31965/07, \u00a7\u00a0188, 14 February 2012; and Dzemyuk v. Ukraine, no. 42488/02, \u00a7 77, 4\u00a0September 2014). In the present case there has been only one incident, and it has not been demonstrated that the illness has affected the applicant in the quality of her private life, except for the period spent in the hospital (see paragraph 19 of the judgment). While I do not question that the applicant has been seriously ill, I do not see the effects on her private life.",
