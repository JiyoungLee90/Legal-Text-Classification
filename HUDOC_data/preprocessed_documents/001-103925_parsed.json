They failed to have due regard to the consequences of the unlawful order of 1996 and the fact that for about nine years the applicant had been in a state of uncertainty as to the full realisation of his right of property. Their holding was apparently based on the underlying proposition that non-pecuniary damage such as stress, frustration and anxiety could only be proved through formal, external evidence, such as medical certificates, and that witness testimony in that respect had to describe the suffering sustained in a particularly precise and concrete manner.",
