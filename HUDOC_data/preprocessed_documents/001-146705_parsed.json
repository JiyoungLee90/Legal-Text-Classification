First, it was not contested by the Government - and the Court accordingly finds it established - that the initial domestic judgment had remained unenforced in the part concerning the lump sum payment by the date of its quashing. As a result of the quashing the applicant was thus prevented from receiving that part of the award through no fault of her own. Second, although the applicant had received several payments of the monthly compensation, after the quashing of the judgment she was deprived of an opportunity to receive the money she had legitimately expected to receive on a monthly basis. The above frustrated the applicant\u2019s reliance on the binding judicial decision and deprived her of an opportunity to receive the judicial award (see Tarnopolskaya and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a011093/07 et al., \u00a7\u00a037, 7\u00a0July 2009) In these circumstances, even assuming that the interference was lawful and pursued a legitimate aim, the Court considers that the quashing of the enforceable judgment of 3\u00a0June 2002 by way of supervisory review placed an excessive burden on the applicant and was incompatible with Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01.",
