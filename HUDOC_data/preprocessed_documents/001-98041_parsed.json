The Court notes that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article\u00a06 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violations found (compare Poznakhirina v. Russia, no. 25964/02, \u00a7 33, 24 February 2005, and Sukhobokov v. Russia, no. 75470/01, \u00a734, 13 April 2006). The applicant was prevented from receiving money he had legitimately expected to receive under the judgment of 28 March 2001 as upheld on 22\u00a0August 2001. The Court, accordingly, considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the said judgment (see, among other authorities, Lesnova v. Russia, no. 37645/04, \u00a7\u00a025, 24 January 2008).",

When the debtor is a private individual or company, the position is different, since the State is not, as a general rule, directly liable for debts of private individuals or companies and its obligations under the Convention are limited to providing the necessary assistance to the creditor in the enforcement of the relevant court awards, for example through a bailiffs' service or insolvency proceedings (see Kesyan v.
