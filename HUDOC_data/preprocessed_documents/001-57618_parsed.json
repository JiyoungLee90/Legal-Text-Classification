Having reviewed the criteria relating to the complexity of the case and to the conduct of the judicial authorities and the parties, the Court must examine the consequences of the trial for the rights and interests at stake. This is one of the factors to be considered, as has often been pointed out by the European Court of Human Rights (Buchholz judgment). In its claim for compensation, the appellant company has given no indication of any consequences of the delay other than the precautionary entry which, in order to cover itself against the outcome of the trial, it had made [in the land register] against security at the time of the civil proceedings, so as to provide for possible compensation of the defendants if they should succeed at trial. Nothing was said about the practical consequences of the length of the trial for the rights and interests of the plaintiff.  The latter confined itself in its submissions to noting the aforementioned effect of the precautionary step provided for in section 42 of the Mortgages Act and \u2018non-pecuniary damage\u2019, about which it remained vague. It thus appears that the time factor was not of primary importance in the instant case. Seeing that only court costs and the amount of the security were involved, it does not seem that this case before the  court merited any priority. If other, more urgent cases were pending, nothing precluded giving them priority and provisionally postponing the decision which is the subject of the present appeal.",
