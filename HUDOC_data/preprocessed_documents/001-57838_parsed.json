Although this admittedly meant that the persons concerned suffered restrictions on the judicial protection of their rights, as they could not challenge in the courts the necessity of the seizure of their assets, it was always open to them to contest the measure in the administrative courts and to ask those courts to refer a question to the Constitutional Court on the constitutional conformity of such action. In addition an appeal (amparo), founded on the right to equality before the law, lay against the final decision of the administrative courts. Finally, the law in issue had in no way deprived the persons concerned of their right to appropriate compensation, a right which they could assert before the Provincial Expropriation Board (jurado provincial d\u2019expropiaci\u00f3n) - the competent administrative body -, and then in the administrative courts.",

The German Government, citing the above-mentioned Buchholz judgment, maintained that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) did not apply to proceedings conducted before such courts. That had been the \u2019s understanding when it had ratified the Convention. They supported the respondent Government\u2019s argument, giving a broad outline of the rules in force in , which are moreover similar to the Spanish provisions. The Portuguese Government took the view that, by reason of their nature, structure and jurisdiction, constitutional courts fell outside the ambit of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",
