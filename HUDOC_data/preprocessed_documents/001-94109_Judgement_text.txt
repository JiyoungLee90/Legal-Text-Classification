The case originated in an application (no. 37215/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Mehmet Aldemir (“the applicant”), on 17 May 2004.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Ertunç, a lawyer practising in İstanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 10 September 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in İstanbul.
On 27 July 2003 the applicant was stabbed by F.Ç. On the same day the police took statements from F.Ç. and the applicant separately. They were both wounded and accused each other of starting the fight. On 29 July 2003 the Bakırköy Forensic Institute delivered its reports on the applicant and F.Ç., which stated that they were unfit for work for ten and seven days respectively. On 31 July 2003 the Bakırköy Public Prosecutor filed an indictment against the applicant and F.Ç. for assault occasioning bodily harm. The indictment was not served on the applicant or F.Ç. On 21 November 2003 the Bakırköy Magistrate’s Court issued a penal order without holding a hearing and found the applicant and F.Ç. guilty as charged. The court fined each of them 462,377,000 Turkish liras. In doing so, it relied on the “simplified procedure” stipulated in Article 386 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for relatively minor offences. On 14 January 2004 the applicant challenged this decision before the Bakırköy Criminal Court. On 30 January 2004 the Bakırköy Criminal Court dismissed the objection without holding a hearing.
