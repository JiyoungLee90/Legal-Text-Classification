Should it not be permissible to adjudicate civil claims in criminal proceedings in which the defendant has been acquitted because it has not been established that he has committed the act that was the factual basis for the indictment [beg\u00e5tt handlingen], the consequence would be that the claim must be brought up in separate civil proceedings.

                                "content": "[Article 6 \u00a7 2] is primarily addressed to judges in criminal proceedings and its main message is that judges shall not prejudge the defendant as having committed the crime of which he is indicted, or that there shall be no prejudgment through statements by public authorities (see Frowein/Peukert: \u201cEurop\u00e4ische Menschenrectskonvention\u201d, \u201cECHR\u201d, 2. edition (1996) page 280 and following, and Rehof/Trier: Menneskerett \u2013 Human Rights (1990), page 164). Both according to legal doctrine and the case-law of the  institutions, the provision may also have importance after the criminal case has been terminated (see Harris/O\u2019Boyle/Warbrick: \u201cLaw of the ECHR\u201d (1995), pages 246-247 with further references to practice). For instance, in the Sekanina v. Austria judgment, the Court stated that if the defendant has been acquitted by a final judgment, the courts might not, in a subsequent case concerning compensation for unjust prosecution, base its judgment on the fact that the accused is guilty. However, how far these points of view go is somewhat uncertain. While it is the accused and the State who are parties to the compensation proceedings regarding unjust prosecution, such proceedings can be seen as a prolongation of the criminal case. In my view, however, the presumption of innocence can hardly apply to civil proceedings between the accused and the person who has been prejudiced or has suffered damage by the act [which was] the factual basis for a criminal charge in respect of which the defendant has been acquitted [en handling som siktede er frifunnet for]. In any event, it must be evident that Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention cannot bar the courts \u2013 in a civil case (for example a case for compensation; on dismissal or parental responsibilities) \u2013 from establishing facts regarding the course of events in question, even if it should disclose the occurrence of a criminal offence and even if the person against whom the claim is directed has been acquitted of the offence in a preceding criminal case (see, inter alia, Lorenzen/Rehof/Trier: \u201cDen Europ\u00e6iske Menneskeretskonvention med kommentarer\u201d \u201cThe ECHR with comments\u201d (1994), page 199, and Frowein/Peukert, op. cit. page 285). Should the presumption of innocence apply at all to civil proceedings between the aggrieved party and the accused, it must at any rate be a condition for finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 that a decision establishing criminal guilt has been taken. Were the court in a civil case not permitted to base its decision on the fact that the person acquitted of a criminal offence, has in fact committed the act [beg\u00e5tt handlingen], the acquittal would deprive the victim, or the person who has suffered damage, of the possibility to obtain a judicial review of claims that he or she might have against the accused. This would, in my view, be contrary to the fundamental right to a fair hearing in Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01.",

I do not agree that there is any basis for making such a distinction. The system whereby civil claims may be raised in the criminal case is based upon well-founded considerations of procedural economy and ... can also benefit the defendant. In criminal proceedings the accused is, as a main rule, entitled to defence counsel paid for by the State and, bearing in mind also the thoroughness with which evidence is presented in a criminal trial, the accused, in the event of a civil claim being determined together with the criminal matter, enjoys particular protection against being wrongly judged. If the defendant is acquitted in the criminal case but is ordered to pay compensation for non-pecuniary damage, the accused will be left with a feeling of not having been \u2018totally acquitted\u2019.

In the applicant\u2019s case, the criminal charges and the compensation claim made against him had been pursued in joint proceedings before the same court, in accordance with Article 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The accused\u2019s acquittal and the ruling on compensation were stated in the same court record. The oral pleadings on compensation took place the day after the acquittal, virtually as an extension of the criminal proceedings. Since no new evidence was adduced, the compensation issue was determined on the basis of the same evidence as that submitted in the criminal trial. The applicant\u2019s appeal against the High Court\u2019s assessment of the evidence was refused by the Supreme Court.

Austria (no. 28923/95, 10.7.2001), and to hold that Article 6 \u00a7 2 was inapplicable and not violated. While the Prosecution had acted as a defendant party in those cases, the present case had involved other types of litigants. The Prosecution had acted neither as a party nor as a representative of the victim\u2019s parents or the applicant, but was discharged upon the completion of the criminal trial. The ensuing compensation round only involved counsel for the victim\u2019s parents and for the applicant \u2013 two private civil parties. Moreover, there was no link between the outcome of the criminal proceedings and the compensation case, the right of the victim\u2019s parents to claim compensation being entirely independent of the criminal case. On essential points the legal basis and the legal issues in the civil compensation proceedings differed from those in the criminal case.

A fine \u2013 but absolutely essential \u2013 line had to be drawn between criminal and civil responsibility. The Convention principle of the presumption of innocence could not bar judicial or other authorities acting in civil matters from addressing the question whether the acquitted person had perpetrated the act that formed the basis for the criminal charge against him. It would be unacceptable if an acquittal in a criminal case should be binding upon any authority that subsequently was called upon to decide civil-law matters arising from the same set of facts. While a court would of course be bound by a finding that criminal responsibility had not been established, it should be free to establish the civil consequences flowing from the same set of facts. An acquittal could not have as its consequence that subsequent decisions in civil matters must take as its premise that the acquitted person did not perpetrate the act, if it was shown on the balance of probabilities that he or she nevertheless was the perpetrator. Such a view would indeed give rise to serious questions under the Convention itself, namely the right under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of access to a court of, inter alia, a victim claiming compensation under the civil law of tort.",

According to its established case-law there are three criteria to be taken into account when deciding whether a person was \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d for the purposes of Article 6, namely the classification of the proceedings under national law, their essential nature and the type and severity of the penalty that the applicant risked incurring (see Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no. 41087/98, \u00a7 31; A.P., M.P. and T.P. v. Switzerland, judgment of 29\u00a0August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V, \u00a7 39). Moreover, the scope of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 is not limited to criminal proceedings that are pending (see Allenet de Ribemont v. France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 16, \u00a7 35). In certain instances, the Court has also found the provision applicable to judicial decisions taken after the discontinuation of such proceedings (see in particular the following judgments: Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62, and Lutz, Englert and N\u00f6lkenbockhoff v. Germany, 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123), or following an acquittal (see the above-mentioned Sekanina, Rushiti and Lamanna judgments). Those judgments concerned proceedings related to such matters as an accused\u2019s obligation to bear court costs and prosecution expenses, a claim for reimbursement of his (or his heirs\u2019) necessary costs, or compensation for detention on remand, and which were found to constitute a consequence and the concomitant of the criminal proceedings.",

However, this concerned only the initial criminal charges of which he was acquitted; it was of no relevance to the compensation claim. The Court notes that the latter had its legal basis in Chapter 3 of the Damage Compensation Act 1969, which sets out the general principles of the national law on torts applicable to personal injuries. It is clear from both the wording of Article 3-5 and Norwegian case-law that criminal liability is not a prerequisite for liability to pay compensation. Even where, as here, the victim had opted for joining the compensation claim to the criminal trial, pursuant to Article 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the claim would still be considered a \u201ccivil\u201d one. This also transpires from the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in the applicant\u2019s case, which described the claim as \u201ccivil\u201d. Thus, the Court finds that the compensation claim in issue was not viewed as a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d under the relevant national law.",

The outcome of the criminal proceedings was not decisive for the compensation case. The victim had a right to claim compensation regardless of whether the defendant was convicted or, as here, acquitted, and the compensation issue was to be the subject of a separate legal assessment based on criteria and evidentiary standards which in several important respects differed from those applicable to criminal liability.",

Nor could the fact that evidence from the criminal trial is used to determine civil law consequences of the act warrant such characterisation. Otherwise, as rightly pointed out by the Government, Article 6 \u00a7 2 would give a criminal acquittal the undesirable effect of pre-empting the victim\u2019s possibilities of claiming compensation under the civil law of tort, entailing an arbitrary and disproportionate limitation on his or her right of access to court under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. This again could give an acquitted perpetrator, who would be deemed responsible according the civil burden of proof, the undue advantage of avoiding any responsibility for his or her actions. Such an extensive interpretation would not be supported either by the wording of Article 6 \u00a7 2 or any common ground in the national legal systems within the Convention community.

Auflage (1996), side 280 ff. og Rehof/Trier: Menneskerett (1990), side 164. B\u00e5de i teori og praksis fra Strasbourgorganene er det imidlertid lagt til grunn at bestemmelsen ogs\u00e5  f\u00e5 betydning etter at straffesaken er avsluttet, se Harris/O\u2019Boyle/Warbrick: Law of the European Convention on Human Rights (1995), side 246-247 med n\u00e6rmere henvisninger til praksis. I dom av 25. august 1993 i saken Sekanina mot \u00d8sterrike har f.eks. Den europeiske menneskerettighetsdomstol lagt til grunn at dersom siktede er frifunnet ved rettskraftig dom,  domstolene i en etterf\u00f8lgende sak om erstatning for uberettiget forf\u00f8lgning ikke bygge p\u00e5 at tiltalte er skyldig. Men hvor langt dette synspunktet rekker,  v\u00e6re noe usikkert. Saker om erstatning for uberettiget forf\u00f8lgning g\u00e5r mellom siktede og staten, og slike saker fremst\u00e5r som en forlengelse av straffesaken. Etter min oppfatning  uskyldspresumsjonen derimot neppe komme til anvendelse i en sivil sak mellom siktede og den som m\u00e5tte v\u00e6re krenket eller ha lidt skade ved en handling som siktede er frifunnet for. Det m\u00e5 i alle fall v\u00e6re p\u00e5 det rene at EMK artikkel 6 nr. 2 ikke  avskj\u00e6re domstolene fra i en sivil sak \u2013 f.eks. en erstatningssak, sak om oppsigelse eller avskjed eller sak om foreldreansvar \u2013 \u00e5 ta stilling til et faktisk hendelsesforl\u00f8p, selv om dette i og for seg skulle utgj\u00f8re en straffbar handling, og den som kravet er rettet mot, er frifunnet for forholdet i en tidligere straffesak, se blant annet Lorenzen/Rehof/Trier: Den Europ\u00e6iske Menneskeretskonvention med kommentarer (1994), side 199 og Frowein/Peukert, op. cit. side 285. Om uskyldspresumsjonen overhodet f\u00e5r anvendelse i en sivil sak mellom skadelidte og siktede, m\u00e5 det under enhver omstendighet v\u00e6re en forutsetning for at EMK artikkel 6 nr. 2 skal v\u00e6re krenket, at det blir foretatt en strafferettslig skyldkonstatering. Dersom domstolene i en sivil sak ikke skulle ha adgang til \u00e5 legge til grunn at den som er frifunnet for en straffbar handling, har beg\u00e5tt handlingen, ville frifinnelsen frata den som m\u00e5tte v\u00e6re krenket eller ha lidt skade ved handlingen, muligheten til \u00e5 f\u00e5 pr\u00f8vd krav som vedkommende m\u00e5tte ha mot tiltalte.

Slik denne saken ligger an, finner jeg det imidlertid ikke n\u00f8dvendig \u00e5 ta endelig stilling til dette, da lagmannsretten ved p\u00e5d\u00f8mmelsen av oppreisningskravet etter mitt syn ikke har foretatt en slik strafferettslig skyldkonstatering som under enhver omstendighet m\u00e5 v\u00e6re en forutsetning for at det  foreligge en krenkelse av EMK artikkel 6 nr. 2. ...",

Disse argumentene har jeg vanskelig for \u00e5 forst\u00e5. Det at beviskravene er forskjellige i ulike relasjoner, er ikke noe s\u00e6regent for denne type saker. [N\u00e5r det for p\u00e5d\u00f8mmelse av oppreisningskrav i tilfeller hvor tiltalte er frifunnet for straff, blir stilt krav om klar sannsynlightsovervekt for at tiltalte har beg\u00e5tt handlingen, er det] ut fra et generelt synspunkt om at det m\u00e5 stilles krav om kvalifisert sannsynlighetsovervekt for at retten skal kunne legge til grunn at det foreligger et sterkt belastende faktum ... Det at det i slike tilfeller av hensyn til den som kravet er rettet mot, stilles skjerpede beviskrav, kan ikke inneb\u00e6re noen krenkelse av EMK.\u201d",
