A number of such necessary measures as identifying the witnesses to the abduction from the local residents, identifying the APCs involved in the events, identifying and questioning the relatives and colleagues of the abducted men who were present during the release of one of the abductees from the military base (see paragraph\u00a09 above), or following up on the detailed information provided by the witnesses about the abductors and their stationing in Khatuni (see paragraphs 42, 43 and 45 above) should have been taken immediately or as soon as possible after the investigation had been initiated. From the submitted documents it is clear that even after the prosecutors\u2019 orders these steps were not taken at all or that some other important steps were taken with significant delays (see paragraphs 47 and 53 above). Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious matter (see\u00a0\u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

They further argued that the applicant, having belatedly complained to the prosecutor\u2019s office about the abduction, had undermined the efficiency of the investigation. The Court observes that the applicant, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged acts or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this respect that while the suspension or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the decisions to suspend were made without the necessary investigative steps being taken, which led to numerous periods of inactivity and thus unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Further, as for the argument concerning the applicant\u2019s allegedly belated complaint about the abduction, the Court notes that prior to the lodging of her official written complaint with the prosecutor\u2019s office, the applicant complained to the authorities, such as her son\u2019s commander S. Kh. and the Grozny FSB (see paragraphs 42 and 45 above) in person. In their submission to the Court the Government did not contest this information. Therefore, it is doubtful that the authorities had been completely unaware of the incident and that the delay between the date of the abduction and the official complaint to the prosecutor\u2019s office could have significantly undermined the remedy referred to by the Government. Accordingly, the Court finds that this remedy was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses the preliminary issue as regards the applicant\u2019s failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
