He had heard from other inmates that the deputy head of Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Facility, L.D., took bribes to transfer inmates to units with lighter security and that L.D. had mentioned to V.\u0160. that it was possible to be released on probation for money. V.\u0160. was questioned by the STT and stated that in December 2010 L.D. had asked him to his office and enquired whether he wanted to be released early. L.D. had indicated that he had a friend who could help V.\u0160. obtain release on probation and promised to organise a meeting with him. V.\u0160. was asked again that month by L.D. to go to the latter\u2019s office, where he met the applicant (see paragraph 7 below). V.\u0160. asked the applicant what he should do in order to obtain release on probation. The applicant stated that V.\u0160. would first have to be transferred to a unit with lighter security. V.\u0160. asked the applicant how much it would cost him and the applicant replied that Kai\u0161iadorys [District Court] would cost him 7,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL, approximately 2,027 euros (EUR)). After that the applicant indicated several judges that would agree to release V.\u0160. on probation. The applicant also stated that the cost for the same thing in the Kaunas Regional Court would be approximately LTL\u00a010,000 (approximately EUR 2,896) but that that was not the final amount. The applicant also mentioned that V.\u0160. would have to pay LTL 1,000 (approximately EUR 290) for the transfer to a unit with lower security. After that conversation V.\u0160. started recording his discussions with L.D. and the applicant using a voice recorder watch which he said he had obtained from other inmates in exchange for cigarettes. Figures mentioned during the other meetings were LTL 2,000 (approximately EUR 579) for the transfer to another unit and LTL 12,000 (approximately EUR 3,475) for the judges at the Kaunas Regional Court as that amount could be more easily divided in three than LTL 10,000. V.\u0160. stated that no agreement on legal services had been concluded with the applicant. V.\u0160. then contacted an acquaintance, G.T., a former police officer who promised to contact the authorities.",

The court held that the transcripts of the conversations between the applicant and V.\u0160. showed that the applicant had been the first to indicate the amounts of money to be paid. The applicant\u2019s statement that he had been going to conclude an agreement on legal services after he had taken LTL\u00a030,000 were refuted by his conversation with G.T., where the applicant had stated that in case of failure he would keep 20% of the money and return the rest. The video-recordings showed that the applicant had not counted the money and that he had indicated to G.T. to put it in the side pocket of the car door. That allowed the court to draw the conclusion that the applicant realised that the money was remuneration for his criminal activity. The court further held that V.\u0160.\u2019s testimony, voice and videorecordings showed that the applicant had not been incited to take a bribe and that the criminal conduct simulation model had been applied within the limits prescribed by the court (see paragraph 12 above).

The court also held that the initial contact between V.\u0160. and the applicant had been arranged by L.D., that V.\u0160. had not known the applicant beforehand and had not had any motive to incite him to commit a crime. The court also found that no agreement on the provision of legal services had been concluded between the applicant and V.\u0160. and that the applicant\u2019s argument that he had intended to conclude one later had been dismissed as an attempt to improve his situation. On the basis of the audio-recordings, the court also observed that the applicant had been the first to say that he could settle the matter for money. The court also found that there had been no incitement and that the authorities had not put any active pressure on the applicant to commit an offence. On the contrary, the applicant had incited V.\u0160. to give him an amount that would be sufficient for himself, an intermediary and three court judges. The court also held that at the time the offence had been committed, Article 226 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code provided for two alternative sentences for bribery of an intermediary: arrest or imprisonment for up to three years. On 5 July 2011 the Criminal Code had been amended and the applicant\u2019s offence had then satisfied the requirements of Article 226 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, which provided for various sentences: a fine, arrest or imprisonment for up to five years.

The Constitutional Court emphasised that the criminal conduct simulation model was only allowed when used to \u201cjoin\u201d (prisijungti) ongoing criminal activities because such activities were happening without any effort from people taking part in undercover operational activities. The undercover agents only simulated acts as part of a criminal activity that was planned or had already commenced. It was prohibited to incite someone to commit a new offence or one that had been commenced but later terminated during the use of the criminal conduct simulation model. The criminal conduct simulation model was unlawful if the limits that had been set for it were exceeded or if someone had been incited to commit an offence. The assessment of those circumstances was a matter for the court. It was for the courts of ordinary jurisdiction dealing with allegations of incitement or other forms of abuse of the model to establish in each particular case whether the investigating authorities had gone beyond the limits of the legal framework within which the model had been authorised.",

Private individuals could only act as undercover agents after they had informed the authorities about a criminal act that was likely to be committed. A conclusion of incitement could be drawn even if the officers\u2019 act of instigation was not intense or insistent, or if the suspect had been contacted through unsuspecting third persons.

The Court has consistently accepted the use of undercover investigative techniques in combatting crime. It has held on several occasions that undercover operations per se did not interfere with the right to a fair trial and that the presence of clear, adequate and sufficient procedural safeguards set permissible police conduct aside from entrapment (see ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 51 and\u00a053, Ciprian Vl\u0103du\u021b and Ioan Florin Pop v.

In deciding whether the investigation was \u201cessentially passive\u201d the Court will examine the reasons underlying the covert operation, in particular, whether there were objective suspicions that the applicant had been involved in criminal activity or had been predisposed to commit a criminal offence until he was approached by the police (see Furcht v.\u00a0Germany, no. 54648/09, \u00a7 51, 23\u00a0October\u00a02014) and the conduct of the authorities carrying it out, specifically whether the authorities exerted such an influence on the applicant as to incite the commission of an offence that would otherwise not have been committed, in order to make it possible to establish the offence, that is, to provide evidence and institute a prosecution (see Ramanauskas, cited above, \u00a7 55; Furcht, cited above, \u00a7 48; Morari v.\u00a0the Republic of Moldova, no. 65311/09, \u00a7\u00a031, 8 March 2016; and Matanovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 123).

No one will ever learn for sure whether the Grand Chamber was (or was not) purposely mindful of these entanglements, but it skilfully (or happily) escaped the subaqueous rocks of epistemology, as it phrased the \u201cuncovering the truth\u201d clause quite cautiously. The Court does not require that the \u201ctruth\u201d be \u201cuncovered\u201d in its entirety, only that the \u201cnecessary steps\u201d be taken to lead in the direction of its \u201cuncovering\u201d, and only insofar they are \u201cnecessary\u201d to \u201cdetermine whether there was any incitement\u201d. Also, it is not made explicit that all the \u201csteps\u201d must be taken, only those \u201cnecessary\u201d. The Court understandingly notes that it is \u201caware of the difficulties inherent in the police\u2019s task of searching for and gathering evidence for the purpose of detecting and investigating offences\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a049) and that it is \u201cmindful of ... the difficulties of the task of investigating offences\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 73). One presumes that it should be no less sensitive to the difficulties encountered by the courts dealing with the cases, where the persons implicated in corrupt activities claim to have been incited to commit them. It is especially onerous for the courts to \u201cuncover the truth\u201d, when they have to choose between competing testimonies, where the prosecution\u2019s version is only feebly supported, or even not supported, by a plethora of authorities-unrelated witnesses\u2019 testimonies or non-testimonial evidence, while the defendant\u2019s story, though implausible in real life, could have been \u201cnot wholly improbable\u201d under some extremely fluky, fortuitous coincidence of circumstances. The crucial factor is whether the Court grants the alleged victim\u2019s version the benefit of doubt or dismisses it as \u201cwholly improbable\u201d. If that version is potent or, on the contrary, utterly fantastic, the Court\u2019s task is relatively easy. Still, there is no sharp boundary between the core of undisputable plausibility and the surrounding province of sheer wanderings: in both these domains the certainty of getting closer to the \u201ctruth\u201d raises no great concerns, but between them lies (if I may import this Wittgensteinian-Hartian construct) the penumbra of doubt where a greater or lesser judicial discretion is exercised. When the Court is necessitated to enter that penumbra, it faces the delicacy of walking the fine line between remaining the master of \u201ccharacterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case\u201d, as it often rightly calls itself, and mutating into being the master of such recognition or refutation of the facts presented by the parties where it effectively discovers them, thus becoming a \u201cfourth-instance court\u201d (or even a \u201cfirst-instance court\u201d).",

In Ramanauskas v. Lithuania (cited above) the \u201cnot wholly improbable\u201d clause has become the Court\u2019s translation of (and a surrogate to) the well-known and long-lived adage in dubio pro reo, which is one of the pillars of the fair criminal procedure in particular and of the rule of law in general. In dubio pro reo requires that any reasonable doubt must benefit the accused. The latter thus must assuredly benefit also from a doubt as to whether he or she had not been incited to commit a criminal offence which otherwise would have not been committed, but only from such a doubt which allows for the possibility (or probability), however slight, that the events evolved in some condonable way, different from the one asserted by the prosecution, but altogether not unlikely in comparison to how things normally are in life. In dubio pro reo is a pragmatic principle. It does not give a blind eye on the shared human experience.",

By employing the formalistic, arithmetic-scented adverb \u201cwholly\u201d, the Court substituted the complete improbability, or the probability that equals zero, for the pragmatically reasonable impossibility, or the chance that something took place being factually inconceivable from the angle of the shared human experience, or the knowledge of how things normally are in life. By confusing the improbability as an arithmetical zero and the improbability as pragmatically reasonable impossibility, the clause in question tells that the accused must benefit from virtually any doubt, however meagre, unless the latter is absolutely hollow, unnatural, i.e. \u201cwholly improbable\u201d, because everything what is not unnatural is also \u201cnot wholly improbable\u201d by definition. The accused thus should benefit also from doubts which are artificially invented and purely imaginative, but not \u201cunnatural\u201d in the strict sense of the word.

True, literal reading is seldom the ultimate reading. Maybe therefore a more liberal reading of the \u201cnot wholly improbable\u201d clause is warranted? Yes and no. Yes, because, as is generally accepted, the plain meaning of the provisions must not be given (and in the Court\u2019s case-law at large is not given) undue prominence. There is a range of interpretative instruments aimed at alleviating the constraints of the plain meaning rule, e.g.: the golden rule (in its narrower or broader versions); the mischief rule; the purposive approach; etc. Even the plain meaning rule itself has its softer version, not rejected even by the most ardent adherents of textualism. These instruments, in principle, allow for not applying the \u201cnot wholly improbable\u201d clause in its strictly verbatim sense and not to take at face value any story of the alleged victim of incitement to commit a criminal act, provided that it is not unnatural, although, if assessed from the pragmatically reasonable angle, quite absurd indeed. But there are caveats. Firstly, these instruments are meant, on the whole, for statutory and constitutional interpretation and not for that of doctrinal provisions of the courts\u2019 case-law. Another caveat pertains to the factual side of adjudication: in the Court\u2019s case-law the \u201cnot wholly improbable\u201d clause is at times taken exactly for what it literally says (for a recent example see P\u0103tra\u015fcu v.\u00a0Romania, no. 7600/09, \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 49, 14 February 2017). Even if it might have been worded, in Ramanauskas v. Lithuania (cited above), so strictly with no special intention, the later ordaining, even if infrequent (contrast Bannikova v. Russia, no. 18757/06, 4 November 2010), of the letter of the tenet to its rigid meaning does not warrant dismissing the criticism of the wording of the clause in question as a mere carping at trifles.",

On the other hand, the exculpation of the accused on the sole ground that the prosecution failed to provide cast-iron proof that there was no incitement, whereas the defendant furnished the story which could not be rebutted with one hundred percent certainty because it indeed could hold true under some extremely unlikely amalgamation of circumstances, may also be far from \u201cuncovering the truth\u201d.

Still, it is the accused who must benefit from any doubt. If his or her exculpation on the basis of the \u201cabsence of any such proof\u201d leaves too much room for doubt, the \u201cnot wholly improbable\u201d clause can be succoured by the \u201cuncovering the truth\u201d clause: with hindsight it is easy (and tempting) to hold that the domestic courts had not taken all the \u201csteps\u201d that might have been \u201cnecessary\u201d for \u201cuncovering\u201d the \u201ctruth\u201d, even if in practice it would have been disadvantageous or hardly possible to take every \u201cstep\u201d which one might envisage.

Conflicting testimonies as to \u201cwho incited whom to give or accept the bribe\u201d were provided: the applicant alleged instigators attributed the mentioning of the money to the applicant, while he blamed them. The Supreme Court admitted the difficulty of \u201cestablish[ing] who was the instigator of giving and accepting the bribe\u201d, but held that \u201c[e]ven assuming that [Mr] Ramanauskas was incited by [other persons] to accept a bribe, ... the incitement took the form of an offer, and not of threats or blackmail\u201d, and [h]e was therefore able to decline (and ought to have declined) the illegal offer ... [however, he] accepted [the bribe] of his own free will\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 27; my emphasis). That was sufficient for the conviction. ECtHR summed up that approach by stating that \u201c[o]nce [the applicant\u2019s] guilt had been established, the question whether there had been any outside influence on his intention to commit the offence had become irrelevant\u201d and observed that a \u201cconfession to an offence committed as a result of incitement cannot eradicate either the incitement or its effects\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a072). Given that the Supreme Court itself conceded that \u201cthe incitement took place\u201d, although it clearly meant the alleged instigators\u2019 request to secure the acquittal of a third person and not the offer of the \u201creward\u201d to the applicant, the Government\u2019s case was hopeless. At the heart of its failure to convince the Court that the offence would have been committed without the outside influence was not that the Supreme Court erred by not establishing with one hundred percent certainty that the applicant had not been incited to take the bribe (that part of the \u201ctruth\u201d did not lend itself to \u201cuncovering\u201d), but that it was satisfied\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in line with domestic criminal law\u00a0\u2013\u00a0with the mere fact that he had taken it.

While the Supreme Court held it to be irrelevant for the conviction of the applicant that he had been asked to perform illicit actions on behalf of a third person and in this respect had been incited, but admitted its inability to establish \u201cwho was the instigator of giving and accepting the bribe\u201d, The Court, however, was not sophisticated at all in distinguishing between the request to perform the said actions and the offer to \u201cremunerate\u201d them. Both would constitute an incitement. The question remains whether they should be seen as one \u201ccompound\u201d initiative or two (related, of course) intiatives. It was accepted even by the Supreme Court that the applicant had been solicited to commit the first set of illicit actions. But it could well have been that he would not have agreed to commit them if the alleged instigator had not agreed to his request for \u201creward\u201d. The Supreme Court admitted the \u201cfirst\u201d incitement and left the question open as to the \u201csecond\u201d one, but held that they were irrelevant for the conviction. In contrast to that, the Court\u2019s judgment is worded so as to make it clear that also the initiative regarding the \u201cremuneration\u201d had come from the \u201coutside\u201d. E.g., it is stated that the applicant \u201chad apparently agreed to seek to have a third person acquitted in return for a bribe of USD 3,000\u201d; or that \u201cthe actions of [the alleged instigators] had the effect of inciting the applicant to commit the offence of which he was convicted\u201d, i.e. accepting a bribe, that is to say, a \u201creward\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 62 and 73; my emphasis). Where the domestic courts, which directly examined all the evidence before them, failed to \u201cuncover the truth\u201d, that mission was accomplished from a distance. While the Supreme Court employed the fiction of division of the incitement to commit a criminal offence into two elements (not a meaningless analytical enterprise as such), ECtHR no less fictitiously employed the inductive inference and discovered that what was true of a part was true of a whole. Not only that was not necessary for the substantiation of the finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 \u2013 that diminished the strength of the whole reasoning.",

The Supreme Court established that one of the alleged instigators was a \u201cpolice driver\u201d who initially acted \u201cin a private capacity\u201d. The Court \u201cpromoted\u201d that person to the rank of an \u201cofficer of a special anti-corruption police unit\u201d (this is the same Special Investigation Service, as in the instant case, only then its name was translated loosely; ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 27). Well, being a police driver does not make one an \u201cofficer\u201d, even if one acts as an undercover agent. Why was such a sham transmutation resorted to at all? One could surmise that otherwise the Court would not have had a sufficiently solid basis for inferring that the \u201cLithuanian authorities\u2019 responsibility was engaged ... for the actions of [the alleged instigators] prior to the authorisation of the [criminal conduct simulation] model\u201d. This factual inference is drawn from the fact that \u201cno satisfactory explanation has been provided as to what reasons or personal motives could have led [the driver-officer in question] to approach the applicant on his own initiative without bringing the matter to the attention of his superiors, or why he was not prosecuted for his acts during this preliminary phase\u201d. True: no such explanation has been provided (ostensibly because the relevant file had been destroyed upon the expiry of the period established in the law, which presumably preceded the communication of the case to the Government). The Court might have inferred rightly\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but it might have erred. There is a difference between the Government not proving their case before the Court and the Court discovering itself that the facts were different from those presented. The reasoning cited above erases that difference.

However, the Supreme Court held that it was unnecessary to exclude that evidence, because according to domestic criminal law, regardless of who was the instigator, the crime had nevertheless been committed and entailed responsibility (see paragraphs 15 and 17 above). The non-exclusion of the impugned evidence might have been nominally in line with the Court\u2019s requirement that \u201call evidence obtained as a result of police incitement must be excluded\u201d (see Ramanauskas, \u00a7 60, cited above), because it was not established that there had been an incitement regarding money changing hands (however critically this approach was assessed by ECtHR).",

It is easy to judge with hindsight. However, if at the time of the trial the witness\u2019 whereabouts had indeed not been known to the authorities (this was not rebutted by anyone), the Court\u2019s ex post facto consideration that his presence should nonetheless have been secured amounted to the predetermination of the Government\u2019s case being doomed to failure.

The fact is overlooked (or deliberately ignored?) that the applicant was not just anybody, but a prosecutor. Prosecutors are supposed to be immune to incitements, aren\u2019t they?

Lithuania (dec.), no. 27968/03, 10 June 2008; Trifontsov v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a012025/02, 9 October 2012; and Lyubchenko v. Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a03460/05, 31 May 2016). But since Matanovi\u010d v. Croatia (cited above), not only has the possibility of such dismissal become more veracious, but the tendency may emerge that such complaints are dismissed as manifestly ill-founded (in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 not only by a seven-member Chamber, but by a three-member committee (see, mutatis mutandis, Mills v. Ireland (dec.), no. 50468/16, 10 October 2017). If, however, the application is not manifestly ill-founded, the Court proceeds with its examination on the merits under the substantive test of incitement, but having established that there was no incitement, does not carry out the procedural test.",

But the Matanovi\u0107 methodology leaves leeway for examination on the merits, as in the instant case, of even a poorly substantiated claim that a provocation had been staged against the incitement-prone, but otherwise allegedly law-abiding applicant, and the adoption not of a decision as to the (in)admissibility of the application but of a judgment where no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 is found. On the other hand, if there had been no incitement, a further examination of the complaint would have been excessive. Further (though this is not decisive), the notion of \u201cnormality\u201d contained in the formula \u201cthat will normally be sufficient\u201d perhaps covers the abnormality (notably, but not exclusively, in the eyes of societies and institutions faced with real difficulties in countering corruption from places other than ivory towers) of the same applicant\u2019s follow-up case regarding the similar complaint, after his victory in the first case effectively braced him to stay incitement-prone.",

                        "content": "31.\u00a0\u00a0The Court limited itself to the substantive test of incitement and did not undertake the procedural one. No examination undertaken of the procedural facets could in any way have altered the finding that there had been no incitement. But had the Court nevertheless decided to proceed with the procedural test, the applicant\u2019s allegations would have appeared to have been no more convincing than those examined under the substantive test. The applicant pleaded not guilty before the domestic courts (see paragraphs\u00a024 and 25 of the judgment). He accused two other persons of inciting the commission of the offence and claimed that one of them, the prisoner, had not been allowed to use a voice-recording watch, by which their conversations had been recorded, in prison and that he must have acquired one from the authorities. These allegations have been verified by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 27 and 29 of the judgment). Although the applicant had an effective opportunity to challenge the use of the evidence acquired from that prisoner\u2019s watch, he did not put forward any argument against the authenticity or veracity of the information obtained from it, but limited his objection exclusively to the formal use of such information in evidence during the proceedings. These arguments were given due consideration by the courts (see paragraphs 25, 27 and 29 of the judgment). The fact that the applicant was unsuccessful at each procedural step does not alter the fact that he had an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence and oppose its use (see, among many authorities, Dragojevi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. no. 68955/11, \u00a7 132, 15\u00a0January 2015). The domestic courts are, in principle, better placed to judge the reliability of evidence and its compliance with domestic law. What is of no less importance is that the impugned evidence was not the only evidence on which the conviction was based. The trial court took into account the applicant\u2019s statements and examined them against the testimony of the alleged instigators and of the officers of the Special Investigation Service, but also against those of the applicant\u2019s co-accused (who pleaded guilty and whom the applicant for some reason had not accused of incitement), as well as against the evidence obtained after the authorisation of the actions simulating criminal conduct (see paragraphs 27 and 29 of the judgment); it also had regard to the applicant\u2019s entrapment plea, heard witnesses, and analysed voice and videorecordings and transcripts of the conversations between the applicant and the alleged instigators (compare Lagutin and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a06228/09 and 4 others, \u00a7 101, 24 April 2014). The court of appeal responded to the applicant\u2019s complaints of entrapment by once again analysing the audio-recordings, questioning the witnesses, who could testify on the issue of incitement, and they were heard in court and cross-examined by the applicant and his lawyer (see paragraph 29 of the judgment). The Supreme Court analysed the applicant\u2019s arguments and provided relevant reasoning for refusing his contentions (see paragraph 29 of the judgment). To sum up, the applicant\u2019s plea of incitement was adequately addressed by the domestic courts, which took all the possible \u201cnecessary steps\u201d to \u201cuncover the truth\u201d and to eradicate the doubts as to whether the applicant had committed the criminal offence as a result of incitement by an agent provocateur.",

Meant to provide guidance in the alleged entrapment cases, that clause, in its literal reading, has, so to say, entrapped the Court itself, with its great reliance on repeated verbatim citations from its own case-law. By mechanically migrating from one case to another, it reinforces the ivory tower recommendation to take at face value even the reasonably improbable stories of the alleged victims of incitement and thus to mock of justice.",

Ramanauskas v. Lithuania (cited above) can no longer fully perform this function, in particular because now it can be seen, at least by some, as besmirched by the fact of being that judgment which in fact reassured the applicant of his impunity and planted in him a hope (though eventually a baseless one) of the Court\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9. The fine-tuned doctrine should send a very clear message that the Court does not shut its eyes to the real difficulties which the domestic authorities encounter when countering crime in general and corruption in particular. A mere declaration (words which also migrate from case to case) that the Court is \u201cmindful of ... the difficulties of the task of investigating offences\u201d or that it is \u201caware of the difficulties inherent in the police\u2019s task of searching for and gathering evidence for the purpose of detecting and investigating offences\u201d (see paragraph 9 above) does not suffice. Worded in most general terms, this wishy-washy assurance does not even mention corruption, which, as a rule, is a clandestine activity. In this context, the Court should ask itself in each and every case pertaining to alleged incitement: what if the authorities had not performed the impugned operation? Or: what results would their inaction have brought about (on this I refer to my dissenting opinion in P\u0103tra\u015fcu v. Romania, cited above)?",

A breach of rights is a breach of rights. It would be unfair and unprofessional to defend the authorities a priori, also in view of the fact that provocation against opponents in particular and political justice in general are a growing reality in some states. Nevertheless, in the assessment of \u201chis word against theirs\u201d contrapositions in agent provocateur cases, the fact of commission of crime should be given some prominence. Also, it should matter, in particular in corruption cases, whether the alleged incitement (provided that it is established that it took place) included the offer of \u201creward\u201d or not. These circumstances certainly cannot attain the status of evidence decisive for the determination of whether there was an incitement to commit a criminal offence, but they should not be completely dropped off the scales and treated as being no evidence at all. This is especially pertinent to cases where the alleged victim of an incitement is, say, a prosecutor (a judge, a law enforcement officer, etc.), whose obstinate refusal and/or inability to resist incitement undermines the very raison d\u2019\u00eatre of his or her being in the respective position and whose treatment, in the Court\u2019s case-law, as a \u201cvictim\u201d on a par with an incitement-prone \u201cman in the street\u201d frustrates and erodes the individualised examination of facts by the courts as an inherent feature of modern Western (in particular European) law and brings us one step back to its earlier condition of the formal (mandatory and indiscriminate) assessment of evidence (on this I refer to my dissenting opinion in Lisovskij v. Lithuania, no. 36249/14, 2 May 2017) and a step away from the ideals of substantive justice. This calls for a more nuanced approach, commensurate with the professional and civic function of alleged \u201cprofessional\u201d victims. If the undifferentiated application of the \u201cnot wholly improbable\u201d clause is the standard, then, in the context of the instant case, why shouldn\u2019t the Court be no less clement to an advocate\u2019s depravity than to that of a prosecutor and not give an advocate\u2019s version of events the same benefit of doubt as to that of a prosecutor? However, the well-meant belief that human beings are equally incitement-prone must not be so allembracing. The Court\u2019s big-heartedness should allow for at least some differentiation between a \u201cman in the street\u201d and state officials (prosecutors, policemen, judges, politicians, etc.), where the latter are bound to the requirement to resist incitement to commit a criminal offence in some stronger way than the former and must be more incitement-resistant, more unyielding to \u201coutside influence\u201d. If being a professional office-holder has any added value, then one\u2019s added responsibility is yet another facet (out of many) of that added value, and its logical consequence. If this is so, the clause which (as I would like to hope) replaces the \u201cnot wholly improbable\u201d clause, even if more or less easily applicable to a layman, should have some in-built reservations when applied to officials.",

In such cases a formalistic approach is the enemy of a just one, and \u201cequal justice\u201d may turn into a caricature of justice. Even admitting that the finding in Ramanauskas v. Lithuania (cited above) was, overall (but not in every passage of argumentation), a reasoned one, the amount awarded to the applicant was barely explicable (to put it mildly). It drew gasps from many in the law enforcement and the judiciary. True, part of the amount awarded was compensation for \u201cindisputabl[e]\u00a0...\u00a0nonpecuniary damage, which cannot be compensated by the mere finding of a violation\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 87), and the other part was compensation for the loss of earnings sustained by the applicant, because owing to his conviction he could no longer work as a prosecutor (at least while he was serving his sentence). Did the Court see the non-termination of the applicant\u2019s work as a prosecutor as a value which had to be compensated, and the non-pecuniary damage sustained by him because of his falling victim to a provocation not counterbalanced by any non-pecuniary or pecuniary damage sustained by society? Raising these questions and finding fair answers to them is yet another lesson to be learned (also) by the Court, albeit at some price and somewhat belatedly. Time will show whether or not this is mere wishful thinking.",
