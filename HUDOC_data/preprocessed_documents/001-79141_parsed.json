His submissions, insofar as relevant to the complaints declared admissible, may be summarised as follows. The judgment of 5\u00a0December 1997, as upheld on 16 January 1998, remained unenforced due to the negligence of the bailiffs. On 18 December 1997, upon the applicant's request, the Lefortovskiy District Court ordered the seizure of the defendant company's bank account. However, despite the court order, the account was not seized. As a result, the company had time to withdraw money from the bank and thus avoid payment of the judgment debt. Furthermore, the bailiffs failed to take the necessary steps to find and seize other assets of the company. Therefore, the responsibility for the non-enforcement of the court judgment of 5 December 1997, as upheld on 16\u00a0January 1998 was fully with the State and the judgment of the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow of 10\u00a0March 1999 was correct. The applicant concluded that the quashing of the judgment of 10\u00a0March 1999 by the Supreme Court was unjustified and breached the principle of legal certainty, enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention.",

However, four months after the judgment had become binding and enforceable it was challenged by the Moscow City Prosecutor by way of supervisory review. That appeal was rejected. Six month later the Deputy Prosecutor General attempted to set aside the judgment of 10 March 1999 again, claiming that the lower court had erred in establishing the bailiff's liability for the non-enforcement of judgment against the company.
