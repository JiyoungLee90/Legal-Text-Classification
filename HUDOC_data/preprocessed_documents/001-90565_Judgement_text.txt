On 8 November 2007 the Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals.
It appears that both parties lodged cassation appeals and the case is pending before the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).
On 21 December 2004 the applicants lodged a complaint under section 5 of the 2004 Act. They particularly referred to the  and Katowice Regional Courts’ inactivity between the date the claim had been filed with the  and the date the first hearing had been scheduled. They sought just satisfaction in the amount of 20,000 Polish zlotys (PLN), that is, PLN 10,000 each.
On 10 March 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants’ complaint. The court held that the 2004 Act had legal effect as from its entry into force on 17 September 2004. It found that during the relevant part of the proceedings, there had been no inactivity or undue delay on the part of the authorities. In that connection, the court held that there had been no breach of the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time in the period after 17 September 2004.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court’s decisions in the cases of Charzyński v.
