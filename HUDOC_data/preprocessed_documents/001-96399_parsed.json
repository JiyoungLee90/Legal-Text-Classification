Nor was the place of residence the only valid contact address; an address for correspondence indicated by the applicant was obviously sufficient to enable the courts to keep contact with him. The Court therefore considers that the Russian courts demonstrated excessive and unjustified formalism by insisting that the applicant indicate his place of residence, a requirement that was known to be impossible in the applicant's situation.",

They also imposed a real restriction on the applicant, preventing him from having his civil claims determined by the courts. What is at stake in the present case is therefore not merely a problem of interpretation of a legal provision in the usual way but of an unreasonable construction of a procedural requirement which prevented the applicant's claims being examined on the merits and thereby interfered with the very essence of his right of access to a court (cf. Miragall Escolano and Others v. , nos. 38366/97, 38688/97, 40777/98, 40843/98, 41015/98, 41400/98, 41446/98, 41484/98, 41487/98 and 41509/98, \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 37, ECHR 2000I; and Canea Catholic Church v.
