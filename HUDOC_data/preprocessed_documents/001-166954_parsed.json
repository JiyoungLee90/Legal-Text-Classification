Slovenia [GC], no.\u00a071463/01, \u00a7\u00a7 156-57, 9 April 2009, and Pozhyvotko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a042752/08, \u00a7 38, 17 October 2013). This obligation concerns the means to be employed, and not the results to be achieved. The authorities must take all reasonable steps to secure the evidence concerning an incident (see Muravskaya, cited above, \u00a7 41). The effectiveness of an investigation implies a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition. Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law (see \u0160ilih, cited above, \u00a7 195). Moreover, with the passage of time, the prospects that any effective investigation can be undertaken will increasingly diminish (see Prilutskiy v. Ukraine, no.\u00a040429/08, \u00a7\u00a043, 26\u00a0February 2015).",

The Court has found that this investigative procedure does not comply with the principles of an effective remedy, because an inquiring officer can take only a limited number of procedural steps within that procedure, at a point where victims have no formal status and are therefore excluded from participating effectively in the procedure (see Skorokhodov v. Ukraine, no. 56697/09, \u00a7\u00a034, 14 November 2013, with further references). It is notable that more than fifteen decisions to terminate the pre-investigation inquiries were taken in that period, and all of them were quashed as unfounded by the supervising authorities, which each time remitted the case for a new round of inquiries. The repetition of such remittal orders discloses a serious deficiency (see, for example, Spinov v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 34331/03, \u00a7 56, 27 November 2008).",
