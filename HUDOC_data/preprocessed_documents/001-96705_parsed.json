The Court has already established certain principles as regards its role in respect of allegedly unlawfully obtained evidence in the context of criminal proceedings. Thus, it held that it is not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence \u2013 for example, unlawfully obtained evidence \u2013 may be admissible or, indeed, whether the applicant was guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair.

In determining whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, regard must also be had to whether the rights of the defence were respected.

In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy (see Bykov v.

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards that person as guilty (see Daktaras v.

Otherwise, as rightly pointed out by the Government, Article 6 \u00a7 2 would give a criminal acquittal the undesirable effect of pre-empting the victim's possibilities of claiming compensation under the civil law of tort, entailing an arbitrary and disproportionate limitation on his or her right of access to court under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. This again could give an acquitted perpetrator, who would be deemed responsible according the civil burden of proof, the undue advantage of avoiding any responsibility for his or her actions. Such an extensive interpretation would not be supported either by the wording of Article 6 \u00a7 2 or any common ground in the national legal systems within the Convention community.
