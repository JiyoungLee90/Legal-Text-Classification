Administrative decisions awarding the applicants compensation through shares in a State-owned company named Obrazovanie i nauka EAD (\u201cON EAD\u201d) \u2013 a printing house engaged in, among other things, the printing of school textbooks \u2013 had been given in 1998 and 1999, and further decisions setting the amount of shares had been adopted in 2003.

They contended furthermore that, since one of the elements of the formula provided in the compensation legislation was the average monthly salary, which had increased since 2003, the value of the compensation due to them and their respective shares in the company would have increased as well, were they to be recalculated now. On the basis of these considerations the experts retained by them calculated the current \u201cmarket value\u201d of each of the shares for the purposes of compensation at BGN 860 (EUR 440).

This meant that the book value of each of its shares was about BGN 113 (EUR\u00a058). Considering that, in view of the passage of time, it would be unjust if the Court awarded the face value of the shares due to the applicants, the Government proposed that the Court award the book value indicated above (EUR 58), taking into account the number of shares awarded to the applicants in 2003 \u2013 namely 579 shares to the first and second applicants and 263 shares to the third applicant. The Government pointed out that in an earlier similar case against Bulgaria, also concerning the State\u2019s continued failure to provide shares awarded to the applicants under compensation legislation, the Court had awarded those shares\u2019 face value (the value indicated on the face of the security certificate; see Nedelcheva and Others v.

It has held that interest rates applied, intended to compensate for loss of value of an award over time, should reflect national economic conditions, such as levels of inflation and rates of interest during the relevant period (see Runkee and\u00a0White v. the United Kingdom, nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, \u00a7 52, 10 May 2007, and Vaskrsi\u0107 v. Slovenia, no. 31371/12, \u00a7 98, 25 April 2017). In a recent case against Bulgaria the Court found it reasonable to apply an interest rate equal to the base interest rate of the Bulgarian National Bank during the relevant period plus one percentage point (see Boyadzhieva and\u00a0Gloria International Limited EOOD v. Bulgaria, nos. 41299/09 and\u00a011132/10, \u00a7 55, 5 July 2018). It will follow the same approach in the case in hand.
