It noted that, according to the established procedure, the authority which had discontinued criminal proceedings was required to send a special notification to the person concerned with an explanation of when and where to seek compensation for damage caused. Where criminal proceedings were discontinued by a prosecutor\u2019s office, the person had to apply to that office within six months of the notification with a view to determining the damage caused. The forfeited or confiscated property was to be returned to that person within a month, if the latter had claimed it within the above-mentioned six-month time-limit. The appellate court established that no such notification had ever been sent to the applicant. It criticised her, however, for not having followed the procedure outlined above.",
