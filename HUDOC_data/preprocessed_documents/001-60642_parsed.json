In that case, the Court agreed (with the former Commission) that Mr Gaskin's file provided a substitute record for the memories and experience of the parents of a child who was in care, that it contained information concerning highly personal aspects of Mr Gaskin's childhood, development and history and that it thus contained the principal source of information about his past and formative years. The Court went on to find that Mr Gaskin's records undoubtedly related to his private and family life in such a way that the question of access thereto fell within the ambit of Article 8. ",

It went on to note that persons in Mr Gaskin's situation had a vital interest, protected by the Convention, in receiving information necessary to know and understand their childhood and early development. It accepted that making access to records dependent on the consent of the contributor (the position in the United Kingdom in relation to records compiled prior to 1989) could, in principle, be compatible with the Convention. However, it found that the absence of any independent authority finally deciding on access to records in cases where the contributor was not available, or improperly withheld consent, constituted a violation of the State's obligation under Article 8 of the Convention (\u00a7 49 of the Gaskin judgment).

The Court notes that these periods of care as a young child allow the present case to be distinguished from the case of Martin v. the United Kingdom (application no. 27533/95, decision of 28 February 1996, Decisions and Reports (DR) 84, p. 169), involving an intermittent period of mental health treatment for less than four years, beginning when that applicant was around nineteen years of age.

It is true that his parents had some access to him during those periods in care and could therefore constitute a source of information for him. However, his mother had psychiatric problems at the relevant time. His father died in 1980 and, in any event, could not be considered to have been a satisfactory source of information about abuse which the applicant alleges was committed by him.",

Most importantly, and as in Mr Gaskin's case, he had no appeal against a refusal of access to any independent body. The disclosure of the copy records in the Government's observations is demonstrative of the necessity for such an independent appeal, given that significant portions of those copy records are blanked out and certain documents have been retained on the basis that non-disclosure is justified by the duty of confidence to third parties.
