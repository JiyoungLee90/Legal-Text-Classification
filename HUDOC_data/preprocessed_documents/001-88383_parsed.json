Responsibility under the Convention is based on its own provisions, which are to be interpreted and applied on the basis of the objectives of the Convention and in light of the relevant principles of international law. The responsibility of a State under the Convention, for the acts of its organs, agents and servants, is not to be confused with the domestic legal issues of individual criminal responsibility under examination in the national criminal courts. The Court is not concerned with reaching any findings as to guilt or innocence in that sense (see Avsar, cited above, \u00a7 284).",

Turkey, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 324, \u00a7 86). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. This investigation should be independent, accessible to the victim\u2019s family, carried out with reasonable promptness and expedition, effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances or otherwise unlawful, and afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results (see Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a024746/94, \u00a7\u00a7 105-109, 4 May 2001, and Douglas-Williams v. the  (dec.), no. 56413/00, 8 January 2002).",

The Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the delay in instituting the criminal proceedings was a result of the applicants\u2019 failure to lodge a complaint with the district prosecutor\u2019s office immediately after the incident. The Government did not dispute that the applicants had reported Ayub Takhayev\u2019s abduction to the police in the morning of 13\u00a0November 2002. In such circumstances the Court considers that the applicants were not obliged to lodge their complaints directly with the district prosecutor\u2019s office. Once the law enforcement authorities were duly and promptly made aware of the crime, it was incumbent on them to organise co-operation between the various State agencies in such a manner that would guarantee the effectiveness of a criminal investigation. Therefore, in the Court\u2019s opinion, the investigating authorities failed to promptly commence the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event.",
