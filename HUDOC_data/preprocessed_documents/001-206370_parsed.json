However, after he had started turning right so as to comply with the police officer\u2019s order, the same police officer had given him another order, indicating with the traffic paddle that he turn left. The police officer repeated the same order once more. Accordingly, he had complied with the given order and had turned left towards his neighbourhood and had continued driving until he had reached his house. Afterwards, two police officers had come to his house and informed him that he had committed the minor offence of failing to comply with a police order to stop a car. He had also been asked to take a breathalyser test for alcohol. One of those police officers had identified himself as Officer D.I. The applicant further argued that it was not true that he had been speeding on that occasion or running away from the police, because, as a lawyer, he had never acted contrary to official orders and he had known that the police had frequently checked traffic in the area, so he had been driving slowly.",

Although he had expressly applied to be allowed to put questions to that witness, the trial court had asked for judicial assistance from another court, where that witness had been examined in the absence of the defence. Neither the applicant nor his lawyer had been informed that D.I. would be questioned before another court, nor had they been notified of the date, time or place thereof. Throughout the proceedings the applicant had not had a single opportunity to put questions to the said witness, and consequently he had been deprived of an effective opportunity to challenge the credibility of D.I.\u2019s testimony, especially bearing in mind that he had failed to refer to many relevant circumstances of the event, which had been set out in the applicant\u2019s defence, such as that he had allegedly issued other traffic orders to the applicant, or the fact that it was not possible to increase the speed of a car at that intersection.",
