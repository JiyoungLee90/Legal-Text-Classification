The authorities had then organised transfer by air and sea to evacuate migrants from Lampedusa. The following day, clashes had taken place in the island\u2019s port between the local population and a group of foreigners who had threatened to explode gas bottles. There had thus been a situation which was likely to degenerate, and which was covered by the notion of \u201cstate of necessity\u201d (stato di necessit\u00e0) as provided for in Article 54 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 32 below). It was thus an imperative, according to the judge, to organise the transfer of some of the migrants by using, among other means, the ships.",

The fact that a refusal-of-entry measure (respingimento) had been taken against the migrants, without judicial scrutiny, a few days after their arrival, was not unlawful in the judge\u2019s view. The calculation of a \u201creasonable time\u201d for the adoption of that measure and for the migrants\u2019 stay in the CSPA had to take account of logistical difficulties (state of the sea, distance between Lampedusa and Sicily) and of the number of migrants concerned.

Unaccompanied minors had been placed in temporary accommodation and no pregnant women were transferred to the ships. The migrants on board had been able to receive medical assistance, hot water, electricity, meals and hot drinks. Moreover, as recorded in a press agency note of 25\u00a0September 2011, a member of parliament had boarded one of the ships in the port of Palermo, and had observed that the migrants were in good health, that they were receiving assistance and were sleeping in cabins containing bed linen or reclinable chairs (poltrone reclinabili). Some of the Tunisians had been taken to hospital, others had been treated on board by medical staff. Accompanied by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (vice questore) and by police officers, the MP in question had talked with some of the migrants. He had thus been able to observe that they had access to prayer rooms, that the food was satisfactory (pasta, chicken, vegetables, fruits and water) and that the Civil Protection authority (Protezione civile) had provided them with clothing. Some of the migrants had complained of a lack of razors, but the MP had observed that this could be explained by a measure taken to prevent self-harm.",

While it is true that the Tunisians interviewed by the Ad Hoc Sub-Committee were perfectly aware that they had entered Italian territory illegally (in fact, it was not the first attempt for some of them and a number had already been sent back to Tunisia on previous occasions), the same is not true of information about their rights and procedures.

Additionally human rights and refugee law and standards require that the removing State must provide an effective remedy against removal. Removing people without giving them the chance of exercising their right to challenge their removal through an effective procedure gives rise per se to a human rights violation.

(see Abdolkhani and Karimnia v. Turkey, no. 30471/08, \u00a7\u00a0125, 22 September 2009). The difference between deprivation of liberty and restrictions on freedom of movement under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 is merely one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance. Although the process of classification into one or other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task, in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of Article 5 depends (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7\u00a7 92-93, Series A no. 39). In order to determine whether someone has been deprived of his liberty, the starting-point must be his or her concrete situation, and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, and Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a036760/06, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2012).",

Furthermore, the aliens to which such confinement is applicable are placed in a CIE by an administrative decision under the supervision of the Justice of the Peace. The applicants, however, were placed in a CSPA and no formal decision to hold them in confinement had been taken. On that point, it is noteworthy that in his decision of 1 June 2012, the preliminary investigations judge of Palermo stated that the Office of the Commissioner of Police of Agrigento had merely recorded the presence of the migrants in the CSPA without ordering their placement and that the same was true for the migrants\u2019 transfer to the ships (see paragraphs\u00a020-21 above).",

The notion of \u201clawfulness\u201d under paragraph 4 of Article 5 has the same meaning as in paragraph 1, such that a detained person is entitled to a review of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of his detention in the light not only of the requirements of domestic law but also of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 \u00a7 1.

In addition, those orders were apparently not notified to the applicants until 27 and 29 September 2011 (see paragraphs 14-15 above), shortly before they were returned by plane and therefore at a time when their deprivation of liberty was about to end. It follows that, even supposing that in certain cases the lodging of an appeal with the Justice of the Peace against a refusal-of-entry order could be regarded as providing an indirect review of the lawfulness of the restriction of liberty imposed on the alien concerned, in the present case such a review, if it had been sought, could not have taken place until after the applicants\u2019 release and return to Tunisia.",

Although this is an unavoidable state of affairs which, in itself and as such, does not infringe Article 3, this provision nevertheless requires the State to ensure that detainees are held in conditions that are compatible with respect for their human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject them to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, their health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kud\u0142a v.

The scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint.

Nor does the \u201cauthority\u201d referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective.

Its explanatory report defines the meaning of \u201ccollective expulsion\u201d with reference to the recent past. As Henckearts notes, \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018collective expulsions of aliens of the kind which have already taken place\u2019 alludes to the expulsion of Germans and others in the wake of World War Two and of the forced movement of peoples in Europe during the Interbellum.\u201d",

Italy ([GC], no. 27765/09, \u00a7 185, ECHR 2012), the Court found that \u201cthe transfer of the applicants to Libya [had been] carried out without any form of examination of each applicant\u2019s individual situation\u201d, adding: \u201cIt has not been disputed that the applicants were not subjected to any identification procedure by the Italian authorities, which restricted themselves to embarking all the intercepted migrants onto military ships and disembarking them on Libyan soil\u201d (emphasis added). The Court found similar problems with identification in Sharifi and Others v.

The implementation of the decision is carried out with respect to the group of aliens as a whole.\u201d Indeed there can be nothing but collective treatment when a group is returned or deported without so much as identification of the individuals (such as passengers on a boat).

The applicants in this case fit into none of these categories. The fact that the applicants were not eligible for leave to enter Italy rendered unnecessary any further examination besides establishing their identity, nationality, and the existence of a safe country of return. That examination was carried out individually. Each applicant was identified upon arrival in Italy and later by the Tunisian consular authority and was provided with an individual removal order written in a language that he could understand. In the applicants\u2019 cases, there were no other individualised factors to be considered. Whether there had been one or one thousand migrants, the process would have been the same. After having their identities and nationalities verified by the Italian and Tunisian authorities, they were returned home in accordance with a treaty between the Italian and Tunisian governments. The return was ordered for each individual applicant by an Italian judicial authority. The streamlined process created by the two countries to deal with the sudden change in migratory flow did not disregard the individual migrant, but rather took into account the necessary considerations when deciding on removal.",
