The Court first recalls that the withdrawal of the writ of execution from the Bailiffs\u2019 Service does not in itself discharge the State from the responsibility to pay the awards given against a State authority or a State-owned enterprise (see, mutatis mutandis, Teteriny v. Russia, no. 11931/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043 and 51, 30 June 2005, and Chizhov v. Ukraine, no. 6962/02, \u00a7\u00a041, 17\u00a0May 2005). In the instant case the judgment was given against the State-owned Coal Mine and the Artemvugilia State Company. As it appears from the case file (see paragraph 10 above), the debt owed to the applicant was not extinguished following the withdrawal of the writ from the Bailiffs\u2019 Service. The Court in many instances has found  directly responsible for debts of State-owned enterprises in similar circumstances (see, among many others, Chernobryvko v. Ukraine, no. 11324/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a023 and 24, 13\u00a0September 2005). Thus, leaving aside the applicant\u2019s allegation that he was forced to withdraw the writ, the State\u2019s liability continued to exist after the formal termination of the enforcement proceedings.",

Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a027).
