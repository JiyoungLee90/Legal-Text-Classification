The purpose of those proposals was to separate judicial and managerial functions, which had been \u201cunified\u201d in the person of the President of the Supreme Court, who was at the same time president of the National Council of Justice.

The Constitutional Court held that the new regulation violated the constitutional requirements for judicial independence on both \u201cformal\u201d and \u201csubstantive\u201d grounds. From the formal point of view, a Cardinal Act must determine the length of judicial service and the retirement age in order to guarantee the irremovability of judges. Reference to the \u201cgeneral retirement age\u201d in an ordinary Act does not fulfil that requirement. As regards the substantive unconstitutionality of the provision, the new regulation resulted in the removal of judges within a short period of three months. Notwithstanding the relative freedom of the legislator to determine the maximum age of judges, and the fact that a certain age cannot be deduced from the Fundamental Law, the Constitutional Court held that the introduction of a lowered retirement age for judges must be made gradually, with an appropriate transition period and without violating the principle of the irremovability of judges. The greater the difference between the new retirement age and seventy years of age, the longer the transitional period required for introducing a lower retirement age. Otherwise, the irremovability of judges, which constitutes an essential element of independence of the judiciary, is violated.",

The former Vice-President submitted a constitutional complaint to the Constitutional Court claiming that the termination of his position violated the rule of law, the prohibition of retroactive legislation and his right to a remedy. In its decision no.\u00a0IV/2309/2012, passed by eight votes to seven, the Constitutional Court rejected the complaint. It stated that the premature termination of the claimant\u2019s term of office as Vice-President of the Supreme Court had not violated the Fundamental Law, since it was sufficiently justified by the full-scale reorganisation of the judicial system and the important changes in the tasks and competences of the President of the K\u00faria. It noted that the K\u00faria\u2019s tasks and competences had been broadened, in particular with regard to the supervision of the legality of municipal council regulations. Seven judges dissented and considered that changes with regard to the judicial system or the new K\u00faria had not fundamentally affected the status of the Vice-President. The dissenting judges concluded that the premature termination of the claimant\u2019s term of office had weakened the guarantees for the separation of powers, had been contrary to the prohibition of retroactive law-making and had breached the principle of the rule of law and the right to a remedy.",

According to different sources, this provision entails that around 300 of the most experienced judges will be obliged to retire within a year. Correspondingly, around 300 vacancies will need to be filled. This may undermine the operational capacity of the courts and affect continuity and legal security and might also open the way for undue influence on the composition of the judiciary. In the absence of sufficiently clear information on the reasons having led to this decision, the Commission trusts that adequate solutions will be found, in the context of the reform, to address, in line with the requirements of the rule of law, the difficulties and challenges engendered by this measure. ...",

The Venice Commission tends to interpret this apparent inconsistency as a confirmation of the fact that the said statement does not have legal significance. Nevertheless, it is recommended that this is specifically clarified by the Hungarian authorities. The adoption of transitional provisions (as required by the third paragraph of the Closing Provisions), of particular importance in the light of the existence, for certain provisions of the new Constitution, of possibly diverging interpretations, could be used as an excellent opportunity for providing the necessary clarifications.

Mr Baka was the Hungarian Judge to the European Court of Human Rights from 1991 to 2007, and was elected President of the Supreme Court by the Hungarian parliament in June\u00a02009. Mr Baka had not previously served a five year term as a judge in Hungary, and was therefore, despite his 17 years of experience as a judge on the ECHR, ineligible for the post of President of the Curia. The widespread perception that these legal provisions were adopted against a specific person is strengthened by the fact that in June 2011 the parliament adopted a decision that suspended all appointment procedures for judges until 1 January 2012, when Mr Baka would no longer be in office. This despite the backlog in cases that is often mentioned by the authorities as one of the underlying reasons for the reform of the judiciary. As mentioned by the Venice Commission, generally formulated legal provisions that are in reality directed against a specific person or persons are contrary to the rule of law.

Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2007-II) had been met, rendering Article 6 inapplicable to the applicant\u2019s dispute. First, as the applicant had admitted, access to a court in order to appeal against the termination of his mandate as President of the Supreme Court had been excluded by the very nature of the act complained of. Therefore the Government were of the opinion that the first condition of the Eskelinen test had been fulfilled. In this regard, they noted that other cases in which the Court had considered Article 6 applicable to civil servants\u2019 disputes did not concern the right of access to a court as such, but rather the question of whether the procedural guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1 had been complied with. Secondly, as regards the second condition of the Eskelinen test, they submitted that the applicant\u2019s post as President of the Supreme Court had involved, by its very nature, the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State (the Government referred to Harabin v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 62584/00, 9\u00a0July\u00a02002). The exclusion of access to a court in respect of the termination of that post had therefore been justified on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest.",

As regards the first condition, an implied bar was not enough; the national law must expressly exclude access to court for a certain post or category of staff, and that exclusion must be of an abstract nature, that is, it must concern all office-holders and not a specified person. Hungarian law, rather than excluding access to a court, expressly ensured that a court executive had the right of access to a court in the event of his or her dismissal, in accordance with the general rules applicable to all court executives, including the President of the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 34-36 above). The applicant had been de facto dismissed from his position as court executive and should have had the right of access to a court under the domestic law. However, he had had no opportunity to contest that measure because the respondent State, by legislating for his personal dismissal in the Fundamental Law, had effectively deprived him of his existing right of access to a court. In the applicant\u2019s view, the nature of the impugned act could not be the ground for exclusion, as the Government had argued.",

Therefore, the nature of the applicant\u2019s post as President of the Supreme Court did not justify, in itself, the exclusion of access to a court in respect of his dismissal. Quite the contrary, given the principle of judicial independence, it might be highly advisable to provide for judicial review in order to safeguard the security of tenure and the irremovability of the Chief Justice. Moreover, considering that his dismissal had been the result of abusive legislation, the applicant maintained that abusive resort to legislation could not be justified on objective grounds in a democratic society governed by the rule of law.",

Unlike the former Vice-President of the Supreme Court, who was able to file a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court against the statutory provision which terminated his term of office (see paragraph 46 above), the termination of the applicant\u2019s mandate as President of the Supreme Court was provided for by the Fundamental Law and as such could not be challenged before the Constitutional Court. In those circumstances, the nature of the impugned measure itself rendered the applicant\u2019s access to a court impossible in practice.

Relying on the Court\u2019s reasoning in its decision in the case of Harabin (cited above), the Government maintained that the applicant\u2019s post as President of the Supreme Court involved by its very nature the exercise of powers conferred on him by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State. The Court reiterates that according to the new approach adopted in Vilho Eskelinen, the mere fact that the applicant is in a sector or department which participates in the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute at issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond of trust and loyalty between the civil servant and the State (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, \u00a7 62). In the present case, the Government have not adduced any arguments to show that the subject matter of the dispute, which related to the premature termination of the applicant\u2019s mandate as President of the Supreme Court, was linked to the exercise of State power in such a way that the exclusion of Article 6 guarantees was objectively justified. In this regard, the Court considers it significant that the former Vice-President of the Supreme Court, unlike the applicant, was able to challenge the premature termination of his mandate before the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 46 above).",

It was not only his right to express his opinion, but also one of his duties as President of the National Council of Justice. There was a causal relationship between the expression of those views and his premature dismissal. According to the applicant, his allegation was corroborated by the fact that the Government had previously denied that the new regulation on the competences of the new K\u00faria would necessitate the termination of the mandates of persons elected under the previous Constitution (see Position CDL(2011)058 of the Government transmitted to the Venice Commission on 6 July 2011, paragraph 48 above). The idea of the applicant\u2019s dismissal did not emerge until late November 2011, subsequent to the criticisms expressed by him (including in his parliamentary speech of 3 November 2011).

The fact that the public expression of his opinions pre-dated the termination of his mandate was not sufficient to prove that there was a causal link between them. The applicant\u2019s mandate had been terminated because of the fundamental changes in the functions of the supreme judicial authority in Hungary, renamed as K\u00faria. The function for which the applicant had been elected had ceased to exist upon the entry into force of the Fundamental Law. His election and activities had been mostly connected with the functions of the President of the National Council of Justice, which had been separated from those of the President of the new K\u00faria. In addition, the functions and competences of the K\u00faria itself had also been changed and broadened. Therefore, the professional requirements stemming from those new functions could not have been taken into account when the applicant\u2019s suitability for the post of President of the Supreme Court had been considered. Relying on the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 19 March 2013 concerning the termination of the mandate of the Vice-President of the Supreme Court, the Government were of the opinion that the major changes in the functions of the President of the Supreme Court also justified reconsideration of his suitability for the post of President of the new K\u00faria. Furthermore, the requirement that the new President of the K\u00faria should have at least five years\u2019 judicial service guaranteed the influence of the judiciary in the selection of candidates for that post. The post was now more judicial and less managerial than that of the President of the Supreme Court.

In their view, this case was part of a general pattern of weakening of the system of checks and balances that had taken place in the past three years in Hungary. They referred to other legislative steps aimed at the early removal of individual State officials, notably the Supreme Court\u2019s Vice-President, whose constitutional complaint had been examined by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 46 above), but also the Data Protection Commissioner and members of the National Election Committee. They also referred to other examples of legislation targeting individuals, retroactive legislation (see N.K.M. v. Hungary, no. 66529/11, 14 May 2013) and other legislative measures threatening the independence of the judiciary (such as the right of the president of the National Judicial Office to transfer cases). They maintained that this case should be examined in the general context in Hungary and in the light of the importance of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. The widespread use of legislation targeting individuals could remove a wide range of significant issues from judicial scrutiny. The Court should therefore delve \u201cbehind the appearances\u201d and examine the real purpose of such legislation and the effect it might have on individuals\u2019 Convention rights.",

The Court observed that in that letter the Prince had criticised the content of the applicant\u2019s lecture and announced the intention to sanction him because he had freely expressed his opinion on questions of constitutional law. The Court therefore concluded that Article 10 was applicable and that there had been an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression. Similarly, in Kudeshkina v. Russia (cited above), the Court observed that the decision to bar the applicant from holding judicial office had been prompted by her statements to the media. Neither the applicant\u2019s eligibility for public service nor her professional ability to exercise judicial functions was part of the arguments before the domestic authorities.

Similarly, in the Harabin judgment it was the applicant\u2019s professional behaviour in the context of the administration of justice which represented the essential aspect of the case.

He expressed his opinions through his spokesman, through public letters or communiqu\u00e9s, including with other members of the judiciary, by challenging legislation before the Constitutional Court, or by directly addressing Parliament in a speech (3 November 2011). On 19\u00a0November\u00a02011, a bill proposing an amendment to the 1949 Constitution was submitted to Parliament by a member of the governing party. The amendment proposed that Parliament should elect the president of the new K\u00faria by 31 December 2011 at the latest. On 20 November 2011, two leaders of the political parties forming the parliamentary majority submitted to Parliament a Bill on the Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law. Pursuant to section 11(2) of the Bill, the mandate of the President of the Supreme Court would be terminated upon the entry into force of the Fundamental Law. That measure was also included in a proposal to amend the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Bill (Bill T/4743), submitted by another member of the governing party on 23 November 2011. On 28 November and 30 December 2011, all those proposals were adopted and enacted.

Furthermore, although the applicant remained in office as a judge of the new K\u00faria, the premature termination of his mandate as President of the Supreme Court had pecuniary consequences, namely the loss of the remuneration and other benefits applicable to that post for the rest of his presidential term. The Court reiterates that the fear of sanction has a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the exercise of freedom of expression and in particular risks discouraging judges from making critical remarks about public institutions or policies, for fear of losing their judicial office (see, mutatis mutandis, Wille, cited above, \u00a7 50, and Kudeshkina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 98-100). This effect, which works to the detriment of society as a whole, is also a factor that concerns the proportionality of, and thus the justification for, the sanction imposed on the applicant.",

Furthermore, the new legislation passed in 2011 prevented him from enjoying the special post-retirement benefits as a former President of the Supreme Court. However, that income had not been actually earned. Nor can it be argued that it was definitely payable (see Volkov v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 21722/11, 18 October 2011; see conversely, N.K.M. v.
