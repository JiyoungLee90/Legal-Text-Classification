In this connection, it finds that the decision of the Supreme Court, served on the applicant on 1 June 2005, and which dealt with the merits of the applicant's petition for review and adopted a reasoned decision in the matter, constituted the final domestic decision with regard to proceedings \u201cA\u201d (B\u00e9la Szab\u00f3 v. , no. 37470/06, \u00a7 16, 9 December 2008).
