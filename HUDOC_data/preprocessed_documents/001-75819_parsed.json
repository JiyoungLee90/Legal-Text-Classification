There were also indications that certain interested parties had not been properly notified of the privatisation terms. The latest valuation of the hotel prior to the privatisation had been conducted under circumstances which called into question the objectivity of the officials involved. These facts could only be elucidated through a criminal investigation. The prosecution authorities were also bound to exercise their powers under Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1952 (\u201cthe CCP\u201d) (see paragraph 40 below). In these circumstances, the performance of the obligations in the privatisation contract would disturb public order, lead to the commission of offences by officials and economic offences, and cause considerable damage.",

The legal basis of the decision appealed against were Article 185 \u00a7\u00a01 of the CCrP and section 119(1)(6) of the Judicial Power Act of 1994.

It argued that it had been entered into under manifestly disadvantageous conditions, within the meaning of paragraph 8 of the transitional and concluding provisions of Transformation and Privatisation of State and MunicipallyOwned Enterprises Act of 1992. The price paid for the hotel had been below its real market value. The penalties stipulated in the contract in the event of a failure of the applicant company to perform its investment obligations were negligible. The applicant company was allowed to convey the hotel as noncash consideration for shares in a limited liability company despite the prohibition to dispose of the hotel for five years. The contract made no provision for its rescission in the event of nonperformance. Finally, the performance of the contract was questionable in view of the fact that the negotiations had initially been conducted with another company, while the applicant company had intervened in the process later.",

In a final decision of 11 February 1998 the Sofia City Court rejected the request as inadmissible, holding that it was not connected with the subjectmatter of the original action, as it concerned acts which postdated the execution of the contract, and that it was not sufficiently precise, as it did not specifically identify all impugned decisions of the Sofia City Prosecutor\u2019s Office.

It took into account not only the cash amount paid to the Sofia Municipal Council, but also the investment and job creation commitments. The court went on to say that there was no legal prohibition on the use of privatised property as noncash consideration for shares. There was nothing to prevent the parties to the contract to agree that the applicant company was free to do so under certain conditions. The Sofia City Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s arguments concerning the possibility of such a transaction were immaterial, as the court\u2019s task was not to hypothesise about future events, but to decide on the basis of concrete facts. The court further found that the lack of any clauses in the contract for its rescission did not render it manifestly disadvantageous, since in the event of nonperformance it could be rescinded by virtue of the law. The penalties provided by the contract for nonperformance were immaterial since the Sofia Municipal Council could in any event claim compensation for its actual damages by law.

It follows that the applicant company would not have been able to successfully bring proceedings against the State or the Sofia City Prosecutor\u2019s Office under that provision.

However, there is nothing to suggest that the prosecutors\u2019 decisions in issue contravened Bulgarian law. They were upheld by the higher prosecutors, whereas the courts would refuse to examine their lawfulness in a civil action, such as a one in tort, as is apparent from the reasoning of the Sofia City Court\u2019s decision of 11\u00a0February 1998 (see paragraphs 10, 11, 17 and 19 above). It thus seems that any such claim would have no prospects of success. The Court furthermore notes that the respondent Government did not refer to any domestic court judgments or doctrinal opinions in corroboration of their averment that such a claim would provide an effective remedy in the circumstances, whereas it is incumbent on a Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy it points to was effective and available in theory and in practice at the relevant time (see, as a recent authority, Sejdovic v.

It observes, however, that the company\u2019s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 relates to the prosecutors\u2019 decisions which interfered with its property rights. These decisions were not part of the matters under examination in the civil proceedings against the company, as the Sofia City Court refused to entertain the request for a declaration of their unlawfulness (see paragraph 19 above). It is true that the discontinuation of the operation of the prosecutors\u2019 decisions following, and possibly as a result of, the conclusion of these proceedings, brought the interference with the company\u2019s possessions to an end. However, it did not eliminate the intervening impossibility to use and manage the hotel for more than two years (see, mutatis mutandis, Potop v. Romania, no. 35882/97, \u00a7\u00a037, 25 November 2003). Moreover, the company\u2019s grievances concern not only the interference with its possessions, but also the alleged impossibility, in breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, to obtain judicial review of the prosecutors\u2019 decisions which brought about that interference (see, mutatis mutandis, Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7 50, ECHR 1999VII). Consequently, the favourable outcome of the proceedings for annulling the privatisation contract does not seem to have provided any redress in respect of the violations alleged in the present case.",

(no. 1), judgment of 25 October 1989, Series A no. 163, pp. 1921, \u00a7\u00a7 6674). The Court observes on this point that the ordered suspension of the performance of the privatisation contract and the eviction of the applicant company from the hotel had a clear and decisive impact on its capability to use and operate it, which was undoubtedly an exercise of a civil right (see, mutatis mutandis, Fredin v.\u00a0Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 192, p. 20, \u00a7\u00a063).

It should firstly be noted in this connection that the Sofia City Prosecutor\u2019s Office made the impugned decisions of its own motion, whereas a tribunal would normally become competent to deal with a matter if it is referred to it by another person or entity. Moreover, it appears that the making of the decisions did not have to be \u2013 and was, in fact, not \u2013 attended by any sort of proceedings involving the participation of the entity concerned, i.e. the applicant company. The law made no provision for the holding of hearings, and did not lay down any rules on such matters as the admissibility of evidence or the manner in which the proceedings were to be conducted (see H., cited above, p. 35, \u00a7 53). Finally, it appears from the wording of the relevant legal provisions (see paragraphs 37 and 38 above) that the Sofia City Prosecutor\u2019s Office enjoyed considerable latitude in determining what course of action to pursue, which appears hardly compatible with the notions of the rule of law and legal certainty inherent in judicial proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Sovtransavto Holding v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 48553/99, \u00a7 82, ECHR 2002VII).",

Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998VIII, pp. 229899, \u00a7\u00a7 14450). It considers that a similar rationale should apply in the present case. The decisions ordering the suspension of the performance of the privatisation contract and the applicant company\u2019s eviction from the hotel were made by the Sofia City Prosecutor\u2019s Office of its own motion. It then brought, in exercise of its powers under Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the CCP, a civil action against the company, seeking the annulment of that same privatisation contract (see paragraphs 8, 15 and 18 above). It could thus hardly be deemed as sufficiently impartial for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Procola v.\u00a0Luxembourg, judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 326, p. 16, \u00a7\u00a045). The same goes for the higher levels of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which upheld these decisions and subsequently acted against the applicant company in the proceedings before the Sofia Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). The mere fact that the prosecutors acted as guardians of the public interest cannot be regarded as conferring on them a judicial status or the status of independent and impartial actors (see, mutatis mutandis, Merit v. , no. 66561/01, \u00a7\u00a063, 30 March 2004).",

This was only natural, as the issue to be decided therein \u2013 whether the privatisation contract with the applicant company had been made under manifestly disadvantageous conditions \u2013 was entirely different from that of the lawfulness of the impugned prosecutors\u2019 decisions. Consequently, the courts did not touch upon that issue in their reasoning or in the operative provisions of their judgments. Therefore, the respondent Government\u2019s suggestion that these proceedings could in a way be regarded as an appeal against the Sofia City Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s decisions cannot be accepted by the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Werner v.

It is true that after their completion the Sofia City Prosecutor\u2019s Office eventually stated that its decisions were no longer operative (see paragraphs 31 and 32 above).

The Court notes in this connection that the respondent Government did not advance any reasons justifying the lack of access to a court. The rationale applied by the  in rejecting as inadmissible applications for judicial review of prosecutors\u2019 decisions was confined to arguments relating to the status of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office (see paragraph 43 above). However, as the Court found above, that Office cannot be seen as being an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1.

Moreover, the aim of the decisions had been legitimate and the means used to that end had been proportionate. The statutory provisions in issue laid down general rules. They empowered the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to take all necessary measures to prevent the commission of criminal offences, including impounding of the means which could be used for perpetrating the offence. Since the possession of property alone could, in certain cases where the relevant privatisation regulations had been breached, constitute a criminal offence, the authorities were under a duty to intervene. The offence sought to be forestalled was one which could possibly be committed by the applicant company. At the same time, the only means to establish whether or not the municipal officials had already offended had been to suspend the performance of the privatisation contract. The prosecutors\u2019 right to request the annulment of a contract in case it violated general rules existed in other legal systems. For instance, under the French system the public prosecutors could also bring proceedings to protect the general interest. The Bulgarian practice in the privatisation domain was thus fully compatible with the universally acknowledged principles of nullity. Since the definition of the general interest was reserved for the national authorities\u00a0\u2013 the legislature and the courts \u2013, the provisions in issue did not fall foul of the requirements of the Convention. The prescribed procedures ensured sufficient safeguards against arbitrary action, such as a possibility to appeal to the higher levels of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office and to a court in the event the criminal proceedings reached the judicial phase. The lack of suspensive effect of these appeals did not deprive them of their effectiveness. Moreover, all higher prosecutors had fully upheld the decisions in issue as lawful. The applicant company\u2019s request for them to be rescinded following the end of the civil proceedings against it had been misguided, as they had then already been rendered invalid.",

For more than seven years the competent prosecutors had not indicated which had been the offence which they had sought to prevent, who would have committed it and why it had been necessary to impound the hotel to avert it. No criminal charges had been preferred before a court. No criminal proceedings had been brought against the applicant company either. That option was unavailable under Bulgarian law anyway, since legal entities could not incur criminal liability. Finally, there was nothing to show that the prosecutors\u2019 decisions had become moot after the end of the civil proceedings against the applicant company; it had thus correctly requested their rescission.",

Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999II; Carbonara and Ventura v. , no. 24638/94, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2000VI; and Capital Bank AD, cited above, \u00a7 133).",

It thus presupposes that the rules of domestic law must be sufficiently precise and foreseeable (see Hentrich v. France, judgment of 22 September 1994, Series\u00a0A no. 296A, pp. 1920, \u00a7 42; and Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2000I). It also implies that the law must provide a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see Capital Bank AD, cited above, \u00a7 134, with further references). It would be contrary to the rule of law for the legal discretion granted to the authorities in areas affecting fundamental rights to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, so as to give the affected individuals and entities adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, mutatis mutandis, Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2000XI, with further references). Finally, the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society command that measures affecting fundamental human rights be accompanied by appropriate procedural safeguards. In ascertaining whether this condition has been satisfied, a comprehensive view must be taken of the applicable procedures (see AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 24\u00a0October 1986, Series A no. 108, p. 19, \u00a7 55; Hentrich, cited above, p. 21, \u00a7 49; and Jokela v.

According to the applicant company, as well as the , that Office\u2019s decisions in the case at hand fell outside the purview of these provisions and were thus unlawful in terms of Bulgarian law (see paragraphs 10, 11, 17, 19 and 91 above). According to the Government, the very possession of a thing could constitute an offence, with the result that the decisions were lawful (see paragraph 90 above). The Court would be usurping the function of the national courts were it to attempt to make an authoritative statement on this issue of domestic law. It is, however, required under the Convention to determine whether that law lays down with reasonable clarity the essential elements of the authorities\u2019 powers (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 2 August 1984, Series A no. 82, p. 36, \u00a7 79). It notes in this connection that the above-mentioned statutory provisions used particularly vague terms (see paragraphs 37 and 38 above), which made it almost impossible to foresee under what conditions the competent prosecutors will choose to act and what measures they will take in the event they considered, without independent control, that an offence might be committed. It is true that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice. However, there is no reported caselaw interpreting and clarifying the exact import of the provisions at issue, in all probability on account of the impossibility of judicial review of prosecutors\u2019 decisions as the ones at hand (see paragraphs 41 and 43 above). As a result, these rules, which appear to be of general application, serve as a catchall, giving the Prosecutor\u2019s Office unfettered discretion to act in any manner it sees fit, which may in some cases have serious and farreaching consequences for the rights of private individuals and entities (see paragraph 39 above). This discretion and the concomitant lack of adequate procedural safeguards, such as elemental rules of procedure and, as already found by the Court (see paragraphs 77, 78 and 8183 above), review by an independent body, and the resulting obscurity and uncertainty surrounding the powers of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office in this domain, lead the Court to conclude that the minimum degree of legal protection to which individuals and legal entities are entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society was lacking. It follows that the interference with the applicant company\u2019s possessions was not lawful, within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

Consequently, no obligation arose for the State to make good the alleged loss of profits resulting from the eviction during the pendency of the civil action against the applicant company. The only period in respect of which the applicant company could validly claim compensation was that which followed the dismissal of the action in a final judgment. However, it was evident that no interference with its possessions had occurred at that time, as the prosecutors\u2019 decisions had become moot after the favourable end of the civil proceedings. Furthermore, the applicant company\u2019s claim was clearly excessive and based on unreliable expert reports. The first expert report produced by the applicant company, relating to the material damage to the hotel, was not signed, but merely sealed.

I disagreed with the majority in respect of Article 13 because, to my mind, the main problem of the case was not the fairness of the trial, but the lack of effective remedies against the impugned Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s decisions and the fact that there was no possibility of obtaining compensation for the damage caused by its actions.",

Initially it relied on Article 185 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974, which gives the impression that criminal proceedings were initiated. Later it became clear that a criminal investigation had indeed been opened; however, not against the applicant company, but against an official of the . Serious allegations of infringing important public interests and public order were also levelled against the . The first tangible procedural steps against the applicant company were taken on 6\u00a0October 1997, when the police sealed off the hotel. At that stage the steps taken were investigative actions by the prosecution (principally against the municipality) of a type which prosecution authorities everywhere are generally entitled to take. It has to be noted clearly that at that point these amounted only to an investigation, not to a trial or a judicial final determination of someone\u2019s civil rights. It was rather a criminal investigation which had direct implications for the applicant company\u2019s property rights. Such steps could, in principle, be viewed as a legitimate control of the use of property. The direct determination of the applicant company\u2019s civil rights started when the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, exercising its legal powers, brought a civil action against the  and the applicant company, seeking the annulment of the privatisation contract. Fullscale judicial proceedings commenced, whose conformity with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 has never been challenged by the applicant company. The final decision in these proceedings was favourable to the company.",

The legality of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s actions was challenged on 9 December 1997 by the , which argued that they did not have a sufficient legal basis and were ultra vires. The applicant company appealed several times, but only to the higher prosecutor\u2019s offices, complaining, inter alia, of a breach of its rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the prohibition on the use of its property (the hotel) for nearly two years, which infringed its right to peacefully enjoy its possessions.",
