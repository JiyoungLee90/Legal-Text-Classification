It observed that the decision of 3\u00a0March 2008 by which he had been excluded from the list of people who were to receive subsidies had been based on the instructions contained in the letters of 12\u00a0September and 29\u00a0November 2002 from the State Construction Agency (see above). Even though those letters, which the court assessed as \u201cnormative acts\u201d, had had an impact on individual rights, namely the right to [respect for one\u2019s] home, they had not been registered with the Ministry of Justice or published, as provided for by law. Furthermore, they had been circulated several months after the list of persons who were entitled to housing subsidies had been compiled. Moreover, the court observed that at the time of the events the applicant had been in possession of a valid court decision establishing the fact that he had been residing in the flood-hit area in June 2002. The court found that, in accordance with the Protection from Emergencies Act (see paragraph\u00a034 below), the procedure for allocating subsidies had had to be established by a decree of the federal or regional governments. However, no such procedure had existed at the material time, and the relevant decree had not been issued. Accordingly, the court directly applied the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the Liberty of Movement Act (cited in paragraphs 33 and 35 below) and found that the applicant\u2019s exercise of his rights could not be conditional on his being registered at his place of residence, and could not be restricted on that account. The court therefore annulled the decision of the Government of Kabardino-Balkaria of 3\u00a0March 2008.",

It was incumbent on the State to abide by its terms (see, among others, Velskaya v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a021769/03, \u00a7\u00a018, 5\u00a0October 2006, and Markovtsi and Selivanov v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a0756/05 and 25761/05, \u00a7\u00a029, 23\u00a0July 2009). However, in the present case, the State avoided paying the judgment debt for more than two years and three months until the judgment was quashed, referring, inter alia, to a lack of money, even though it is not open to a State authority to cite a lack of funds as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt (see Burdov v.\u00a0Russia (no.\u00a02), no.\u00a033509/04, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR\u00a02009).

Similarly, only the operative part of the appeal court\u2019s judgment was read out, whereas a copy of the reasons for that decision was prepared and sent to the parties ten days later (see paragraph\u00a031 and 32 above). The material before the Court suggests that the judgments were not publicly pronounced in full by either the firstinstance or the appeal court, and there is no evidence to confirm that the judgments were made accessible to the public at all. The Court concludes that the judgments of the above-mentioned courts remained inaccessible to the public, as at the material time there was no means of ensuring publicity other than by reading out the operative parts of judgments in open court. The possibility to grant access to the judgments to those whose rights and lawful interests had been infringed was insufficient to comply with the publicity requirement (see Malmberg and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a053-55, with further references). The Court further notes that Federal Law no.\u00a0262FZ of 22\u00a0December 2008, which provided for the publication of domestic court judgments on the Internet, entered into force on 1\u00a0July 2010, that is more than a year after the events in the present case (see Malmberg and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056).",

On the other hand, it notes that the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2005 in the applicant\u2019s favour was never enforced. Therefore, the applicant was prevented from receiving the amount he had legitimately expected to receive under the binding and enforceable judgment delivered by domestic courts in his favour.
