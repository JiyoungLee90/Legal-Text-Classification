The Supreme Court found that the applicant had failed to follow the procedure established by the Minsk Convention. In particular, he had not submitted the following documents to the Russian courts: a certified copy of the R\u00ee\u0219cani District Court\u2019s judgment, a letter from the R\u00ee\u0219cani District Court asking for the enforcement of the judgment on the territory of the Russian Federation, a statement by the judge that the judgment had not yet been enforced in Moldova, a confirmation by the same judge that Ms\u00a0E.P. and her representative had been duly notified of the date and place of the hearing before the R\u00ee\u0219cani District Court, and, finally, a statement by the R\u00ee\u0219cani District Court that the judgment had entered into force. The Supreme Court also noted that the translations into Russian of the court documents submitted by the applicant had not been made. In such circumstances, the Moscow City Court should not have granted his application for a warrant of execution \u2013 instead, under Article 136 of the CCP the City Court was obliged to adjourn the proceedings and give the applicant the opportunity to submit the missing documents. The Supreme Court ordered that the case be remitted for fresh consideration.",

In particular, the City Court dismissed the argument by Ms\u00a0E.P. that the enforcement of the decision of the R\u00ee\u0219cani District Court in Russia would be contrary to \u201cpublic policy\u201d.

Articles 51 et seq. of the Minsk Convention concern mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments and establish a procedure for obtaining a warrant of execution. Those provisions are formulated in the same terms as the corresponding provisions of the 1993 Treaty; however, the list of exceptions which prevent the issuance of a warrant of execution is longer. In particular, the court may refuse to issue a warrant of execution if the original decision rendered in another member-State is not final or enforceable, if the statutory time-limit for enforcement has been exceeded, and so forth.",

Where one parent unlawfully prevents another from enjoying the latter\u2019s parental rights, the Court has repeatedly held that Article 8 includes a right for parents to have measures taken that will enable them to be reunited with their children and an obligation on the national authorities to take such measures (see IgnaccoloZenide, cited above, \u00a7 94, with further references).",

In particular, in cases of international child abduction the Court has always presumed that the best interests of the child are better served by the restoration of the status quo by means of a decision ordering the child\u2019s immediate return to his or her country of habitual residence in the event of abduction (X v.\u00a0Latvia, cited above, \u00a7 97).",

The Court laid out a series of principles which have essentially been reproduced in most of the nonenforcement of return order cases which have followed. First of all, the Court established that Article 8 includes a parent\u2019s right to have measures taken with a view to his or her being reunited with his or her child and an obligation on the national authorities to take such action. In implementing such measures the authorities should take into account the best interests of the child, which are considered in terms of the possibility of using coercive measures to enforce return (\u00a7\u00a094). The positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention must be interpreted in the light of the Hague Convention (\u00a7\u00a095). The adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation. Proceedings relating to execution of the decision delivered require urgent handling, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the children and the parent who does not live with them (\u00a7\u00a0102). Finally, the Court has defined its role in such cases as considering whether the measures taken by the domestic authorities were \u201cadequate and effective\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a0108 and 113).",

The Court observes that on 19 October 2011 the Bailiffs\u2019 Service refused to enforce the warrant of execution on the grounds that the original judgment of the R\u00ee\u0219cani District Court was declaratory and did not require any positive measures to be taken (see paragraph 67 above). The Court observes that the bailiffs\u2019 refusal to act was based on essentially the same misconception as the decision of the Moscow City Court of 15\u00a0September 2010, which was later quashed by the Supreme Court. Such a reading of the original judgment was wrong, but to prove this point the applicant had to initiate yet another set of court proceedings in Russia, which only ended on 28 September 2012 with a judgment of the Moscow City Court (see paragraph 75 above). The Russian courts declared that the bailiffs\u2019 refusal to take action was unlawful and ordered them to act.

The Court stresses that Ms E.P. was living in Russia quite openly, and had a job and a known place of residence. She was required by law to present herself regularly to the immigration authorities in order to have her residence permit extended. Her son attended kindergarten and, as transpires from the materials of the case, was known to the social services. Thus, Ms\u00a0E.P. was within the reach of the authorities.

The Court accepts that such assistance was indeed quite useful. The Court also notes that the child welfare authorities made certain steps to check up on the child\u2019s home environment and living conditions, and to ensure that he was not subjected to illtreatment in his new family. However, none of those measures were aimed at the enforcement of the judgment of the R\u00ee\u0219cani District Court, and the actions taken by the authorities were certainly insufficient to compel Ms\u00a0E.P. to hand the child over to the applicant.",

Although, for the most part, those proceedings did not require the applicant\u2019s personal presence, the Court accepts that at least one trip to Moscow was necessary in the circumstances.
