The Juvenile Court had taken into account the applicant\u2019s young age of eighteen years, the short period of time during which he had committed the offences, namely two and a half months, together with the fact that the applicant had no previous criminal record. Further, the administrative authorities had grossly disregarded the applicant\u2019s high degree of integration in , namely his lawful residence and that of his family for years, as well as his school education and completion of a vocational training on the one hand, and the lack of any family ties with  and  after his grandparents\u2019 death on the other.

In this respect they submitted that the applicant did not meet the requirements of Section\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(4) of the 1997\u00a0Aliens Act, as he clearly had not grown up in Austria from an early age onwards since he had left Austria when he was only seven months old and did not return until he was ten. This had also been pointed out in the reasoning of the domestic authorities\u2019 decisions of 25\u00a0March and 27\u00a0April 1998 which dismissed his application for lifting the residence prohibition. The measure also pursued the legitimate aim of the prevention of disorder or crime.

These cases all involved second generation immigrants who arrived in the host country at an early age and were convicted of serious offences with lengthy terms of unconditional imprisonment. Furthermore, they concerned drug offences, the kind of offence, for which the Court has shown understanding of domestic authorities\u2019 firmness with regard to those who actively contribute to its spread (see C. v. Belgium, 7\u00a0August 1996, Reports 1996-III, p.\u00a0924, \u00a7\u00a035; Dalia, cited above, p.\u00a092, \u00a7\u00a054, Baghli v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a034374/97, 30\u00a0November 1999, \u00a7\u00a048 in fine, ECHR 1999-VIII; and Yilmaz v.

In the present case, despite the shorter duration of the applicant\u2019s stay in  the Court attaches considerable weight to the fact that although the applicant was convicted of aggravated robbery, he was only sentenced to a six-month unconditional term of imprisonment, whereas twenty-four months were suspended on probation.
