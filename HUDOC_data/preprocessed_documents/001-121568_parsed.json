Before the Migration Board (Migrationsverket), the applicant submitted that he is a Sunni Muslim from Nasriya, located in the Thi-Qar district in Southern Iraq. He had been in a relationship with a woman who was a Shiah Muslim. He had asked her family for permission to marry her on three occasions in 2007, but had been refused because he was a Sunni Muslim. After his first proposal, two of the woman\u2019s cousins had assaulted him and warned him against proposing again. In late 2007 the couple had decided to elope. They had travelled to , where they had stayed with a relative of the applicant for one week. They had falsely told their families that they had married and the woman had returned to her parents\u2019 house, after having been promised that the family would allow the marriage. Meanwhile, the applicant had returned home with his brothers. Some days later, four unidentified persons had shot at their house, but had left after the applicant\u2019s brother had fired back. The next day the applicant had driven past the woman\u2019s house, and had discovered that she had been killed. Her hair and her hand with the engagement ring had been hung on the front door of her house, as a sign that the family had cleansed their honour. The woman had been killed by her father and two of her cousins. Of the woman\u2019s cousins one was involved with the Badr Organisation and another with the Al\u00a0Daawa party, and they had requested the militias to harass the applicant. His family\u2019s house had been visited daily by the woman\u2019s relatives, and they had left a threatening letter stating that they wanted his head. They had also entered his family\u2019s house to look for him. The applicant had left the region after a few days in hiding. In 2008, his father had received a threatening letter, urging him to surrender the applicant or else leave his home. His mother had been shot and killed by relatives of the woman in January 2009. The shot had been aimed at another relative, but had hit her instead. Their house had subsequently been burnt down.",

The Board further held that the applicant\u2019s claim that the woman\u2019s family had been responsible for the shooting was mere speculation on his part. The threatening letter addressed to his father was unsigned, while the one addressed to the applicant had not been submitted to the Board. It had not been made probable that the death of the applicant\u2019s mother was connected to him. The Board also noted that the police had contacted the woman\u2019s family regarding the incidents, and that they had denied involvement. The woman\u2019s family had, according to the applicant\u2019s own statements, \u201cwashed away their shame\u201d by killing the woman, and the Board therefore presumed that the family considered their honour to be restored.

This occurred principally in Baghdad, Iraq\u2019s most diverse city, but also in the mixed towns and villages surrounding it.

We observe that although the May 2012 UNHCR Guidelines emphasise the harm caused by the ethno-sectarian conflict between different communities, especially that between Sunni and Shi\u2019a, they do not state there is a need for international refugee protection purely because a person is a Sunni or Shi\u2019a and we do not consider that the evidence shows that there is a real risk of Article 15(c) [of the Refugee Qualification Directive 2004/83/EC] harm arising solely because a person is a Sunni or Shi\u2019a civilian. And even where concern is expressed about both Sunnis and Shi\u2019as living in or returning to areas in which they would constitute a minority, the substance of what UNHCR is saying is not that Sunni Arabs living in majority Shi\u2019a areas and Shi\u2019a Arabs living in majority Sunni Arab areas \u201cwill\u201d be at Article 15(c) risk but simply that \u201cthey may be exposed to targeted violence on account of their religious identity\u201d.

However, whilst for the above reasons we find the evidence as a whole insufficient to establish Sunni or Shi\u2019a identity as in itself an \u201cenhanced risk category\u201d under Article 15(c), we do accept that depending on the individual circumstances, and in particular on their facing return to an area where their Sunni or Shi\u2019a brethren are in a minority, a person may be able to establish a real risk of Article\u00a015(c).

However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0124-125, ECHR 2008-...).",

Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a046827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2005-I). These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v. France, judgment of 29 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, \u00a7 40).",

It is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In this respect, the Court acknowledges that, owing to the special situation in which asylum seekers often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in support thereof. However, when information is presented which gives strong reasons to question the veracity of an asylum seeker\u2019s submissions, the individual must provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies (see, among other authorities, Collins and Akaziebie v.

Taking into account the international and national reports available today, the Court sees no reason to alter the position taken in this respect four years ago.

However, the Court has held that reliance on such an alternative does not affect the responsibility of the expelling  to ensure that the applicant is not, as a result of its decision to expel, exposed to treatment contrary to Article 3. Therefore, as a precondition of relying on an internal flight or relocation alternative, certain guarantees have to be in place: the person to be expelled must be able to travel to the area concerned, gain admittance and settle there, failing which an issue under Article 3 may arise, the more so if in the absence of such guarantees there is a possibility of his or her ending up in a part of the country of origin where there is a real risk of illtreatment (Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom, nos. 8319/07 and\u00a011449/07, \u00a7 266, 28 June 2011, with further references).",

The same holds true for his claim that he would be forced to submit documents to local authorities which would inevitably lead to his being found. Here, the Court first observes that the available general information suggests that tribes and clans are region-based powers. Thus, in many cases, a person who is persecuted by a family or clan can be safe in another part of the country. In this connection, it is also of importance to note that the influence and power of the tribes and clans differ. One factor possibly weighing against the reasonableness of internal relocation is that a person is persecuted by a powerful clan or tribe with influence at governmental level. However, if the clan or tribe in question is not particularly influential, an internal flight alternative might be reasonable in many cases. As regards the family in question, there is no evidence to support the applicant\u2019s claim that it is powerful and has links to the authorities and militia. The applicant has not put forward any documentary evidence to support his claim in this regard, nor has he given any detailed information regarding the woman\u2019s relatives and their alleged position in Iraqi society.",
