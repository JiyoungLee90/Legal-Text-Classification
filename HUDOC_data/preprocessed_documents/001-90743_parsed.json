He had been given four military awards for bravery and four medals, however such medals had been given to a large number of officers and soldiers. In October 1992 he had been called upon to carry out military assignments (allegedly murders and terrorist acts) against the Shi\u2019as in Al Ahwar. As he had felt unable to murder his own people, he had deserted and left  on 20 December 1992. In this respect, he submitted that he sympathised with all organisations working against Saddam Hussein and working towards a democratic government. Following his desertion, he had visited his relatives in Basra and then made his way, with his family, to northern Iraq, where he and his children had travelled to Sweden via  with the help of smugglers.

He had been drafted to the military in October 1981, had become an officer in 1986 and had risen to major in 1990. He claimed that he had never participated in any combat or killed anyone since his military work had mainly consisted of ensuring the functioning of transports and support for the front line. As an officer, he had been placed under the orders of others and thus had never had any influence himself. He had participated in the war against  and when this ended in 1988 he had been transferred to an armoured tank division within the Republican Guard. In March 1992 he had received four medals for bravery from the Ministry of Defence. He stated that about 500 officers had received such medals and that they were mainly perceived as an encouragement to the officers. At this time he had also received a special identity card, \u201cFriends of Saddam\u201d, which almost every officer in the Republican Guard and some officers in the regular army received. He had never met Saddam Hussein personally but the card gave certain privileges, inter alia, in contacts with the authorities. During the interview on 15 December 1993, the applicant changed certain statements which he had previously given to the Immigration Board. In particular, he claimed that he had not been called back into service after he left the military in January 1992. Moreover, he stated that he had applied for a visa for a tourist trip to Malta with his family at the Maltese Embassy in  and that they had received both visas and exit permits for a month.

It further ordered that the applicant be expelled from  with a prohibition on returning. The applicant had admitted that he had killed his wife but claimed that he had acted in psychosis and had not intended to kill her.

The assessment of his application for asylum took place in 1993, at a time when the SICT had not yet come into existence and he had also not been asked about it later. Apart from the risk of being sentenced by the SICT or another jurisdiction, there was a real risk that he would be the victim of an extrajudicial killing. Extremist militias tried to find and kill all officers who had fought for Saddam Hussein in the war against Iran or who had fought against the Shi\u2019as in southern  in 1991.

The ceasefire was initially declared for a period of six months but was prolonged and, in August 2008, al-Sadr announced an indefinite ceasefire and stated that anyone in his Mahdi Army who did not follow his order would not be considered a member of his group (United Press International, Sadr declares another ceasefire, 29 August 2008).

The security environment remained precarious, particularly in Central and Southern Iraq, where issues relating to shelter and property restitution or compensation had not yet been solved (UNHCR, UNCHR urges reinforced EU commitment to protection of Iraqi refugees, 23 September 2008).",

In this respect, the Court observes that Iraqi national identity cards explicitly note the holder\u2019s religion. Thus, even if the applicant were not to manifest his religious beliefs openly, it is likely that his religious affiliation would become known to others as he would have to show his identity card to the authorities in the course of everyday life. The Court also takes into account that there have been several incidents directed against Christians in Iraq, as recently as October 2008 twelve Christians were killed in attacks in the town of . However, Christian congregations are still functioning in  and, from the general information available, it can be seen that the Iraqi Government has condemned all attacks against this group and that they intervened with police and military following the October attack to ensure their safety. Hence, it is clear that there is no State-sanctioned persecution of Christians and, since the attacks were also condemned by Islamic groups and no one has accepted responsibility for them, it appears that the reported attacks were carried out by individuals rather than by organised groups. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the applicant would be able to seek the protection of the Iraqi authorities if he felt threatened and that the authorities would be willing and in a position to help him. Thus, the Court considers that he would not face a real risk of persecution or ill-treatment on the basis of his religious affiliation.",

He also stated that he had never had any influence himself but only carried out orders from his superiors and that he had deserted from the army when ordered to carry out attacks on the Shi\u2019as in 1992. The Court observes that the applicant has essentially maintained this account, stating that in 1988 he had been promoted to officer and thereafter he had been working with logistics. Furthermore, the applicant has at no point claimed that he is sought or wanted by the Iraqi authorities for any crime, indeed, he has consistently held that he left the country when ordered to carry out acts against international law. On the basis of this information, and noting that some former Republican Guards have been integrated into the new Iraqi army, the Court finds nothing to indicate that the applicant would risk being charged with any type of crime before the Iraqi courts, let alone the IHT/SICT, for having served in the Republican Guard.

In his submissions before the Government in 2005, the applicant alleged that he had held a prominent position within the Ba\u2019ath Party and that he was well-known and hated by many. Further, in his submission of 13 September 2006 to the Court, he specified that he had been an \u201cadvanced sympathiser\u201d which meant that he had held a high position in the hierarchy. Here, the Court observes that there is relatively little information about the structure of the Ba\u2019ath Party (see above \u00a7 57) but that it would appear that, on the one hand, an \u201cadvanced sympathiser\u201d was not a full member of the party and rather low in the hierarchy whereas, on the other hand, a holder of a \u201cFriends of Saddam\u201d card was a person who had been a Party member for at least ten years. Thus, the Court finds that, on the basis of the information and evidence presented to it, it is not possible to establish whether or not the applicant was a full member of the Ba\u2019ath Party or, if he was, what exact level he had attained within it. However, having regard to the fact that the applicant has consistently held that he has never met Saddam Hussein or been involved in any political activities, as well as his statement that most officers within the Republican Guard and some officers in the regular army received this special card, the Court considers it highly unlikely that he belonged to any of the higher levels of the Ba\u2019ath Party. In any event, the Court observes that the Accountability and Justice Act has opened the door for most former Ba\u2019ath Party members to apply for reinstatement into civil service positions. Moreover, the Act has introduced an element of personal responsibility thereby removing the idea of a \u201ccollective guilt\u201d of all Ba\u2019ath Party members. The Court further observes that the Iraqi parliament adopted an Amnesty Law in February 2008 (see above \u00a7 61) which has resulted in the release, so far, of over 120,000 detainees in . Having regard to the aforementioned and to the above finding of the Court that the applicant did not risk being charged with any type of crime before the Iraqi courts, the Court considers that the applicant does not face a real risk of being persecuted, and even less of being sentenced to death, for having been a member of the Ba\u2019ath Party.",

However, the Mahdi Army has, more than one year ago, introduced a cease-fire which is now in force for an indefinite period of time and, as a consequence, the sectarian violence has decreased significantly.",

In any event, the Court observes that the applicant has maintained all along, including before the Court, that from 1988 until he left Iraq, he had been working in a transport division with logistics and that he had deserted from the army because he did not want to take part in the attacks against the Shi\u2019as in Al Ahwar. To the Court, this rather indicates that the applicant did not personally carry out any violent or criminal acts against the Shi\u2019a population for which they would seek revenge. The mere fact of him having been in the Republican Guard is not sufficient to establish that he would face a real risk of being persecuted or attacked by Shi\u2019a militia groups. This is in particular so having regard to the Mahdi Army\u2019s cease-fire and the facts that it is more than 15 years since the applicant left  and that he did not hold a prominent position within the Republican Guard or the Ba\u2019ath Party.",

The applicant had no reason to furnish details of such reports in his initial asylum interviews in 1993 because his fear, at that time, had nothing to do with the activities of Shi\u2019a militia groups. It was grounded, instead, upon the likely consequences he would face, having deserted Hussein\u2019s regime.
