It is further uncontested that a number of persons were detained in the village during this operation, although it appears that no custody records have been produced in respect of Shakhid Baysayev or any other detained persons. As the prosecutors' orders cited above attest, the domestic investigation focused on this version of events and on several occasions attempted to identify the servicemen and the units involved. The Government did not suggest that the persons who detained Baysayev belonged to the illegal paramilitaries, and there is no material available to the Court which could support such a conclusion.

A number of international reports point to the same conclusion (see paragraph 46 above). The Court agrees with the applicant that, in the context of the conflict in , when a person is detained by unidentified servicemen without any subsequent acknowledgement of detention, this can be regarded as life-threatening. The absence of Shakhid Baysayev or any news from him for over six years supports this assumption. Moreover, the stance of the prosecutor's office and the other law-enforcement authorities after the news of his detention had been communicated to them by the applicant significantly contributed to the likelihood of his disappearance, as no necessary actions were taken in the crucial first days or weeks after his detention. Their behaviour in the face of the applicant's well-established complaints gives a strong presumption of at least acquiescence in the situation and raises strong doubts as to the objectivity of the investigation.",

She argued that a number of important steps, such as providing a transcript of the videotape, had been taken with an unjustified delay or only after communication of the complaint to the respondent Government, and in a manner which had undermined their effectiveness. The applicant observed that she had been granted victim status four times, whereas no other member of Shakhid\u00a0Baysayev's family had been granted such status despite their requests. A number of important investigative actions had never been taken, most notably the identification and questioning of the persons who appeared in the videotape, the servicemen who had manned checkpoint no. 53 or those who had conducted the sweeping operation on 2 March 2000. The investigation had failed to consider the evidence indicating that Baysayev's detention and killing had been carried out by federal servicemen. The applicant pointed to the fact that over six years had passed without the investigation producing any known results and to the fact that it had been adjourned and reopened on numerous occasions. The supervising prosecutors had criticised its conduct and given instructions which were not complied with; this, in the applicant's view, supported her allegation of its ineffectiveness. The authorities had systematically failed to inform the applicant of the progress of the proceedings and she had been given no information about important procedural steps. Finally, the applicant contended that the Government's failure to submit a substantial part of the investigation file without a proper explanation strengthened the suspicion that the investigation had been ineffective.",

It was available to the authorities as far back as 2000. The Court finds it astonishing that in February 2006 the persons depicted in it had still not been identified by the investigation, let alone questioned (see the prosecutors' orders in paragraphs 88-94 above). It appears that in June 2005 the investigation collected photographs of the servicemen of the OMON units from the Moscow Region, but no information has been provided to the Court about a follow-up to this action. It does not appear that the investigation identified and questioned the servicemen of the military units who manned roadblock no.\u00a053 or those who carried out the \u201csweeping\u201d operation in Podgornoye.

For more than six years she has not had any news of him. During this period the applicant has applied to various official bodies with inquiries about her husband, both in writing and in person. Despite her attempts, the applicant has never received any plausible explanation or information as to what became of her husband following his detention on 2\u00a0March 2000. The responses received by the applicant mostly denied the State's responsibility for her husband's apprehension or simply informed her that an investigation was ongoing.
