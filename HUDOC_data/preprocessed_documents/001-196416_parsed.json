She insisted that she had never neglected or avoided her parental obligations, and that, contrary to the findings of the domestic courts which had determined that she was responsible for not maintaining contact with her children, the lack of contact had been the result of her being continually and arbitrarily denied access to her children, rather than her avoiding her parental obligations.

As regards their best interests, the applicant relied on the findings of psychological reports in respect of the children carried out in the context of the proceedings in 2010 and 2012 (see paragraphs 20 and 36-37 above), which clearly showed that the children needed their mother\u2019s love and care, that the rupture of the natural ties between them and the applicant could provoke detrimental effects that would negatively influence their life, and that the applicant should have unimpeded access to them. Thus, depriving her of her parental authority had clearly not been in the children\u2019s best interests.",

She stressed that ever since she had been forcibly separated from her children by her late husband\u2019s relatives, she had consistently sought access to the children and their return. In all three sets of court proceedings, as well as in two sets of enforcement proceedings, she had consistently informed the authorities of the conflict between her and her late husband\u2019s relatives, their hostile attitude towards her, and the fact that they had set the children against her and completely excluded her from their life by obstructing all contact, including telephone calls. Despite all her efforts, the authorities had remained totally idle and had failed to take any measures with a view to facilitating contact between her and the children. In particular, neither the judgment of 10\u00a0August 2010 nor that of 31 January 2012 had ever been enforced, despite the applicant\u2019s numerous requests to that end. Moreover, in the third set of proceedings that had taken place in 2013, in which she had been deprived of her parental authority, the domestic courts had held her responsible for the lack of contact between her and the children. She argued that that finding had not been based on an adequate assessment of the facts, and that the domestic courts had not struck a fair balance.",

In that regard, she relied on the case of N.Ts. and Others v.\u00a0Georgia (no. 71776/12, 2 February 2016). Moreover, two of her daughters \u2013 T. and El., aged thirteen and eleven at the relevant time \u2013 had not been heard, in breach of Article 57 of the Russian Family Code, which provided that the opinion of a child over ten years old should be taken into account (see paragraph 69 above). She also submitted that relevant psychological or psychiatric examinations by independent experts should have been carried out in respect of all six children.

Secondly, Article 57 referred to situations where the consent of a child who had reached the age of ten was compulsory for actions taken in respect of him or her; depriving a child\u2019s parent of his or her parental authority was not one of those situations, and therefore, in the Government\u2019s view, a child\u2019s opinion on such a matter had not been necessary.

Russia, no. 56987/15, \u00a7 68, 2 October 2018). There is currently a broad consensus \u2013 including in international law \u2013 in support of the idea that in all decisions concerning children, their best interests must be paramount (see Neulinger and Shuruk [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7 135, 6 July 2010, and X\u00a0v.\u00a0Latvia [GC], no. 27853/09, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2013). A child\u2019s interests dictate that the child\u2019s ties with his or her family must be maintained, except in cases where the family has proved to be particularly unfit and this may harm the child\u2019s health and development (see, for instance, K.B. and Others v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a036216/13, \u00a7 143, 14 March 2017). Severing such ties means cutting a child off from his roots, which may only be done in very exceptional circumstances (see G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc v. Germany, no.\u00a074969/01, \u00a7 48, 26 February 2004); everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, if and when appropriate, to \u201crebuild\u201d the family (see Kacper Nowakowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a032407/13, \u00a7 75, 10 January 2017). In that context, the Court has emphasised, in particular, the State\u2019s obligation to adopt measures to preserve the mother-child bond as far as possible (see S.H. v.

Such further limitations entail the danger that family relations between parents and a child are effectively curtailed (see Kutzner v. Germany, no.\u00a046544/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2002I, and Haase v.

However, that judgment was never enforced, in spite of the applicant\u2019s numerous requests to that end, as the bailiff in charge repeatedly refused to commence the enforcement procedure (see paragraphs 23-29 above).

In the Court\u2019s view, the domestic courts\u2019 position can hardly be found to be reconcilable with the core values of modern democratic societies. It further notes with satisfaction that, in the second set of proceedings following the reopening of the proceedings, the domestic courts dismissed the above-mentioned allegations as not pertaining to the grounds for depriving a parent of his or her parental authority as established in the relevant domestic law (see paragraph 42 above).",

At the same time, with reference to the fact that by that time the applicant\u2019s children had been living with their paternal relatives for two years, the courts ordered that they should remain living at E.B.\u2019s address, appointed him their legal guardian, and determined contact arrangements between the children and the applicant (see paragraph 44-45 above). The Court notes with concern that this situation \u2013 where the courts overturned their initial findings made in the judgment of 10 August 2010, as upheld on appeal on 14 September 2010, that the children should live with their mother (the applicant), and ordered that they should remain living with their paternal relatives \u2013 was in fact prompted by the authorities\u2019 inaction in the enforcement proceedings in respect of that judgment.",

Poland, no. 21823/12, \u00a7 80, 6 October 2015). The Court has consistently held that Article 8 of the Convention includes both the right for a parent to have measures taken with a view to his or her being reunited with the child, and an obligation for national authorities to take measures to facilitate that reunion (see, among other authorities, Y.U. v.\u00a0Russia, no. 41354/10, \u00a7 93, 13 November 2012, and Haddad v. Spain, no. 16572/17, \u00a7 64, 18 June 2019). Furthermore, that positive obligation will begin to weigh on the competent authorities with progressively increasing force as from the period of separation of a child from a parent, and the adequacy of a measure is thus to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between a child and the parent who does not live with him or her (see Strand Lobben and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0208).",

During that period the bailiff in charge did no more than obtain a \u201cwritten declaration\u201d from E.B. confirming that the latter would not obstruct the applicant\u2019s contact with her children, and inform him of the risk that he might be found administratively liable (see paragraph 51 above).

The applicant also sought the competent authorities\u2019 protection and assistance in that connection; in particular, on numerous occasions she attempted to have the judgments in her favour enforced (see paragraphs 12, 16, 18, 25, 28-29, 39, 47-48, 52-53 and 59 above). As the facts of the case reveal, her efforts proved futile, and her applications were mostly left unanswered, or rejected under various pretexts (see paragraphs 12, 26-29 and 54 above). Whilst fully aware of the applicant\u2019s situation, the authorities remained passive and took no tangible steps to ensure and facilitate her reunion with her children (compare Haddad, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072). It is also noteworthy that, in the absence of any meaningful action on the part of the authorities, the applicant herself attempted to approach her two elder daughters who had moved to Grozny to pursue their college studies; however, that attempt failed, in view of the girls\u2019 extremely negative attitude towards their mother (see paragraph\u00a059 above).",

Not only did the authorities remain idle for years when faced with her situation, but in reaching that conclusion, the domestic courts chose to shift responsibility for that flagrant inaction onto the applicant. It is particularly worrying that the domestic courts relied on that finding as a reason to justify depriving the applicant of her parental authority. As concerns the courts\u2019 other conclusion \u2013 that the applicant had not supported her children financially \u2013 it is unclear whether it was based on any evidence other than E.B.\u2019s allegation in that regard. Even assuming that that finding was accurate, the Court is not convinced that the applicant should have been held solely responsible for that fact, nor could it be regarded as sufficient grounds for depriving her of her parental authority. In particular, given the long-standing conflict between the applicant and her late husband\u2019s relatives, it was not convincingly demonstrated in the domestic proceedings that she had had a realistic opportunity to provide financial support, communicate with her late husband\u2019s relatives, and ensure that such support would reach her children. In fact, the courts merely briefly referred to the applicant\u2019s failure to support her children financially, without elaborating on that conclusion any further.",

The unreasonableness of those court findings is so striking and palpable on the face of it that they can only be regarded as grossly arbitrary. By relying on those findings as grounds for depriving the applicant of her parental authority, the courts arbitrarily applied the relevant provisions of national law. In this connection, the Court notes the ruling of 27 May 1998, where the Supreme Court of Russia stated that only in the event of proven guilty conduct might parents be deprived of their parental authority on the grounds established in Article 69 of the Russian Family Code; that parents who failed to fulfil their parental obligations for reasons beyond their control should not be deprived of their parental authority; and that even where a parent\u2019s guilty conduct was established, deprivation of parental authority should not be automatic (see paragraph 75 above).",

However, in the proceedings under examination, no expert opinion was ever sought on such important questions as the degree of the children\u2019s attachment to their mother, the effect which the severance of all bonds with her might have on them, her parenting abilities, and so on (compare Strand Lobben and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0222-23). No reasons were advanced to explain why such a drastic measure as depriving the children\u2019s mother, their only surviving parent, of her parental authority would be in their interests, nor whether any weighty considerations relating to their health and development could justify that measure. Moreover, no attempts were made to explore the effectiveness of less far-reaching alternatives before the court sought to sever the ties between the applicant and her children by depriving her of her parental authority.",

However, in the proceedings under examination, the court remained silent on this point, simply ignoring the applicant\u2019s arguments that that she had had no contact with her children at all, that her late husband\u2019s relatives had set the children against her, and that her two elder daughters had refused to talk to her when she had attempted to approach them (see paragraph 59 above).",

At the same time, those views are not necessarily immutable, and their objections, which must be given due weight, are not necessarily sufficient to override the parents\u2019 interests, especially in having regular contact with their child. The right of a child to express his or her own views should not be interpreted as effectively giving an unconditional veto power to children without any other factors being considered and an examination being carried out to determine their best interests. What is more, if a court based a decision on the views of children who were palpably unable to form and articulate an opinion as to their wishes \u2013 for example, because of a conflict of loyalty and/or their exposure to the alienating behaviour of one parent \u2013 such a decision could run contrary to Article 8 of the Convention (see K.B. and Others v.
