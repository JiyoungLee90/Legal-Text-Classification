Normally, the priority under Article 41 of the Convention is restitutio in integrum, as the respondent State is expected to make all feasible reparation for the consequences of the violation in such a manner as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach (see, among other authorities, Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 85, \u00a7\u00a012). In case of a quashing of a final judgment recognising the applicant\u2019s title to a property, the return of the property in question would put the applicant as far as possible in the situation equivalent to the one in which he would have been if there had not been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01. However, as an alternative, payment of the current value of the property as compensation for pecuniary damage is also possible (see Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23, ECHR 2001I).",

Moreover, the applicant himself did not claim such restitution (see, by contrast, Brum\u0103rescu [GC], cited above, \u00a7 10) but rather payment of the market value of the property, to which the Government did not object, and which, according to him, amounted to EUR 30,510. The Court therefore considers it possible to award the applicant in the present case compensation for the pecuniary damage sustained. However, as rightly pointed out by the Government, the applicant owned only half of the property in question, while the second half belonged to his mother who was not an applicant in the present case. Only half of the amount claimed for pecuniary damage must therefore be granted. The Government did not contest the valuation submitted by the applicant and the Court has no reasons to doubt its accuracy. It therefore decides to award the applicant EUR 15,255 in respect of pecuniary damage. The Court further decides to award the applicant EUR\u00a03,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",
