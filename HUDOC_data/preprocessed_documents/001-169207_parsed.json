It has found, in particular, that the prison authorities would not have a sufficiently independent standpoint \u2012 as required by Article 35 of the Convention \u2012 when deciding on a complaint concerning breaches of domestic regulations governing the provision of medical care to detainees (see Koryak, cited above, \u00a7 79, and Dirdizov, cited above, \u00a7 75). The Court has also pointed out that a complaint to the supervising prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy because of the procedural shortcomings that have been previously identified in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Koryak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81). As to a civil claim for compensation, the Court has held that such a claim could offer an applicant no redress greater than a purely compensatory award and could not put an end to a situation where there is an ongoing violation, such as inadequate medical care (see Reshetnyak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-73). Lastly, the Court has found that such a remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, in particular because the award was conditional on the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities, which was extremely improbable in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed the application of a certain measure, for instance certain conditions of detention or a certain level of medical treatment (see A.B. v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a096, 14 October 2010).",

Accordingly, the respondent State had an obligation to ensure the availability of an effective remedy to deal with the substance of his complaint. Taking into account the circumstances of the present case and the aforementioned case-law, the Court sees no reason to depart from its previous findings on the issue. It concludes that the legal avenues put forward by the Government did not constitute an effective remedy capable of preventing the alleged violations or their continuation and providing the applicant with adequate and sufficient redress for his complaint under Article 3 of the Convention.",
