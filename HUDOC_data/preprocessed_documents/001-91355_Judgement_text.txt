The case originated in two applications (nos. 38940/02 and 5197/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Mahmut Aslan and Mr Hüseyin Demir (“the applicants”), on 13 July 2000 and 12 November 2002 respectively.
The applicants were represented by Mr E. Talay and Mr M. Taş respectively, lawyers practising in Diyarbakır and Elazığ. The first applicant was granted legal aid. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 1 June 2006 and 20 November 2007 respectively, the Court declared the applications partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the lack of legal assistance to the applicants during their police custody. It also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).

During their custody period, they were interrogated by the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge respectively, in the absence of a lawyer.
