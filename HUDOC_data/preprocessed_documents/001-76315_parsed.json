In 1964, as a result of this judgment, the State bought the unlawfully requisitioned land and exchanged it with 100,000 sq. m of land owned by the National Defence Fund in the nearby area of Korakovouni. The area was public woodland outside the boundaries of the urban development plan. According to the applicants, the understanding was that the association would be allowed to develop it after the State had issued the appropriate changes to the local planning regulations. The first applicant paid one drachma per sq. m to cover the difference in value between the old and the new land. The relevant decision approving the contract of sale and exchange was retroactively validated by virtue of the Necessity Act (Law no.\u00a062/1967). The Government asserted that the above price was symbolic and that at the relevant time the market value of the land was 15 drachmas per sq. m.

Coming to the current situation, they stressed that Presidential Decree of 15 April 1988, and the interpretation of Articles 24 \u00a7 1 and 117 \u00a7 4 of the 1975 Constitution as set out in the 1403/1990 judgment and in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Administrative Court, made clear that it was no longer possible to build on their land. Such interference was even more odious in view of the aims of the association which was the provision of appropriate housing for its members, an aim that had now come to nought, despite the great amounts of money and time invested in it by the association and its members. The applicants claimed that according to the provisions of Law no. 998/1979 they were entitled to compensation for the deprivation of their right to use their property for the purposes for which they had bought it. Thus, by refusing to exchange their land for new land of equal value, or to expropriate it, the State had violated Articles 17 of the 1975 Constitution and 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",
