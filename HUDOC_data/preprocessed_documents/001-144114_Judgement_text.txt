The case originated in an application (no. 37394/11) against the Republic of Finland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Finnish national, Mr Kaj-Erik Torsten Glantz (“the applicant”), on 13 June 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr Pekka Pinomaa, a lawyer practising in Helsinki. The Finnish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
The applicant complained under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention about double jeopardy (ne bis in idem) involving taxation proceedings, in which a tax surcharge had been imposed, and criminal proceedings for aggravated tax fraud.
On 26 June 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Klaukkala.
The tax inspector conducted a tax inspection of the applicant’s attorney’s office in 2006.
On 18 and 19 December 2006 the tax authorities considered that the applicant had received disguised dividends from his company during the tax years 2000 to 2004. The amounts of the disguised dividends were the following: 107,152 euros (EUR), EUR 1,673, EUR 48,711, EUR 32,759, and EUR 18,842. Additional taxes and tax surcharges (veronkorotus, skatteförhöjning) were imposed in the amount of EUR 5,300, EUR 84.09, EUR 2,400, EUR 1,600 and EUR 900 respectively.
By letter dated 9 March 2007 the applicant sought rectification from the local Tax Rectification Committee (verotuksen oikaisulautakunta, prövningsnämnden i beskattningsärenden).
On 30 May 2007 the Tax Rectification Committee rejected the applicant’s requests. It found that the applicant had given incomplete information to taxation authorities and tax had therefore been incompletely or partially levied. Therefore the additional tax and the tax surcharges imposed on him were not considered to be too high.
By letter dated 11 June 2007 the applicant appealed to the Helsinki Administrative Court (hallinto-oikeus, förvaltningsdomstolen).
On 22 December 2008 the Helsinki Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s appeal on the same grounds as the Tax Rectification Committee.
By letter dated 27 February 2009 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen).
On 11 January 2010 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.
On 15 December 2008 the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant on, inter alia, five counts of embezzlement and two counts of aggravated tax fraud (törkeä veropetos, grovt skattebedrägeri) concerning the tax years 1997 to 2003. According to the charges, the applicant was accused of aggravated tax fraud as, in his personal capacity, he had underdeclared his income. The undeclared income amounted in total to EUR 500,895 and, consequently, the tax imposed had been EUR 263,711.68 too low.
On 6 November 2009 the Helsinki District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) convicted the applicant, inter alia, on four counts of embezzlement and two counts of aggravated tax fraud and sentenced him to a prison sentence of 2 years and 8 months. He was also ordered to pay the taxation authority EUR 214,168.38 plus interest.
By letter dated 25 January 2010 the applicant appealed to the Helsinki Appeal Court (hovioikeus, hovrätten), requesting that the charges be dismissed. He claimed, inter alia, that one of the embezzlement charges was statute-barred.
On 23 December 2010 the Helsinki Appeal Court, after having held an oral hearing on 28 and 29 October 2010, convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 2 years and 8 months in prison. It upheld the District Court’s judgment in respect of the compensation award. The court found that one of the embezzlement charges was not statutebarred. As concerned the aggravated tax fraud in the applicant’s personal taxation, the court noted that tax surcharges had been imposed on the applicant and that the taxation proceedings had become final on 11 January 2010. As the charges had been brought on 20 August 2009, that was, before the taxation proceedings had become final, there were no obstacles to examining the charge concerning aggravated tax fraud.
By letter dated 21 February 2011 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen), requesting that the charges be dismissed. He claimed that there had been a lack of a fair trial and a violation of the legality principle in respect of the embezzlement charges as he had been convicted of something other than the charges against him and the conviction had been based on a wrong Penal Code provision. Also one of the changes had been statute-barred. As concerned the tax fraud charges, he claimed that the ne bis in idem principle had been violated when he was convicted of aggravated tax fraud in respect of his personal taxation. That principle and the legality principle had also been violated when he was convicted of aggravated tax fraud and bookkeeping crime as a representative of the company as the undeclared income was the same as in his personal taxation. He also claimed that there had been a lack of a fair trial before the Appeal Court as he was not allowed to obtain detailed information about the charges and to put questions to one of the witnesses.
On 18 May 2011 the Supreme Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.
By letter dated 6 June 2011 the applicant lodged an application for an extraordinary appeal with the Supreme Court, requesting, inter alia, that the execution of the prison sentence be stayed. He repeated this request on 10 July 2011, and on 24 and 29 August 2011.
On 15 June, and 17, 25 and 30 August 2011 the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay of execution.
On 31 August 2011 the applicant started serving his sentence.
On 12 December 2011 the Supreme Court refused the applicant’s request for the reopening of the case.
By letter dated 16 December 2011 the applicant lodged a new extraordinary appeal with the Supreme Court concerning its decision of 12 December 2011. He referred, inter alia, to Article 6 of the Convention and the lack of a fair trial.
It is not known whether the case is still pending before the Supreme Court.
By letters dated 24 and 29 August 2011 and 7 February 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Chancellor of Justice (oikeuskansleri, justitiekanslern), asking him to examine whether the Supreme Court justices had acted in accordance with the law and their duties when rendering the decision of 12 December 2011.
On 20 March 2012 the Chancellor of Justice informed the applicant that he was not going to investigate the matter as it was still pending before the Supreme Court. However, he indicated that the general interpretation was that the duty to give reasons did not apply to decisions concerning leave to appeal or extraordinary remedies.
By letter dated 14 May 2012 the applicant asked the Chancellor of Justice to re-examine the matter and to take action in order to have the Supreme Court decision of 12 December 2011 re-opened.
It is not known whether the case is still pending before the Chancellor of Justice.
Section 57, subsection 1, of the Tax Assessment Procedure Act (laki verotusmenettelystä, lagen om beskattningsförfarande, Act no. 1558/1995, as amended by Act no. 1079/2005) provides that if a person has failed to make the required tax returns or has given incomplete, misleading or false information to taxation authorities and tax has therefore been incompletely or partially levied, the taxpayer shall be ordered to pay unpaid taxes together with an additional tax and a tax surcharge.
According to Chapter 29, sections 1 and 2, of the Penal Code (rikoslaki, strafflagen; as amended by Acts no. 1228/1997 and no. 769/1990), a person who (1) gives a taxation authority false information on a fact that influences the assessment of tax, (2) files a tax return concealing a fact that influences the assessment of tax, (3) for the purpose of avoiding tax, fails to observe a duty pertaining to taxation, influencing the assessment of tax, or (4) acts otherwise fraudulently and thereby causes or attempts to cause a tax not to be assessed, or too low a tax to be assessed or a tax to be unduly refunded, shall be sentenced for tax fraud to a fine or to imprisonment for a period of up to two years.
If by the tax fraud (1) considerable financial benefit is sought or (2) the offence is committed in a particularly methodical manner and the tax fraud is aggravated when assessed as a whole, the offender shall be sentenced for aggravated tax fraud to imprisonment for a period between four months and four years.
The Supreme Court has taken a stand on the ne bis in idem principle in its case KKO 2010:46 which concerned tax surcharges and aggravated tax fraud. In that case it found, inter alia, that even though a final judgment in a taxation case, in which tax surcharges had been imposed, prevented criminal charges being brought about the same matter, such preventive effect could not be accorded to pending cases (lis pendens) crossing from administrative proceedings to criminal proceedings or vice versa.
On 20 September 2012 the Supreme Court issued another judgment (KKO:2012:79) concerning ne bis in idem. It stated that in some cases a tax surcharge decision could be considered final even before the time-limit for ordinary appeal against the decision had expired. However, it was required that an objective assessment of such a case permitted the conclusion that the taxpayer, by his or her own conduct, had intended to settle the tax surcharge matter with final effect. The assessment had to concern the situation as a whole, and it could give significance to such questions as to how logically the taxpayer had acted in order to settle the taxes and tax surcharges, to what extent he or she had paid taxes and tax surcharges, and at which stage of the criminal proceedings the payments had been made. In the case at issue taxes and tax surcharges had been imposed on A on account of action related to disguised dividends, by decisions of 2 March 2009 for tax years 2005 and 2006, and 7 September 2009 for tax year 2007. In the charge, which became pending on 28 June 2011, the prosecutor demanded that A be sentenced to punishment for aggravated tax fraud on account of the same action. A had paid the taxes and tax surcharges entirely before the charge became pending. The time-limit for seeking rectification in respect of the tax year 2005 had expired on 31 December 2011 without A having sought rectification. A declared that he had no intention of appealing against the decisions concerning the other tax years, either. The Supreme Court held that the charge of aggravated fraud was inadmissible as A had paid the taxes and tax surcharges before the charge became pending.
In its newest case-law (KKO:2013:59 of 5 July 2013), the Supreme Court reversed its earlier line of interpretation, finding that charges for tax fraud could no longer be brought if there was already a decision to order or not to order tax surcharges in the same matter. If the taxation authorities had exercised their decision-making powers regarding tax surcharges, a criminal charge could no longer be brought for a tax fraud offence based on the same facts, or if such a charge was already pending, it could no longer be pursued. The court assessed whether the preventive effect of the first set of proceedings had to be attributed to the fact that 1) tax surcharge proceedings were pending, 2) a tax surcharge issue was decided, or 3) to the finality of such a tax surcharge decision, and found the second option the most justifiable.
In December 2012 the Government submitted to Parliament a proposal for an Act on Tax Surcharges and Customs Duty Surcharges Imposed by a Separate Decision and for certain related Acts (HE 191/2012 vp). After the entry into force of the Act, the tax authorities could, when making a tax decision, assess whether to impose a tax surcharge or to report the matter to the police. The tax authorities could decide not to impose a tax surcharge. If they had not reported the matter to the police, a tax surcharge could be imposed by a separate decision by the end of the calendar year following the actual tax decision. If the tax authorities had imposed tax surcharges, they could no longer report the same matter to the police unless, after imposing the tax surcharges, they had received evidence of new or recently revealed facts. If the tax authorities had reported the matter to the police, tax surcharges could, as a rule, no longer be imposed. The purpose of the proposed Act is thus to ensure that a tax or a customs duty matter is processed and possibly punished in only one set of proceedings.
The proposed Act on Tax Surcharges and Customs Duty Surcharges Imposed by a Separate Decision (laki erillisellä päätöksellä määrättävästä veron- tai tullinkorotuksesta, lagen om skatteförhöjning och tullhöjning som påförs genom ett särskilt beslut, Act no. 781/2013) has already been passed by Parliament and it entered into force on 1 December 2013. The Act does not, however, contain any transitional provisions extending its scope retroactively.
