However, it is ready to accept that that demonstration was an immediate response to the death of a disabled war veteran who had set himself on fire as a protest against the bureaucratic injustices that he had allegedly faced. The fact that the funeral was held on 29 December constituted a special circumstance warranting a spontaneous demonstration on that particular date, overriding the obligation to submit a prior notice of an assembly (see, mutatis mutandis, Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, ECHR 2007III). The Court also observes that according to Article 5 \u00a7 IV of the Law on Freedom of Assembly, prior written notification was indeed not required for \u201cspontaneous assemblies\u201d (see paragraph 25 above). In those circumstances the Court has doubts whether the dispersal of the assembly of 29 December 2013 was prescribed by law. However, given that a more conspicuous problem arises with respect to the necessity of the interference, the Court considers that it is not appropriate to limit its examination under Article 11 of the Convention only to the lawfulness of the interference (see Gafgaz Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 57).",

In those circumstances, the Court is ready to accept that the dispersal of the demonstrations on 12\u00a0January, 26\u00a0January and 10 March 2013 was lawful (compare Ibrahimov and Others v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, nos. 69234/11, 69252/11 and 69335/11, \u00a7\u00a7 74-75, 11\u00a0February 2016).",

The facts of that case and the present cases are similar to a significant degree. Consequently, for the same reasons as those outlined in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment, the Court concludes that the authorities in the present cases have not adduced relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstrations (see Gafgaz Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 61). The authorities also failed to acknowledge that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration was by itself protected by Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 63).",

Such a chilling effect deters other opposition supporters and the public at large from attending demonstrations, and, more generally, from participating in open political debate (see Gafgaz Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 67).",

The time and facilities to prepare the defence had been inadequate (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 78-81). In addition, there had been a great reliance by the domestic courts on the administrative offence report prepared by the police and statements given by the police (ibid., \u00a7 85), a complete disregard by the domestic courts of important factual circumstances and legal issues, inter alia, the peaceful nature of the unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7 86), an absence of legal assistance at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 90-91), a failure to provide an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of one\u2019s own choosing (ibid., \u00a7 92), and purely formalistic representation by the State-funded lawyer (ibid., \u00a7 93).
