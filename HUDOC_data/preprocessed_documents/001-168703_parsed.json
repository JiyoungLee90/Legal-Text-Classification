The Act was enacted to cover professional conduct of diplomats, who formed a specific and restricted group. At the time of the impugned events, the Act had been in force for several years. The Court agrees with the Government that the applicants, who were all professional diplomats and who had worked in this field for more than 10 years, could not therefore claim to be ignorant of the content of the said provision. Had they had doubts about the exact scope of the provision in question, they should either have sought advice about its content or refrained from issuing their statement. Moreover, it appears that those ambassadors who had issued the original statement only a day before were consequently dismissed from their posts on the basis of the same provision. Although the fact that they had been dismissed may not have been known to the applicants at the relevant time, they must have held it possible that such interpretation of the provision in question could be foreseeable.

In this regard, the Court considers that measures directed at the need to preserve the political neutrality of a precise category of civil servants can in principle be considered legitimate and proportional for the purposes of Article 10 of the Convention (see Ahmed and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 2 September 1998, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI). However, such a measure should not be applied in a general manner which could affect the essence of the right protected, without having in mind the functions and the role of the civil servant in question, and, in particular, the circumstances of each case (see, mutatis mutandis, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckbalaban and Kutlu v. Turkey, nos. 29764/09 and 36297/09, \u00a7 34, 24 March 2015; and Dedecan and Ok v. Turkey, nos.\u00a022685/09 and\u00a039472/09, \u00a7 38, 22 September 2015).",

Had the applicants adduced some such argument on the basis of sufficiently plausible material, the Court\u2019s scrutiny of compliance with the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10 would undoubtedly have been more demanding. As it is, the applicants\u2019 submissions in this connection were rather directed towards showing that their statement was neutral and not \u201cpolitical\u201d as such (see paragraph 32 of the judgment). It is on that basis that, like our colleagues, we have subscribed to the conclusion in paragraph\u00a059 of the judgment that \u201cno evidence has been adduced that could call into question the respondent State\u2019s assessment\u201d as to the necessity to restrict the applicants\u2019 freedom to engage in \u201cpolitical\u201d activities.",

In such cases, it falls to the Court, having regard to the circumstances of each case, to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the fundamental rights of the individual to freedom of expression and the legitimate interests of a democratic State in ensuring that its civil service properly furthers the purposes enumerated in Article 10 \u00a7 2 (see Vogt v.

Moldova [GC], no. 14277/04, \u00a7 95, ECHR 2008; Fuentes\u00a0Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, \u00a7 48, 29 February 2000, and Kudeshkina v.\u00a0Russia, no. 29492/05, \u00a7 98, 26 February 2009). Armenian legislation provides for a variety of reprimands which can be applied to a diplomat should he or she breach diplomatic ethics, starting with a warning, followed by a reprimand, a severe reprimand, a reduction in salary and finally dismissal.

They were deprived of the opportunity to exercise the profession for which they had a calling, for which they had been trained and in which they had acquired skills and experience (see Vogt v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060). The fact that there were no real effective safeguards available to the applicants added to the severity of the sanction. It seems that there was no possibility for the applicants to appeal before the administrative organs. It will be recalled, in this respect, that the fairness of the proceedings and the procedural guarantees afforded are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 (see, for example, Kudeshkina v.
