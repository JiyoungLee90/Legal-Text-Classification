Indeed, the representatives of the defendant authority were present at the hearing before the Justice of the Peace, and they did not complain about its lack of jurisdiction. Nor did they raise this issue on appeal. This issue was only raised in their supervisory review application lodged after the judgment in the applicants\u2019 favour became final and enforceable (compare Talysheva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 24559/04, \u00a7\u00a026, 22\u00a0December 2009, and Zvezdin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a025448/06, \u00a7\u00a030, 14\u00a0June 2007). The Court agrees that, as a matter of principle, the rules of jurisdiction should be respected. However, in the specific circumstances of the present case the Court does not detect any pressing social need which would justify the departure from the principle of legal certainty (see Sutyazhnik v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a08269/02, \u00a7\u00a038, 23\u00a0July 2009).",
