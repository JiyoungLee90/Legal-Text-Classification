OIN replied in the negative. Subsequently the applicant\u2019s expulsion to  was ordered together with the imposition of a two-year entry ban, as sanction for illegal border crossing. The expulsion order was in essence based on the Readmission Agreement between Hungary and  and the non-applicability of the \u201cnonrefoulement\u201d principle. Simultaneously, the execution of the expulsion was however suspended until the necessary means and conditions were secured, but for not longer than six months. The applicant\u2019s alien policing detention was then ordered for 72 hours on the ground that the police had initiated his deportation and that it was necessary to keep him under the authorities\u2019 supervision, as a measure to secure the intended expulsion, pending the Ukrainian authorities\u2019 reply to the Hungarian return initiative. Section 54(1) (b) of the Third Country Nationals Act (see below) was referred to in the decision as the legal ground for the detention, but without substantiating any relevant factual element.

It pointed out that, in relation to EU Member States, the procedure for detaining an individual must be in accordance with EU law. However, as a part of the EU Asylum Acquis, Article 18 of Directive 2005/85/EC (\u201cthe Procedures Directive\u201d) stipulates that no individual should be held in detention on the sole basis that he is seeking asylum and that all asylum seekers have the right to judicial review of their detention. In addition, Article 7 \u00a7 of Directive 2003/9/EC (\u201cthe Reception Conditions Directive\u201d) recognises the right of asylum seekers to move freely within the territory of the host Member State; they may be confined only when it proves necessary. In the AIRE Centre\u2019s view, these provisions taken together indicate that the detention of asylum seekers is to be avoided and that any detention is subject to an examination of its necessity to achieve its given purpose. Moreover, the AIRE Centre emphasised the relevance of Article 15 \u00a7 4 of Directive 2008/115/EC (\u201cthe Returns Directive\u201d), as it states that a detention will no longer be permitted when there is no \u201creasonable prospect of removal\u201d or the legal or other considerations justifying the detention no longer exist.",

Moreover, Hungarian law only permitted detention with a view to deportation where that deportation could be executed, which was not the case during the asylum proceedings.
