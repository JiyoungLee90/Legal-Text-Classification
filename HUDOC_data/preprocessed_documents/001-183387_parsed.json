The national courts rendered the final decision on the applicant\u2019s legal incapacitation on 22\u00a0December 2004. The applicant submitted her first letter on 21 June 2005 by fax (received by the Court on the same day) and two copies by post (one reached the Court on 27 June 2005, while the second arrived on 19\u00a0July 2005). The date of the first submission, 21 June 2005, falls within the sixmonth period running from the adoption of the final decision of 22\u00a0December 2004. On 8 July 2005 the Court invited the applicant to submit a completed application form within six weeks of receipt of the Court\u2019s letter. On 5 August 2005 the Court received the completed application form signed by the applicant and dated 20 July 2005.

As the Court has previously found (see Shtukaturov, \u00a7 95, and Lashin, \u00a7\u00a092, both cited above), Russian law at the material time did not provide for any intermediate form of restricting legal capacity by contrast to full capacity or full incapacitation. Therefore, the national courts could not take into account the kind and degree of a person\u2019s mental disorder and other relevant particular circumstances owing to the existing legislative framework (see Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7 94). This conclusion is further confirmed by the legislative amendments introducing partial incapacitation as of 1\u00a0March 2015. The Court takes note of those positive developments; however, they did not affect the applicants\u2019 situations during the periods prior to the entry into force of those amendments.",

Thus, the applicants were unable to present their position and the national courts did not have the benefit of direct contact with them before forming an opinion about their situation (see Shtukaturov, \u00a7 91, and Lashin, \u00a7\u00a082, both cited above). The Court observes that since the legislative amendments of 2011, the personal participation of those concerned has become mandatory, save for certain exceptions (see paragraph 38 above).

Moreover, the Court highlights that the notion of \u201clawfulness\u201d in the context of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (e) of the Convention might have a broader meaning than in national legislation. Lawfulness of detention necessarily presumes a \u201cfair and proper procedure\u201d, including the requirement \u201cthat any measure depriving a person of his [or her] liberty should issue from and be executed by an appropriate authority and should not be arbitrary\u201d (see Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7 45). In this context the domestic proceedings must themselves offer the applicant sufficient protection against a potentially arbitrary deprivation of his or her liberty (see Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0113).",

However, the Court was not provided with any medical documents which would demonstrate that the authorities had ever examined whether her disorder was \u201cof a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement\u201d. In fact, the Government did not provide any medical documents for the period of confinement lasting more than a year after the applicant\u2019s admission to hospital on 7\u00a0March 2008. The first medical expert opinion available to the Court was issued only on 10\u00a0March 2009. Furthermore, even that medical expert report did not explain which factors justified the applicant\u2019s continued involuntary confinement. The Primorskiy District Court then authorised the applicant\u2019s compulsory treatment on the basis of that expert report. It did not examine any other relevant factors to demonstrate that the applicant\u2019s mental disorder was of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement (see Vershinin v.\u00a0Russia, [Committee], no. 42858/06, \u00a7 26, 20\u00a0September 2016).",

First, as the national authorities considered the applicant\u2019s treatment as voluntary, no court was involved in its initial authorisation. Furthermore, at the relevant time Russian law did not provide for an automatic judicial review of confinement in a psychiatric hospital in situations similar to the applicant\u2019s (see Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7 126). Lastly, having been declared legally incapable, the applicant herself was unable to apply for a judicial review of her compulsory confinement (ibid). The Court notes the positive developments in the Russian law and practice since that time (see paragraph 37 above); however, the applicant was placed in the hospital before those positive changes occurred.",
