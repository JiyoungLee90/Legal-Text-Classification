This was for the following reasons. First, on 24 September 2010, the applicant filed an application for a provisional order, which was pending until the applicant withdrew the application on 16\u00a0December 2010. Until that date, it would not have been proper to deport him. Second, the applicant had only surrendered his passport to the authorities on that date. Third, deportation could not have been carried out while proceedings before the Ombudsman were pending (they concluded on 27 October 2010: see paragraph 12 above). Fourth, during his detention the applicant had been receiving medical care. He was hospitalised from 22\u00a0September 2010 to 21 October 2010, while recovering from his accident. On 3\u00a0November 3010 he was transferred to the hospital so his cast could be removed. From 22 November 2010 to 25 November 2010 he was again hospitalised. On 2 December 2010 the applicant was transferred to the hospital for a medical examination. He was also hospitalised from 19\u00a0January 2011 to 29 January 2011 having surgery and then staying in hospital until he recovered. The applicant was deported as soon as he was released from the hospital on 29 January 2011.",
