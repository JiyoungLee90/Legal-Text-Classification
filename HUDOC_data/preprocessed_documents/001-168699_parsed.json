In both that case and the present application, evidence obtained in breach of the applicants\u2019 procedural rights had been excluded from their criminal case files and the breaches of their right to defence had been acknowledged by the domestic judicial authorities in separate rulings. In the present case, the applicant\u2019s conviction had been based on ample evidence that had been obtained and examined with due respect for his procedural rights. The applicant himself had been present at the trial, at which he had also been represented by legal counsel of his own choice and had had every opportunity to state his case, to question witnesses and to challenge documentary evidence. His complaints of a purported breach of his rights had also been examined by courts of appeal and cassation, which had found them to be without merit. Lastly, it was also important that the investigative officers involved in the applicant\u2019s case had received a preventive warning and that it also remained open to the applicant to institute civil proceedings to claim compensation from the police for the breach of his right to defence.",

Therefore, the statements he had made during that questioning had greatly affected the course of the entire investigation and had influenced the manner in which other evidence had been taken and interpreted by the investigative and judicial authorities. More so, the record of the applicant\u2019s questioning of 6\u00a0June 2001 had, in fact, not been excluded from the case file and had materially affected the ultimate findings of the domestic courts concerning his guilt. In particular, in its judgment of 13 August 2003, the District Court had expressly relied on the statements given by the applicant to the police on 6\u00a0June 2001. More specifically, in the text of its judgment, it referred to the applicant\u2019s \u201cdeclarations ... dated June\u00a02001\u201d.

As a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 55, 27 November 2008 and Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08, 50571/08, 50573/08 and 40351/09, \u00a7\u00a7 257, 262 and 265, 13 September 2016). As the Court has recently clarified, the Salduz test, assessing whether a restriction on access to a lawyer is compatible with the right to a fair trial, comprises two stages. In the first stage, the Court must assess whether there were compelling reasons for the restriction. In the second stage, it must evaluate the prejudice caused to the rights of the defence by the restriction in the case in question. In other words, the Court must examine the impact of the restriction on the overall fairness of the proceedings and decide whether the proceedings as a whole were fair (see Ibrahim and Others cited above, \u00a7 257).",

It is of relevance, when assessing whether compelling reasons have been demonstrated, whether the decision to restrict legal advice had a basis in domestic law and whether the scope and content of any restrictions on legal advice were sufficiently circumscribed by law so as to guide operational decision-making by those responsible for applying them (ibid., \u00a7 258).",

The applicant claims that the trial court relied on this testimony by referring to \u201cthe declarations by the head of the farming company Loboda G.I. contained on pages 65 and 67 of volume 1 of the case, dated June 2001\u201d. The Court does not find this claim to be established on the facts. In the first place, the applicant failed to submit pages 65 and 67 of the domestic case file. The Court also observes that, as follows from the minutes of the District Court\u2019s hearings, page\u00a065 of the domestic criminal case file contained a \u201cletter from the farming company\u201d (see paragraph 15 above). It further notes that, as appears from the copy of the record of the questioning of 6 June 2001 submitted to the Court, this document was given page numbers 82-83 in the domestic criminal case file and not 65 and 67. In light of these circumstances and in particular in the absence of any evidence from the applicant that pages 65 and 67 of his criminal case file contained indeed any material related to his questioning of 6 June 2001, the Court cannot conclude that the disputed phrase in the District Court\u2019s judgment referred to the applicant\u2019s statements given to the police during the questioning at issue. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicant failed to substantiate his claim that the disputed testimony was in fact used in the assessment of facts by the trial court.",

The Court notes in that respect that, according to the case file, the applicant had been informed by the police about the subject matter of their inquiry into the disappearance of the slabs already in March 2001 (see paragraph 7 above). He must have had ample opportunities to consult a lawyer by June 2001 and there is no basis to conclude that the questioning of 6 June 2001 had caught him by surprise. The applicant then, had yet another opportunity to make a statement in the course of the investigation, in the presence of his lawyer, but he deliberately decided not to make use of that opportunity (see paragraph\u00a011 above). As to the fact that the record of the testimony of 6\u00a0June 2001 has in fact remained, rather than being taken out of the case file, the Court notes that this violation of the applicant\u2019s defence rights was indeed recognized by the trial court, and that the trial court explicitly alerted the investigation authorities as to this failure to observe the applicant\u2019s defence rights (see paragraph\u00a017 above).",

The Court sees no evidence that this testimony played a role in the domestic courts\u2019 assessment of the relevant facts and the finding of guilt. It notes that the domestic courts substantiated the applicant\u2019s conviction by ample array of witness, documentary and other evidence. There is no basis to conclude that the applicant, who took part at the trial personally and was also represented by a legal counsel of his choice, was in any way restricted in adopting a defence strategy at variance with his testimony, which indeed he did. Neither was he restricted in his rights to state his case, question witnesses or challenge documentary evidence during the proceedings. He also had his appeals examined by the higher courts at two instances, which found them to be ill-founded.",
