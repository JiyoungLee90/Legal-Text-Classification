The Court therefore considers that the authorities were thereby made sufficiently aware of the applicant\u2019s situation. It is true that he did not lodge separate complaints with the courts or prosecutor\u2019s offices as suggested by the Government. However the Government did not demonstrate what redress could have been afforded to the applicant by such a measure, taking into account that the problems arising from the conditions of his detention were apparently of a structural nature and did not only concern his personal situation (see Kalashnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 47095/99, 18\u00a0September 2001, Mamedova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7\u00a057, 1 June 2006 and Benediktov v. , no. 106/02, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30, 10\u00a0May 2007).

In the instant case, during the period of his detention the applicant was held in two detention facilities and was transferred to other facilities several times. Therefore, with respect to the Government objection that the application in respect of detention conditions in the Kingisepp police department had been submitted too late, the question to be resolved is whether the whole period of the applicant\u2019s detention constitutes a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d, and thus meets the six-month criterion.",

Complaints which have as their source specific events which occurred on identifiable dates cannot be construed as referring to a continuing situation (see Camberrow MM5 AD v. , (dec.), no. 50357/99, 1 April 2004). Hence, the Court has previously refused to treat the time spent by applicants in different detention facilities as a continuing situation in cases where their complaints related to specific episodes, such as force-feeding (see Nevmerzgitskiy v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 58825/00, 25 November 2003), failure to render medical assistance at different facilities (see Tarariyeva v. Russia (dec.), no. 4353/03, 11 October 2005) or complaints relating to different detention regimes (see Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004).

Russia (dec.), no. 6847/02, 22 February 2005). Further, where an applicant has been released between different periods of detention, the Court has limited the scope of its examination to the later period (see Dvoynykh v. , no.\u00a072277/01, \u00a7\u00a046, 12 October 2006, and Grishin v. , no.\u00a030983/02, \u00a7\u00a083, 15\u00a0November 2007).",
