In that connection, the Court refers to its settled case-law to the effect that a decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him or her of victim status unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see, for example, Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, p.\u00a0846, \u00a7 36; Dalban v.\u00a0Romania\u00a0[GC],\u00a0no. 28114/95,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 1999-VI; Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a0142, ECHR 2000-IV; and Ila\u015fcu and Others v.\u00a0Moldova and Russia [GC] (dec.), no. 48787/99, 4 July 2001). In the present case, the Court notes that the legislative provisions impugned by the applicant remain in force, and that she is still disqualified from standing both for Parliament and for municipal councils. As to the parliamentary practice referred to by the Government, this hardly suffices to affect the applicant\u2019s status as a \u201cvictim\u201d, since future repeal of the disputed restrictions is merely hypothetical and without any certainty. In any event, any such repeal would not negate the measures already taken against the applicant, namely the prohibition on her participation in the parliamentary elections of 1998 and 2002 and the forfeiture of her seat as  city councillor in 1999.",

It was consequently necessary to exclude those persons from exercising legislative authority since, having failed to respect democratic principles in the past, there was no guarantee that they would now exercise their authority in accordance with such principles. In other words, the disqualification from standing for election was justified by the need to protect effective democracy, to which all of society was entitled, against a possible resurgence of communist totalitarianism. Relying on Ahmed and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 2\u00a0September 1998 (Reports 1998-VI, p. 2395, \u00a7 52), the Government argued that the disputed disqualification was preventative in nature and did not require the factual existence of dangerous and undemocratic actions on the part of those persons.

In that connection, the Court wishes to reiterate that, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, its task is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. In so doing, it has to satisfy itself that the national authorities based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts and that they committed no arbitrary acts (see, for example, the judgments in Freedom and Democracy Party (\u00d6ZDEP) v.

The Preamble goes on to affirm that European countries have a common heritage of political tradition, ideals, freedom and the rule of law. This common heritage consists in the underlying values of the Convention; thus, the Court has pointed out on many occasions that the Convention was in fact designed to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society. In other words, democracy is the only political model contemplated by the Convention and, accordingly, the only one compatible with it (see, among many other examples, the above-mentioned United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey judgment, pp.\u00a021-22, \u00a7 45; Refah Partisi (The Welfare Party) and Others v.

It was precisely this concern which led the authors of the Convention to introduce Article 17, which provides: \u201cNothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention\u201d (see Collected Edition of the \u201cTravaux Pr\u00e9paratoires\u201d: Official Report of the Consultative Assembly, 1949, pp.\u00a01235-1239).

The problem which is then posed is that of achieving a compromise between the requirements of defending democratic society on the one hand and protecting individual rights on the other (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v.

In their internal legal orders the Contracting States make the rights to vote and to stand for election subject to conditions which are not in principle precluded under Article 3. They have a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere, but it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see also the following judgments: Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v.

The Government submit that the CPL was to be considered illegal from the latter date. The Court cannot accept that argument. It points out that, when examining compliance with the \u201clawfulness\u201d criterion in respect of the interference provided for in Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention, it has on numerous occasions stated that any restrictive provision must be \u201cforeseeable\u201d, this requirement being closely linked to the principle of legal certainty (see, most recently, Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, \u00a7\u00a030, to be reported in ECHR 2004). Yet, according to the information available to the Court, no legislation explicitly or even implicitly prohibited the operations of the CPL or of the CPSU prior to August 1991. Consequently, in becoming involved or participating actively in those organisations during the period in question, the applicant could not reasonably have foreseen the adverse consequences that might arise in the future.

Hungary, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 47). Equally, to the extent that the applicant refers to the CPL\u2019s official programme and to its alleged moves towards democratisation after 1990 (see paragraph 56 above), the Court points out that a political party\u2019s constitution and programme cannot be taken into consideration as the only criterion in determining its objectives and intentions. The political experience of the Contracting States has shown that in the past political parties with aims contrary to the fundamental principles of democracy have not revealed such aims in their official publications until after taking power. For that reason, the Court has always noted that it cannot be ruled out that the programme of a political party may conceal objectives and intentions different from those that it proclaims; to verify that it does not, the content of the programme must be compared with the actions of the party\u2019s leaders and members and the positions they defend (see Refah Partisi and Others v. Turkey, \u00a7\u00a0101; United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, p.\u00a027, \u00a7 58; and Socialist Party and Others v. Turkey, pp.\u00a012571258, \u00a7 48, all cited above).",

It is undeniable that the authorities of a newly-established State are best placed to evaluate the risk of \u201cfall-out\u201d from a totalitarian political regime from which the country concerned has just freed itself and to assess the need for preventative measures. In those circumstances, the Court accepts that to bar from the legislature persons who had held positions within the former regime\u2019s ruling body and who had also actively supported attempts to overthrow the new democratic system may be a legitimate and balanced solution, without it being necessary to look into the applicant\u2019s individual conduct; such a measure would be fully compatible with the concept of a \u201cdemocracy capable of defending itself\u201d relied on by the Government. After a certain time, however, this ground is no longer sufficient to justify the preventative aspect of the restriction in question; it then becomes necessary to establish whether other factors, particularly an individual\u2019s personal participation in the disputed events, continue to justify his or her ineligibility. Furthermore, the Court notes that this principle was, in essence, acknowledged by the  in its judgment of 30 August 2000, encouraging the legislature to re-examine periodically the need to maintain the disputed measure (see paragraph 48 above).",

Consequently, and having regard to the interpretation of the term \u201cactive participation\u201d given by the Constitutional Court, the courts have only limited powers to assess the real danger posed to the current democratic order by each individual. In the Court\u2019s opinion, such inflexibility is striking, in that it deprives the national courts of jurisdiction to rule on whether the disputed disqualification remains proportionate over time. Accordingly, the Court must itself examine whether the applicant\u2019s conduct more than ten years ago still constitutes sufficient justification for barring her from standing in parliamentary elections.",

As the Court has noted above, the procedure for disqualification introduced by the Parliamentary Elections Act is very firmly focused on the past and does not allow for sufficient evaluation of the current threat posed by the persons concerned.

However, the Court points out that there is no democracy without pluralism. On the contrary, it is of the essence of democracy to allow diverse political projects to be proposed and debated, even those that call into question the way a State is currently organised and those which offend, shock or disturb a section of the population (see, mutatis mutandis, Freedom and Democracy Party (\u00d6ZDEP) v.\u00a0Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 39 and 41). A person or an association may promote a change in the law or even the legal and constitutional structures of the State on two conditions: firstly, the means used to that end must be legal and democratic; secondly, the change proposed must itself be compatible with fundamental democratic principles (see Refah Partisi and Others v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a098).

Turkey, no.\u00a026482/95, \u00a7\u00a045, 12\u00a0November 2003). The same conclusion is inescapable as regards the means used by the applicant to attain her political objectives. In particular, she has never been accused of having been secretly active within the CPL after the latter\u2019s dissolution, let alone of having sought to re-establish that party in its previous totalitarian form.

Italy (dec.), nos. 28160/95 and 28382/95, ECHR 1999-II). In particular, one of the main objectives of Article 17 is to prevent totalitarian or extremist groups from justifying their activities by referring to the Convention. However, in the present case, the applicant\u2019s disqualification from standing for election is based on her previous political involvement rather than on her current conduct, and the Court has just found that her current public activities do not reveal a failure to comply with the fundamental values of the Convention (see paragraph 98 above). In other words, there is no evidence before the Court that would permit it to suspect the applicant of attempts to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. In this area, there is a clear distinction between the present case and the Glimmerveen and Hagenbeek case, cited above, in which the applicants\u2019 conviction and the annulment of their electoral list were based on their real and specific conduct at the material time, or the German Communist Party and Others v. Germany case (no. 250/57, Commission\u2019s report of 20 July 1957, Yearbook 1, pp.\u00a0222-225), in which the dissolution of the applicant party was based on the views expressed in its programme, which were contrary to democracy.

Germany (Article 50), judgment of 21 June 1983, Series A, no. 65, p. 11, \u00a7 25). However, this principle must be interpreted in the light of the overall objectives pursued by Article 41. The Court has accepted that the high costs of proceedings may of themselves constitute a serious impediment to the effective protection of human rights, and that it would be wrong for the Court to give encouragement to such a situation in its decisions awarding costs under Article 41 (see B\u00f6nisch v.\u00a0Austria (Article 50), judgment of 2 June 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 9, \u00a7\u00a015). In those circumstances, reimbursement of fees cannot be limited only to those sums already paid by the applicant to his or her lawyer; indeed, such an interpretation would discourage many lawyers from representing less prosperous applicants before the Court. In any event, the Court has always awarded costs and expenses in situations where the fees remained, at least in part, payable by the applicant (see, for example, Kamasinski v. Austria, judgment of 19\u00a0December 1989, Series A no. 168, p. 47, \u00a7 115; Koendjbiharie v. the Netherlands, judgment of 25\u00a0October 1990, Series A, 185-B, p. 42, \u00a7 35; and Iatridis v.

The majority lays considerable emphasis on the fact that the measure complained of might have been justified in a transitional period, but not in 1998, when the adjustment period was over. I fail to see how an international Court is better placed to impose its own value judgements on such evanescent and ephemeral issues as to exactly when a state of emergency or transition is over, rather than the democratic sensors of the national authorities, in everyday, and far more intimate, contact with the realities of Latvian history. In the absence of objectively identifiable criteria (such as \u2019s entry into NATO and the European Union in 2004) the Court should have considered the determination of when a transition period comes to an end, to fall squarely within the national margin of appreciation.",

Had the applicant been found guilty in criminal proceedings, loss of election rights would have followed automatically. The Latvian authorities, (whether in a spirit of reconciliation, or for reasons of the fragility of the power structures is as unclear as it is irrelevant) spared the applicant severe criminal prosecution and instead favoured her with the far softer option of a penalty based on fully adversarial civil-law proceedings. The Court would not, presumably, have objected to a criminal sentence coupled with loss of electoral rights.

I also wanted to draw attention to the problem of the Court\u2019s judicial self-restraint in genuinely political matters. I think that in such cases the Court should be extremely careful, try to remain on the solid ground of judicial assessment, and not advance on to political ground, the latter being reserved for the democratic institutions of the Contracting States.
