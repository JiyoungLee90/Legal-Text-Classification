The Court considers important that, as a consequence of German tax legislation, the couple\u2019s choice of a joint tax assessment not only had consequences for the calculation of the couple\u2019s overall tax, but also for the administration of the tax claims against the first applicant and his wife, which were put together in one document.",

That was because offsetting is part of the procedure for calculating taxes and the tax authorities only calculate the final income tax after spouses have submitted their tax declaration and made their choice of a joint or separate tax assessment. Under those circumstances, the Court doubts whether a preventive declaratory action can be regarded as a counterbalancing factor in the circumstances of the case, all the more so as the Government have not given any details as to the preconditions and effects of such an action.",

Austria (no. 9781/82, 14 May 1984), the Government stated that the second and fifth applicants\u2019 obligation to pay the special church fee did not constitute an interference with their right to freedom of religion, as both had been members of a church and the obligation to pay fees for that membership had not interfered with its members\u2019 freedom of religion. The Government further stressed that the applicants, had they not wanted to pay the special church fee, could have chosen to leave their church (reference Konttinen v.\u00a0Finland, no. 24949/94, Commission decision of 3 December 1996).",

On the contrary, according to the Government\u2019s submissions, the direct result of the spouses\u2019 decision was that the third applicant\u2019s church tax was lower than under separate income tax declarations. In contrast to the Government\u2019s similar argument in the case of the first applicant, where this decision enabled his wife\u2019s church to collect its special church fee at the expense of the first applicant\u2019s tax reimbursement claim (see paragraph 93 above), in the present case the church tax was levied on and collected from the person liable to pay it, namely the third applicant, who is a member of a church.",

The calculation of the third applicant\u2019s church tax did not arise directly from State legislation, but derived from a decision taken independently by the Protestant Church of the Land of Thuringia. As such, that decision cannot be attributed to the respondent State (see paragraph 115 above).",

Looking at the first element, the applicant was indeed treated differently compared with individuals who were in the same situation, namely individuals with a higher income than their spouse, but whose spouse did not belong to a church with tax-levying powers. Those other individuals had the possibility of opting for a joint tax assessment, with the benefits that come from such joint assessment, without being forced as a result to have their total income taken as a basis for the calculation of their wife\u2019s church contributions. The applicant did not have that choice and thus was treated less favourably. He could choose only one of those two alternatives, either a joint tax assessment or not having his income taken into account for the purpose of the calculation of his wife\u2019s church contributions. It is precisely this restriction of the choice available to the first applicant that amounted to a different treatment and this was the substance of his complaint before the Court (see paragraph 102). This difference in treatment was based on the religion of the applicant\u2019s wife and as a result, in my view, falls within the ambit of Article 9, with the requisite need for justification of such different treatment.",

While some of the justifications for this differential treatment could be inferred from earlier domestic judgments, particularly those of the Federal Constitutional Court in its relevant judgments, the fact remains that this complaint was never addressed at the domestic level. Thus, although it falls within the ambit of Articles 14 and 9 of the Convention, an assessment of its justification would be particularly difficult in the light of the lack of proper consideration at the domestic level, this also being contrary to the principle of subsidiarity.",
