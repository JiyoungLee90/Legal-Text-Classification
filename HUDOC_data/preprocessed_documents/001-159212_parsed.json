It was not disputed that the house in which the supposed accident had taken place had been locked, that the applicant had had the key to it, and that he had been the last person to see the boy alive (see paragraphs 7-9 above).

While being repeatedly questioned in his home, the applicant maintained \u201cthe accident\u201d version. He was then taken to the police station, where it was proposed to him that he should \u201ctell the truth\u201d and where he wrote his statement of \u201cvoluntary surrender to the police\u201d (see paragraphs\u00a011-13 above).",

The Court notes, however, that he chose at that stage, on the advice of his lawyer, to deny his guilt altogether, let alone to show any remorse.

There was no such stamp or other acknowledgment of receipt on the request for the applicant\u2019s participation in the cassation hearing of the same date (see paragraph 35 above). It is also noteworthy that the applicant did not comment on the Government\u2019s observation that he had not applied to participate in the cassation hearing.
