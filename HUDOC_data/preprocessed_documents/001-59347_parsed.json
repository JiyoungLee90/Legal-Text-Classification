From the evidence it is established, however, that the car, registered in the name of the accused\u2019s mother, is mainly used by the accused, even if it is also occasionally used by others, such as the accused\u2019s sister. It would have been open to the accused to give a contrary version of events which conflicted with the charges and to put in relevant evidence without thereby at the same time having to name another person as the driver. That was evidently impossible, however, because having spent the night away from his parents\u2019 house and possibly consuming alcohol he had on 8 April 1995 driven his mother\u2019s car through Obsteig. The court of first instance correctly referred to the observations of the police officers to the effect that immediately after the accident the car was indeed in front of the parents\u2019 house, yet the accused\u2019s bed had not been slept in and he could not be found. Nor could it be ascertained where the accused, who refused to make a written statement to the police, was staying. On the basis of the available evidence before it the court of first instance made a realistic assessment of the facts, especially as there was no evidence that anyone else, such as the accused\u2019s sister, had been driving the car at the time of the accident.\u201d",

The Government maintained that the applicant was given ample opportunity to defend himself and to refute the evidence adduced at the trial or to produce evidence in his favour.

Article 6 \u00a7 2 requires, inter alia, that when carrying out their duties, the members of a court should not start with the preconceived idea that the accused has committed the offence charged; the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and any doubt should benefit the accused (see the Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v. Spain judgment of 6 December 1988, Series A no.\u00a0146, pp. 31 and 33, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68 and 77). Thus, the presumption of innocence will be infringed where the burden of proof is shifted from the prosecution to the defence (see the John Murray v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8\u00a0February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, p.\u00a052, \u00a7 54).",

The Court recalls that the above-mentioned John\u00a0Murray judgment concerned a case in which the law allowed for the drawing of common-sense inferences from the accused\u2019s silence, where the prosecution had established a case against him, which called for an explanation. Considering that the evidence adduced at the trial constituted a formidable case against the applicant, the Court found that the drawing of such inferences, which was moreover subject to important procedural safeguards, did not violate Article 6 in the circumstances of the case (ibid.). The Court considers that the drawing of inferences from an accused\u2019s silence may also be permissible in a system like the Austrian one where the courts freely evaluate the evidence before them, provided that the evidence adduced is such that the only common-sense inference to be drawn from the accused\u2019s silence is that he had no answer to the case against him.",
