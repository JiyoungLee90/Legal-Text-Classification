Finland [GC], no. 25702/94, \u00a7 150, ECHR 2001-VII). However, family life must include the relationship arising from a lawful and genuine marriage (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, \u00a7 62, Series\u00a0A no. 94). Furthermore, it follows from the concept of family on which Article 8 is based that a child born of a marital union is ipso jure part of that relationship; hence, from the moment of the child\u2019s birth and by the very fact of it, there exists between him and his parents a bond amounting to \u201cfamily life\u201d which subsequent events cannot break, save in exceptional circumstances (see, among other authorities, Berrehab v. the Netherlands, 21 June 1988, \u00a7 21, Series A no. 138; and C\u0131l\u0131z v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a029192/95, \u00a7\u00a7 59 and 60, ECHR 2000\u2011VIII), until the child reaches adulthood.

In this context, the Court observes that the Federal Administrative Court expressly acknowledged that the first applicant\u2019s state of health gave reason for concern and that, according to his attending doctor, his return to Ecuador in itself was likely to jeopardise his health, irrespective of the medical treatment he received (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above).",

The Court further observes that the Federal Administrative Court considered that, given her integration into Swiss society, lack of knowledge about her country of origin, where she never returned after having entered Switzerland at the age of two, and the fact that she hardly spoke Spanish, it would amount to an \u201cuprooting of excessive rigidity\u201d to send her back to Ecuador (see paragraph 17 above). Under these circumstances, it can be expected that personal contact between the two applicants would, at the least, be drastically diminished if the first applicant were forced to return to Ecuador. The Court puts emphasis on the fact that the Federal Administrative Court, when considering the first applicant\u2019s case, did not make any reference to the child\u2019s best interests, because it did not consider that the relationship between them fell under the protection of \u201cfamily life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. Under these circumstances, the Court is not convinced that sufficient weight was attached to the child\u2019s best interests. Reference is made in this context also to Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in accordance with which the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all actions taken by public authorities concerning children (see Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7 135, ECHR 2010, and Nunez, cited above, \u00a7 84).",
