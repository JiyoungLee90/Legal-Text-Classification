The\u00a0hospital\u2019s conclusion not to release the applicant on 11\u00a0September 2006 was not based on any fresh medical evidence but on an earlier decision of 14\u00a0September\u00a02005 ordering his confinement. It should be noted that this decision referred to an expert opinion of 7 April 2005. Furthermore, more recent expert evidence of June 2006 was not taken into consideration (see\u00a0paragraph 21 above). In this respect the Court reiterates that the medical assessment must be based on the actual state of mental health of the person concerned and not solely on past events. A medical opinion cannot be seen as sufficient to justify deprivation of liberty if a significant period of time has elapsed (see,\u00a0Witek v.
