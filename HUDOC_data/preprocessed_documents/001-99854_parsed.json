The court noted that, in view of the fact that the two bodies had not drawn up a formal contract between them, the applicant company could not prove that it had received the impugned information officially from the UNIAN. Furthermore, the information published by the applicant company did not correspond to the information disseminated by the UNIAN. For those reasons, the court concluded that the applicant company could not be protected against liability. The applicant company and Mr M. were ordered to pay Ukrainian hryvnias 100,000 (UAH) and UAH 20,000, respectively, in compensation. The court, however, found no liability against the UNIAN, which had been identified as a co-defendant by the court, because the plaintiff had lodged no claims against it and the UNIAN had published a correction.",

Despite the Government's arguments that a council of judges is a collective body, the domestic legislation seems to empower the chairman of such a council to initiate disciplinary proceedings against other judges. The applicant company submitted material about the monitoring of judicial independence, which demonstrates the possible risk that judges could be influenced through a threat of disciplinary proceedings and other career-related decisions which are within the competence of the chairman of a council of judges. Therefore, the applicant company could reasonably anticipate a possible conflict of interest in the domestic proceedings in question. Furthermore, the Deputy President of the Supreme Court allowed the request of the defendants in part, although he had not, as asked, transferred the case to a court in Kyiv, but had transferred it to a first-instance court in another region of . Although this decision by the Deputy President of the Supreme Court did not state clearly the reasons for the transfer, it suggested that the applicant company's fear about a risk of bias of the courts in the  region was not without substance.

Moreover, the higher courts, in dealing with the applicant company's appeals, disregarded its submissions to this effect.",

Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his words and deeds by journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see Lingens v.\u00a0Austria, 8\u00a0July 1986, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 103, or Incal v.

The domestic courts, however, failed to distinguish between the accusation made by Mr M. and the reporting on such accusation by the applicant company and found them jointly and equally liable for the statement that did not emanate from the applicant company but was clearly identified as that proffered by another person. The domestic courts thus failed to explain whether the defamation ascribed to the applicant company lay in the contents of the reported accusation, or in the fact that the applicant company had made it (see paragraph 11 above). The Court notes that the domestic law exempts the media from liability under certain conditions where they have published untrue information. It is not, however, clear why this issue had been so extensively discussed by the domestic courts in the present case because they had themselves established that the information as disseminated by the applicant company was true.",
