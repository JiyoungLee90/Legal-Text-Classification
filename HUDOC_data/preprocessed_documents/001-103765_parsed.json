In the present case, the Court notes that, after the respondent State\u2019s ratification of the Convention on 3 March 2004, the first decision was given on 28 March 2005, which is more than a year after the ratification. After this decision had been quashed on 3 October 2006, it then took more than a year for another first-instance decision to be given, on 3 November 2007. Lastly, the case has been pending before the  since 16\u00a0December 2008, that is for more than two years and one month. There is nothing in the case file to suggest that this has been caused by the conduct of the applicants, but rather by the failure of the authorities to act in accordance with the law and time-limits provided therein (see paragraphs 33-36 above).",

That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention \u2013 with which it has close affinity \u2013 that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system (see the decision as to the admissibility of application no. 5238/07, Ahlskog v. Finland, 9 November 2010, \u00a7 68). In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see the recapitulation of the relevant case-law in Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999-V). The remedies which Article 35 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these various conditions are satisfied (see, for example, Vernillo v. France, 20\u00a0February 1991, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 198; and Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16\u00a0September 1996, \u00a7 66, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV). On the other hand, and as correctly pointed out in the judgment (see \u00a7 55), once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been used, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from that requirement. The decisive question when assessing the effectiveness of a remedy for a length of proceedings complaint is whether or not the applicant was afforded an opportunity to have the proceedings expedited or had a possibility to claim compensation for delays which have occurred (see Kudla v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96 \u00a7\u00a7 157-159, ECHR 2000XI).",

In the present case the question arises as to whether the applicants should be required to exhaust this remedy, given that they introduced their applications prior to the enactment of the above Act. In this connection, the majority reiterated that the assessment of whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is normally carried out with reference to the date on which the application was lodged with it. However, this rule is subject to exceptions which may be justified by the particular circumstances of each case (see Baumann v. France, no. 33592/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001V (extracts)). Thus, the Court has held that applicants in cases against Italy, for instance, which concerned length of proceedings and had not been declared admissible, should be required to have recourse to the remedy introduced by the \u201cPinto Act\u201d notwithstanding that it was enacted after their applications had been filed with the Court (see, for example, Giacometti and Others v.  (dec.), no. 34939/97, ECHR 2001XII; or Brusco v.  (dec.), no. 69789/01, ECHR 2001IX). A similar decision was taken in respect of cases introduced against Croatia following the entry into force of a constitutional amendment permitting the Constitutional Court to provide redress of both a preventive and a compensatory nature to persons complaining about undue delays in judicial proceedings (see Nogolica v.\u00a0Croatia (dec.), no.\u00a077784/01, ECHR 2002-VIII). A similar approach was followed also in respect of Slovakia (see Andr\u00e1\u0161ik and Others v. Slovakia (dec.), nos. 57984/00, 60237/00, 60242/00, 60679/00, 60680/00, 68563/01 and 60226/00, ECHR 2002IX) and  (see Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland (dec.), no. 15212/03, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2005V; and Michalak v. Poland (dec.), no. 24549/03, \u00a7 41, 1\u00a0March 2005). We believe that the present case is similar, in substance, to the above Italian, Croatian, Slovak and Polish cases. As in those cases, the arguments of the applicants that they did not have the possibility to use this remedy and were not obliged to use it, should in our opinion and following the Court\u2019s case-law, have been rejected by the Court.",

Furthermore, the relevant domestic case-law shows that between 1 January 2008 and 30 September 2009 the courts in  considered one hundred and two requests for review pursuant to this Act. In eighty-four cases the applicants were notified that certain procedural measures would be undertaken within a specified period. No information has been provided as to whether these time-limits were complied with or not. Eighteen requests were rejected as ill-founded. On the other hand, in the same period twenty-two actions for fair redress were submitted, of which sixteen were dealt with and six are still being examined. In one case the domestic courts awarded non-pecuniary damages for the length of civil proceedings. In 2010, an additional fourteen actions for fair redress were examined, in two of which the courts awarded damages.",

The majority of the Chamber found that a constitutional appeal could not be considered an available remedy where there is no \u201cindividual decision\u201d against which such an appeal could be lodged. For the majority, this implies that there should be an individual court decision.

As found in Slavi\u010dek v. Croatia (dec). no. 20862/02, ECHR 2002VII) and Nogolica v. Croatia (cited above), a constitutional complaint was accepted by the Court as an effective remedy for length of proceedings cases which were still pending before the domestic courts in Croatia. The approach of the Court\u2019s case-law in respect of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been to the effect that when the applicant has neither used the constitutional complaint nor shown that it was for any reason inadequate or ineffective (and we consider that no such reason had been shown in this case), the case is to be declared inadmissible for reasons of non-exhaustion (see Mirazovi\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, (dec.) no. 13628/03, 6 May 2006).",

The essence of the length of proceedings problem is precisely the lack of an individual decision and for that reason there is no reasonable explanation why a constitutional complaint could not have been lodged in this case either. The applicants decided not to test this avenue, alleging that it would not have been effective. However, there are no relevant statistics showing that that would have been the case. The European Court\u2019s case-law has already taken a stand on this issue, establishing that as regards legal systems which provide constitutional protection for fundamental rights, it is incumbent on the aggrieved individual to test the extent of that protection (see Holland v. Ireland, no. 24827/94, Commission decision of 14 April 1998, Decisions and Reports 93, p. 15 and Independent News and Media and Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited v. Ireland (dec.), no.\u00a055120/00, 19 June 2003; Toki\u0107 and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 12455/04, 14140/05, 12906/06 and 26028/06, \u00a7 59, 8 July 2008). For us, neither good reasons nor special circumstances have been adduced which would justify a departure from this or any of the above-emphasised principles and so absolve the applicant from the obligation to use this legal remedy.",
