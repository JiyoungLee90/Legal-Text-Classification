Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s sentence had to be mitigated.

The fact that he was summoned to the trial at a late stage has contributed to the length of the proceedings as the court now has a duty to verify that the prosecutor does not add to the charges beyond the terms of the original indictment, having regard to the statute of limitations. The applicant contested the Government\u2019s contention that the changes of counsel at the 33rd hearing on 11 December 2001 and reversion to his original counsel on 12 March 2002 delayed the proceedings.
