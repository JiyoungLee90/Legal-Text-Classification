Although the applicant argued that his family and personal circumstances made the risk of his absconding very unlikely, the courts reiterated that the seriousness of the crime, with which he was charged, alone warranted his detention, without pointing to any particular reason which could reasonably lead the authorities to assume that the applicant would abscond and thus explain the need for his continued detention. In these circumstances, only very compelling reasons would persuade the Court of the necessity to have prolonged the applicant's detention, the duration of which had reached four years by the end of this period. In the absence of such grounds or circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the reasons relied on by the courts in their decisions were not sufficient to justify the applicant's being held in detention for the period in question. It is also to be noted that, subsequent to the quashing of the first-instance conviction, the applicant's pre-trial detention continued and that he is still detained on remand.",
