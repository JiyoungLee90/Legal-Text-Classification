At the same time, the applicant indicated that he had no previous criminal record, he had a permanent residence and employment in Kaluga, had taken part in peacekeeping military operations in the Northern Caucasus, his mother was seriously ill, he had no international passport and therefore could not leave Russia, and he had positive references from the places of his residence, work and military service.

A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons to justify the continued detention (see, among other authorities, Castravet v.

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7 67, 7 April 2005, and Ilijkov v. , no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 84 and 85, 26 July 2001). The national judicial authorities must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and must set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is not the Court\u2019s task to establish such facts and take the place of the national authorities who ruled on the applicant\u2019s detention. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in the domestic courts\u2019 decisions and of the true facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Korchuganova v. Russia, no. 75039/01, \u00a7 72, 8 June 2006; Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7 86; and Labita, cited above, \u00a7 152).",

In the present case, contrary to the Government\u2019s submission, the domestic authorities did not mention any specific facts warranting the applicant\u2019s detention on that ground.
