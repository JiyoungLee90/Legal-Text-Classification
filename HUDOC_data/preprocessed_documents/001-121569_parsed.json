In April 2006 he had begun working for a committee which had been established to develop research methods at the university. The committee had soon been accused of cooperating with Americans. On 20\u00a0June 2006 the applicant had written a letter to the Minister of Education, accusing a university colleague of corruption and of counteracting the work of the committee. The colleague, a member of the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP), had found out about the accusations and had threatened the applicant, saying that bad things would happen to him. On 27 June 2006 armed men had attempted to kidnap the applicant\u2019s daughter. Her mother had called the police and, after some shooting, the daughter had been released. On 30 June 2006 the applicant had received a letter, in which he and his family had been called Christian traitors and it had been stated that they would be killed if the applicant did not quit his job. On 8 July 2006 the applicant had reported the incidents to the police and the family had moved in with relatives. Thereafter, the applicant had found out that the head of the committee had been kidnapped and killed on 16 July 2006 and that he, as well as the other committee members, had previously received threatening letters saying that he deserved to die. The work of the committee had consequently ended and on 3 October 2006 the applicant had fled with his family to . On 15 January 2008 the applicant\u2019s parents, who lived in , had been shot at and the father had been kidnapped and tortured until he had told the kidnappers the whereabouts of the applicant. In October and December 2008, the applicant had received threatening messages on a website.

Also, the applicant had failed to make plausible that his accusation against a former colleague had harmed that person or the IIP and it was thus unlikely that the applicant would be conceived of as a threat by that person.

In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

As stated by a representative of an international organisation and the head of Asaysih, the KRI general security authority, to investigators of the Danish/UK fact-finding mission, this is because Christians are at particular risk of terrorist attacks in southern and central Iraq and as the Christians are not considered to pose any terrorist threat themselves (at 4.34 and 8.19 of the report, M.Y.H. and Others, \u00a7 36).",

As concluded by the UK Border Agency (M.Y.H. and Others, \u00a7 31) and the UK Upper Tribunal in the recent country guidance case of HM and others (M.Y.H. and Others, \u00a7 34), it is possible for an individual to obtain identity documents from a central register in Baghdad, which retains identity records on microfiche, whether he or she is applying from abroad or within Iraq. In regard to the need for a sponsor resident in the Kurdistan Region, the Upper Tribunal further concluded, in the case mentioned above, that no-one was required to have a sponsor, whether for their entry into or for their continued residence in the KRI. It appears that the UNHCR is of the same opinion as regards entry, although its statement in the Guidelines directly concerns only the requirements of a tourist (M.Y.H. and Others, \u00a7 30).
