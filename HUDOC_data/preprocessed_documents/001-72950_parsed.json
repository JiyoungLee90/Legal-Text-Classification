According to the established case-law of the Convention organs, where no domestic remedy is available the sixmonth period runs from the act alleged to constitute a violation of the Convention. In the case of a continuing situation it runs from the end of the situation concerned (see, among many other authorities, Agrotexim Hellas S.A. and Others v. Greece, no.\u00a014807/89, Commission decision of 12 February 1992, Decisions and Reports 72, p. 148). In the instant case that was the amendment of the relevant provisions of the CCP effective 1 January 2000, which preceded the lifting of the applicant\u2019s house arrest on 3 July 2003. The fact that in the meantime the form of the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty mutated from pre-trial detention to house arrest \u2013 which also falls within the scope of Article 5 (see Mancini v. Italy, no. 44955/98, \u00a7 17, ECHR 2001IX; Vachev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 64 and 70; and Nikolova v. Bulgaria (No. 2), no. 40896/98, \u00a7\u00a7 60 and 74, 30 September 2004) \u2013 appears to be of no relevance, as it did not put an end to the alleged violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 concerning the fact that the applicant was not brought before a judge upon his arrest and the justification of his deprivation of liberty, and of Article 5 \u00a7 4 concerning the availability of fullfledged judicial review thereof. However, the Court will take into account the differences between the various forms of the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty when examining the merits of his complaints.",

Increasingly often the Bulgarian courts relied on the Convention in deciding the cases before them.

On 2\u00a0October 1996 his deprivation of liberty took the form of house arrest, which lasted until 3 July 2003 (see paragraphs 34, 39 and 43 above). The Court has already held that house arrest constitutes deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 (see Mancini, \u00a7 17; Vachev, \u00a7\u00a7 64 and 70; and Nikolova (No. 2), \u00a7\u00a7 60 and 74, all cited above). It is furthermore unable to subscribe to the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s house arrest did not in fact amount to a custodial measure because the authorities responsible for monitoring compliance with it were far away, which allowed him to breach it with impunity. To determine whether a person is deprived of his or her liberty the Court must look upon the actual circumstances of the regime to which he or she was subject, as a matter of law and in fact (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no.\u00a093, p. 14, \u00a7 24 and p. 20, \u00a7 42; and Weeks v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114, p. 22, \u00a7 40). Thus, in a case concerning the detention of a person of unsound mind, the Court was of the view that the facts that she had absconded and had been granted probationary leave had no incidence on the applicability of Article 5 \u00a7 4, as she was still detained in law (see Van der Leer v. the Netherlands, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 170A, p. 14, \u00a7 35). Similarly, in a recent case concerning the detention of a person infected with HIV, the Court had no doubt that Article 5 \u00a7 1 was applicable for the entire duration of that person\u2019s detention, regardless of the fact that he had escaped on several occasions and had actually spent much less time in custody (see Enhorn v.\u00a0Sweden, no. 56529/00, \u00a7\u00a7 32 in fine, 33, 47 and 55, ECHR 2005...). By the same token, in the instant case, the fact that the applicant had the opportunity to breach his house arrest cannot lead to the conclusion that it did not fall within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 3.",

The presumption was only rebuttable in very exceptional circumstances where even a hypothetical possibility of absconding, reoffending or collusion was excluded, due to serious illness or other exceptional factors. It was moreover incumbent on the detained individual to prove the existence of such exceptional circumstances, failing which he or she was bound to remain in detention pending trial throughout the proceedings. The above principles were based on Article 152 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the CCP, as worded at the material time, and the Supreme Court\u2019s practice at that stage (see Ilijkov v.

It made similar findings in a number of subsequent cases (see, among many others, Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 94100; and Hamanov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 44062/98, \u00a7\u00a7 7985, 8 April 2004). However, the Court reiterates that its task is not to rule on the law in abstracto. It must rather examine whether its implementation in an individual case gave rise to a violation of the Convention (see Nikolova, cited above, \u00a7 60). In the instant case, the applicant did not institute judicial proceedings in which to challenge his pre-trial detention. His allegations about the scope of the judicial review of this detention are therefore a matter of speculation. The Court cannot conjecture how the proceedings that the applicant never brought would have unfolded (see Belchev v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 39270/98, 6 February 2003).",

The Court further found that, while the Convention was incorporated in Bulgarian law and was directly applicable in , it was still not entirely clear whether a remedy satisfying the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 existed in theory. In any event, the Court noted that the Government had not furnished any example of a judicial decision in which a person put under house arrest had successfully relied on that provision to apply to a court for his or her release. The decision of the Assembly of the Criminal Divisions of the Supreme Court of Cassation to refer the provisions of the CCP governing pre-trial detention to the Constitutional Court as being contrary to Article 5 of the Convention (see paragraph 53 above) did not, in the Court\u2019s view, represent a relevant precedent. The Court found that the lack of precedents indicated the uncertainty of the alleged remedy in practice. It accordingly dismissed the Government\u2019s objection of nonexhaustion of domestic remedies and concluded that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Vachev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 6974). In a subsequent case the Court found a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 for the same reason (see Nikolova (No. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 7477).",

Furthermore, the Government have not identified and there is, to the Court\u2019s knowledge, no reported caselaw or doctrine opinions supporting the Government\u2019s assertion. The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see Vachev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 67, 72 and 73; and, mutatis mutandis, Stoichkov v.

The remainder (EUR 45,000) represented compensation for his damaged health. He pointed to the disproportionate duration of his deprivation of liberty and the length of the criminal proceedings against him, asserting that these had seriously disrupted his family life and had had a negative impact on his ability to provide for his family. His deprivation of liberty had also prevented him from being with his wife at the time when she gave birth. Finally, he had had to move several times because of the resultant difficulties in finding employment.",
