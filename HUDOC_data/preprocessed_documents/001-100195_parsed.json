The Court observes that according to the Cooperative's charter as registered by the domestic authorities and the relevant domestic law in force at the time of the establishment of the Cooperative, at least three members were required for its establishment and this rule was not infringed. There is no evidence to prove that, at any time, the domestic authorities ceased to recognise the Cooperative as a legal entity based on this ground (number of members).",

However, that right would be illusory if a 's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see\u00a0Hornsby v. , 19 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II).",
