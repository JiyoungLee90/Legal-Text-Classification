In addition, the Government argued that from 17\u00a0September 2004, the date of entry into force of the 2004 Act, the applicants could have sought compensation for the damage resulting from the excessive length of proceedings before Polish courts, under sections 16 and 18 of the 2004 Act read in conjunction with Article\u00a0417 of the Civil Code.

The Court also notes that the examples of domestic case-law furnished by the Government do not constitute evidence of a judicial practice which was sufficiently established to make a claim for compensation based on Article 417\u00b9 \u00a7 3 of the Civil Code an effective remedy and that the Government have thus failed to substantiate their contention (see Grabi\u0144ski\u00a0v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a043702/02, \u00a7\u00a074, 17 October 2006).
