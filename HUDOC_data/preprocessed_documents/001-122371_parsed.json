On receipt of the statement, it emerged that Officer M, of the Police Service Northern Ireland (the \u201cPSNI\u201d replaced the RUC in 2001), had taken the statement on the Coroner\u2019s behalf. However, Officer M had been a member of the RUC at the time of the alleged assault. He was also the Deputy Investigation Officer and, in addition, he was due to be called as a witness. The first applicant therefore requested and, in October 2009, the Coroner obtained and disclosed Officer M\u2019s journal entries on the police investigation. It emerged therefrom that Officer M had interviewed a soldier (Private G) in 2000. Private G had told Officer M that, on the day when John Hemsworth was allegedly assaulted, Private G had seen an officer in the RUC Blues OSU assaulting a civilian with a baton in an area close to the location of Mr Hemsworth\u2019s alleged assault. Private G had also told Officer M that a senior military officer, as well as a senior RUC officer from the RUC Blues OSU, had told him that he should not report this incident to his superiors. Given the time it would take to recall witnesses and to call Private G, the Coroner considered it preferable to discharge the jury and conduct the inquest afresh.",

Witnesses who attended were also able to rely on the passage of time to explain their inability to recall issues and/or to furnish documents. The delay to date would make future identification of the responsible officers difficult which would, in turn, be likely to affect the decision of the DPP as regards any potential prosecution. The delay also led to the destruction of evidence: the applicants pointed to early disclosure issues as regards the evidence of Private G and the loss of relevant documents, which loss was of particular relevance since Private G had revoked his complaint in his oral evidence. More generally, the delay in holding the inquest rendered public scrutiny of it ineffective: while the applicants and the public had access to the inquest, the inquest was limited and, to a large extent, this was because of the delay in holding it.\u00a0The jury was unable to identify the assailant and, given the inadequacy of the original investigation combined with delay, it was unlikely that the perpetrator(s) would ever be identified.",

Thereafter the inquest was adjourned in June 2001 pending submissions on this Court\u2019s judgments of 4 May 2001 concerning Northern Ireland and then pending Pearse Jordan\u2019s inquest. The Coroner did not hear preliminary matters until February 2003. While the applicants delivered a list of witnesses in December 2004, the Coroner did not rule on this until after a series of significant and relevant domestic judgments (Amin, Middleton, McKerr and, finally, Jordan and McCaughey in 2007). It took a further year after that last judgment (March 2007) to hold a pre-inquest hearing (March 2008). The delay between March 2008 and September 2009 was explained by the Coroner\u2019s refusal, later overturned, to call RUC witnesses. There was a further delay between the date initially fixed for the second inquest and the date it began (January 2010-May 2011).",

This period was characterised by legal actions by the applicants\u2019 and others which were demonstrably necessary to drive forward their inquests and to ensure the clarification of certain important aspects of coronial law and practice including, notably, the rights of the next-of-kin. In particular, the principles flowing from this Court\u2019s judgments of 4 May 2001 were applied in domestic law, not through legislation, but through a series of complex and overlapping domestic judicial review applications. The entry into force of the HRA in 2000 also brought with it further questions of relevance to coronial law and, notably, its application to investigations into pre-HRA deaths, a key issue not finally resolved until the judgment of the Supreme Court in McCaughey of May 2011 which overturned the earlier judgment of the House of Lords in McKerr (paragraphs 36-43 above). The present inquest was therefore adjourned for long periods pending the outcome of highly relevant litigation initiated by others and by the first applicant (who was required twice to litigate to obtain legal aid).",

The fact that it was necessary to postpone the inquest so frequently and for such long periods pending clarifying litigation demonstrates that the inquest process itself was not structurally capable at the relevant time of providing the applicants with access to an effective investigation which would commence promptly and be conducted with due expedition (the above-cited Jordan and McKerr judgments at \u00a7\u00a7 138 and 155, respectively).",

This premise seems to have little support in the Court\u2019s position in hundreds of other cases, where the Court held that \u201cany deficiency in the investigation which undermines its capability of establishing the circumstances of the case or the person responsible is liable to fall foul of the required standard of effectiveness\u201d (see, among many other authorities, Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a096-97, 4 May 2001; Anguelova v.

Such a conclusion falls short of those reached more than ten years ago in similar cases against the United Kingdom, where the Court indicated that \u201ca prompt response by the authorities may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts\u201d (see Hugh Jordan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 136-140).

But it cannot and should not be excluded that, in some cases, it is clear on the evidence that the effectiveness of the available domestic remedy to look at the substantive allegations of unjustified killing by State agents has not been so adversely affected as to render the remedy ineffective. In such circumstances, it is difficult to see any reason (i) why the applicant should be dispensed from his or her normal obligation under Article 35 \u00a7 1 to exhaust an available and effective remedy in relation to that particular, namely substantive, complaint and (ii) why the national system should not be allowed by this Court to do its subsidiary task.",

The standard of proof required to establish liability is the civil one of proof on the balance of probabilities, not the stricter criminal or Convention standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. As I understand it, the underlying logic in previous Northern Ireland cases, such as Jordan v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, ECHR 2001-III, is that the system of civil remedies in Northern Ireland (and indeed in the United Kingdom in general) is sufficiently well armed and strong to constitute, in principle, an effective means of establishing facts and liability and of obtaining adequate compensation, as appropriate, in relation to killings or serious ill-treatment allegedly committed by State agents. As a consequence \u2013 and this is in accord with the reasoning developed in Akdivar \u2013, as regards a substantive complaint of unlawfulling killing under Article 2, the civil claim is in principle to be exhausted. It would have to be demonstrated, in a particular case before this Court, that the deficiencies in the process of investigation and of prosecution of perpetrators were so serious that the civil remedy was compromised to the point where it would be unreasonable to expect the applicant to exhaust it. Arguably such a situation could arise where, for example, as a result of delay key evidence had been lost or destroyed, key witnesses had died or become untraceable, and so on.",

The verdict of the inquest jury in May 2011, rendered after several days of hearing witnesses, following the production of various expert reports and apparently following adequate disclosure of relevant documentary material by the authorities (see notably \u00a7\u00a7 21, 23, 26, 27 and 63 of the Chamber\u2019s judgment), \u201cwas largely in the applicants\u2019 favour in that it explicitly accepted key aspects of their claims about the death of John Hemsworth\u201d, identifying its probable cause as being violent conduct by one or more police officers (see \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 60 of the Chamber\u2019s judgment).
