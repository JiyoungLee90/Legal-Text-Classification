The applicants were represented by Ms T. Aslan, a lawyer practising in . The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.
On 4 October 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the applicants’ right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants were born in 1979 and 1973 respectively and were serving prison sentences at Nazilli Prison at the time of their applications to the Court.
On 23 February 1999 the applicants were arrested and taken into custody by police officers from the Anti-terror branch of the Kuşadası Security Directorate. They were interrogated on 24 and 25 February 1999 respectively.

The applicants confessed to having committed the offence of which they were accused, namely throwing Molotov cocktails at buildings. They claimed they had acted alone, that they were not involved in any illegal organisation and that they regretted their actions.
On the same day, the applicants were brought before the Kuşadası Magistrates’ Court where they reiterated their statements given to the public prosecutor. Mr Sancı acknowledged in part the statements he had given to the police. He alleged in this connection that he had been subjected to illtreatment in police custody. Mr Aslan acknowledged the contents of his statements made to the police. However, he claimed that he had signed without reading them. The court remanded both applicants in custody.
On 15 March 1999 the public prosecutor at the  filed a bill of indictment with that court accusing the applicants of having thrown Molotov cocktails at the buildings of the Ülkü Ocakları Association, Ziraat Bank, Halk Bank and Yaşar Bank in Kuşadası on 22 February 1999. He requested that they be convicted and sentenced under Articles 169 and 264 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713.

At a hearing held on 15 July 1999 the court noted that the testimony of the witness Mr I.E., taken by proxy, had been submitted to it. The applicants asked the court not to take the testimony into account. They further requested that a further on-site inspection be conducted in order to find out whether the offence had been committed at night time. Finally, they asked the court to hear the bank clerks as witnesses. On the same day, the court, finding that the evidence contained in the case file sufficiently elucidated the events, dismissed the applicants’ requests. The prosecutor read out his observations on the merits of the case against the applicants. The next hearing was held on 2 September 1999.
At the hearing held on 14 October 1999 the military judge sitting on the bench of the  was replaced by a civilian judge. The court heard the applicants’ final submissions on the merits of the case.

The court further stated that it had not been convinced by the applicants’ denials, having regard to the evidence contained in the case file (i.e.  Mr.I.E’s testimony, photographs of the events, expert reports, incident reports and the reports drawn up following a reconstruction of events) and the applicants’ submissions to the public prosecutor and the Magistrates’ Court.
