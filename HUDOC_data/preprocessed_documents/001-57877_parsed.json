There was no legal obligation for a law graduate to take the oath before seeking enrolment on the list of pupil advocates. The text of the decision refusing the applicant admission to that list had not cited as a reason the fact, mentioned orally on 27 June 1983 (see paragraph 10 above), that the Hasselt Bar already had a large number of lawyers. It had referred solely to the circumstance that the applicant had completed a full career outside the Bar. Yet, in the light of the judgment of the Court of Cassation of 13 May 1952 (see paragraph 36 below), a refusal to enrol of this nature should have been grounded either on the failure to comply with the conditions laid down in Article 428 of the Judicial Code or on the postulant\u2019s unfitness or incompetence to practise as a lawyer.  It followed that the reason given by the Hasselt Bar Council did not justify in law the decision of 17 November 1983, which should therefore be set aside.",

The intervention of the National Bar Association could not have the effect of delaying the proceedings (Article 54 of the Regent\u2019s decree of 23 August 1948 laying down the rules for the procedure in the Administrative Division of the Conseil d\u2019Etat).",

No investigative measure was taken between 24 April 1984, when Mr De Moor\u2019s memorial in reply was filed, and 15 September 1986, on which date the auditeur requested various documents from the Hasselt Bar Council (see paragraphs 17-18 above).

The second period began on 12 October 1987 and ended on 31 October 1991 with the judgment of the Conseil d\u2019Etat (see paragraph 27 above).
