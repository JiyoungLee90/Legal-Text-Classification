State responsibility could however flow from general liability under civil law. Yet, it would be very difficult to establish a causal link between the damage and an unconstitutional failure on the part of the State to enact deregulating legislation. Referring to the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgments nos. Pl. \u00daS 20/05 and I. \u00daS 489/05 (see paragraphs 105 and 118 of Annex II), the court held that as of 2\u00a0June 2006 at the latest the applicant could have brought an action pro futuro. As regards the period between 20\u00a0March 2003 and 2 June 2006 the Municipal Court stated that the applicant should have brought an action against the tenants for forfeiture of the proceeds of unjust enrichment.

First of all, the lower courts had been dismissing such actions between 1\u00a0July 2002 and 31 August 2005, which was the period to which her claim related. Moreover, that judicial practice corresponded to the established case-law of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 167 of Annex II) and the result of any action against the tenant was thus fully foreseeable. Further, the possibility of bringing an action for rent increase had been created by the Constitutional Court only in its landmark judgment no. Pl. \u00daS 20/05 of 2\u00a0June 2006.

In this connection it should be pointed out that when speaking of \u201claw\u201d, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term. It follows that, in addition to being in accordance with the domestic law of the Contracting State, including its Constitution, the legal norms upon which the deprivation of property is based should be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application (see Visti\u0146\u0161 and Perepjolkins, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 96-97).",

Another possibility should not be omitted i.e. that one of the contractual parties would bring the issue of rent to a court; this would concern cases of disagreement over level of rent namely when the landlord would claim the level of rent common in the given locality on the ground that the parties did not agree on the price (\u00a7 671 Civil Code); this would however not be the case of rent increase properly speaking... It is possible to presume that it was not possible to increase rent unilaterally after the repeal of Ordinance no. 06/2002, unless the parties agreed so by mutual consent. This is, however, rather a\u00a0theoretical possibility, owing not only to the limited time available to negotiate such a tenancy agreement but also \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 to the obvious economic disadvantage of such an arrangement for tenants.

By this course of action not only is Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Charter violated, but Article 11 \u00a7 1 of the Charter, which provides protection to ownership rights at the constitutional level, is also violated in consequence of the extension of the purpose of Article 706 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code (i.e. in consequence of a failure to observe Article 4 \u00a7 4 of the Charter). From the constitutionality perspective it is true that not even an established practice is enough to justify an expansive interpretation of grounds for succession to tenancy by which landlords\u2019 ownership rights are restricted beyond the law. If such interpretation is to protect the right to housing, then the Constitutional Court must observe that in its finding of 21 June 2000 no.\u00a0Pl.\u00a0\u00daS\u00a03/2000 it held that although the European Social Charter embodied the right to housing, in case of competition of this right with other rights these clashes need to be measured against the principles of fair balance and proportionality ... In case of a clash between the right to housing, which is a social right (the fact that it arises under international law does not alter this in any way), and the ownership right it is necessary to apply principles that are also valid in respect of other social rights ... It cannot be neglected that the content of social rights \u2013 contrary to the classical fundamental rights \u2013 depends on the wealth of society and on economic development, including fluctuations in the economic cycle. This characteristic, i.e. this condition, often leads to the classification of social rights as constitutional soft law (in contrast to classical fundamental rights). In testing the proportionality and fair balance the \u2018right\u2019 of an actual tenant, who may resort to \u2018feigned\u2019 cohabitation or may move in for a short period of time solely to acquire favourable housing conditions, would not stand in relation to the ownership right. The expedience of the conduct may, for example, be determined from a comparison of the situations in which the person lived prior to his/her move, in relation to which he/she asserts that it was motivated exclusively by the care of a relative. Furthermore, the case-law of the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic satisfies this requirement, when it bases its decision-making on the following opinion: \u2018Although for persons specified in Article 706 \u00a7 1, first sentence of the Civil Code, the condition of a community of consumption is not required for succession to tenancy of a flat, from the point of view of satisfying the condition of there being a common household, it is necessary for the cohabitation in the flat with the tenant to be characterised by permanency. The cohabitation is considered permanent if there are circumstances that can be objectively ascertained and that show that the flat tenant and the person living with him/her in his/her flat agreed upon the intention to cohabitate permanently.\u2019 (cf. decision of 16 January 2001 no.\u00a026\u00a0Cdo\u00a01867/2000, no. 42/2001 in the Collection of Decisions of the Supreme Court). ...",

The Constitution obliges the courts to verify carefully whether the person asserting the satisfaction of conditions for succession to tenancy is not abusing the law to the detriment of the owner. This holds true a fortiori if a short period of only several months has passed from the moment of the beginning of the cohabitation to the death of the original tenant and during this period the original tenant was mainly in hospitals or other health-care facilities. The decisions of the ordinary courts are based on an interpretation of the law that does not observe the constitutional protection of the applicants\u2019 ownership rights and furthermore the ordinary courts reached their conclusions via a course of action in assessing the evidence that is contrary to the rules of a fair trial. ...\u201d",

In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view it is not possible to accept the interpretation according to which until the time of a decision of the court on the enforcement of a decision the relationship between the former landlord and tenant is regulated by Article 712a of the Civil Code, i.e. that until that time the former tenant is obliged to pay to the landlord rent as determined by Decree no. 176/1993, i.e. the \u2018controlled rent\u2019. Such a broad interpretation does not even observe the protection of the right to housing, but it protects housing \u2018for a price subsidised by the owner\u2019 and that is a consideration that is markedly outside a reasonable interpretation of the right to housing. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s opinion such interpretation does not observe the essence and objective of the protection of ownership rights and consequentially it creates an entirely disproportionate restriction, or even negation of ownership rights, which are already inadmissibly restricted during the tenancy by the mere nature and form of the rent regulation, as the Constitutional Court has repeatedly held in the past (cf. judgments nos.

From that moment the former tenant uses the flat without legal entitlement and this relationship is no longer governed by Article\u00a0712a of the Civil Code. After this time the right of the owner ... to the surrender of unjust enrichment comes into existence, while the amount of the unjust enrichment should correspond to the amount of usual rent in the given place and time. The interpretation by the ordinary courts, which does not respect the limits stipulated in Article 4 \u00a7 4 of the Charter, represents a disproportionate restriction of the ownership rights of the flat owner and is therefore contrary to Article 11 \u00a7 1 of the Charter.\u201d",
