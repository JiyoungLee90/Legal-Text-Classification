In this way it embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect. However, that right would be illusory if a \u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants\u2013proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious\u2013without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions. To construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would indeed be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6.

The authorities allocated the relevant property in the first place to the applicants, then to A.L through a lease contract and finally to A.L.\u2019s mother. Furthermore, it would appear that the initiation of separate proceedings was designed to circumvent previous courts\u2019 findings. The domestic courts were aware of the parallel proceedings in that they frequently cross-referred to them (see paragraphs 15, 22 and 26). Most importantly it would have been legally possible to join all the proceedings. The Court considers that better management of the parallel inter-related proceedings would certainly have contributed positively to the speedy clarification of the applicants\u2019 title. For the Court, the existence of prior proceedings raising the same legal issue must be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of the length of the third set of proceedings. ",

The Court recalls that there is a difference between a mere hope of restitution, however understandable that hope may be, and a legitimate expectation, which must be of a nature more concrete than a mere hope and be based on a legal provision or a legal act such as a judicial decision (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v.
