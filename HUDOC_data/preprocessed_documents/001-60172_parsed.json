In assessing whether such a \u201cneed\u201d exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. The Court's task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Jerusalem v. Austria, no.\u00a026958/95, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2001-II, with further references).",

Moreover, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider with regard to a politician acting in his public capacity than in relation to a private individual, as the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must display a greater degree of tolerance. A politician is certainly entitled to have his reputation protected, even when he is not acting in his private capacity, but the requirements of that protection have to be weighed against the interests of the open discussion of political issues (see Lingens v.

However, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds no indication of such deliberate carelessness on the part of the applicant. It rather appears that the applicant's statement, which may certainly be considered polemical, did not on that account constitute a gratuitous personal attack as it was made in a particular political situation in which it contributed to a discussion on subject matters of general interest such as immigration, its control and the legal status of aliens in Austria. Thus, the impugned statement was part of the political discussion initially provoked by Mr Haider and other members of the FP\u00d6 themselves by initiating the above-mentioned opinion poll on these issues.",

The degree of precision for establishing the well-foundedness of a criminal charge by a competent court can hardly be compared to that which ought to be observed by a journalist when expressing his opinion on a matter of public concern, in particular when expressing his opinion in the form of a value judgment. In the Court's opinion, the applicant published what may be considered to have been fair comment on a matter of public interest, that is a value judgment, and the Court disagrees with the qualification of that statement by the Austrian courts. The Court would also point out that it has previously considered similar statements to be value judgments, the truth of which is not susceptible to proof (see Lingens, cited above, p. 28, \u00a7 46, or Wabl, cited above, \u00a7 36).",
