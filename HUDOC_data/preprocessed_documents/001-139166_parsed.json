According to his statement, on 1 March 2004 he was on duty at the training aerodrome together with four second year students: Privates Alekseyev, Kol., G. and Kob. Upon their reporting for sentry duty he reprimanded Privates Alekseyev and Kob. for their untidy appearance, as their collars were dirty, and ordered them to rectify this. They left and returned shortly afterwards with clean collars. The aerodrome has a parking lot for the officers\u2019 private vehicles. The parking lot is only accessible through the aerodrome gates until 10 p.m. and by vehicles indicated in a list approved by the commander of the aerodrome. At night the gates are closed and there is no access to the parking lot. If a car trying to enter the parking lot is not on the list, the sentry on duty must report this to Captain L., who must request permission from the commander to let the vehicle in. At around 7\u00a0a.m. on 2 March 2004 Private Alekseyev, having learned that someone wanted to enter the aerodrome, went to the gates. Once there he let in a man and a woman who had no passes. At the time, Captain L. was having breakfast at the checkpoint. At around 8 a.m. Lieutenant Colonel Zh., the deputy head of the College, called him and asked why strangers had entered the aerodrome grounds and taken away a car. He also asked why the access control policy had not been complied with. Twenty or thirty minutes later Major P., Captain Sh. and Private Alekseyev arrived at the checkpoint. Captain L. and Major P. reprimanded Private Alekseyev for having let strangers, who had taken a car, into the aerodrome without having checked their passes. They spoke to him calmly as, in any event, Captain L. knew that the car in question had been parked there on Lieutenant Colonel Zh.\u2019s request and that it had not been stolen. Captain L. ordered Private Alekseyev to provide a written explanation by the end of the day. Private Alekseyev did not seem to be particularly upset. Captain L. later noticed that a fastener was missing from a lamp that the sentries had been provided with for night duty and ordered Privates Alekseyev and G. to search for it. At around 10:30 a.m. Private Alekseyev returned to the checkpoint. Captain L. asked him whether they had found the fastener. He answered \u201cno\u201d, and took a registration journal to the aerodrome so that the officers on duty could sign it in accordance with standard procedure. At 10:50 a.m. he returned to the checkpoint. Captain L. asked him whether the registration journal had been signed, which was confirmed by Private Alekseyev. Captain L. did not notice that Private Alekseyev was particularly upset about something. Afterwards Private Alekseyev had to take up duties at a control panel. However, later on Captains L. and Sh., who were in the same room, heard noise coming from the adjacent day room. It sounded as if something had fallen on the floor. Captain L. went to see what had happened and saw Private Alekseyev lying on the floor of the day room with a knife covered with blood near his head. He was still breathing but could not answer Captain L.\u2019s questions. Captain L. then shouted to Captain Sh. to come over and call an ambulance. Captain Sh. entered, saw what had happened and rushed to get his car. At the same time Captain L. reported what had happened to Major P. and Lieutenant Colonel Zh. and they instructed him to take Private Alekseyev to the hospital immediately. Several officers took him from the room and placed him in a minivan. He was breathing and moaning but could not explain anything. Captain L. could not understand why Private Alekseyev had done what he had, as during his duty shift he had neither threatened nor otherwise pressured him.",

According to him, Private Alekseyev was a sociable person and had not been having any problems with his studies. On 1 March 2004 when they reported for sentry duty Captain L. reprimanded him and Private Alekseyev for the untidy appearance of their collars and sent them away to attach new ones. As they only had ten minutes to do it they had to be quick, and so they did not talk to each other much. When they returned, Captain I. said that they would be in big trouble after the duty shift was over for breaching the uniform rules. However, Private Kob. was not too upset about it, and Private Alekseyev did not appear to be upset either. During the night shift Private Alekseyev and Private Kob. kept replacing each other. Around 8\u00a0a.m. Private Kob., who was in the day room, heard Captain L. shouting at Private Alekseyev in the adjacent room because he had let a car leave the parking lot, which he should not have done. Captain L. said, in particular, that it was an expensive car and that if it had been stolen this would be considered Private Alekseyev\u2019s fault. Later on at around 9:30 a.m. he heard Captain L. berating Private Alekseyev for having lost a fastener from a lamp. Privates Alekseyev and G. left to search for the fastener, and Captain L. came in and ordered Private Kob. to clean the grounds. While he was clearing away snow, Private Alekseyev came over and told him to put the garbage in the garbage truck and he left to do that. While he was loading the garbage together with three other servicemen, an officer came and said that Private Alekseyev had committed suicide.",

Upon reporting for sentry duty on 1 March 2004 Captain L. ordered Privates Alekseyev and Kob. to change their collars but did so in a respectful manner. At around 9:40 a.m. on 2 March 2004 Captain L. told Private G. that Private Alekseyev had let a car leave the parking lot without having established the identity of the driver and also that they had lost a fastener from a lamp. He said that if they did not find it they would have to pay for the fastener and ordered Privates G. and Alekseyev to search for it. Private Alekseyev seemed upset and told Private G. that he had let a car leave the parking lot even though it had not been driven by its owner and that he would be liable for it. According to Private G., Private Alekseyev seemed to believe that he would have to pay for the car if it appeared that it had been stolen. They returned to the checkpoint without having found the fastener. A couple of officers there told them that if the car had been stolen everyone who had been on duty would have to pay for it, and they would have to pay for the fastener too. Sometime later Private Alekseyev picked up a registration journal from the checkpoint and told Private G. that he had suffered too many misfortunes in one day. At around 11:20 a.m. Private G. again went to the checkpoint where he saw about five people and Private Alekseyev lying on the floor of the day room. Private G. helped to put him in the minivan.",

Lieutenant Colonel Zh. offered to let X. use his parking place, having obtained the consent of the commander of the aerodrome. Ever since the day he had parked his relative\u2019s car at the aerodrome\u2019s parking lot he had continued to inform all the officers on duty that the parking of this vehicle there had been agreed with the commander.

Lieutenant Colonel Zh. was very surprised and, after X. had left, called Captain L. and asked how a stranger could have picked up a car from the parking lot without having provided a pass. He did not ask for any specific checks to be conducted in this respect, but explained that he felt embarrassed as he had told X. that they had a very strict access control policy at the parking lot, but, as it happened, X. had tested it and proved that it was lacking.",

Initial inquiries and investigative actions were carried out within days. That included an inspection of the scene of events; the seizure of certain items, including Private Alekseyev\u2019s bayonet and suicide note; questioning of the main witnesses; and a forensic examination of Private Alekseyev\u2019s body and his bayonet. Taking into account that, after certain additional investigative actions were taken, the final decision to discontinue the investigation was taken on 10\u00a0November\u00a02004, the Court considers that the investigation was sufficiently prompt.",

They took a significant number of investigative actions including questioning of numerous witnesses and conducting pertinent forensic examinations. Notably, the investigating authorities thoroughly examined various theories as to the reasons behind Private Alekseyev\u2019s death, including the possibility of murder or incitement to suicide (cf. Mosendz, cited above, \u00a7 98). From the investigating authorities\u2019 letters it is clear that different lines of inquiry were being pursued (see paragraphs 37 and 60 above). In order to establish whether Private Alekseyev\u2019s death could have been the result of murder the authorities conducted a fingerprint identification test on the bayonet; a handwriting examination of the note found near Private Alekseyev\u2019s body; and a forensic examination of Private Alekseyev\u2019s clothes and personal items and the clothes of Captains L. and Sh., who claimed to have found his body in the day room with a stab wound. They also questioned Captains L. and Sh., including with the use of a polygraph test, and many other witnesses, who stated that they could not think of anybody having a motive to kill Private Alekseyev. They also questioned expert B. so as to establish whether, having supposedly inflicted the wound himself, Private Alekseyev could have removed the knife. Therefore, the investigating authorities\u2019 dismissal of the possibility of a murder having taken place was based on sufficient evidence.",

                                        "content": "132.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time the authorities investigated the possibility of incitement to suicide. Numerous witnesses questioned stated that they had neither information nor reasons to believe that Private Alekseyev had been subjected to any form of pressure while at the College. As for the events of 2 March 2004, and in particular as regards the reprimand concerning having a dirty collar and losing the fastener for the lamp, it is clear from the witness statements that the reaction of Private Alekseyev\u2019s superiors did not go beyond what constituted a legitimate reprimand for breaching the applicable rules. As for the incident with the car, the Court notes that whereas Private Kob. submitted that he had heard Captain L. saying to Private Alekseyev that it was an expensive car and if it had been stolen this would be his fault (see paragraph 14), Captain L. denied ever having told Private Alekseyev that he would have to pay for the car, which was confirmed by a number of the College\u2019s students (see paragraphs 74 and 77). Furthermore, Major P. explained to the investigating authorities that servicemen on duty were not financially liable for cars in the parking lot (see paragraph 72), a fact of which, according to the Government, Private Alekseyev must have been aware. The Court thus cannot but share the domestic authorities\u2019 conclusion that there was no evidence of Private Alekseyev\u2019s having been asked to pay for the car. The Court concedes that Captain L. might have pointed out to Private Alekseyev that should it appear that the car had been stolen it would be his fault in order to raise his awareness of the importance of compliance with the internal rules and to make him feel responsible for their breach. However, this by no means could be considered to have constituted an order to pay the cost of the car\u2019s replacement, especially when Captain L. was well aware that the car had been taken from the parking lot by its owner. The fact that Private Alekseyev believed himself to be financially liable for the car, which is evident from his suicide note and Private G.\u2019s submissions (see paragraphs 10 and 16), appears to have been the result of him having misinterpreted the situation due to the state of anxiety which, according to the results of the psychological/psychiatric expert examination, he was in that morning (see paragraph 50).",

Furthermore, in view of the finding of the psychological/psychiatric expert examination that Private Alekseyev had not been suffering from any chronic disorder, as well as taking into account numerous witness statements to the effect that he did not appear to have any psychological problems, the authorities could not have been aware of the risk of his suicide and thus cannot be found to have been under an obligation to take any measures in this regard.
