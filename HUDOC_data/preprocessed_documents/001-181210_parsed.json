Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, \u00a7\u00a049, Series A no. 24, and, for a more recent reference, B\u00e9dat v. Switzerland ([GC], no. 56925/08, \u00a7 48, 29 March 2016). Those who create, perform, distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society. Hence the obligation on the State not to encroach unduly on their freedom of expression. Artists and those who promote their work are certainly not immune from the possibility of limitations as provided for in paragraph 2 of Article\u00a010. Whoever exercises his or her freedom of expression undertakes, in accordance with the express terms of that paragraph, \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d; their scope will depend on his or her situation and the means he or she uses (see, for example, Vereinigung Bildender K\u00fcnstler v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a068354/01, \u00a7 26, 25\u00a0January 2007).",

More specifically, she fried eggs on the Eternal Glory Memorial, had her actions filmed, prepared a statement explaining her position and posted the video with that statement on the Internet. However, the applicant was criminally prosecuted and convicted only on account of frying eggs over the Eternal Flame, which the domestic courts considered to have amounted to desecration of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, an offence under the Ukrainian Criminal Code. The charge against her concerned neither the subsequent distribution by her of the respective video nor the contents of the rather sarcastic and provocative text accompanying that video (see, in particular, paragraph 7 above).",

However, eternal flames are a long-standing tradition in many cultures and religions most often aimed at commemorating a person or event of national significance, or serving as a symbol of an enduring nature. The one on which the applicant fried eggs is part of a monument commemorating soldiers who gave their lives defending their and the applicant\u2019s country during the Second World War. There were many suitable opportunities for the applicant to express her views or participate in genuine protests in respect of the State\u2019s policy on the use of natural gas or responding to the needs of war veterans, without breaking the criminal law and without insulting the memory of soldiers who perished and the feelings of veterans, whose rights she had ostensibly meant to defend.",

Their performance, as she explained, was aimed at drawing public attention to the incompatibility of the official pathos when it came to remembrance of the Second World War with the miserable situation of surviving war veterans. Together with other participants, she sought to highlight what they perceived as the superfluous nature of an eternal flame which, whilst honouring the sacrifices of those who fell in the service of their country, did little to support war veterans who desperately needed the State\u2019s limited resources. Satura quidem tota nostra est is the famous saying of Quilitian describing the composite nature of this literary genre. Satire extended rapidly to all form of artistic expression mainly in the social and political arena. As Stanis\u0142aw Jerzy Lec wittily mentioned in his Unkempt Thoughts, \u201cthere are times when satire has to restore what pathos has destroyed\u201d. This satirical performance necessarily included filming the process of frying eggs to be later put on the Internet with the relevant commentary. By filming and subsequently disseminating the video, supplemented by the song and text, the applicant and other participants chose to express their criticism through a rude and irreverent satire.",

In the context of freedom of speech, the US Supreme Court noted in the famous case of Texas v. Johnson, when holding that the desecration of the American Flag was protected speech under the First Amendment, that \u201csymbolism is a primitive but effective way of communicating ideas\u201d. In a fast-moving world, it is not surprising that those who wish to highlight a particular cause or voice an opinion would have recourse to those symbolic acts and demonstrations which are likely to gather a greater degree of attention and trigger a wider debate than might have been achievable with more conventional and established forms of protest. The relationship between art and the conveyance of opinions is a complicated one; and whilst art should not be reduced to an opinion, art quite often relates to the expression of an opinion.",

The applicant\u2019s actions, and those of her associates, undoubtedly generated significant controversy and offence among many of those who became aware of it, due perhaps to its perceived bad taste, but their aim was the opposite: in the words of George Orwell, \u201cthe aim of the joke is not to degrade the human being, but to remind him that he is already degraded\u201d.",

Moreover, the domestic courts paid little attention to the applicant\u2019s stated motives given their irrelevance for the legal classification of her actions, although a little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 for restrictions on freedom of expression in the area of political speech or debate required them to give consideration to the structure of the performance as a whole and to conduct a sufficiently careful balancing exercise on the basis of the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law.

In Dmitriyevskiy v.\u00a0Russia (no.\u00a042168/06, \u00a7 117, 3 October 2017), the Court considered that the conviction of a journalist for incitement to hatred or enmity and his two-year suspended sentence and four months\u2019 probation had violated Article\u00a010 as \u201cboth the applicant\u2019s conviction and the severe sanction imposed were capable of producing a chilling effect on the exercise of journalistic freedom of expression\u201d.
