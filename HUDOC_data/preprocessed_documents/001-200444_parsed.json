In that connection, the Court reiterates that the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. It can embrace multiple aspects of the person\u2019s physical and social identity. Article 8 protects in addition a right to personal development and the right to form and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world, including relationships of a professional or business nature. It is, after all, in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant opportunity to develop relationships with the outside world (see Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no.\u00a076639/11, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, \u00a7\u00a7 100-09, \u00a7\u00a7 115-17, 25 September 2018). In the present case it is undisputed that the applicant\u2019s disbarment for professional misconduct prevented him from exercising his profession, and therefore affected a wide range of his professional and other relationships and encroached upon his professional and social reputation. The Court thus considers that the impugned measure had very serious consequences for the applicant and affected his private life to a very significant degree (compare and contrast Denisov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 123 and 125). Article 8 therefore applies.",

France, no.\u00a041841/12, \u00a7\u00a072, 19 April 2018). The specific status of lawyers gives them a central position in the administration of justice as intermediaries between the public and the courts. That special role of lawyers, as independent professionals, in the administration of justice entails a number of duties, particularly with regard to their conduct. Whilst they are subject to restrictions on their professional conduct, which must be discreet, honest and dignified, they also enjoy exclusive rights and privileges that may vary from one jurisdiction to another \u2013 among them, usually, a certain latitude regarding arguments used in court (see Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a013233, ECHR 2015). In addition, professional associations of lawyers play a fundamental role in ensuring the protection of human rights and must therefore be able to act independently, and respect towards professional colleagues and self-regulation of the legal profession are paramount (see Jankauskas v. Lithuania (no. 2), no. 50446/09, \u00a7 78, 27 June 2017).",

The disciplinary commission also refused to hear evidence from other lawyers participating in the above-mentioned hearings before the Nasimi District Court in order to clarify the events leading to the disciplinary complaint against the applicant. The Court also cannot overlook the fact that the Presidents of the disciplinary commission and the ABA openly criticised the applicant for his frequent appearances in the media and his affiliation to an opposition political party, which were not related to the subject matter of the disciplinary proceedings instituted against him.",

The Court considers it necessary to draw attention to Recommendation R (2000) 21 of the Council of Europe\u2019s Committee of Ministers to member States on the freedom of exercise of the profession of lawyer, which clearly states that the principle of proportionality should be respected in determining sanctions for disciplinary offences committed by lawyers (see paragraph 30 above).

They further failed to give any reason as to why a lenient sanction, like suspension from practising for a period of from three months to one year, as provided by Article 22 of the Law, would have not been possible in the present case instead of disbarment, which cannot but be regarded as a harsh sanction, capable of having a chilling effect on the performance by lawyers of their duties as defence counsel (see Igor Kabanov v.

The Court further reiterates that an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, although the document specifying the representative\u2019s services refers to the preparation of the application lodged with the Court, it is clear from the documents in the case file that the applicant was not represented when he lodged his application with the Court. Therefore, the applicant\u2019s application was not prepared by his representative and the amount of work done by the latter before the Court was limited to the preparation of the applicant\u2019s observations and just satisfaction claims. Having regard to these facts, as well as to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award to the applicant the sum of EUR\u00a0850 covering costs under all heads.",
