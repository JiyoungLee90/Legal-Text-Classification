The court first established that the applicant had been continuously resident in Azerbaijan since 1991 and this fact had not been contested by the respondent domestic authorities. It further held that the relevant applicable domestic law in the present case was the wording of Article 5 of the Law on Citizenship as in force before 24 June 2008 which provided that those who had been resident in Azerbaijan before the entry into force of that Law were considered as citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Citing the Court\u2019s case-law, the court also found that the law should comply with the requirements of the quality of law, which should be accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to its effects. In that connection, it held that the SMS\u2019s argument that the applicant could not be considered a citizen because he had only a temporary registration at a place of residence as a student could not be accepted because the Law on Registration at Place of Residence and Stay did not draw a distinction between temporary and permanent registration and cited dormitories among places of residence where a person could reside. The court also held that the applicant had entered into various types of relationships with the Azerbaijani State since 1991 which belonged, by their nature, to the category of the relationships that exist only between a State and its citizens. In particular, it referred to the applicant\u2019s participation in elections, his registration as a reserve military officer by the Ministry of Defence and the existence of a stamp confirming his Azerbaijani citizenship in his Soviet passport. Lastly, the court noted that the specification of the identity card of the Republic of Azerbaijan had been established by a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 2 February 1999 and that until that date an accepted identity document of a citizen of the Republic of Azerbaijan had been a Soviet passport with a stamp confirming Azerbaijani citizenship.",

In particular, they submitted that the applicant had failed to produce all the necessary documents in support of his claim and that the costs and expenses had not actually been incurred, because the amount claimed had not been paid by the applicant. They also submitted that the work done by the applicant\u2019s representative did not correspond to the amount claimed. The Government asked the Court to dismiss the applicant\u2019s claim under this head. Alternatively, they considered that the applicant could claim the total amount of EUR 1,000 under this head.",

Accordingly, in so far as the lawyer is entitled to seek payment of her fees under the contract, the applicant may claim reimbursement of those fees (see Pirali Orujov v. Azerbaijan, no. 8460/07, \u00a7 74, 3 February 2011; Rizvanov v. Azerbaijan, no. 31805/06, \u00a7 89, 17\u00a0April 2012; Malik Babayev v. Azerbaijan, no. 30500/11, \u00a7 97, 1 June 2017; and Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC], no. 72508/13, \u00a7\u00a7 371-72, 28\u00a0November 2017). According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. However, having regard to the amount of legal work necessary in the present case, the Court considers that the amount claimed in respect of legal fees is excessive and should be satisfied only partially. In these circumstances, having regard to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR\u00a01,500, covering costs for the proceedings before the Court, to be paid directly into the bank account of Ms G. Guliyeva, who represented the applicant throughout the proceedings before the Court (see paragraph 2 above).",
