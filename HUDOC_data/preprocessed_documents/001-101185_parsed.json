France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).

It recalls that between 5 May 1998 and 2 October 2001, that is for three years and five months, the proceedings were effectively thwarted, mostly due to unexplained procrastination in carrying out of the medical examination and flawed cooperation between the district court and the forensic examinations bureau. The Court is particularly mindful that the authorities substantially acknowledged the fact of the delays, as evidenced in the correspondence between the district court and the forensic examinations bureau and in the reprimand issued by the supervisory instance in respect of the district court. It recalls in this respect that the principal responsibility for the delay due to the expert opinions rests ultimately with the State (see Capuano v. , 25\u00a0June 1987, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 119). Seeing that the delay associated with the taking of an expert opinion accounted for most of the length of the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case, the Court is of the opinion that the reasonable expedition displayed by the courts subsequently is not sufficient to redress the long period of inactivity.",
