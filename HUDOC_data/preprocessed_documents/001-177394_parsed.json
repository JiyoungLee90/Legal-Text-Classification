He was, thus, in a place within the exclusive knowledge and control of the authorities of the State (see Makeyev v. Russia, no. 13769/04, \u00a7\u00a045, 5\u00a0February 2009, and Rudnichenko v. Ukraine, no. 2775/07, \u00a7 107, 11\u00a0July 2013). However, the Court observes that the trial court, without relying on any particular circumstances, ordered that D.T. give evidence before the K\u0131rklareli Assize Court. In other words, it appears that D.T. was not examined in person owing to the fact that the trial court never summoned him to give evidence before it. Moreover, when the applicant requested the trial court to hear evidence from D.T. in person, it held that D.T\u2019s statement given before another court had been sufficient for a conviction. In so doing, the trial court did not hear D.T. but merely relied on his statements as recorded by the K\u0131rklareli Assize Court. The Court cannot, therefore, conclude that there was a good reason for the non-attendance of D.T. or that the trial court had made all reasonable efforts to secure D.T.\u2019s attendance at the trial.",

Romania, no. 10890/04, \u00a7\u00a040, 4 June 2013; and Asatryan v. Armenia, no. 3571/09, \u00a7 61, 27 April 2017). The assessment of the trustworthiness of a witness is a complex task which usually cannot be achieved by a mere reading of his or her recorded words (see, mutatis mutandis, Lorefice v. Italy, no.\u00a063446/13, \u00a7\u00a043, 29 June 2017). In this connection, the Court notes that the statement of D.T. was not recorded on video, thus the domestic courts and the applicant could not have an opportunity to observe his conduct. In view of what was at stake for the applicant, the Court finds it striking that the domestic courts failed to examine D.T. in person when convicting the applicant and sentencing him to life imprisonment, one of the heaviest penalties in the Turkish criminal law system.",
