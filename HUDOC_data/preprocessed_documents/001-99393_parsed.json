In that case, the Court observed at the outset that the prior restraints in question, which are identical to those in the present case, were not imposed on particular types of news reports or articles, but on the future publication of entire newspapers, whose content was unknown at the time of the national court's decisions. The Court considered that both the content of section 6(5) of Law no. 3713 and the judges' decisions stemmed from the hypothesis that the applicants, whose \u201cguilt\u201d had been established without trial in proceedings from which they had been excluded, would recommit the same kind of offences in the future. The Court therefore found that the preventive effect of the suspension orders had entailed implicit sanctions on the applicants to dissuade them from publishing similar articles or news reports in the future,\u00a0and hinder their professional activities. Noting that less draconian measures could have been envisaged, such as the confiscation of particular issues of the newspapers or restrictions on the publication of specific articles, the Court concluded that, by suspending the publication and distribution of the newspapers, albeit for short periods, the domestic courts largely overstepped the narrow margin of appreciation afforded to them and unjustifiably restricted the essential role of the press as a public watchdog in a democratic society. Finally, the Court held that the practice of banning the future publication of entire periodicals on the basis of section 6(5) of Law no.\u00a03713 went beyond any notion of \u201cnecessary\u201d restraint in a democratic society and, instead, amounted to censorship (see \u00dcrper and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 42-45).",

They further contended under Article 13 of the Convention that they had not had a domestic remedy by which to challenge the lawfulness of the national court decisions, as their objections to the suspension orders had been dismissed without trial. The applicants also complained under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention that these orders had violated their right to be presumed innocent, since the national courts had held that criminal offences had been committed through the publication of news reports and articles in the newspapers for which they had been responsible. The applicants further submitted under Article 7 of the Convention that the decisions to suspend the publication and distribution of the newspapers amounted to a \u201cpenalty\u201d without any legal basis. Lastly, they complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that the decisions to suspend the publication of Yedinci G\u00fcn and Toplumsal Demokrasi had constituted an unjustified interference with their right to property.",
