As regards the request for the investigation to be resumed, the court found that the investigators had questioned several witnesses and obtained information on Abdula Edilov\u2019s eventual arrest and detention from a number of law-enforcement authorities, including the FSB department in the Urus-Martanovskiy District. The investigation had not established who was responsible for the abduction of Abdula Edilov and it had been suspended on numerous occasions on that ground, the latest such decision being dated 28 April 2006. The court stressed, however, that the investigation had not taken all possible steps to establish Abdula Edilov\u2019s whereabouts and identify his abductors. In particular, the investigators had failed to identify and question the officers of the federal forces who had been on duty at the checkpoint over the Argunskiy canal on the eastern outskirts of Goyty in August 2001.
