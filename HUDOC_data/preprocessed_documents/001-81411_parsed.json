In so far as the applicant's complaint may be understood to concern the assessment of evidence and the result of the proceedings before the domestic courts, the Court reiterates that it is for the national courts to establish and assess the facts, to determine the probative value of evidence and to apply the national law. It is not the function of the Court to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, 29, ECHR 1999I). Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see Schenk v. Switzerland, judgment of 12 July 1988, Series A no. 140, p.\u00a029, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46).",

During the time which falls within its competence ratione temporis, the case was reconsidered on five occasions. The domestic courts thus cannot be said to have been inactive. However, although the Court is not in a position to analyse the quality of the case-law of the domestic courts, it considers that, since the remittal of cases for re-examination is usually ordered as a result of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see Pavlyulynets v. , no. 70767/01, \u00a7\u00a051, 6 September 2005; Wierciszewska v.
