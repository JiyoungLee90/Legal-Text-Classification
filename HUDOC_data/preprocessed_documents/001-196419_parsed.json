Nor could it be said that the case had been examined in a hurry in that it focussed solely on whether or not the applicant had been abroad without permission. Although it was unfortunate that the members of the Board who investigated, heard and established facts were also police officers answerable to the CoP, these persons had taken an oath of impartiality before the Attorney General in respect of the specific appointments. The court noted that these were persons who usually would have a lot of experience and who were trusted by the members of the Police Force. As to the PSC, the court held that, although the Constitution provided that the PSC was not obliged to give anyone before it a fair hearing and that the exercise of its functions was not questionable before any court, domestic caselaw had established that the PSC immunity from judicial action was not absolute and that the PSC had a duty to comply with procedural rules and observe the principles of natural justice, and they could not act ultra vires. The caselaw of the Court had also evolved, opening the applicability of Article 6 to police officers in certain cases. However, in the light of the principles established in Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no.\u00a063235/00, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2007II), the present cases did not fulfil the two criteria necessary to make Article\u00a06 applicable. Indeed the charges issued against the applicant called into question \u201cthat special bond of trust and loyalty\u201d and the PSC\u2019s actions were not subject to any review, thus there was no violation of Article 6.",

In particular prior authorisation was necessary to safeguard the reputation of the Police Force which was to keep out of public debate so to be consonant with what the Police Force represented. While it was not necessary to examine the content of the interview, a prima\u00a0facie assessment of such content showed that it had not been consonant with the role of a police officer. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, when the applicant went to Syria to bring back the kidnapped child without the CoP\u2019s permission and while she was still a police officer, she had created a delicate situation which could have had repercussions at an international level.

In brief, in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant\u2019s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest. The mere fact that the applicant is in a sector or department which participates in the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civilservant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article\u00a06 for the civil servant is justified (\u00a7 62).",

In particular, it appears that those officers had no specific legal training \u2013 indeed it transpires from the minutes of the hearing that the legal issues raised by the applicant and her representative had been sent to a lawyer, and the Board\u2019s decision to dismiss those legal arguments was solely based on the lawyer\u2019s views (see paragraph 17 above).
