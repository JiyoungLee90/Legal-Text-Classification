The case originated in an application (no. 2433/12) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Ali Haydar Varhan (“the applicant”), on 22 November 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Ocak, a lawyer practising in Adıyaman. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 9 September 2013 the complaint concerning the alleged breach of the applicant’s right to freedom of expression was communicated to the Government, and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1985 and lives in Adıyaman.
On 21 March 2007 the applicant participated in the Newroz (Kurdish New Year) celebrations held in Malatya.
On an unspecified date the Malatya public prosecutor filed an indictment charging the applicant and twenty other people with disseminating propaganda in favour of the PKK under section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713). The public prosecutor claimed that the applicant had waved a green, yellow and red flag symbolising the PKK.
On 6 March 2008 the Malatya Assize Court convicted all of the accused as charged, including the applicant. On the basis of evidence in the case file, the court found it established that one of the accused, Ms N.K., had made a press statement, and the other accused, including the applicant, had chanted slogans in favour of the PKK and its leader. The court also noted that the accused had waved the so-called flag of the PKK. The applicant was sentenced to ten months’ imprisonment.
On 31 May 2011 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 6 March 2008.
On 21 December 2011 the applicant started serving his prison sentence.
On 12 July 2012 the Malatya Assize Court ordered the applicant’s release from prison in accordance with Law no. 6352, which had entered into force on 5 July 2012 and had amended certain provisions of Law no. 3713.
On 12 December 2012 the Malatya Assize Court decided to suspend the execution of the applicant’s prison sentence in accordance with provisional section 1 of Law no. 6352. The suspension was for a period of three years, on the condition that he did not commit a terrorism-related offence during that period.
The relevant domestic law applicable at the material time can be found in Belge v. Turkey (no. 50171/09, § 19, 6 December 2016).
In particular, at the time of the events giving rise to the present application, section 7(2) of Law no. 3713 read as follows:
“Any person who disseminates propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation shall be liable to [serve] a term of imprisonment of one to five years ...”
