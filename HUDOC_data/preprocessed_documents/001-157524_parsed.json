The court noted that the original administrative decision had been given before 1 September 2004. On that date the Law of 17 June 2004 amending the Civil Code had entered into force. This law had fundamentally changed the legal framework concerning civil liability of the State Treasury. It abrogated, inter alia, Article\u00a0160 of the Code of Administrative Procedure and enacted Article 417 1 of the Civil Code (see paragraphs 22-24 below). The court was of the view that it was the latter provision which should be applied to the circumstances of the case. Under this provision, read together with the provisions of the Civil Code on liability in tort, the prescription period started to run only when the decision of 30 December 2005, confirming the unlawfulness of the original expropriation decision, became final.

However, it was of the view that the provisions concerning the State\u2019s civil liability in tort should have been interpreted differently by the first-instance court, in particular as to the determination of the prescription period. The court observed that under the communist regime it was practically impossible, essentially for political reasons, to vindicate claims originating in unlawful administrative decisions or to seek compensation from the State Treasury for damage in tort caused by such decisions. The earliest date on which it was possible to do so was 4 June 1989, when the first partially free parliamentary elections were held in Poland. It was from that date that the prescription period of ten years provided for by Article 442 of the Civil Code started to run. The applicants should have availed themselves of the available remedy, namely they should have obtained a decision declaring the original expropriation decision unlawful prior to 4 June 1999 when the ten-year prescription period came to an end.",

It noted that the manner in which the provisions concerning the State\u2019s liability in tort for unlawful administrative decisions were interpreted had given rise to serious difficulties and differences of opinion in judicial practice. It disagreed with the view expressed in certain judicial decisions that the ten-year prescription period for bringing compensation claims before the courts had started to run when the unlawful decision had been given, but its running was subsequently stayed until 4\u00a0June 1989. The Regional Court was of the view that the threeyear prescription period, referred to in the former Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, was applicable to the circumstances of the case.

However, once such a solution has been adopted by a State, it must be implemented with reasonable clarity and coherence, in order to avoid, as far as possible, legal uncertainty and ambiguity for individuals concerned by the measures to implement it. In that context, it should be stressed that uncertainty, whether it is legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities,is an important factor to be taken into account in assessing a State\u2019s conduct (see Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7 151; Tunnel Report Limited v. France, no.\u00a027940/07, \u00a7\u00a039, 18\u00a0November 2010; Zolotas v. Greece (no. 2), no. 66610/09, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR\u00a02013 (extracts); and Bitt\u00f3 and Others v.

The concept of quality of law covers also the question of its foreseeability. The mere fact that a legal provision is capable of more than one construction does not mean that it fails to meet the requirement of foreseeability for the purposes of the Convention. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain, taking into account the changes in everyday practice (see Gorzelik and Others v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a044158/98, \u00a7 65, 17 February 2004). It is primarily for the national authorities to interpret and apply domestic law. However, the Court is required to verify whether the way in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the principles of the Convention, as interpreted in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law (see, among many other authorities, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0190 and 191, ECHR 2006V).",

In the present case the applicants were successful in having the expropriation decision declared null and void. It was open to them later to have recourse to judicial proceedings with a view to vindicating their compensation claim. Their case was examined at two levels of jurisdiction. There is no indication that they were prevented from submitting their evidence and developing legal arguments before the courts. Hence, the domestic law provided a framework of a judicial character by which the applicants could seek to have their claim arising from the old expropriation vindicated.",

Their case ultimately failed as the Warsaw Court of Appeal overturned the first-instance judgment and dismissed their claim. It held that the provisions concerning the State\u2019s liability in tort should have been interpreted differently by the first-instance court. That court held that the tenyear prescription period for seeking compensation for damage originating in unlawful administrative decisions had started to run from 4\u00a0June 1989 onwards, when the first partially free parliamentary elections were held in Poland. The court considered that the applicants should have availed themselves of the appropriate remedies prior to 4 June 1999.

In January 2010 the President of the Supreme Court requested the Civil Chamber of that Court to adopt a resolution with a view to harmonizing the relevant judicial practice. In response to that request, the seven-judge bench of that Chamber acknowledged the importance of the issues involved, and held that a resolution of the Chamber sitting as a full bench was called for. Ultimately the Civil Chamber, having acknowledged the divergences in judicial practice adopted a resolution and held that the three-year time-limit within which to claim compensation for damage caused by an unlawful administrative decision given prior to 1 September 2004 started to run from the date of the correcting decision.",

In that case it found a breach of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention on account of the fact that the applicants had initially sued for damages caused by a decision declared null and void an entity of public administration which subsequently, under evolving case-law of the domestic courts, lost its locus standi. As a result, their claim was unsuccessful. The Court emphasised that when a public entity was liable for damages, the State\u2019s positive obligation to facilitate identification of the correct defendant was all the more important. It concluded that shifting the duty of identifying the competent authority to be sued to the applicants and depriving them of compensation on this basis failed to strike a fair balance between the public interest and the applicants\u2019 rights.",

The Court is of the view that while legal uncertainty is certainly to be avoided, the degree to which it affects the success of a civil claim is an important factor for the Court to decide whether the circumstances of a case were Convention-compliant. In the present case the degree of uncertainty related to the subtle aspects of the substance of the case. The Court is prepared to accept that it did not concern fundamental procedural aspects of the case and was therefore not such as to entail per se a breach of the Convention.",
