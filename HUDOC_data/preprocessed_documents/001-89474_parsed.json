Therefore, in the reasoning part of its decision, the Court of Appeal considered, in line with the findings of the first-instance court, that the State had no valid title and that therefore the applicants had never lost their right of property.

Accordingly, the obligation to enforce a court decision is not limited to its operative part, as its merits must simultaneously be respected and applied (see Zazanis and Others v. Greece, no.\u00a068138/01, \u00a7\u00a036, 18 November 2004).
