The statements of the taxi driver and of the applicant\u2019s friend could not be accepted because they were not eyewitnesses to the beating but rather knew about the applicant\u2019s alleged ill-treatment at the hands of police from what the applicant had told them. The police officers argued that it was impossible for them to ill-treat the applicant in their office because the Minister\u2019s office was one floor above and if there had been shouts the Minister or other persons from the Ministry\u2019s top echelons would have heard. Moreover, they did not have rubber truncheons in their office and the offence with which the applicant had been charged was not so serious as to justify ill-treating him. A colleague of the police officers also declared that the applicant was not ill-treated and that, during questioning, the door of the office was always open. The applicant appealed against this decision and argued that it was unlawful because the prosecutor had failed to examine objectively and completely all the circumstances of the case. The applicant submitted that the prosecutor had failed to notice that the police officers had failed to draw up a record of his detention and questioning of 21 December 2004.",

By its final judgment the Supreme Court of Justice found that there was sufficient evidence to support the applicant\u2019s allegations of torture, that the Prosecutor Office\u2019s investigation had been inefficient and that therefore there had been a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights guaranteed by Article\u00a03 of the Convention.

Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 23, Series A no. 32). It clearly appears from the facts of the case that the applicant made a criminal complaint against the police officers under the provisions of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above).

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. As with an investigation under Article 2, such investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2000-IV).",

The Court recalls other decisions by the domestic courts to compensate victims of Article\u00a03 breaches, such as the 2004 judgment in Drugalev v. the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Finance (see Holomiov v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a030649/05, \u00a7\u00a7 88, 106 and 107, 7 November 2006). However, such decisions, encouraging as they may seem, do not appear to be part of a consistent policy of the domestic courts offering real remedies against breaches of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court considers, therefore that the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention cannot be declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and accordingly the Government\u2019s objection must be dismissed.",

The doctor who examined him notified the police of the applicant\u2019s injuries and his allegations that they had been caused by police ill-treatment. In such circumstances, the onus was on the authorities to follow-up the concerns raised in the hospital\u2019s letter. However, no response at all was given to the letter. The Prosecutor\u2019s Office also failed to react even when it was approached personally by the applicant on 3 September 2005. After 15\u00a0December 2005, when an investigation was finally launched, the prosecutors failed to inquire as to the reason why the two accused police officers had omitted to make any entries in the registration log concerning the applicant\u2019s questioning on 21 December 2004. On 15 January 2006 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint without even questioning the applicant, nor for that matter any other witnesses. The conclusion was that his aim was to tamper with the criminal investigation against him, a conclusion which remained predominant until the end of the investigation. It is not without interest to note that in spite of reaching such a conclusion, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office did not make any analysis of whether the applicant had any incentive to make false accusations against the two police officers or whether the applicant could have benefited from such accusations in circumstances in which no confession was obtained on 21\u00a0December 2004 and the two accused police officers did not work on his case after that date.",
