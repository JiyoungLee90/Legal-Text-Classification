On 21 September 2006 she made an application for asylum, in the course of which she complained, inter alia, that she had been forced to work for the K\u00a0family without remuneration. Furthermore, in April 2007 the applicant\u2019s solicitor wrote to the police and asked that they investigate her case.

The Court does not consider that the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning her treatment by S. and M. were inherently implausible. Indeed, it notes that the circumstances which she described were remarkably similar to the facts of the Siliadin case, the only notable differences being that the applicant was older than the applicant in Siliadin and that it was an agent \u2013 and not her \u201cemployers\u201d \u2013 who she claimed were responsible for the treatment contrary to Article 4 of the Convention. Although the Government have submitted that the applicant\u2019s account was not in fact credible, the Court observes that this was a conclusion reached following further investigation of her complaints. Indeed, the fact that the domestic authorities conducted any investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaints strongly indicates that, at least on their face, they were not inherently implausible. Consequently, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaints did give rise to a credible suspicion that she had been held in conditions of domestic servitude, which in turn placed the domestic authorities under an obligation to investigate those complaints.",

Finally, on 12 August 2009 the police wrote to the applicant\u2019s solicitor, indicating that her case did not appear to constitute an offence of trafficking for the purposes of exploitation and that they were \u201cnot aware of any specific offence of forced labour or servitude\u201d.",

In particular, it observes that the investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaints was carried out by a specialist trafficking unit and while investigators occasionally referred to slavery, forced labour and domestic servitude it is clear that at all times their focus was on the offence enshrined in section 4 of the 2004 Act. As indicated by the Aire Centre and the Equality and Human Rights Commission in their third party interventions, domestic servitude is a specific offence, distinct from trafficking and exploitation, which involves a complex set of dynamics, involving both overt and more subtle forms of coercion, to force compliance. A thorough investigation into complaints of such conduct therefore requires an understanding of the many subtle ways an individual can fall under the control of another. In the present case, the Court considers that due to the absence of a specific offence of domestic servitude, the domestic authorities were unable to give due weight to these factors. In particular, the Court is concerned by the fact that during the course of the investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaints, no attempt appears to have been made to interview S. despite the gravity of the offence he was alleged to have committed (see, by way of comparison, M. and Others v. Italy and , no. 40020/03, \u00a7\u00a7 104 - 107, 31 July 2012). For the Court, the lacuna in domestic law at the time may explain this omission, together with the fact that no apparent weight was attributed to the applicant\u2019s allegations that her passport had been taken from her, that S. had not kept her wages for her as agreed, and that she was explicitly and implicitly threatened with denunciation to the immigration authorities, even though these factors were among those identified by the ILO as indicators of forced labour.",
