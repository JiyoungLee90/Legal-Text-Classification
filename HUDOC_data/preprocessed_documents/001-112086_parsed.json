In 1992 in the public sector \u2013 where the legal positions of both the employers and the employees are determined by their dependence on the State budget \u2013 public-law regulations, basically corresponding to the characteristics of the closed public service system, were introduced. The legal status of the individuals who perform work in the service of the State was \u2013 according to the specific features of the activities performed \u2013 governed by the legislature in separate Acts of Parliament. ... The basic feature of the closed public service system is that the content of the public service relationship and the rights and duties of the subjects of the legal relationship are governed not by the parties\u2019 agreement but by statutes, by law. ... The content of the public service relationship is regulated under the law, regard being had to the fact that public servants carry out the tasks of the State, and, in performing their tasks, they exercise public powers, consequently \u2013 compared to other employees \u2013 additional statutory requirements must be imposed on them. The activity of public servants must serve the interest of the public, it must be professional, impartial, devoid of influence and bias, therefore public servants must meet up-to-date and high-standard professional requirements, must bear particular responsibility for their work and are subject to strict conflict-of-interest rules; however, the incomes earned in the public service remain below the wages that can be obtained in the private sector, since the source of public servants\u2019 remuneration is the State budget. The starting point for the closed public service system ... is that \u00ab\u00a0additional requirements \u2013 compliance with which may and must be demanded from persons engaged in public service \u2013 may only be imposed in return for additional entitlements \u00bb. Such additional entitlements include the career system regulated and the salary guaranteed in an Act of Parliament, the predictable and safe \u2018public service life career\u2019 system and the additional allowances. A basic characteristic of the closed public service system is the stability of public service relationship, namely that a public servant may be removed from office only where the conditions specified in an Act of Parliament are met. While until the 1980s the public service systems of various States were characterised by the gradual extension of the closed public service system, since then a strongly critical approach to the closed systems has become more and more dominant. As a consequence, in almost all European States, public service reform processes have been launched in order to enhance the efficiency, performance and standards of the public administration. The direction of the reforms is to loosen the rigidity of the closed system, and to bring it closer to the regulation of private sector labour relations. The method generally applied for the loosening of the rigidity of the closed system is the loosening of the previously strictly interpreted concept of \u2018non-dismissibility\u2019 and the widening of the grounds of dismissal.",

It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 147, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII).",

In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to \u201cguarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective\u201d and that the maintaining in the domestic law of the right to bring a labour-law claim does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the right to access to a court, if that possibility is devoid of any substance and thus of any prospect of success (see, mutatis mutandis, Imbrioscia v.

In Vilho Eskelinen and Others, the Court extended this protection, in principle, to all civil servants, the exception being those cases where national law does not confer a right of access to the court to a category of civil servants and such exclusion of the Convention protection is justified. While the Court gave a list of non-exhaustive examples of \u201cordinary labour disputes\u201d to which Article 6 should in principle apply, it did not exclude other labour-related proceedings from applicability of that article. Later, the Court held that the approach developed in the case of Vilho Eskelinen and Others also applied to access to a public office and termination of public office, assessing issues such as the unfairness of proceedings concerning removal from office, or the excessive overall length of the dismissal proceedings. This broad protection afforded to employees by Article 6 was complemented by other Articles. Termination of employment has also been assessed from the perspective of other Convention rights and freedoms, such as the freedom to hold religious beliefs and freedom of expression.",

This provision has been accepted by 24 Member States of the Council of Europe, but not by .

The Court has already established that a social right can legitimately be derived from a Convention provision, even when such a right is foreseen in the European Social Charter and the Contracting Party is not bound by the relevant provision of the Charter. This jurisprudence is also valid in the case of the right of all workers not to have their employment terminated without valid reasons for such termination and the concomitant right to appeal the decision of termination of employment to an impartial body.",

The right of appeal against any termination of employment to an independent body requires that this body has the powers to verify the factual and legal aspects of the appealed decision and to remedy it, if it is found illegal.",

It is not acceptable for one and the same State to advocate a double standard on termination of employment in respect of different international organisations, claiming to be held to a lower standard vis-\u00e0-vis the Council of Europe when it is already subject to a more demanding standard vis-\u00e0-vis the United Nations and the European Union.",
