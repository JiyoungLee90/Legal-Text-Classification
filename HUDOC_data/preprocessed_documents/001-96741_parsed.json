The Court notes that both applications concerned an environmental permit which was needed for the restructuring works of the service station. In the first application the applicants applied for an environmental permit for enlarging the storage capacity of liquid fuel, in the second one they wanted to reduce the said storage capacity. The Court finds this difference, however, irrelevant as the environmental permit was needed in any event to perform restructuring works on the site, which was a precondition for that the service station could continue functioning.
