It therefore finds that the applicant's imprisonment in default amounted to criminal punishment and that the applicant had previously been subjected to criminal punishment for both the drug-trafficking offence (by the prison sentence \u2013 and the order excluding him from French territory) and the customs offence of illegally importing goods (by the customs fine).

However, having regard to both Gradinger and Oliveira, the Court finds that there has been no violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 in the instant case. It further notes \u2013 although the point was not taken by the Government \u2013 that  issued a reservation on ratifying Protocol No. 7 declaring that it agreed to Article 4 solely in cases that fell within the jurisdiction of the French criminal courts. As the Court accepted in Jamil, cited above, customs fines are hybrid in nature and may, therefore, come within the scope of that reservation.

In the instant case, the Criminal Court had reduced the amount of the fine, having imposed a fine of FRF 400,000 instead of the sum of FRF 1,070,000 to FRF 2,140,000 sought by the customs authorities. Furthermore, Article 388 of the Customs Code left it to the criminal court to decide whether or not the defendant should remain in custody in default of payment.

At all events, they were complied with before the criminal court which imposed the order for imprisonment in default. The applicant has not suggested the contrary and that is true also of the issue of the reasoning in the judgment. The applicant has in fact confused that judgment and the decision of the court to keep him in custody at the end of his main custodial sentence in order to serve the term of imprisonment in default (Article 388 of the Customs Code). The length of the imprisonment in default is, it is true, set by statute, by reference to the amount of the customs fine (see Article 706-31 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). However, the case-law of the Convention institutions on Articles 6 or 7 contains no authority in which a legislature has been censured for laying down a fixed sentence or the courts required to \u201cadapt\u201d such a sentence to the circumstances of the case, independently of the amount of the customs fine imposed.
