On 1 July 1997 the total number of disability pension recipients was 689. This included Fund members who had not become entitled to a disability pension until after the commencement of the 1992 Act in June 1992. The cases of the aforementioned 336 persons receiving disability pensions from the Fund, who had acquired their entitlement before that time and were still drawing disability pensions in 1996, were reviewed in late 1996 and early 1997 in the light of their capacity for work in general. Altogether, 104 members of this group of disability pensioners had their benefits reduced in July 1997 as a result of the new rules on disability assessment under the 1992 Act. In the case of 54 Fund members, including the applicant, the disability rating for work in general did not reach the level of 35% required under the Act to retain entitlement to disability benefit, and so benefit payments were discontinued.

In order to tackle this large deficit, the Fund\u2019s Board asked for amendments to be made to the Act under which the Fund operated. It is clear that the reduction of the pension rights that resulted from Law no. 44/1992 was based on relevant considerations. Even though that Act was repealed by Law no. 94/1994, this does not change the fact that the appellant\u2019s legal position had already been determined by Law no. 44/1992.

They pointed out that at no time was the applicant\u2019s right unconditional in the way he maintained, and the 1974 Act gave him no grounds for harbouring any such expectations. Even if no amendments had been made to that Act, the applicant had already become ineligible to receive a pension, having regard to the terms of the condition stated in the final sentence of section 13(1). This clearly stated that no person was entitled to a disability pension if he received equally high wages for another job which granted pension rights, and that the pension could never be higher than the equivalent of the loss of income demonstrably incurred by the Fund member as a result of his disability. During the period until 1 July 1997 when it was making pension payments to him, the Seamen\u2019s Pension Fund had no information about the applicant\u2019s employment earnings, despite pension beneficiaries\u2019 duty under section\u00a013(4) of the Act to provide such information. At the time when the Act was in force, the Pension Fund did not actively monitor whether disability pensioners received wages from paid employment at the same time as drawing compensation payments; for example, disability pensioners were not required to submit tax returns to the Fund. In all likelihood, the applicant\u2019s right to receive compensation had actually expired before 1 July 1997; judging by the information submitted by the applicant regarding his income as a head of department at Samskip after 1 July 1997 (see his letter to the Court dated 12 June 2003), it could be stated with certainty that he was no longer entitled after that date.",

The argument was not reviewed by the national courts, but was apparently developed for the first time at the merits stage of the proceedings under the Convention and was rejected by the applicant. The Court is not convinced by these submissions, which are based on facts that are both uncertain and unclear, and will not attach any weight to them in its examination of the case. In any event, whether the applicant, as argued by the Government, could have forfeited his entitlement to a disability pension under a different legal ground is a matter that falls outside the scope of the case, which concerns the effects of the legislative amendments that came into force on 1 July 1997.",

The above-mentioned legitimate concerns about the need to resolve the Fund\u2019s financial difficulties seem hard to reconcile with the fact that after 1 July 1997 the vast majority of the 689 disability pensioners continued to receive disability benefits at the same level as before the adoption of the new rules, whereas only a small minority of disability pensioners had to bear the most drastic measure of all, namely the total loss of their pension entitlements. In the Court\u2019s view, although changes made to pension entitlements may legitimately take into account the pension holders\u2019 needs, the above differential treatment in itself suggests that the impugned measure was unjustified for the purposes of Article 14 of the Convention, which consideration must carry great weight in the assessment of the proportionality issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",
