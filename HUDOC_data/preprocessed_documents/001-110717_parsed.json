The police indicated that their advice from the Crown Prosecution Service was that there could be no charge at that point in time, given the impossibility of interviewing the applicant.

The action in negligence therefore failed on causation and loss. In any event, any loss had been absolutely minimal. A delay of 31\u00a0hours in the hospitalisation of the applicant could only lead to minimal damages. The judge also rejected the claim based on the Human Rights Act on the grounds that Dr M. could not be seen as a public authority for the purposes of the Act, and that the situation did not meet the minimum level of severity inherent in Article 3 of the Convention. The applicant\u2019s claim for damages based on Article 8 of the Convention was also dismissed, the judge finding that this was not an exceptional case in which compensation would be justified. The claim for misfeasance in public office could only succeed if the applicant could show complete and reckless disregard on the part of the defendant, which he had not done.",

He maintained that while the Mental Health Act 1983 allowed up to 72 hours\u2019 detention, it was only in truly exceptional cases that anything close to this duration should be accepted. Good professional practice demanded that a person detained under that legislation should be moved to a suitable facility as soon as possible, and this was reflected in the official guidance on the use of the section 136 power.

He stressed that his mental illness had left him in a highly vulnerable state at the time, demanding a prompt response. It was beside the point for the Government to say that the applicant had at least been safe while at the police station. In reality, he had been in dire need of psychiatric care, which was not provided until the fourth day. There could be no justification for situations that were incompatible with human dignity. Issues such as the limited availability of hospital beds or nursing staff, or the expectation that he would be charged by the police over the assault on his aunt, were irrelevant. The authorities had created the situation by arresting him, and should bear responsibility for the consequences on him. His own behaviour during the period at the police station should not be seen as hindering the authorities\u2019 endeavours to arrange for his treatment, but as evidence of the urgency of the case. Although he may not have been able to rationally perceive the nature of his situation at the time, all of the medical professionals who examined him noted that he was in an agitated and anguished state. He had also been in an unhygienic and undignified state. As for food and water, the custody record showed that his intake during the last 40 hours in the police station had been inadequate.

Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, \u00a7 201, 17 January 2012). It is the consistent case-law of the Court that in order to come within the scope of the interdiction contained in Article 3 the treatment inflicted on or endured by the victim must reach a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level of severity is a relative one, depending on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (Price v. the , no. 33394/96, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2001VII). As for the concept of degrading treatment, the Court has in its case-law described it as treatment such as to arouse feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating or debasing the victim and possibly breaking their physical or moral resistance (see Keenan v. the , no. 27229/95, ECHR 2001-III, \u00a7 110). In considering whether a punishment or treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3. However, the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (Ramirez Sanchez v. France [GC], no. 59450/00, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2006IX; see also Price, cited above, \u00a7 30).",

Given that the arrest occurred during the night, and the real possibility at the outset of serious criminal charges being brought against him, the initial removal of the applicant to a police cell, a designated place of safety under the 1983 Act, is not open to criticism.

It is clear that the police endeavoured continuously to bring this about. In the meantime, as the Government have observed, the cell in which the applicant was detained, and kept under observation, was a place of relative physical safety for him.

His expectation until the middle of the third day that the applicant would become subject to the criminal process does not appear to the Court to be groundless or otherwise unreasonable.",

The Court can agree with this, discerning no real inadequacy, let alone neglect, on the part of the police in this respect. They offered the applicant meals and drinks at intervals. Although the police record states that he did not consume all of these, the Court does not consider this to raise any distinct or additional issue.",

The Court considers that this situation, which persisted until he was at last transferred to Reaside early on the fourth day, diminished excessively his fundamental human dignity. It\u00a0refers here to the opinion of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture, cited above (see \u00a7 30 above). It is of some significance that the applicant\u2019s situation failed to respect both best medical practice in  as well as the maximum time-limit set by Parliament in the relevant legislation.

The situation appears to have arisen essentially out of difficulties of co-ordination between the relevant authorities when suddenly confronted with an urgent mental health case. The Government have indicated that this incident led to an improvement in the standing arrangements between the police and the health authorities to respond more rapidly in such circumstances. While welcoming these improvements, the Court is required to deal with the treatment to which the applicant was subjected. Even though there was no intention to humiliate or debase him, the Court finds that the conditions which the applicant was required to endure were an affront to human dignity and reached the threshold of degrading treatment for the purposes of Article 3.",

In other words, they had mischaracterised his claim. As a consequence, the domestic courts had not been in a position to provide him with a remedy. There had been no full hearing of the case even though the County Court had acknowledged that it was arguable.
