In this connection, the Court reiterates that while the applicant is entitled to make use of his procedural rights, he must bear the consequences when it leads to delays (see, Malicka-W\u0105sowska v. Poland, (dec.), no.\u00a041413/98, 5\u00a0April 2001). Nevertheless, the Court notes that the total period during which the proceedings were stayed on the grounds of the applicant\u2019s failure to pay the costs was about ten months. In the light of the fact that the overall length of the proceedings, taken into consideration by the Court was ten years and two months, the Court is of the view that the applicant cannot bear the responsibility for the totality of the delay.
