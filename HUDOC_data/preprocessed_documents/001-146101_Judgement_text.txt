The case originated in ten applications against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by ten British nationals (see list appended).
The applicants were represented by Taylor & Kelly, a firm of solicitors based in Coatbridge. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
The applicants alleged in particular that, as convicted prisoners, they were ineligible to vote in the elections to the European Parliament on 4 June 2009.
On 27 May 2014 these complaints were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the applications were declared inadmissible.
Written observations were received from the respondent Government and just satisfaction claims were received from the applicants.
The applicants were all incarcerated at the relevant time following criminal convictions. The case-file does not disclose either the offences of which they were convicted or the lengths of the sentences of imprisonment imposed on them. They were automatically prevented from voting, pursuant to primary legislation, in the elections to the European Parliament held on 4 June 2009.
The relevant domestic law and practice is set out in the Court’s judgments in Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, ECHR 2005IX; and Greens and M.T. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 60041/08 and 60054/08, ECHR 2010 (extracts). Further developments since the Greens and M.T. judgment are set out in the Court’s decision in McLean and Cole v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 12626/13 and 2522/12, 11 June 2013.
On 18 December 2013 the United Kingdom Parliament’s Joint Committee on the Draft Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Bill published its report. It made the following recommendation:
“We recommend that the Government bring forward a Bill, at the start of the 2014-15 session of Parliament, to give legislative effect to the following conclusions:
That all prisoners serving sentences of 12 months or less should be entitled to vote in all UK parliamentary, local and European elections;
...
That prisoners should be entitled to apply, 6 months before their scheduled release date, to be registered to vote in the constituency into which they are due to be released.”
