The courts held so because they considered that a judgment debtor was not a party to such proceedings and was thus unaware that a judgment creditor had undertaken steps to enforce the judgment. The courts also noted that the applicant had not used the opportunity to institute enforcement proceedings directly \u2013 a step that would certainly have interrupted the running of the statutory limitation period \u2013 in which case the recognition of the enforcement title could have been decided incidentally as a preliminary issue in those proceedings. Lastly, the courts noted that the applicant had instituted the first enforcement proceedings within the ten-year statutory limitation period but that they had ended with a decision declaring his application for enforcement inadmissible, in which case, pursuant to section 389(2) of the Obligations Act, they did not interrupt the running of the limitation period.",

They argued that when a judgment could not be enforced because the enforcement had become time-barred, this did not constitute interference within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. They explained that the right of a creditor to enforce his or her claim lapses upon the expiration of the statutory limitation period, which periods were determined by clear legal regulations, and their expiration did not depend on any actions or acts by the state authorities. Moreover, if the debtor fulfilled his or her obligation after the expiration of the limitation period, he or she could not claim back what had been given. Furthermore, the debtor must plead that the limitation period had expired, because the court could not take it into account of its own motion, but only if the debtor raised it. Therefore, the Government argued that the applicant's claim still existed, but, due to the expiration of the statutory limitation period in which he had failed to undertake necessary legal steps for its enforcement, he could no longer enforce his claim through the courts. For this reason, the Government argued that his claim had not been extinguished or limited and therefore there had been no deprivation or control of possessions by the state authorities.",

However, that supposition contradicts the established case-law of the Supreme Court according to which proceedings for recognition of a foreign judgment are not ex parte proceedings but adversarial proceedings where a judgment debtor has to be informed of their commencement and be allowed to participate in them (see paragraph 34 above). It is true that companies C.O. and P. as the judgment debtors indeed did not participate in the proceedings for recognition of a foreign judgment instituted by the applicant. However, this was so only because of the failure of the Koprivnica Municipal Court to notify them that the applicant had instituted those proceedings. Even though this error of the Koprivnica Municipal Court should not have had negative consequences for the applicant, the same court nevertheless used it, in the civil proceedings instituted by the companies C.O. and P. to have the enforcement against them declared inadmissible, to justify its refusal to enforce the judgment in the applicant's favour (see paragraphs 25-29 above).",

However, that right would be illusory if a 's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable for Article 6 \u00a7 1 to describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions. To construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would indeed be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see Hornsby v. , 19 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II).",

Thus, in the Court's view, the judgment of the Koprivnica Municipal Court of 8 June 2004 to declare the enforcement of the above-mentioned 's court judgment inadmissible may be regarded as imposing a restriction on his right of access to a court. The Court must therefore examine whether the applicant's right of access to a court was unduly restricted by that decision.",
