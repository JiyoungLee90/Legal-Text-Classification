The case originated in an application (No. 34081/96) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Andrea Starace (“the applicant”), on 4 November 1996. The applicant is represented by Mr Francesco Imparato, a lawyer practising in Naples. The Italian Government are represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, assisted by the Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length and the fairness of a set of criminal proceedings. On 4 March 1998 the Commission (First Chamber) decided to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and invited them to submit their observations on its admissibility and merits. The Government submitted their observations on 11 May 1998, to which the applicant replied on 26 June 1998.
Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1st November 1998 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 § 2 thereof, the application was transferred to the Court.
In accordance with Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Second Section. The Chamber constituted within the Section included ex officio Mr B. Conforti, the judge elected in respect of Italy (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 26 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court), and Mr C. L. Rozakis, the President of the Section (Rule 26 § 1 (a)). The other members designated by the latter to complete the Chamber were Mr M. Fischbach, Mr P. Lorenzen, Mrs M. Tsatsa-Nikolovska, Mr A.B. Baka and Mr E. Levits (Rule 26 § 1 (b)).
On 12 January 1999 the Court (Second Section) decided to give notice to the respondent Government of a new complaint raised by the applicant on 30 October 1998, concerning his right to obtain the attendance and examination of a witness on his behalf, and invited them to submit their observations on its admissibility and merits. The Government submitted their observations on 31 March 1999 to which the applicant replied on 25 May 1999.
On 31 August 1999 the Court declared the application admissible as regards the complaint concerning the length of the criminal proceedings and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.
On an unspecified date of 1990, G. C. and V. A. filed a complaint against the applicant and another person in relation to the publication, in the review “Atenapoli” on 23 March 1990, of an article reporting the applicant’s opinions. Criminal proceedings were instituted by the Naples Public Prosecutor's Office for libel.
On 27 October 1990 the Naples Public Prosecutor, following the abridged procedure ("giudizio direttissimo"), summoned the applicant and two other persons to appear before the Naples District Court on 23 November 1990.
The first hearing was adjourned at the defendants' request.
In an order of 14 February 1991, the Naples District Court declared the writ of summons null and void, since in a judgment of 8 February 1991, the Constitutional Court had ruled that it was not possible to deal with charges of libel by way of abridged proceedings.
On 16 March 1991, the Naples public prosecutor requested the competent investigating judge to summon the defendants to appear before the Naples District Court.
The date of the preliminary hearing before the Naples investigating judge, fixed for 17 March 1992, was adjourned by the Court of its own motion on two occasions and eventually took place on 20 November 1993. In an order issued on the same day, the investigating judge summoned the applicant and his two co-accused to appear before Naples District Court at a hearing on 1 March 1994.
The trial hearing was adjourned, first to 24 May 1994 because Mr A. who, (together with Mr C.) had joined the proceedings as a civil party was absent and then until 31 October 1994, because on that day the lawyers of
By a judgment of 6 May 1996, filed with the registry on 20 June 1996, Naples District Court convicted the applicant for libel and sentenced him to a fine of 2,000,000 lire (ITL) and ordered him to pay each civil party damages of ITL 50,000,000.
On 25 July 1996, the applicant lodged an appeal before the Naples Court of Appeal, requesting, inter alia, that Mr U., who could testify to the truthfulness of the assertions made in “Atenapoli”, be heard as a witness.
The date of the hearing, fixed for 20 May 1997, was first adjourned to 8 July 1997, then postponed to 9 September 1997 because the applicant was ill. In a judgment given on the same day and filed with the registry on 13 September 1997, the Court of Appeal upheld the fine imposed on the applicant and reduced the amount of damages to ITL 15,000,000 for each civil party. As to the question of whether Mr U. should be examined, the court considered that there was no interest, given the fact that the applicant’s liability could be established beyond any reasonable doubt in the light of the wording of the article published in “Atenapoli”.
On 22 October 1997, the applicant appealed against this judgment on points of law, seeking an acquittal and alleging, inter alia, that the Court of Appeal’s refusal to hear Mr U. as a witness amounted to an omission to take “decisive evidence” (Article 606 § 1 (d) of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure).
In a judgment of 5 May 1998, filed with the court registry on 23 June 1998, the Court of Cassation held that the charge against the applicant had become time-barred and consequently annulled the order imposing a fine on him.
Observing that under the relevant provisions of Italian law a person accused of criminal libel is in principle entitled to produce evidence to prove the truthfulness of the contested statements, the Court concluded that the refusal to hear Mr U. as a witness was unlawful. However, as the charge was time-barred, it did not consider it necessary to quash the conviction and to refer the case back to the Court of Appeal, confining itself to setting aside the order for damages and to ordering the case-file to be forwarded to the competent civil courts.
