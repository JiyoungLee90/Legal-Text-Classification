In all their detention decisions the authorities repeatedly relied on a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question, which was supported by evidence from witnesses, and on the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. They attached importance to the complexity of the case, the significant number of persons involved and the voluminous documentation. They further considered that the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, especially the need to verify evidence from suspects and witnesses justified holding him in custody and that the applicant, if released, could obstruct the proper course of the proceedings. The courts found no special grounds that would justify lifting the detention and imposing a less severe measure. In its decision of 21 December 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal recommended to the  that hearings should be held more frequently, in order to ensure the speedy progress of the proceedings. Further, in the decisions of 11 October 2006 and 22 February and 20 June 2007, the Katowice Court of Appeal stressed the need to terminate the criminal proceedings pending before the first-instance court.",

Such restrictions as limitations put on the number of family visits, supervision over those visits and, if so justified by the nature of the offence, subjection of a detainee to a special prison regime or special visiting arrangements constitute an interference with his rights under Article 8 but are not, by themselves, in breach of that provision.

However, as stated above, while this element is to be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 and may justify a longer period of detention than in a case concerning an individual offender, a member of an organised criminal group is entitled to the protection against unreasonably lengthy detention afforded by this provision (see paragraphs 30, 32 and 36 above). As in other numerous similar detention cases, the authorities did not justify the applicant\u2019s continued detention by relevant and sufficient reasons (see paragraphs 30-36 above). Moreover, as demonstrated by the ever increasing number of judgments in which the Court has found Poland to be in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of applicants involved in organised crime, the present case is by no means an isolated example of the imposition of unjustifiably lengthy detention but a confirmation of a practice found to be contrary to the Convention (see, among many other examples, Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, 4 May 2006; K\u0105kol v. Poland, no. 3994/03, 6 September 2007; Malikowski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 15154/03, 16 October 2007). Consequently, the Court sees no reason to diverge from its findings made in Kauczor as to the existence of the structural problem and the need for the Polish State to adopt measures to remedy the situation (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62 ).",
