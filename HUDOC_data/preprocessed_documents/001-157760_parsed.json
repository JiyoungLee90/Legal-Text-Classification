In the impugned letter the applicants stated their complaints about M.S., who was the editor of the entertainment programme at the BD public radio at the material time and one of the candidates for the post of director of that radio station, as well as about the selection process. They claimed that their intention was to inform competent authority about certain irregularities in a matter of important public interest and to prompt them to investigate the allegations in the letter. While it is true that the impugned statements were subsequently made public, the Court notes that there was no evidence in the domestic proceedings that the applicants had participated in their publication. That was, indeed, the point of view of the first-instance court (see paragraph 8 above). Moreover, the Appellate Court only found the applicants liable for defamation by sending the impugned letter to the authorities competent for taking relevant further steps into the matter and this was upheld by the Constitutional Court. The Court will therefore refrain from taking into consideration any other alleged means of defamation of M.S. by the applicants (see, mutatis mutandis, Sofranschi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a028).",

In its practice, the Court has distinguished between statements of fact and value judgments. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see Jerusalem v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a026958/95, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2001II). However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (see De Haes and Gijsels v.\u00a0Belgium, no. 19983/92, \u00a7 47, 24 February 1997).",

They addressed it to the competent authorities, that is to say the International Supervisor for BD, the President of the Assembly of BD and the Governor of BD. It was a very limited communication, which was both private and confidential, and was made to persons who had a direct institutional interest in the matter and were thus entitled to receive it. The letter was certainly not meant for wider publication or, in the words of Section 6 of the Defamation Act 2003, for dissemination. That the applicants reserved the right to contact the media if no action was taken by the authorities does not detract from this argument; whether such an eventuality would have materialised and, if so, in what form or with what content one simply does not know. Lastly, it has not been suggested that the applicants should be held accountable for the ultimate dissemination of the letter, in which they were not shown to have been involved in any way.",

It contained views on matters of public interest. It criticised the approach already taken by the authorities and transmitted to them \u201cunofficial information\u201d received in relation to candidate M.S., to the effect that M.S. was unsuitable for the post. The gist of it all was that the authorities were duty-bound to direct their attention to the said \u201cunofficial information\u201d and, if it was substantiated, to act accordingly. It was clear that the applicants relied on the authorities to inquire into the various allegations and to evaluate them.",

What is germane to the present purpose is that the applicants themselves made no definite or final assertions as to the facts. In the words of Section 6 of the Defamation Act 2003, there was nothing they did that could fairly be regarded as tantamount to ascertaining a falsehood.",

Account should be taken of the need to protect the reputation of the individual but also of the need to maintain confidence in public administration by encouraging the involvement of citizens and addressing their concerns. People are entitled, in the discharge of their civic duties, to bring relevant information to the attention of the authorities and may, indeed, do so in strong terms in an attempt to persuade the authorities to scrutinise such information so as to ensure sound administration in public affairs. A person may sometimes overstep the mark and, where that happens, a proportionality exercise may be necessary. In the present case, the highest domestic courts approached the case as if the applicants had actually gone farther than they should have done. Even if that were the case the courts then failed, in our view, to carry out a meaningful examination of the relevant competing interests bearing on the proportionality of State interference with the right to freedom of expression under Article 10.",
