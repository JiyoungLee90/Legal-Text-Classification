In this regard, the Court reiterates that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the alleged criminal activities of the applicant may be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings (see G\u00f3rski v. , no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4\u00a0October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent extensions of the detention (see Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised crime groups, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other coaccused, or otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high. In this connection the Court notes that the applicant attempted to commit suicide and that the domestic courts took into consideration the defendants' health and family situation when taking decision on the continuation of their detention (see paragraphs 15-18 above).",

In this regard, the Court observes that the proceedings were of considerable complexity, regard being had to the number of defendants, the extensive evidentiary proceedings and the implementation of special measures required in cases concerning organised crime. Nevertheless, the hearings in the applicant's case were held regularly and at short intervals. The Court therefore concludes that the national authorities displayed special diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. The length of the investigation and of the trial was justified by the exceptional complexity of the case. It should not be overlooked that, while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the efforts of the judges to clarify fully the facts in issue, to provide both the defence and the prosecution with all necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case and to give judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence to be imposed.",
