Proceedings relating to the termination of the applicant’s contract of employment
The applicant was employed by the District National Committee (Okresný národný výbor) in Bardejov. In 1988 he was dismissed for breach of discipline. Subsequently courts at two levels of jurisdiction declared the dismissal unlawful. Their decisions became final on 2 August 1991. In 1990, while the above proceedings were pending, the national committees ceased to exist ex lege and their liquidation was formally completed on 31 July 1991. The national committees were replaced by district offices (okresné úrady) which were not, strictly speaking, the legal successors to the former.
On 2 September 1991 the Bardejov District Office terminated the applicant’s contract of employment on the ground that the district national committee which had formerly employed him had ceased to exist. The applicant challenged this decision. He argued, in particular, that the government regulations on the liquidation of the former national committees were unlawful, that he had become an employee of the Bardejov District Office after his dismissal in 1988 was declared unlawful on 2 August 1991, and that the District Office had paid his salary until the end of 1991. He claimed compensation for damage caused by the termination of his contract of employment.

On 12 January 2006 the applicant filed an application for the District Court’s judgment of 16 January 1991 to be enforced by an executions officer in accordance with new legislation enacted with effect from 1 September 2005. That application was registered under file no. 3 Er 210/06.
On 20 March 2006 the District Court transmitted the file to the executions officer. In doing so it concluded its proceedings under file no. 182/98 as under the new legislation the enforcement of judicial decisions was entrusted exclusively to executions officers.
On 19 July 2006 the District Court dismissed both parties’ objections to the execution.
The executions officer enforced the compensation for costs of the proceedings which had been awarded to the applicant in the judgment in issue. On 19 October 2006 the executions officer informed the applicant that the enforcement was thereby concluded. The applicant was invited to indicate to which bank account the sum in issue should be transferred.
In November 2006 the applicant objected that the execution had not been completed. He expressed the view that under the judgment in issue the defendant should be obliged to offer him a job.
On 22 November 2006 the executions officer transferred the sum enforced (the equivalent of approximately EUR 20), in accordance with the applicant’s request, to the bank account of the Orthodox Church Parish in Bardejov.
On 20 December 2006 the District Court informed the executions officer that no objections to the execution could be examined once the execution was completed. The executions officer was asked to return to the court the authorisation to carry out the enforcement. He complied with the request on 21 December 2006.
On 10 June 1998 the applicant submitted to the Bardejov District Court another application for enforcement of the same judgment of 16 January 1991. Until March 1999, the court did not consider the applicant’s application as a request for enforcement and attached it to the original case file. After having reconsidered the position, the court registered it as an application for enforcement under file no. E 83/99.
On 22 April 1999 the Bardejov District Court transferred the file to the Prešov District Court for reasons of jurisdiction. The case was registered under file no. E 572/99.

The  decided not to award any just satisfaction to the applicant. It held that the applicant sought the enforcement of a judicial decision of a declaratory nature which did not, as such, impose any enforceable obligation on the defendant. In that respect his request had been devoid of any prospect of success from the very beginning.

As in the above decisions, it noted that under the judgment of 16 January 1991 the applicant had no enforceable right to obtain employment. In that connection the applicant should have initiated separate proceedings with a view to obliging the defendant to offer him a job.
On 2 February 1996 the applicant brought proceedings against the State, represented by the Bardejov District Office, before the Bardejov District Court. He claimed that (i) the court should declare that the decision of the Bardejov District Office of 2 September 1991 to put an end to his contract of employment formally had been arbitrary and (ii) that the authorities had discriminated against him in that respect.

It based its decision on its established practice of examining length-of-proceedings complaints only where the proceedings complained of were still pending before the authority liable for the alleged violation when the complaint to the  was filed. That requirement had not been met, as the proceedings complained of had ended with the ’s decision, which had become final on 21 February 2003.

With reference to the relevant law, it held that the execution proceedings had ended with final effect on 9 February 1998, when the District Court had been notified of the applicant’s compliance with his obligation.

2  Constitutional proceedings
On 26 November 2002 the applicant complained to the Constitutional court about undue delays in the above proceedings before the Bardejov District Court.
On 7 May 2003 the  found that the Bardejov District Court had violated the applicant’s right to have the case decided without undue delay.
The decision stated that the District Court had been inactive without any justification from 17 March 2000 until 26 November 2002 (the date of lodging the complaint to the ), that is, a total of two years and eight months. The applicant was partly responsible for that period in that, after he had informed the District Court of his inability to attend hearings on account of his illness on 20 February 2000, he had failed to inform the court when the period of that illness had come to an end.
The  therefore decided not to award any just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage to the applicant. It ordered the District Court to avoid further delays in the proceedings and to reimburse the applicant’s costs.

On 17 May 2006 the  declared the complaint inadmissible. It found no unjustified delays in the proceedings during the period subsequent to its above judgment on 7 May 2003. As regards the complaint about the change of judges, the applicant should have first sought redress by means of an appeal on points of law. Since the applicant had filed an appeal on points of law against the Regional Court’s judgment of 16 March 2005, the remaining complaints to the  were premature.
On 25 May 2004 the applicant filed a criminal complaint in respect of a fraud. He alleged that the case file in the proceedings concerning his above defamation action of 1996 contained documents with a forged signature.
On 3 July 2004 the District Directorate of the Police Corps in Bardejov found no ground for bringing criminal proceedings.

As the complaint did not comply with the formal requirements, on 2 May 2006 the  asked the advocate appointed by the applicant to submit further information. In the absence of any reply from the advocate, on 7 July 2006 the , rejected the complaint as falling short of the statutory requirements.
On 19 July 2007 the  rejected a third complaint by the applicant. It concerned the refusal, by the Police Directorate in Bardejov and the Bardejov District Prosecutor’s Office, to prosecute persons responsible for the inclusion of a fraudulent document in the file concerning the above action for defamation. The decision stated that the prosecuting authorities had duly considered the applicant’s criminal complaint and had given sufficient reasons for their conclusion. The fact that they did not accept the applicant’s argument that an offence had been committed did not amount to a violation of his right to a fair hearing.
