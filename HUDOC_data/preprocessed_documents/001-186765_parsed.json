It observes that the applicant\u2019s complaint is directed against the City of Moscow, a municipality for whose actions the Russian Federation may be held responsible. It was the action brought by the City that led to the revocation of the applicant\u2019s property title and its transfer to the City. The fact that the City had earlier lost its possession as a result of the actions of third parties, including the notary, has no bearing on the respondent State\u2019s standing.

Following the death of the flat\u2019s owner, it should have been considered bona vacantia, and the title to it should have been transferred to the City of Moscow. The applicant had bought the flat in bad faith, given that his intent had been to resell it. Moreover, on several other occasions the applicant had been a party to civil proceedings in which the City of Moscow had contested the validity of transactions in respect of real property that he had acquired. The Government furthermore submitted that the recovery of the flat by the City of Moscow had pursued a legitimate aim. The City was responsible for providing affordable housing to people on low incomes. Accordingly, the City had reclaimed the flat in the interests of those people. Lastly, the Government argued that the national courts had correctly applied the national laws when adjudicating the dispute between the applicant and the City of Moscow. Those decisions had ensured a fair balance between the needs of society and the applicant\u2019s private interests. The fact that the applicant had disagreed with the findings of the domestic courts was insufficient for an issue to be raised under the Convention. In any event, the flat recovered by the City of Moscow had not been the applicant\u2019s sole home. He had established his permanent residence in Israel and a temporary one in Moscow.",

Having examined the specific conditions and procedures under which the State ensured the compliance and legitimacy of the housing transactions between private individuals, the Court noted that they fell within the State\u2019s exclusive competence and held that the defects in those procedures preventing the State from obtaining title to bona vacantia housing should not have been remedied at the expense of such housing\u2019s bona fide owners. The Court furthermore reasoned that the restitution of such property to the State or relevant municipality without any compensation being paid to the respective bona fide owner imposed an individual and excessive burden on the latter and failed to strike a fair balance between the demands of the public interest on the one hand and applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions on the other.",

In this connection, the Court observes that it was the responsibility of the State registration authorities to make sure that the transfers of title to real property in question had been carried out in accordance with the law. The Government\u2019s submissions do not address the question of why the City authorities did nothing, after S.\u2019s death, to regularise the status of the real property in question.

The Court reiterates that the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova v. Russia, no. 15711/13, \u00a7\u00a049, 29\u00a0January 2015). The Court therefore concludes that the forfeiture of title to the flat by the applicant and the transfer of the ownership of the flat to the City of Moscow, under the circumstances described above and in the absence of any compensation to be paid to the applicant, placed a disproportionate and excessive burden on the latter. There has therefore been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",
