In the course of that trial, the court held two hearings, and obtained testimony from several witnesses, documentary evidence and the opinion prepared by a forensic expert at the request of the court. It noted that the police medical report sheet that was normally filled in when suspects were apprehended was missing from the file and that the full version of the video recording was no longer available. The court observed that, during the course of the impugned police measure, the applicant had suffered minor bruises on both his upper arms, his right elbow, his back and his left knee. All these injuries healed within eight days and did not indicate that he had been struck, kicked or dragged along the ground, as alleged by the applicant. Analysing the available evidence, the court concluded that (i)\u00a0the officers had not committed the offence of \u201cill-treatment during official proceedings\u201d in that the use of force applied had been lawful, necessary and proportional, and (ii) the minor injuries that the applicant had sustained had been caused accidentally, without any intention to ill-treat him, when he had been immobilised and handcuffed by the officers.",

It cannot be said that he deliberately tried to defer the time-limit set out in Article 35 \u00a7 1 by making use of inappropriate procedures that could have offered him no effective redress for the complaint in issue under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Petrovi\u0107 v.

Hungary (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 42\u201345 and 51, with further references). In addition, where an individual is deprived of his or her liberty or, more generally, is confronted with law-enforcement officers, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by the person\u2019s conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention. The Court emphasises that the words \u201cin principle\u201d cannot be taken to mean that there might be situations in which such a finding of a violation is not called for, because the above-mentioned severity threshold has not been attained. Any interference with human dignity strikes at the very essence of the Convention. For that reason any conduct by law-enforcement officers vis-\u00e0-vis an individual which diminishes human dignity constitutes a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. That applies in particular to their use of physical force against an individual where it is not made strictly necessary by his conduct, whatever the impact on the person in question (see Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7\u00a7 100-101, ECHR 2015).",

This investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. If that were not the case, the general legal prohibition on torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see, among many other authorities, Kmetty v. Hungary, no.\u00a057967/00, \u00a7 38, 16 December 2003, and M.F. v. Hungary, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051). The investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances and, as pointed out above, of identifying and \u2013 if appropriate \u2013 punishing those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must take whatever reasonable steps they can to secure the evidence concerning the incident. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see also Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, \u00a7 301, ECHR 2011 (extracts)).",

Had this not been the case, the authorities may have had strong evidence at their disposal to prove or disprove the applicant\u2019s allegations. Although the short, edited version of the recording was available, it did not contain footage of the applicant being handcuffed. Moreover, a further element underlying the inadequacy of the investigation was the absence of the police medical report sheet, which is normally filled in when suspects are apprehended (see paragraph 14 above). That document, if it had been available, may have shed more light on the circumstances of the incident complained of.",

The above omissions necessarily prevented the national courts from making as full findings of fact as they might have otherwise done. An adequate investigation would have required diligence and promptness (see Menesheva v. Russia, no.\u00a059261/00, \u00a7 67, ECHR\u00a02006III). The Court notes that in the present case the prosecutor in charge of the case requested a copy of the original video recording of the applicant\u2019s arrest only on 29 February 2012, when the statutory thirty-day period, during which it could have been obtained for the purposes of an investigation, had long expired (see paragraph 11 above).",
