The majority concluded that \u201cthe civil courts established the facts surrounding the infliction of the grievous bodily harm upon the applicant and awarded her compensation\u201d (see paragraph 65 of the judgment), and that therefore the State had complied with its obligations under Article 3.",

This consideration, nonetheless, by no means diminishes the duty to investigate and eventually prosecute, particularly where an applicant is under the care and responsibility of the authorities (see Sizarev v. Ukraine, no.\u00a017116/04, \u00a7 120, 17 January 2013). In addition, the Court has repeatedly pointed out that in cases which concern medical negligence it is important to ensure that the measures chosen by the Government are capable of establishing any liability of the doctors concerned (see, mutatis mutandis, Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy, no. 32967/96, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2002-I; Vo\u00a0v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2004-VIII; and Tarariyeva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4353/03, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2006XV (extracts)).",

                        "content": "5.\u00a0\u00a0In some cases the Court has found that it is only by recourse to criminal-law remedies that it can be ensured that situations are investigated and evidence is collected in conformity with the Convention requirements (see Mitkus v. Latvia, no.\u00a07259/03, \u00a7 76, 2 October 2012, and Gorodovych v. Ukraine, no. 71050/11, \u00a7 18, 19 January 2017). For example, in Mitkus, the Court concluded that civil proceedings had not offered the applicant a sufficient possibility to establish facts, gather evidence and find out the truth about the circumstances of his infection with HIV. In Arskaya v. Ukraine (no. 45076/05, 5 December 2013), which concerned medical negligence allegedly leading to the death of the applicant\u2019s son, the Court examined whether the available legal remedies, taken together, as provided in law and applied in practice, could be said to have constituted legal means capable of establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress to the victim. Rather than assessing the legal regime in abstracto, the Court decided to examine whether the legal system as a whole had adequately dealt with the case at hand (see Arskaya, cited above, \u00a7 66). Thus, the Court has stressed that providing compensation to the victims is only one of the aspects of the State\u2019s obligations when it comes to protecting the life and physical integrity of a person. It must also be accompanied by measures that are capable of identifying the individuals whose actions or omission led to the infliction of bodily harm on the applicant. In Arskaya the Court found a violation of Article 2 owing to the failure of the domestic authorities to examine all the relevant facts concerning the death of the applicant\u2019s son and to identify the persons responsible (\u00a7 71). Furthermore, the Court noted the lack of adequate domestic regulations establishing a stringent procedure for the treatment of patients in a situation similar to that of the applicant\u2019s son (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 90-91).",

The position of inferiority and powerlessness which is typical of patients confined in psychiatric hospitals calls for increased vigilance in reviewing whether the Convention has been complied with (see M.S. v. Croatia (no. 2), no.\u00a075450/12, \u00a7 98, 19 February 2015), and the authorities should demonstrate special care in guaranteeing safe conditions corresponding to the special needs of persons with mental illnesses (see Hiller v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a01967/14, \u00a7 48, 22\u00a0November 2016).",

In this respect we note that, in the second set of proceedings, responsibility was divided between the asylum and Ms B., respectively, in a proportion of 80% to 20%. The domestic courts did not provide reasons for this distribution of responsibility. They failed to establish all the circumstances of the incident which led to the infliction of severe bodily injuries on the applicant. In particular, it was never established whether B. had lacked legal capacity at the moment of the incident, since in the two sets of civil proceedings different conclusions were reached in this regard (see paragraphs 17 and 23 of the judgment). Hence, we do not think that the national authorities demonstrated due diligence when considering the complaint about illtreatment, establishing all the circumstances of the case and identifying the individuals responsible (see Virabyan v. Armenia, no. 40094/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0177178, 2 October 2012).",

Neither the first nor the second set of civil proceedings identified who exactly was responsible for the applicant\u2019s placement in the same ward as B., allegedly known for her violent behaviour, and for leaving them both unattended for a certain period of time. Although the Government provided the Court with the asylum orderlies\u2019 list of duties, according to which the psychiatric patients should not have been left unsupervised, it remains unclear if these duties were made known to the asylum employees and, if that was the case, to what extent, if at all, they were implemented. This Court has underscored many times that the positive obligations under Article 2 require States to make regulations compelling hospitals, whether public or private, to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of their patients\u2019 lives (see Oyal v. Turkey, no.\u00a04864/05, \u00a7 54, 23 March 2010, and\u00a0Lambert and Others v. France\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a046043/14, \u00a7 140, ECHR 2015 (extracts)).",
