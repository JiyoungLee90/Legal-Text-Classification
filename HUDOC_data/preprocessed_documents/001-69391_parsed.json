It reiterates, however, that Article 8, like any other provision of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, must be interpreted in such a way that it guarantees not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see, mutatis mutandis, Artico v. Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 15-16, \u00a7\u00a033, and Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no.\u00a0161, p. 34, \u00a7\u00a087). Furthermore, while the chief object of Article\u00a08, which deals with the right to respect for one's private and family life, is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private or family life (see, for example, G\u00fcl v.\u00a0Switzerland, judgment of 19 February 1996, Reports 1996I, pp.\u00a0174175, \u00a7\u00a038; Ignaccolo-Zenide v.

Although they are not of Latvian origin, the fact remains that they have developed personal, social and economic ties strong enough for them to be regarded as sufficiently well integrated in Latvian society, even if, as the Government maintain, there are gaps in their knowledge of Latvian (see the Slivenko judgment cited above, \u00a7 124). Similarly, although the second and third applicants have Russian nationality and had an officially registered residence in Russia, none of the three applicants appears to have developed personal ties in that country comparable to those they have established in Latvia (ibid., \u00a7 125).",

While it recognises the right of each State to take effective steps to ensure compliance with its immigration laws, it considers that a measure of the kind imposed on the applicants could be considered to be proportionate only if the applicants had acted in a particularly dangerous manner. In that connection the Court reiterates that most of the similar cases it has examined under Article 8 of the Convention have related to situations in which the applicants had been deported after being convicted of serious criminal offences. In the instant case, however, the applicants received only a modest fine which was not classified as a criminal penalty under Latvian law (see paragraph 18 above).",

In that connection the Court reiterates that it is inappropriate for the authorities of a respondent State to enter into direct contact with an applicant. Even if a Government has reason to believe that in a particular case the right of individual petition is being abused, the appropriate course of action is for that Government to alert the Court and inform it of their misgivings (see Tanrikulu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0131, and Orhan v. , no. 25656/94, \u00a7\u00a0409, 18 June 2002).

Consequently, the Court considers that Article 8 does not extend to guaranteeing the person concerned a particular type of residence permit, provided that the solution proposed by the authorities allows him to exercise without hindrance his right to respect for his private and family life. In the instant case the Court observes that a permanent residence permit would allow the third applicant to live close to her family in  for an indefinite period, and would therefore constitute an adequate safeguard to protect the rights enshrined in Article 8 of the Convention...\u201d",

However, in our view, the decisive factor as regards the obligations under the Convention is the fact that the regularisation procedures proposed by the Government would allow the applicants to remain without hindrance within Latvian territory, to lead a normal social life there and to enjoy the rights enshrined in Article 8 of the Convention. The choice of the practical means of achieving that is a matter first and foremost for the authorities in the respondent State, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity which underpins the entire Convention system. It should be noted in that context that the argument advanced in paragraph 54 of the judgment is contrary to the Court's case-law, which has never stated that applicants had the right to choose the method by which their stay in a State Party to the Convention was regularised. The same applies to the argument of the majority (also in paragraph 54) endorsing the decisions of the first-instance courts despite being aware that the highest courts in the country had ruled otherwise.",
