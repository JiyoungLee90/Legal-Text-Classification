The security forces were thus able to take preventive measures. The area concerned was secured by numerous police officers and members of the rapid intervention force. As a result, in the particular circumstances of the present case, it cannot be said that the security forces were called upon to react without prior preparation (see Rehbock\u00a0v. , no.\u00a029462/95, \u00a7\u00a072, ECHR 2000XII). The Court notes that the group did not obey the police warnings to disperse. However, as explained in detail below (see paragraphs 51-54 below), there is nothing in the case file to suggest that the demonstrators presented a danger to public order. At this point, the Court also refers to the judgment of the Beyo\u011flu Criminal Court dated 19\u00a0September 2005 by which the applicants were acquitted of the charges against them.

It goes without saying that any demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life and encounter hostility. In the Court's opinion, it is important that preventive security measures such as, for example, the presence of first-aid services at the site of demonstrations, be taken in order to guarantee the smooth conduct of any event, meeting or other gathering, be it political, cultural or of another nature. This being so, associations and others organising demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, should respect the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force (see Oya Ataman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 39).",

It is observed that the rally began at about noon and ended with the group's arrest within half an hour at 12.30 p.m. The Court is therefore particularly struck by the authorities' impatience in seeking to end the demonstration.
