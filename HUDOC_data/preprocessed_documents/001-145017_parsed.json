However, the interference was prescribed by Article 6.9 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Code of Administrative Offences and section 25.10 of the Entry and Exit Procedures Act, and the Federal Service for Drug Control had authority to issue the decision declaring the first applicant\u2019s presence in Russia undesirable. The interference pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of public order and was necessary to prevent the first applicant and other persons from re-offending. The Government disputed that the first applicant could be considered a long-term or settled migrant because he had taken up legal residence in Russia in 2001 at the age of twenty. The applicants\u2019 marriage had been a very recent event, having taken place in August 2011. The applicants had not shown that they would not be able to continue their life in Georgia where the first applicant had spent a major part of his life, where he could receive specialist treatment and find employment as a driver. The Government further pointed out that the first applicant had been held criminally responsible and found guilty on ten counts of administrative offences before the decision of 15\u00a0November 2011 and on seven counts after that date. Having regard to the first applicant\u2019s age, the length of the period of his criminal and immoral behaviour, as well as the seriousness of the crime and administrative offences he had committed, those deeds could not be regarded as \u201cacts of juvenile delinquency\u201d (here the Government referred to Balogun v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 60286/09, 10 April 2012). The Government attached particular weight to the fact that the first applicant had committed drug-related offences. Lastly, they submitted that the first applicant would not be able to return to Russia for five years following his administrative expulsion and submitted that, in their view, that period was not excessively long (here they referred to Samsonnikov v. Estonia, no. 52178/10, 3 July 2012, in which the Court found no violation in respect of a three-year period, and Maslov v. Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, ECHR 2008, in which the Court found a violation in respect of a ten-year period).",

Pursuant to Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2000)15 (cited in paragraph 37 above), the first applicant was to be considered a \u201clong-term immigrant\u201d in Russia whose expulsion would be justified only if he had been convicted of a criminal offence and given a custodial sentence of at least two years\u2019 imprisonment. The first applicant, however, had never been convicted of any crime and the administrative offences he had committed amounted to nothing more than misdemeanours, the maximum sentence for which was fifteen days\u2019 detention. In the first applicant\u2019s view, the Russian authorities were, at least in part, responsible for his drug addition: an epidemic of desomorphine abuse in the Komi Republic had occurred because it could be simply synthesised from cheap codeine-based painkillers that were available over the counter from any pharmacy. The applicants emphasised that family and community support was a factor that had a positive impact on the first applicant\u2019s treatment for HIV infection. In sum, the applicants considered that the impugned interference with their right to respect for their family life was disproportionate and not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",

France, 21\u00a0October 1997, \u00a7 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997\u2011VI). The Convention does not guarantee the right of an alien to enter or to reside in a particular country and, in pursuance of their task of maintaining public order, Contracting States have the power to expel an alien convicted of criminal offences. However, their decisions in this field must, in so far as they may interfere with a right protected under paragraph 1 of Article 8, be in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society, that is to say justified by a pressing social need and, in particular, proportionate to the aims sought to be achieved (see, among other authorities, Slivenko v.\u00a0Latvia [GC], no. 48321/99, \u00a7 99, ECHR 2003).",

Paragraph 1(3) of section 9 of the Foreign Nationals Act provided for the revocation of the residence permit of a foreigner whose expulsion had been ordered. Lastly, the exclusion order was issued on the basis of section 25.10 of the Entry and Exit Procedures Act. The latter decision was taken by the Federal Migration Service following a proposal of the Federal Service for Drug Control. In the case of Liu, the Court observed that, where an executive authority could take such decisions without hearing the foreign national concerned, it could indicate that the relevant legal provisions did not give an adequate degree of protection against arbitrary interference and therefore failed to meet the Convention\u2019s \u201cquality of law\u201d requirements (see Liu, cited above, \u00a7 65). However, since in the present case the reasons for the decision were eventually reviewed by the courts at two levels of jurisdiction, the Court may dispense with pursuing this inquiry because it will address any outstanding lawfulness issues below, together with its assessment of the proportionality of the interference (see Liu v. Russia (no.\u00a02), no. 29157/09, \u00a7\u00a079, 26\u00a0July 2011).",

In Ezzouhdi, the Court emphasised that it could not be reasonably maintained that the offences of drug use and drug consumption represented a serious threat to public order, since the penalty imposed on the applicant was relatively mild, notwithstanding the repetitive nature of the offences (see Ezzouhdi v.\u00a0France, no. 47160/99, \u00a7 34, 13 February 2001, the applicant having been sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment).

This was confirmed on appeal by the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic, which rejected the arguments relating to the first applicant\u2019s family situation by reference to the automatic nature of the expulsion measure (see paragraph 14 above). By this assertion the Supreme Court explicitly refused to balance the different interests involved and made no further analysis as to the proportionality of the measure to be applied against the first applicant. It refused to take into account the criteria elaborated by the Court and to apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a08 (compare with Liu (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a081).",

The Town Court reached the conclusion that the first applicant\u2019s presence posed no real threat to national security, public order or health, and the Court endorses that finding. Indeed, it follows from the list of offences supplied by the Government that the first applicant had never committed any violent offences and his acts had never caused any significant damage to anyone but himself. Contrary to the Government\u2019s allegation that he was a felon, the first applicant had never been found guilty of any crime and the criminal proceedings against him were discontinued without trial in 2003, in view of his active repentance (see the Town Court\u2019s judgment in paragraph 26 above). As to the administrative proceedings, all of them concerned misdemeanours, including minor disorderly acts, public drunkenness and drug consumption, or regulatory offences, such as failure to follow administrative procedures. Each time the first applicant was given a small fine. What is also significant is that a majority of the incidents took place between 2000 and 2004, namely more than eight years before it was decided to declare the first applicant\u2019s presence undesirable. With the passage of time the relevance of those acts diminished and a stronger justification was required to invoke them as a ground for the first applicant\u2019s exclusion from Russia. On the other hand, the first applicant was married to a Russian national and had a son with her who was also a Russian national. Both of his parents had moved to Russia together with him and had since acquired Russian nationality. There was no indication that he had any close family members in Georgia. In these circumstances, the Town Court\u2019s assessment that the duration of the first applicant\u2019s stay in Russia and the strength of his family connections outweighed the cumulative effect of his history of offending, appears to have been a reasonable one.",

The Supreme Court did not subject the executive\u2019s assertion that the first applicant posed a threat to public order and health to any meaningful scrutiny. Without analysing in any detail what offences the first applicant had committed and when, or what his length of stay and family ties in Russia were, the Supreme Court declared his lifestyle to have been an \u201cimmoral\u201d one which \u201cundoubtedly\u201d was an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to the health and morals of Russian citizens (see paragraph 27 above). In the absence of any explanation in the text of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment as to the factual circumstances on which such findings were based, the Court does not need to investigate further whether or not a value judgment on the immorality of the first applicant\u2019s lifestyle constituted, as a matter of Russian law, a sufficient and foreseeable legal ground for his exclusion from Russia. Furthermore, in so far as the test of proportionality demanded that the interference with the protected Convention rights be no greater than is necessary to achieve the legitimate aim pursued, it does not follow from the text of the judgment that the Supreme Court considered any alternative, less intrusive measures before validating the exclusion of the first applicant from Russia (see point 5 (b) of Recommendation Rec(2000)15). Since the balancing exercise was not carried out in accordance with the Convention standards, the Court considers that the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic failed to balance properly the various interests that were at stake in the present case.",
