Point 3 of the operative provisions states that there has been a violation of the substantive aspect of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the national authorities\u2019 failure to protect the applicant against ill-treatment by his cellmates. We voted in favour of that finding in so far as it does not come into direct conflict with the position which we defend. However, we opposed the quantification of non-pecuniary damage (see points 5(i) and 6 of the operative provisions), which we consider to be inadequate since it is broadly in line with the amounts awarded by the Court in cases of inhuman or degrading treatment.",

They subsequently acknowledged that it was genuine. The applicant alleged that, while in detention, he had been tortured, beaten and raped. Unfortunately, the applicant\u2019s allegations of torture and rape were not examined by the majority, even though the Court\u2019s usual practice is to specify the type of illtreatment suffered in the body of the judgment and/or in the operative provisions. As a result, like the applicant, we are unable to address them directly.",

The burden of proof in respect of the rape of the applicant (with its implications for the legal characterisation of the facts) should not lie solely with him, especially since the authorities did not conduct an investigation despite being legally bound to do so (Article 223 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). It can readily be inferred that the reason why the applicant did not report the incident immediately was because, as he explained, he was very afraid, particularly of the other prisoners who had threatened to kill him if he reported them (see paragraph 14 of the judgment). Nevertheless, it appears that the applicant was moved from his original cell following the meeting with his lawyer, who observed an appreciable change in his behaviour (see paragraph 20). The fact that the authorities agreed to the transfer means that a problem must have existed. It is well known that prisoners are not allowed to change cell unless there is a good reason for it. However, the fact is that no investigation, even of a summary nature, was instituted following that request. In our view, the lack of an investigation is further evidence, if any were needed, corroborating the applicant\u2019s version of events.",

However, the Court\u2019s practice is quite different, in that it has gradually relaxed the rigid nature of this principle, which comes from the sphere of criminal law. For instance, in the absence of direct proof confirming that an act was committed, notably when the alleged abuse occurred while the person concerned was in the custody of the State, our Court is content to rely on other evidence. Thus, it has used evidence arising from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a0121, 6 April 2000), from primary facts, or contextual facts or sequences of events which can form the basis for inferences about the primary facts, and also from statements by international observers (see Merabishvili v.

He added that the removal of his eyebrows was an outward sign that he had been sodomised (see paragraph 18 of the judgment). A double humiliation! Indeed, this fact was confirmed before a judge by four witnesses (see paragraphs 29-32 of the judgment). The Government, for their part, offered no explanation as to the relationship between the shaving and the alleged rape. Their disingenuous silence on the subject should count against them, especially since no effective investigation was carried out by the authorities into the applicant\u2019s subsequent allegations of ill-treatment. Such an investigation was all the more vital since the right in issue here has a special ranking under the Convention (Article 3). Nor can the context be overlooked. In that connection, the CPT, in the reports following its visits of September 2004 (paragraphs 87 and 89 of document CPT/Inf(2006) 18, reproduced in paragraph 48 of the judgment) and June 2015 (paragraph\u00a051 of document CPT/Inf(2016) 21, reproduced in paragraph\u00a050 of the judgment), emphasised the very high level of inter-prisoner violence in the prison in question.

Once again, the Government omitted to respond to this complaint. However, they could not have been unaware of the aftermath of the Balkans war (1992-95) and the atrocities committed at that time.

Failure for the Court to do so, as, in our humble view, happened in the present case, will result in: (a) not giving the right under Article 3 its due and fullest weight and effect consistent with its wording and aim and purpose, and (b) awarding an insufficient amount of just satisfaction for non-pecuniary damage under Article 41 of the Convention.",
