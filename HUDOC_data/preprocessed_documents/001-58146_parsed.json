It is in reality the traditional distribution of family responsibilities between mothers and fathers that gave rise to the Austrian legislation under which only mothers were entitled to parental leave allowance. The discrimination against fathers perpetuates this traditional distribution of roles and can also have negative consequences for the mother; if she continues her professional activity and agrees that the father stay at home, the family loses the parental leave allowance to which it would be entitled if she stayed at home.",

The reference to the situation in other European States and to the lack of uniform practice is not conclusive. The Commission correctly stated in its report that there are different social-security systems in the European States, and a State, when opting for one system, is not permitted to grant benefits in a discriminatory manner.",
