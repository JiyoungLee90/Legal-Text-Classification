The compensation paid to the applicants had been proportional to the aim pursued. The market value of the plots of land in question had been calculated by applying income and comparative methods. The comparative method took into account several factors influencing the market value of agricultural land, such as property rights and restrictions; appearance of the plot of land; existence of any water supplies; measurements, location and yield of the plot of land; existence of any transport access; and slope degree and rock content of the plot of land. The income method took into consideration the necessary expenses and the expected incomes of the growing crops in the agricultural lands at issue. The average fertility rates were used for the calculation of the market value of the plots of land in question. Data from neighbouring and comparable plots of land not subject to expropriation for State needs were used in the market value assessment.",

As the applicants could challenge the reports prepared by the valuer hired by the acquirer of their property, the Court finds that the applicants were afforded sufficient guarantees against arbitrariness.
