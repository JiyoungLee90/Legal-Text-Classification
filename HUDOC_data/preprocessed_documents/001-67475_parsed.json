She noted, inter alia, that the National Medico-Legal Board had initiated an inquiry into X's professional conduct in the beginning of 1994. He had been prohibited from conducting surgeries until September 1995, when he had been found capable of resuming his work as a surgeon.",

In any case the legal successors of Mrs Haapalainen had enjoyed an independent right to bring private prosecution proceedings. The case had been investigated as suspected manslaughter, for which any criminal proceedings had been time-barred already by the time of the petition. While the Deputy Ombudsman still had the right to bring charges for aggravated manslaughter, she concluded that this was no longer appropriate.",

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d (see Handyside v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 7\u00a0December 1976, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a024, p.\u00a023, \u00a7\u00a049 and Jersild v.\u00a0Denmark, judgment of 23\u00a0September 1994, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0298, p.\u00a026, \u00a7\u00a037).

Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart \u2013 in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest (see the Jersild v. Denmark, cited above pp. 23-24, \u00a7\u00a031, the De Haes and Gijsels v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 24\u00a0February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I, pp. 233-34, \u00a7 37, and the Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas judgment cited above, \u00a7 59). Not only does it have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them (see Thorgeir Thorgeirson v.\u00a0Iceland, judgment of 25\u00a0June 1992, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0239, p.\u00a027, \u00a7\u00a063). In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see the Prager and Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 26\u00a0April 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0313, p.\u00a019, \u00a7 38, and the Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas judgment cited above, \u00a7\u00a059).

As mentioned above, the article of 27 February 1996 did mention that \u201cno one [could] be considered guilty\u201d, but this assertion was made in connection with the National Medico-Legal Board's conclusions. In any case there was no express mention of the waiver of charges although it is common ground between the parties that the applicant was aware of that decision before writing the article. It is observed however that in the Court of Appeal the applicant testified that although aware of the decision, she obtained a copy of the decision only after the publication of 27 February 1996. In evaluating the importance of this fact the Court has taken into account the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman's decision of 22 March 2001. Although the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman did not expressly state her opinion concerning the lawfulness of X's actions and she refrained from bringing an action herself, her decision nevertheless supports the view that based on the pre-trial records a court ruling would have been preferable and, thus, that there were relevant reasons to press charges against X. This finding lends support to the approach to the facts taken by the applicant in the contested articles, or, at the very least, suggests that the content of the articles had not been erroneous or that the applicant had not failed to verify the facts appropriately.",

Accordingly, careful scrutiny is called for on the part of the Court of the proportionality of measures taken by national authorities which are capable of discouraging the press from performing its vital role as \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d. However, the exercise of the freedoms guaranteed by Article 10 carries with it \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d which not only apply to the press but assume special significance when, as in the present case, the statements made may affect the reputation and rights of other private individuals. As the Court has consistently held, these duties and responsibilities are such that the guarantees afforded to journalists by Article 10, in reporting on issues of general interest, are subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism. Thus, special grounds are required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals. Whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their source as reliable with respect to the allegations (see, among other authorities, McVicar v. the United Kingdom, no. 46311/99, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2002\u2013III and Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.

However, the articles of 4 January 1996 and 27 February 1996 which were the subject of the defamation proceedings against the applicant differ from that of 9 January 1996 in that they focussed on the specific case of the operation carried out by surgeon X, which resulted in the death of Mrs Haapalainen. Both articles, as found by the national courts, contained a clear allegation that X had been drunk or had been suffering from a hangover while operating on Mrs Haapalainen and that this had led to her death \u2013 an allegation which, as the Court of Appeal observed, was of the utmost seriousness for the reputation and professional standing of a practising surgeon.

But both courts also stressed that such criticism had to be appropriate and based on fact. While the media may not always be able to obtain confirmation of the absolute veracity of information which was to be published, such information should, in the view of the Court of Appeal, at any rate be sufficiently grounded in fact and allegations against a specific person should be critically examined.

Moreover, despite being aware of the conclusions of the National Medico-Legal Board, as well as the fact that no prosecution had been brought against X, the applicant had failed to check in detail the terms of the Board's opinion or the outcome of the pre-trial investigation. This being so, the applicant had accused X of an offence, as well as of reprehensible conduct, \u201cwithout having verified the allegations and without having had any objectively weighty grounds or likely reasons for considering the defamatory allegations truthful\u201d.

The fact that the information in the article of 27 February 1996 was obtained from public pre-trial records and contained direct quotations from statements by hospital staff has to be viewed in the light of the national courts' finding that the applicant had selected only those parts of the records which supported her own thesis and, more importantly, that she had omitted to mention that the County Prosecutor had issued a reasoned decision not to institute criminal proceedings \u2013 a decision reached on the basis of all the material in the pre-trial file.

It is also pointed out that the 's decision has in any event to be seen in the light of the decision of 22 March 2001 of the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman. I do not consider that either point assists the applicant. The Prosecutor's decision had been taken in April 1994, nearly two years before the impugned articles were published. I find it difficult to see how the failure of the applicant to obtain a copy of the decision before publication of the two articles may be said to be consistent with the diligence expected of a responsible journalist. Moreover, when judging the necessity and proportionality of measures taken by the national courts in 1998 and 1999, I cannot attach much weight to the fact that in 2001 the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman voiced a view different from that of the County Prosecutor some 7 years before. Still less can I accept that the decision of the Deputy Ombudsman suggests, as the judgment of the Chamber argues, that \u201cthe applicant had not failed to verify the facts appropriately\u201d (judgment, \u00a7 62).",

In this respect the case is to be distinguished from that of Bergens Tidende and Others v.
