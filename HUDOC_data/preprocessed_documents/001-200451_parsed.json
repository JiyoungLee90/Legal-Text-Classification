However, none of those theories appear convincing. There is no evidence in the case file suggesting that Mukhumad Magomadov had any enemies, unpaid debts or could have fallen victim to a blood feud. The allegation that he had left for Syria was rebutted by witness statements showing that he had left home on a winter\u2019s day wearing flip-flops and indoor clothing, leaving his passport at home (see paragraphs 10 and 29 above). Moreover, he did not buy any travel tickets, which he would have needed for the trip (see paragraph 48 above).",

It finds that the applicant, his wife, must be considered a victim of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the distress and anguish she has suffered, and continues to suffer, as a result of her inability to ascertain the fate of her missing spouse and of the manner in which her complaints have been dealt with.
