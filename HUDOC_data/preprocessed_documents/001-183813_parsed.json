It observes that in the decision of 28\u00a0August 1992 to strike the factory building claimed by the applicants out of the register of State properties the mayor of Gabrovo relied expressly on the Restitution Act (see paragraph 6 above). The fact of the restitution was also recognised in the notary deed obtained by the first applicant and his brother in 1993 (ibid.). Soon after that the State-owned company T. started paying rent to the first applicant and his brother, and continued paying such rent, after 1997 to the two applicants, until its privatisation in 2003 (see paragraph 10 above). Moreover, in 1999, when awarding the first applicant and his brother compensation for the factory\u2019s moveable properties, the Minister of Economy pointed out that the factory building had been the subject of restitution (see paragraph 9 above). As in Yavashev and Others, this continued recognition of the restitution and treatment of the applicants as owners of the property at issue (contrast Velikin and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria ((dec.), no. 28936/03, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68, 1 December 2009), coupled with the fact that the Restitution Act provided for restitution by operation of law (see paragraph 16 above), meant that the applicants had a proprietary interest protected under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Moreover, in case where the restitution was deemed impossible the applicants were, in principle, entitled to compensation. As in Yavashev and Others (see paragraph 27 above), the Court thus concludes that the applicants had \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

Seeing, as mentioned above, that restitution under the Restitution Act occurred ex lege (see paragraph 16 above), the applicants, faced with such recognition and in the absence of any other decision challenging the restitution, must have had a justified assumption that such restitution had taken place. Thus, it was not unreasonable on their part not to apply at the time for compensation under the Compensation Act. It was only in 2003 that the restitution was for the first time contested, and a national court found that no restitution had taken place only in 2010 (see paragraphs 10-12 above). This passage of time is especially relevant in the case, since the time-limit for the applicants to apply for compensation under the Compensation Act expired on 22 November 1998 (see Yavashev and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7 65). In 2011, when they finally applied for such compensation, their application was dismissed as time-barred (see paragraph 13 above).",

Neither was any payment of rent on the part of company T. a replacement of the compensation due by the State in cases where restitution of nationalised property could not take place, as provided for in the Restitution Act and the Compensation Act (see paragraph 17 above; the payment of rent by company T. may however be relevant in the assessment under Article 41 of the Convention of any losses incurred by the applicants).",
