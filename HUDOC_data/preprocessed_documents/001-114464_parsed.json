K.\u2019s expert report, delivered to them on 13 February 2006. As to the impartiality of L.\u00a0K., the court emphasised that he had been the only expert to see the damages on-site in 1996. Ten years after the occurrence of the damages, appointing a further forensic expert to proceed on the basis of documentary evidence would have been futile in the court\u2019s opinion. In addition, L.
