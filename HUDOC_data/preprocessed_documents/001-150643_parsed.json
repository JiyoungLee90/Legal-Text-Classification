Only because the medical commissions had recognised in those five cases the claimants\u2019 right to disability benefits under national law, had the courts awarded damages in subsequent proceedings brought under section 1 of the SMRDA. The legal basis for those awards had been the second decision of the medical commission. In the present case, the medical commission had made no such decision.

That same claim was examined by the courts continually, during a judicial process in the context of which the applicant asserted that the medical commission had repeatedly failed to assess her actual state of health despite a first judgment instructing it to do so.

In addition, the subsequently adopted Code of Administrative Procedure 2006, although not applicable at the time of the facts, also provides that where administrative courts quash an administrative act they are to return the case file to the responsible administrative body with mandatory instructions as to the interpretation and application of the law (see paragraph 22 above). The Court also notes that it has earlier held, in the context of complaints about failure to comply with administrative courts\u2019 judgments in a number of cases in respect of Bulgaria, that compliance with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention required administrative bodies to act in accordance with the findings and indications in the courts\u2019 final judgments (see Basarba OOD v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 77660/01, \u00a7 32, 7\u00a0January 2010; Popnikolov v.

Therefore, in the present case the NEMC had to act in application of the domestic court\u2019s final judgment and had to do so complying with the latter\u2019s indications which were mandatory. The Court observes in that connection that the domestic courts had unequivocally held that, in order to determine the percentage of disability, the NEMC needed to assess the actual state of health of the applicant (see\u00a0paragraph 14 above). For that the NEMC had to take into account all conditions from which she chronically suffered as established by the medical reports accepted by the court. On the basis of that assessment the NEMC had to determine the applicant\u2019s overall disability in percentage terms.",

The Court then notes that the NEMC decision of October 2005 stated that it \u201cconfirms the rest of the elements\u201d (see\u00a0paragraph 16 above), presumably referring to the elements it had listed in its 9 October 2003 decision. However, the 2003 NEMC decision had been quashed by the court in its entirety and so the NEMC could not confirm parts of it. In its decision of 2005 the NEMC was called upon to determine the disability percentage assessing anew all relevant elements, on the basis of the four medical conditions accepted by the court in 2005. It is not apparent from the NEMC decision of 28 October 2005 that such a full new assessment was indeed carried out. The Court is therefore not convinced that the medical commission assessed the applicant\u2019s actual state of health, as it should have, before determining the percentage of her disability. It finds that the specific and clear instructions, namely to take into account all four medical conditions of which the applicant had been found to suffer, which the domestic court had given to the administrative body, were not complied with by the NEMC. The Court reiterates in that connection that it remained in the NEMC\u2019s exclusive competence to determine the percentage of disability.",
