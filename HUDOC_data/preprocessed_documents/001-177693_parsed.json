They failed to mention any case-specific facts relevant to those grounds and to substantiate them with relevant and sufficient reasons (see Farhad Aliyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 191-94, and Muradverdiyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a087-91).",

However, the Court reiterates that under Article 5 \u00a7 3 grounds such as the need to implement further investigative measures, or the fact that proceedings have not yet been completed, do not correspond to any of the acceptable reasons for detaining a person pending trial (see Allahverdiyev, cited above, \u00a7 60).",
