It is because of the coincidence of its moral postulates with these ideas that Christianity became well set in Europe. No other religion may be spread, disseminated in Europe. Europe has always refused and refuses the deceitful humanist ideas of other religions, including Islam. Morality in Islam is a juggling act; its humanism is not convincing. The Islamic humanism criteria cannot even resist the dialectic materialist criticism that we learnt by heart, became accustomed to. Islam is a type of Eastern despotism and may be considered only as one of the modifications of despotism. Islam would never transform into a moral imperative in Europe; it is incapable of that. Although it was carried as a coffin on the shoulders of the Ottoman Empire throughout Europe, no place was found to put it down. It was again brought and placed in the East, in the direction of Mecca. A man worshipping Jesus Christ would never give any consideration to the Prophet Muhammad. In comparison with Jesus Christ, the father of war fatwas (m\u00fcharib\u0259 f\u0259tvalar\u0131n\u0131n atas\u0131) the Prophet Muhammad is simply a frightful creature (qorxunc bir m\u0259xluqdur).

The margin of appreciation of States is thus reduced where a debate on a matter of public interest is concerned (see Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, \u00a7 159, 23 June 2016, and Satakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v. Finland [GC], no. 931/13, \u00a7 167, 27 June 2017). As paragraph 2 of Article 10 recognises, however, the exercise of freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities. Amongst them, in the context of religious beliefs, is the general requirement to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under Article 9 to the holders of such beliefs including a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is, in regard to objects of veneration, gratuitously offensive to others and profane (see Giniewski v. France, no. 64016/00, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2006I, and Sekmadienis Ltd. v. Lithuania, no. 69317/14, \u00a7 74, 30 January 2018). Where such expressions go beyond the limits of a critical denial of other people\u2019s religious beliefs and are likely to incite religious intolerance, for example in the event of an improper or even abusive attack on an object of religious veneration, a State may legitimately consider them to be incompatible with respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion and take proportionate restrictive measures (see for example, mutatis mutandis, OttoPreminger-Institut v.
