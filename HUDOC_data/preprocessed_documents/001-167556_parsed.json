Where an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article\u00a035\u00a7\u00a01 to take the start of the six-month period as the date on which the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001). The Court further reiterates that in cases where an individual raises an arguable claim concerning willful ill-treatment by the State authorities, a breach of Article\u00a03 cannot be remedied exclusively through an award of compensation to the victim, as this provision requires, by implication, that there should be an effective official investigation into the relevant facts (see Vladimir Romanov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 41461/02, \u00a7\u00a7 78 and 81, 24 July 2008).",

Inter alia, an instruction on providing medical assistance to persons brought to the medical sobering-up centres, which was part of these by-laws, contained rules on determining levels of intoxication. Should the applicant have wanted to challenge the findings concerning the level of his intoxication, he could have taken a medical test in an independent facility upon his discharge. However, the applicant had not taken this opportunity and had undergone such an examination only on the following day. In addition, the Government maintained that, as could be seen from the explanation given by the officers who had removed the applicant from the public street, such a removal had been warranted by his unsteady walking and indecent behaviour (notably, his shouting obscenities).",

It is not clear from submissions by the parties and other available material what was the scope of the authority conveyed under the domestic legal order to the municipal guard officers and what were the procedural safeguards against abuse of this authority. It is likewise not clear what was the legal basis for the sobering-up centre\u2019s functioning on the date of the incident giving rise to the present application (20 February 2002). As can be seen from the case-file material before the Court, on 9 August 1999 the Cabinet of Ministers decided to close down the sobering-up centres previously managed by the police authorities and to transfer them to the municipalities with a view to their being reformed as substance-abuse assistance facilities for the public (see paragraph 30 above). The by-laws and the instruction on medical assistance to persons taken to medical sobering-up centres, to which the Government refer in their observations (see paragraph\u00a049 above), were adopted by the Lviv City Council only on 13\u00a0November 2002 (see paragraph\u00a034 above). Further, as can be seen from the text of the Shevchenkivskiy District Court\u2019s judgment of 6 June 2003, Y.B., the sobering-up centre\u2019s paramedic who examined the applicant prior to his confinement, submitted in court that he had assessed the applicant\u2019s state in accordance with an instruction provided by the medical department of the Ministry of Interior (see paragraph 22 above). However, neither this judgment nor any other document on file cites the relevant provisions or provides full reference to this legal act. Accordingly, neither the applicant, nor the Court has been able to identify the impugned document or access and consult its text. In the light of the above, the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s confinement was not based on accessible and foreseeable legal provisions. It was therefore not in accordance with the law.",

The description of the grounds on which the municipal guard officers decided to remove the applicant from a public street appears rather formulaic and lacking case-specific details (see paragraph 20 above). It is also notable that the applicant was not charged or held liable under Article\u00a0178 of the Code of Administrative Offences, which provided for sanction for appearance in public while in a state of drunkenness (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a028 above). Moreover, nothing in the case file indicates that the municipal guard officers considered any milder options, such as escorting the applicant to his home. Overall, the case-file materials do not provide sufficient evidence that the applicant\u2019s confinement in the sobering-up centre was necessary in the circumstances.",
