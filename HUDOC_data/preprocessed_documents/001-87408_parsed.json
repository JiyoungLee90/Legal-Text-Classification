Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see Schenk v. Austria, judgment of 12 July 1988, Series A no. 140, p. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, and Garcia Ruiz v. Spain, no. 30544/96, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1999-I, \u00a7 28).",

The applicant was fully able to state his case and challenge the evidence; all essential evidence was presented and the courts\u2019 decisions were satisfactorily reasoned. In these circumstances the Court finds that the case discloses no appearance of a violation of the guarantees of a fair hearing relied on by the applicant. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03 and\u00a04 of the Convention.",
