It recalls that the eventual negative repercussions on an applicant's property rights caused by the excessive length of the proceedings may be seen as a consequence of the violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and taken into account for the award of just satisfaction under the latter provision (see Varipati v.

The Court further takes note of the fact that, at the end of those proceedings, the domestic courts fixed a certain amount of compensation without taking into account the monetary depreciation which had occurred between the date when the case was lodged and the date of the decision. While the domestic courts applied the statutory interest rate to the amount of compensation, this clearly failed to cover the financial loss of the applicants. In this respect, the Court observes that while TRL 1,000,000,000 was equal to USD 22,600 in July 1995, it was equal to USD 790 in July 2001 and the applicants received USD\u00a01,850 at the end of the proceedings, covering the compensation award plus interest running from July 1995. The Court therefore concludes that the length of the proceedings in the instant case caused financial loss to the applicants as well as distress and frustration. Having regard to the above, and deciding on an equitable basis, the Court grants a total of EUR 15,000 to the applicants, jointly, covering both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.",
