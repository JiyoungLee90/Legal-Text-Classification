Greece (Article 50), judgment of 31 October 1995, Series A no.\u00a0330-B, \u00a7\u00a040, and Gridin v. , no. 4171/04, \u00a7\u00a020, 1 June 2006).

That sum was paid to the applicant in May 2006. Thus, the Court dismisses the applicant's claim under this head. As regards the remaining claims in respect of pecuniary damage, the Court observes that in the present case it has found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in that the awards in the applicant's favour had not been paid to him in good time. It recalls that the adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value, such as an extended delay in enforcement (see Gizzatova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 5124/03, \u00a7\u00a028, 13 January 2005; Metaxas v. , no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 27 May 2004). Having regard to the materials in its possession and the fact that the Government did not furnish any objection to the applicant's method of calculation of compensation, the Court awards the applicant RUR 127,230 in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable.",

Slovakia, judgment of 2\u00a0September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI, \u00a7 75). The Court further observes that the applicant provided receipts and vouchers to substantiate his expenses for preparation of documents and sending them to the Court. Regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR\u00a0135 covering costs under all heads, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
