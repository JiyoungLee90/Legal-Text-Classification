However, it is particularly struck by the fact that during one year and eight months of the privately-retained counsel\u2019s default in appearance, the trial court had failed to take advantage of the powers bestowed on it by law and invite the applicant to retain a different counsel or to assign a legal-aid lawyer in accordance with the domestic legal provisions (see paragraph 21 above). The applicant\u2019s possible lack of activity in the circumstances of detention did not \u2018absolve the court from ensuring compliance with the requirements of Article 6 concerning reasonable time\u2019 (see, mutatis mutandis, Uni\u00f3n Alimentaria Sanders S.A. v.\u00a0Spain, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 157). The Court concludes that the overall delay attributable to the authorities amounts approximately to two years and nine months. Regard being had to the fact that the applicant remained detained for all but eight months of the proceedings, it finds such inactivity unacceptable and leading to a breach of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6.",
