Whether a person has an actionable domestic claim may depend not only on the content, properly speaking, of the relevant civil right as defined under national law but also on the existence of procedural bars preventing or limiting the possibilities of bringing potential claims to court. In the latter kind of case Article 6 \u00a7 1 may be applicable (see Petko Petkov v. Bulgaria, no. 2834/06, \u00a7 26, 19\u00a0February 2013, with further reference to Al-Adsani v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001XI). By implication, where the national law defines the substantive content of the right so that it is not \u201cactionable\u201d, Article 6 does not apply.",

Sweden, 1 July 1997, \u00a7\u00a038, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV; and Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, 28 September 1995, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 327A). Furthermore, the Court has noted that \u201cthe mere fact that the wording of a legal provision affords an element of discretion does not in itself rule out the existence of a right\u201d (see Boulois v. Luxembourg, [GC], no. 37575/04, \u00a7 93, ECHR 2012; Camps v. France (dec.), no. 42401/98, 23 November 1999; and Ell\u00e8s and Others v. Switzerland, no. 12573/06, \u00a7 16, 16 December 2010). In other words, the threshold set by the Court\u2019s case-law for the applicability of Article 6 is much lower: in order to attract the protection of this provision the right claimed by the plaintiff must be recognised under the domestic law \u201cat least on arguable grounds\u201d. The dispute may concern the very existence of the right in question, precisely as in the present case. The intention is to free the domestic courts from unnecessary work and to relieve them from examining claims which are \u201cfrivolous or vexatious or otherwise lacking in foundation\u201d (Rolf Gustafson, cited above, \u00a7\u00a039).",

If this was the case, the scope of application of Article 6 (and the supervisory role of the Court) would have been substantially restricted. A mere doubt about the existence of a \u201cright\u201d would preclude the applicability of article 6 and thus the whole set of guarantees under this provision. However, it is precisely under those circumstances that the guarantees of article 6 are most needed. Such a restrictive approach would not be in conformity with the cornerstone principle of the rule of law, or indeed with the object and purpose of the Convention.",

The applicant based his claim on the fact that his daughter suffered from diabetes, that their flat was too small, and that for many years their situation had remained the same despite the family being simultaneously on three waiting lists. Those facts were contested neither in the domestic proceedings nor by the Government. It is not disputed that diabetes was on the list of illnesses which conferred the right of inclusion on the \u201cfirst priority\u201d waiting list under the old Housing Code and the Decree of 28 March 1983 of the Ministry of Public Health of the USSR. Under the new Housing Code also \u201csevere chronic illness\u201d of a member of the family was mentioned as a ground for entitlement to additional living space. The applicant, referring to these acts, claimed that his family was entitled to additional housing. Whereas diabetes was not included in the list of \u201csevere chronic illnesses\u201d which entitled the family to the \u201cextraordinary\u201d (that is, priority or \u201cout of turn\u201d) provision of additional housing, the new Housing Code empowered the Government to establish such a list (see Government Decree no. 378 of 16 June 2006), and it was for the courts to ascertain whether the applicant\u2019s family was eligible to obtain better housing. Thus, the applicant\u2019s interpretation of the law and the facts was not \u201cfrivolous\u201d and his claim was not \u201cvexatious\u201d. It was rather his bona fide understanding of the meaning of the \u201cright to housing\u201d as proclaimed in the Constitution and the Housing Code, and of the \u201cbenefits\u201d made available to disabled people by Government Decree no. 901 of 27 July 1996 (see paragraph 21 of the judgment).",

Thus, this claim attracted the protection of Article 6 of the Convention. However, by terminating the proceedings without addressing the substance of the applicant\u2019s arguments and without rendering a judgment on the merits, the courts denied the applicant access to court. In our opinion, there has therefore been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on that account.",
