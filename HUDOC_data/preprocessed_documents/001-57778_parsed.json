Could it reasonably be asked of people, he continued, to envisage exceptions being made to the normal rule, namely that the time allowed for appealing should begin to run from publication in the case of general regulatory decisions and from notification in the case of individual decisions? Where appeals and the procedures for bringing them were concerned, things should be simple.

For such decisions, the Government continued, publication in the Official Gazette was itself sufficient to cause the time allowed for appealing to begin to run. Furthermore, Article 7 of the decree of 13 June 1969 required notification only if the designation decree imposed any specific restrictions on a given tract of land (see paragraph 19 above); the decree in issue did not, however, contain any such restrictions. The Government conceded that these rules did limit public access to the courts to some degree, but argued that such a limitation was justified by the need to establish a simple, fair process for private individuals while ensuring lasting protection for the common national heritage. Lastly, the choice of time for notifying the decision to the applicant after it had been published (see paragraph 12 above), although psychologically unfortunate for him, was purely coincidental and had no legal consequences since in this instance notification was a purely optional formality.",

When these requirements are being formulated, regard must be had to the nature of the right on which the limitations at issue have been imposed. Given the great importance in our democratic societies of the \"right of access to a court\", there must be no possibility of misunderstandings as to the limitations placed on it, such as the point at which the time allowed for appealing starts to run.
