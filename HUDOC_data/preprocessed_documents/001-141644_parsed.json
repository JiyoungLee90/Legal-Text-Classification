In the instant case, there had been a threefold breach of those requirements. Firstly, the requesting party had only submitted the text of the Cypriot court judgment to the Latvian court, and not the certificate required in accordance with Annex V to the Regulation. In that connection the applicant acknowledged that under Article 55(1) of the Regulation the court in which enforcement was sought could, in some circumstances, exempt the requesting party from the obligation to produce a certificate; however, in the present case, the Latgale District Court had omitted to explain whether and for what reason it considered that the requesting party could be exempted from that obligation. Secondly, the Cypriot judgment itself had contained no reference to its entry into force or possible remedies. Lastly, in order to be enforced in accordance with the Regulation, a judgment had to be enforceable in the country of origin; however, none of the documents produced by the company demonstrated that the judgment of 24 May 2004 was enforceable in Cyprus. The applicant therefore concluded that the judgment could under no circumstances be recognised and enforced in Latvia.",

As to the Government\u2019s assertion that the applicant had implicitly acknowledged the validity of the debt claimed by F.H.

His complaint, indeed, consists in alleging that the Latvian courts ordered the enforcement of a judgment given by a Cypriot court although he had not been correctly summoned to appear before the latter in order to defend his case. Accordingly, the Court fails to see how, at this stage, the applicant could be criticised for not having challenged the validity of the debt in question at the domestic level, given that his complaint is precisely that he was not in a position to do so (see, mutatis mutandis, Joos v. Switzerland, no. 43245/07, \u00a7\u00a019, 15 November 2012, and, conversely, Shefer v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a045175/04, \u00a7\u00a7 24-25, 13 March 2012). It therefore considers that the first condition laid down in Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Convention, namely the absence of significant disadvantage to the applicant, has not been satisfied.",

In that connection the Court has previously held that, in Latvia, an individual constitutional complaint constitutes a remedy to be exhausted where the complaint in question concerns a legislative provision or regulation which the applicant considers to be incompatible per se with the Convention (see Gri\u0161ankova and Gri\u0161ankovs v. Latvia (dec.), no. 36117/02, ECHR 2003II). By contrast, this remedy has been held not to be effective where the alleged violation results from the supposedly erroneous interpretation or application of a domestic legal provision which, in itself, is not alleged to be unconstitutional or incompatible with the Convention (see Liep\u0101jnieks v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a037586/06, \u00a7 73, 2 November 2010, and Savi\u010ds v.\u00a0Latvia, no. 17892/03, \u00a7\u00a7 113-14, 27 November 2012).

As required by Article 36 of the Regulation, the Senate had not reviewed the Cypriot judgment on the merits.

However, that exception was subject to the following condition: \u201cunless he had the opportunity to appeal against the judgment and did not do so\u201d. As the applicant had not appealed against the Limassol District Court judgment of 24 May 2004, and there had been nothing to prevent him from so doing, the above-mentioned exception did not apply. The Government submitted that they were not competent to comment on Cypriot domestic law: however, it could certainly be presumed that the judgment at issue had been open to appeal in Cyprus (if necessary, by requesting an extension of the time-limit for appealing after it had expired). Moreover, in the Government\u2019s submission, since the applicant had accepted the choice of law and jurisdiction clauses which made the deed of acknowledgement of debt subject to Cypriot law and to the jurisdiction of the Cypriot courts, he must be presumed to be very familiar with the relevant provisions of Cypriot law. In that connection the Government produced the record of the hearing of the Riga Regional Court of 2 October 2006, according to which the applicant\u2019s lawyer had stated twice that his client had not appealed against the Cypriot judgment.",

Indeed the Regional Court accepted those arguments and rejected the request for execution of the Cypriot judgment. The Supreme Court quashed the Regional Court\u2019s judgment and granted the request for execution. We find it highly problematic that the only reason given by the Supreme Court for refusing to uphold the applicant\u2019s allegations of not having been duly notified of the Cypriot judgment was to say that those arguments \u201c[were] of no importance\u201d (see paragraph 22).",

The Court has always reiterated that its power to review compliance with domestic law is limited, as it is in the first place for the national authorities to interpret and apply that law (see Mkrtchyan v. Armenia, no. 6562/03, \u00a7 43, 11\u00a0January 2007). However, the majority did not consider that this was a fourthinstance case. The majority based their finding that there had been no violation of Article 6 on two grounds. First, they referred to the Bosphorus principle, saying that the standard of protection of fundamental rights in the EU was equivalent to that required under the Convention (see paragraph 47), and that compliance with the obligations flowing from the State\u2019s membership of the EU was a matter of general interest (see paragraph 49). Second, they considered that the applicant should have known that he had to repay the debt and should not therefore have been surprised that he was pursued by the creditor in the courts in Cyprus (see paragraph 51).",

That is not an issue to be considered by this Court, however, and still less an issue that should be turned into one of the main reasons for its findings. It is a matter for the domestic courts. Second, EU Regulations are directly applicable in the EU Member States, which means that national authorities should apply the relevant legal provisions while also taking into consideration the caselaw of the EU Court of Justice. The Brussels Regulation provides for exceptions to automatic execution of judgments, notably in Article 34(2). We also note that the Court of Justice has spelt out that where the defendant claims, under Article 34(2), not to have been properly notified the judge of the receiving State is competent to examine the evidence (see paragraph 29, and also 26). In other words, the applicable EU law does not provide for blind automaticity as concerns the execution of judgments. Third, we note that in accordance with the Court\u2019s wellestablished case-law Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect. The principle of equality of arms is one element of the broader concept of a fair trial within the meaning of that provision. It requires a \u201cfair balance\u201d between the parties: each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present their case under conditions that do not place them at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis their opponent or opponents (see, for example, Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others v. Spain, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2004III). As these principles are aimed at all aspects of the procedural law of the Contracting States, they also apply to this particular area of service of judicial documents on the parties (see Miholapa v. Latvia, no.\u00a061655/00, \u00a7 23, 31 May 2007). Contrary to the majority, we consider the answer given by the Supreme Court of Latvia to the applicant\u2019s submission that he was not properly notified of the judgment of the Cypriot courts totally insufficient to meet the requirements of Article 6 and especially bearing in mind the applicable EU law.",

It should have been for the domestic courts to examine and give reasons why, for example, the exception relied on could not be maintained on the facts of the case. There probably were good reasons, but we do not know what they were. Still less is it for us to provide such reasons. The fact remains that the majority have departed from the Court\u2019s case-law. Additionally, we are not sure that the implicit approval of the manner in which the Latvian Supreme Court applied the EU law is in fact consistent with EU law. While the Court is not competent to interpret EU law, we submit that it should not implicitly approve of domestic practices that may go against EU law. This is a new situation for the Court which merits very serious further reflection.",
