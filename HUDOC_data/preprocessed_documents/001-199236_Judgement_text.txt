The case originated in an application (no. 6982/18) against the Republic of Lithuania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Lithuanian national, Mr Danas Steponavičius (“the applicant”), on 30 January 2018.
The Lithuanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms L. Urbaitė.
On 31 January 2019 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1979 and is detained in Vilnius.
The applicant was detained in Lukiškės Remand Prison from an unspecified date in 2011 to 5 August 2015.
On 25 July 2016 he lodged a civil claim against the State, alleging that he had been detained in overcrowded and unsanitary cells. He claimed 100,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.
On 30 September 2016 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court allowed the applicant’s claim in part. It firstly held that the time-limit for claiming damages was three years after the damage arose, and accordingly dismissed the part of the applicant’s claim concerning the period before 26 July 2013 as time-barred. The court then examined the documents provided by the prison administration and found that, during the entire remaining period, the applicant had had more than 3.6 sq. m of personal space, in line with the domestic law. It also dismissed the applicant’s complaints concerning insufficient furniture in the cells, inadequate ventilation and lack of cleaning equipment. However, the court considered that the prison administration had failed to refute the applicant’s allegations that there had been fungus in the cells, that the lighting had been insufficient and that there had been no toilets in the prison gym. Furthermore, the court found that the sanitary units in the cells had been separated from the rest of the cells by a 1.5-metre partition, which had not ensured sufficient privacy for the applicant when using the facilities because he could have been seen by other detainees and prison guards. Accordingly, the court concluded that the conditions of the applicant’s detention had not complied with the domestic requirements, and awarded him EUR 200 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.
The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision, and on 11 October 2017 the Supreme Administrative Court allowed his appeal in part. It upheld the lower court’s findings on the conditions of the applicant’s detention. It further observed that in his complaint the applicant had alleged that he had been unable to take a shower in private and that the showers had lacked shelves, mirrors and hangers. Since the prison administration had not refuted those allegations, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled in favour of the applicant. It increased the award in respect of non-pecuniary damage to EUR 400.
