In refusing the transfer of custody, the District Court relied, inter alia, on the public health officer\u2019s certificates according to which A. had been in a good physical and psychological state, as well as T., although the medical officer had also found a retardation in the latter\u2019s linguistic skills and striking deficiencies in his social behaviour.

The court noted that the living conditions at the applicant\u2019s place were below average. Nevertheless the children\u2019s well-being was not in danger. The incident which led to the taking away of T. and A. was a unique one and the applicant cared sufficiently for her children, having regard both to their psychological and physical well-being.

On a visit to Lambach by a staff member of the Youth Welfare Office on 16 August 1995, the applicant had not permitted the official to enter her home on the grounds of desolate living conditions and the decrepit state of the building.

After returning to the applicant, R. had been subject to systematic and repeated abuse by P.F., the applicant\u2019s then companion, who had almost daily beaten R. and had treated him in a degrading manner. In 1993 R. had been committed to hospital because of injuries inflicted on him by P.F. Thereupon criminal proceedings against the applicant and P.F. for abuse of minors had been instituted. In November 1994 P.F. had been convicted of this offence and sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant had been acquitted. At the same time, custody of R. had been transferred to the Youth Welfare Office. He was no longer living with the applicant.

In August 1995 the applicant had not had the children with her at all but had placed them in the custody of a former companion whose identity had not been disclosed to the Youth Welfare Office. Less intrusive measures such as educational support for parents (Erziehungshilfe) could not have been used as the applicant refused to co-operate with the Youth Welfare Office. It had also not been possible to transfer custody of the children to a close relative as no such person was available. Even though custody was removed from the applicant, she maintained certain minimum rights, such as visiting them and being heard before important decisions on educational issues were taken, which had the purpose of maintaining family links and to make possible the family\u2019s later reunification.
