This was first publicly announced in Parliament by Mr Leon Brittan on 30 November 1983 (Hansard (House of Commons Debates) cols.\u00a0505-507). In essence, the tariff approach involves breaking down the life sentence into component parts, namely retribution, deterrence and protection of the public. The \u201ctariff\u201d represents the minimum period which the prisoner will have to serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. The Home Secretary will not refer the case to the Parole Board until three years before the expiry of the tariff period, and will not exercise his discretion to release on licence until after the tariff period has been completed (per Lord Browne-Wilkinson, R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte V. and T., [1998] Appeal Cases 407, at pp.\u00a0492G-493A).",

In criminal matters, it is clear that Article 6 \u00a7 1 covers the whole of the proceedings in issue, including appeal proceedings and the determination of sentence (see, for example, Eckle v. Germany, judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, pp. 34-35, \u00a7\u00a7 76-77). The fixing of the tariff, which is the part of the sentence said to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence, has been found to constitute part of the sentencing exercise for young offenders detained during Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure (see V. v. the United Kingdom ([GC] no. 24888/94, ECHR 1999-IX, \u00a7\u00a7 109-111) and for adult prisoners sentenced to mandatory life sentences for murder (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, ECHR 2002-IV, \u00a7 87). The Court finds that the same analysis applies to the fixing of the tariff for adults sentenced to discretionary life sentences. It amounts to a sentencing exercise and Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 is, accordingly, applicable to this procedure.",

The Secretary of State then proceeded to fix the tariff, after consulting the judiciary, at 16 years in a decision dated 5 February 1998. Though at the same time, the Secretary of State certified that the discretionary life provisions should apply to the applicant, the further procedure of review of the applicant\u2019s tariff was conducted by the Secretary of State again, who reduced it to 12.5 years following the recommendation of the Lord Chief Justice.",

The Government disputed however that any issue arose from the fact that the tariff was fixed by the Secretary of State since he followed the recommendations of the judiciary. The Court would observe that the sentencing exercise carried out in criminal cases must necessarily be carried out by an independent and impartial tribunal, namely, a court offering guarantees and procedure of a judicial nature.
