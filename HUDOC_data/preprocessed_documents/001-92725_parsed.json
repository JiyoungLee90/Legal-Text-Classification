Yet it does not deem it necessary to establish whether the third applicant shared his conclusion as to the nature of the premises in which he had been kept with the investigators, since the building in question was most likely located inside Urus-Martan. Indeed, the Court doubts that some fifteen to thirty armed men escorting the two captured persons could have easily walked a long way out of Urus-Martan in fifty minutes and found a large building outside a settlement. Accordingly, it considers that the two Nenkayev brothers were walked through Urus-Martan and taken to premises located within the town.",

Furthermore, the investigation has been resumed by the prosecuting authorities themselves a number of times due to the need to take additional investigative measures. However, they still failed to investigate the applicants\u2019 allegations properly. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative steps that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted.

It has also found that, in view of all the known circumstances, he should be considered dead and that the responsibility for his death lies with the State authorities (see paragraph 146 above). The Court notes, however, that the exact way in which Muslim Nenkayev died and whether he was subjected to ill-treatment while in detention have not been established, and finds that this complaint has not been substantiated.",

Relevant elements will include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, the involvement of the family member in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person and the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries. The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not mainly lie in the fact of the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the family member but rather concerns the authorities\u2019 reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities\u2019 conduct (see Orhan v. Turkey, no.\u00a025656/94, \u00a7\u00a0358, 18 June 2002, and Imakayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0164).",

The Court also points out that the third applicant was arrested together with his brother and then detained for twenty-four hours and that the domestic investigation concerned the kidnapping of the two Nenkayevs. It follows that the third applicant was directly involved in communication with the authorities. However, no evidence has been submitted to the Court that the other seven applicants participated in the search for Muslim Nenkayev (see, by contrast, Luluyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0112). In such circumstances, the Court, while accepting that the events of 8 June 2002 might have been a source of considerable distress to the fourth to tenth applicants, is nevertheless unable to conclude that their mental suffering was distinct from the inevitable emotional distress in a situation such as in the present case and that it was so serious that it fell within the ambit of Article 3 of the Convention.",

Secondly, the Government did not specify what type of claim or complaint would have been an effective remedy and before which authority it should have been lodged in their view. Neither did they provide any further information as to how this could have provided the third applicant with adequate redress. The Court thus finds that the Government have not substantiated their claim that the remedies that the third applicant had allegedly failed to exhaust in relation to his complaints concerning his unacknowledged detention were effective (see, among other authorities, Kranz v.

Taking into consideration the applicants\u2019 family ties with Muslim Nenkayev, the Court accepts that they have suffered non-pecuniary damage which cannot be compensated for solely by the findings of violations. It finds it appropriate to award EUR 20,000 to the first and second applicants jointly, EUR 10,000 to the third applicant and EUR 750 to the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth applicants each, plus any tax that may be chargeable thereon.",
