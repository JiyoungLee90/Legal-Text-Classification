The Government argued that the House of Representatives was \"an independent and impartial tribunal established by law\" for the purpose of hearing the disciplinary charge against Mr Demicoli. The Maltese House of Representatives was an independent authority \"par excellence\". The House was independent of the executive and of the parties, its Members were elected for a term of five years and its proceedings afforded the necessary guarantees. Accordingly it fulfilled all the requirements of a tribunal set out in the Ringeisen judgment of 16 July 1971 (Series A no. 13, p. 39, para. 95). The independence of the House was sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt as to its impartiality. Moreover, the Members directly satirised by the article intervened to defend the dignity of the House and not just their own reputations.",
