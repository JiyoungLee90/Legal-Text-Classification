Materials ... incomplete though they are, reveal different responses to the problem of enforcement. Under some legal systems (Spain, Belgium and  are examples) the registered owner is presumed to be the driver guilty of minor traffic infractions unless he shows that some other person was driving at the relevant time or establishes some other ground of exoneration. There being a clear public interest in enforcement of road traffic legislation the crucial question in this case is whether section 172 represents a disproportionate response, or one that undermines a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, if an admission of being the driver is relied on at trial.",

In contrast, it may be acknowledged, the percentage of alcohol in her blood was a fact, existing before she blew into the breathalyser machine.

It is true that section 172(2)(b) permits a question to be asked of \u2018any other person\u2019 who, if not the owner or driver, might not be said to have impliedly accepted the regulatory regime, but someone who was not the owner or driver would not incriminate himself whatever answer he gave.

There were very good reasons why the owner should be required to identify the driver: driving offences are intended to deter dangerous conduct which causes risk to the public and deterrence depended on effective enforcement (research showed that speed cameras, etc., had reduced crashes by up to 28%), there was no obvious generally effective alternative to the power contained in section 172 and without such a power it would be impossible to investigate and prosecute traffic offences effectively, and the simple fact of being the driver of a motor car was not in itself incriminating. Nor did section 172 breach the presumption of innocence as the overall burden of proof remained on the prosecution. It provided for the putting of a single question in particular circumstances and all the usual protections against the use of unreliable evidence or evidence obtained by improper means remained in place, while the maximum penalty was only a fine of GBP 1,000.",

John Murray v. the  (8 February 1996, Reports 1996I) concerned, amongst other things, the drawing of inferences from a person\u2019s silence during questioning and trial. The Court found that there was no doubt that \u201cthe right to remain silent under police questioning and the privilege against self-incrimination are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6 ... By providing the accused with protection against improper compulsion by the authorities these immunities contribute to avoiding miscarriages of justice and to securing the aims of Article 6\u201d (see John Murray, cited above, \u00a7 45). The Court saw two extremes. On the one hand, it was self-evident that it was incompatible with the immunities to base a conviction solely or mainly on the accused\u2019s silence or on a refusal to answer questions or to give evidence himself. On the other hand, the immunities could and should not prevent the accused\u2019s silence from being taken into account in situations which clearly called for an explanation. The conclusion was that the \u201cright to remain silent\u201d was not absolute (ibid., \u00a7\u00a047). In discussing the degree of compulsion in the case, the Court noted that the applicant\u2019s silence did not amount to a criminal offence or contempt of court, and that silence could not, in itself, be regarded as an indication of guilt (ibid., \u00a7 48). The Court thus distinguished the case from Funke, where the degree of compulsion had, in effect, \u201cdestroyed the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 49).",

The domestic provisions required company officers to produce books and documents, to attend before inspectors and to assist inspectors in their investigation on pain of a fine or committal to prison for two years. The Court referred to the cases in John Murray and Funke, and found that the right not to incriminate oneself was primarily concerned with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent. It did not extend to the use in criminal proceedings of material which may be obtained from the accused through the use of compulsory powers but which had an existence independent of the will of the suspect, such as breath, blood and urine samples. The Court held that the question whether the use made by the prosecution of the statements obtained from the applicant by the inspectors under compulsion amounted to an unjustifiable infringement of the right \u201chad to be examined in the light of all the circumstances of the case\u201d: in particular, it had to be determined whether the applicant had been subjected to compulsion to give evidence and whether the use made of the resulting testimony offended the basic principles of a fair procedure under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Saunders, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 67 and 69).",

It then found, after considering the various procedural protections available, that the \u201cdegree of compulsion\u201d imposed on the applicants, namely, a conviction and imprisonment for failing to give \u201ca full account of [their] movements and actions during any specified period and all information in [their] possession in relation to the commission or intended commission [of specified offences]\u201d, \u201cin effect destroyed the very essence of their privilege against self-incrimination and their right to remain silent\u201d. Thereafter, the Court considered that the security and public-order concerns relied on by the Government could not justify the provision (see Heaney and McGuinness, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47-58, with reference back to \u00a7 24).",

Even if the defendant\u2019s active participation is required, it can be seen from Saunders that this concerns material produced by the normal functioning of the body (such as, for example, breath, urine or voice samples). In contrast, compelling the applicant in the instant case to regurgitate the evidence sought required the forcible introduction of a tube through his nose and the administration of a substance so as to provoke a pathological reaction in his body. As noted earlier, this procedure was not without risk to the applicant\u2019s health.",

The Court is unable to accept this. It is true, as pointed out by the applicants, that in all the cases to date in which \u201cdirect compulsion\u201d was applied to require an actual or potential suspect to provide information which contributed, or might have contributed, to his conviction, the Court has found a violation of the applicant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. It does not, however, follow that any direct compulsion will automatically result in a violation. While the right to a fair trial under Article 6 is an unqualified right, what constitutes a fair trial cannot be the subject of a single unvarying rule but must depend on the circumstances of the particular case. This was confirmed in the specific context of the right to remain silent in Heaney and McGuinness and, more recently, in the Court\u2019s judgment in Jalloh, in which the Court identified the factors to which it would have regard in determining whether the applicant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination had been violated.",

The Court notes that, although both the compulsion and the underlying offences were \u201ccriminal\u201d in nature, the compulsion flowed from the fact, as Lord Bingham expressed it in the Privy Council in the case of Brown v. Stott (see paragraph 31 above), that \u201c[a]ll who own or drive motor cars know that by doing so they subject themselves to a regulatory regime. This regime is imposed not because owning or driving cars is a privilege or indulgence granted by the State but because the possession and use of cars (like, for example, shotguns ...) are recognised to have the potential to cause grave injury\u201d. Those who choose to keep and drive motor cars can be taken to have accepted certain responsibilities and obligations as part of the regulatory regime relating to motor vehicles, and in the legal framework of the United Kingdom these responsibilities include the obligation, in the event of suspected commission of road-traffic offences, to inform the authorities of the identity of the driver on that occasion.",

Section 172(2)(a) applies only where the driver of the vehicle is alleged to have committed a relevant offence, and authorises the police to require information only \u201cas to the identity of the driver\u201d.

In Heaney and McGuinness the applicants were required to give a \u201cfull account of [their] movements and actions during any specified period\u201d (cited above, \u00a7 24), and in Shannon, information could be sought (with only a limited legal professional privilege restriction) on any matter which appeared to the investigator to relate to the investigation (see reference at \u00a7\u00a023 of Shannon, cited above).

At his trial, he attempted to challenge the admission of the statement under sections 76 and 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, although the challenge was unsuccessful. It remained for the prosecution to prove the offence beyond reasonable doubt in ordinary proceedings, including protection against the use of unreliable evidence and evidence obtained by oppression or other improper means (but not including a challenge to the admissibility of the statement under section 172), and the defendant could give evidence and call witnesses if he wished. Again, as noted in the case of Brown v.

I repeat: I understand this line of reasoning, but I do not accept it. In my opinion, if there are so many breaches of a prohibition, it clearly means that something is wrong with the prohibition. It means that the prohibition does not reflect a pressing social need, given that so many people choose to breach it even under the threat of criminal prosecution. And if this is the case, maybe the time has come to review speed limits and to set limits that would more correctly reflect peoples\u2019 needs. We cannot force people in the twenty-first century to ride bicycles or start jogging instead of enjoying the advantages which our civilisation brings. Equally, it is difficult for me to accept the argument that hundreds of thousands of speeding motorists are wrong and only the government is right. Moreover, the government is free to breach the fundamental rights of hundreds of thousands of its citizens in the field of speed regulations.

The Government\u2019s argument that \u201cthe very fact that other legislative techniques could bring about substantially the same result indicated that questions of proportionality \u2013 rather than the absolute nature of the rights suggested by the applicants in cases of direct compulsion \u2013 were at issue\u201d (paragraph 39) is unconvincing.

Stott \u2013 accept that \u201c[t]hose who choose to keep and drive motor cars can be taken to have accepted certain responsibilities and obligations as part of the regulatory regime relating to motor violations, and in the legal framework of the United Kingdom these responsibilities include the obligation, in the event of suspected commission of road-traffic offences, to inform the authorities of the identity of the driver on that occasion.\u201d I do not agree with that view. Our own case-law makes it very clear that some rights under Article 6 can indeed be waived, provided that this is done unambiguously and in an unequivocal manner. But I sincerely doubt whether the majority accept the corollary which is unavoidable if the judgment in the present case is to be consistent with that case-law: under the British system, when it comes to the identity of the driver of a car, all those who own or drive cars are automatically presumed to have given up unambiguously and unequivocally the right to remain silent. Just to make this point clear: I accept that the driver of a car may be obliged to carry his driving licence with him and to surrender it to a police officer immediately when so requested, and also that the failure to do so may in itself be an offence. But, to use another phrase from the Court\u2019s case-law (see Saunders v. the , 17\u00a0December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI), a driving licence has \u201can existence independent of the will\u201d of the driver concerned.

Surprisingly, however, paragraph 55, which sets out the criteria on which the Court bases its examination \u201c[i]n the light of the principles contained in its Jalloh judgment, and in order to determine whether the essence of the applicant\u2019s right to remain silent and privilege against self-incrimination was infringed\u201d, makes no mention of the public interest criterion: it only mentions the other Jalloh criteria (the nature and degree of compulsion used to obtain the evidence; the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedure; and the use to which any material so obtained was put).",
