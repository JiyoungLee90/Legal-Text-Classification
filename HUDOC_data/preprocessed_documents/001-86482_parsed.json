He explained that he had been living in the flat since 1973 and that it had been privatised in his mother\u2019s name by the decision of the Executive Committee of People\u2019s Deputies of the Shahumyan District Council of Yerevan of 27 October 1994. According to the ownership certificate of 18 November 1994, the entire flat was owned solely by his mother. The memorandum of 29 April 2003 contradicted those two documents and did not correspond to the reality. There were not six people in his family, since his father had died in 1982. He finally submitted that he had been unaware of these discrepancies and had filled out the declaration of property in reliance upon the official documents he had in his possession. The District Election Commission had wrongly equated the notions of falsification and inaccuracy.",

In order to comply with the rule, normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria no.\u00a024760/94, \u00a7 85, ECHR 1999-VIII). Furthermore, the existence of remedies which are available and sufficient must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these various conditions are satisfied (see, among other authorities, De\u00a0Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, judgment of 22 May 1984, Series\u00a0A no. 77, p. 19, \u00a7\u00a039; and Vernillo v.

On the contrary, the judgment explicitly stated, with reference to Article 155 of the CCP, that it was final and not subject to appeal (see paragraph 19 above). The Court further notes that the Government did not submit any evidence (such as examples of domestic practice) in support of their claim that Article 40 of the Electoral Code, which provides an exception to Article 155 of the CCP, was applicable to the applicant\u2019s case.

The form of this ownership certificate was introduced by the authorities and contained no information on the existence of the joint tenancy and the joint tenants. According to the applicant, the authorities had accepted some years later that the standard form was incorrect and introduced a new form which included the names of all the joint tenants when property was held under a joint tenancy. Thus, the misunderstanding based on the absence of any information on common ownership in the ownership certificate had wrongly been qualified by the domestic court as \u201cfalsification\u201d. Furthermore, the judgment of the domestic court was based, inter alia, on the memorandum issued by the Real Estate Registry on 29\u00a0April 2003, which contained information contradicting the ownership certificate it had previously issued. These discrepancies could not be blamed on him and could not be considered falsification of documents, since he had had no such intention. Moreover, the memorandum itself did not correspond to the reality: his family did not have six members, since his father had died in 1982. Finally, the notion of \u201cfalsification\u201d was an offence under the criminal law. The domestic court had thus confirmed the fact of \u201cfalsification\u201d in a civil case, despite the fact that he had never been convicted of such an offence by a criminal court.",

The Court considers that the requirement to submit information on the candidate\u2019s property status serves to enable voters to make an informed choice with regard to the candidate\u2019s fortune, a factor not unimportant for forming an opinion about the candidate. The introduction of such a requirement therefore does not appear arbitrary or unreasonable (see, mutatis mutandis, Krasnov and Skuratov v. , nos. 17864/04 and 21396/04, \u00a7 44, 19 July 2007). It is also undoubtedly legitimate to ask the candidates that the information submitted be accurate to the best of their knowledge, to avoid the electorate being misled by false representations.

The Court notes however that, notwithstanding the effect of Section 13, the ownership certificate provided by the Real Estate Registry indicated the applicant\u2019s mother as the owner of the entire flat, with the word \u201cshare\u201d being expressly crossed out (see paragraph 9 above). The Government did not provide any explanation for this. Furthermore, contrary to what the Government claimed, the decision of 27 October 1994 did not specify the form of ownership the privatisation would take (see paragraph 8 above). In such circumstances, the Court does not find it unreasonable that the applicant, relying on the official documents he had in his possession, had grounds for believing that he was not a joint owner of the flat in question.",

The Court, however, is not convinced by this argument. Having regard to the application for privatisation filed by the applicant\u2019s mother, the Court notes that the applicant and other adult members of his family, while giving their consent to the privatisation of the flat by signing the application, did not choose either of the two options listed in Section 11 of the application and simply requested that the flat be privatised in the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s name (see paragraph 7 above). Such an alternative, however, was apparently not envisaged by Section 13 of the Law on Privatisation. This suggests that the applicant and other members of his family were either not aware of the requirements of that provision or, even if they were, had misconstrued them. It therefore cannot be said that the applicant was fully aware of the legal consequences of his written consent to the privatisation of the flat in question.",

On the contrary, the Executive Committee examined and \u2013 by its decision of 21 February 1994 \u2013 granted the application for privatisation, without specifying the form of ownership of the flat following privatisation, while the Real Estate Registry issued an ownership certificate indicating the applicant\u2019s mother as the sole owner of the entire flat. It therefore appears that the authorities followed the same line and accepted that the flat was being privatised as the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s property. In view of such an inconsistent application of Section 13, the Court is prompted to conclude that the privatisation rules and procedures were not sufficiently clear and therefore cannot be relied upon by the Government in support of their position.",

In such circumstances, and in view of all the above factors, the Court considers that the conclusions of the domestic authorities that the applicant had falsified his declaration of property \u2013 which, in the Court\u2019s opinion, implies an intentional omission on his part \u2013 were not sufficiently supported by the evidence and the circumstances of the case and cannot be regarded as reasonable.",

As the Court has indicated above, the legitimate aim was to avoid a situation in which voters were misled by false representations by candidates and, in that respect, the Court notes that, even if unintentionally, the information submitted by the applicant was objectively inaccurate. However, it considers that the applicant cannot be regarded as having acted in bad faith since, as already mentioned above, he had good reason to believe that the information was accurate, all the more so considering that his omission was the result of misleading privatisation rules and practices and could not reasonably be blamed on him. The Court further notes that the information the applicant was found to have allegedly concealed concerned only a small share in a flat having a total surface area of 64.7 sq. m. and it cannot seriously be maintained that information of such minor importance was capable of carrying any real risk of misleading the electorate as far as the applicant\u2019s property status was concerned.",
