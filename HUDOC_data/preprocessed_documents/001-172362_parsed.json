In addition, as the action against the applicants was brought within the initial one-year time-limit following the enactment of the Restitution Law, it could be said to have been part of the measures associated with the period of legal and economic transition in Bulgaria after decades of totalitarian rule. As in earlier similar cases, this means that the case fell within the scope of legitimate aims pursued by the Restitution Law, such as the restoration of justice and respect for the rule of law (see Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0172).",
