It has not been disputed by the parties that on the days of court hearings the applicant was woken up at 6 a.m. The Court further notes that the Government were unable to provide information as to the exact time the applicant was brought back to the remand prison from the court-house and taken to his cell. The Government, however, acknowledged that on some occasions this took place after 10 p.m., in which case the applicant was given an opportunity to catch up on his sleep during the following day. The Court notes that on quite a few occasions the applicant was taken to the court-house several days in a row, especially at the later stages of the trial, in the period between April and June 2005. That schedule of court hearings made any extra sleep the following day impossible.",

The Court notes that Volgograd is a large city, that the prison system was suffering from a shortage of prison vans, and that the same prison van would dispatch a relatively large group of remand prisoners to different court-houses located in different parts of the city every day in the morning and collect them in the evening in order to take them back to the remand prison. Such a system inevitably leads to the accumulation of delays in the transportation of each prisoner, and the period between the time when he would leave his cell and return to it would thus often be unnecessarily protracted. The Court also is mindful of the fact, which was not disputed by the Government, that the pronouncement of the judgment which started on 7\u00a0June at 8.30 p.m. lasted until 00.30 a.m. on 8\u00a0June 2005 (see paragraph 31 above). This shows that court days did not always end at 6\u00a0p.m., as suggested by the Government (see paragraph 36 above). Thus, although it is impossible to calculate precisely how much time the applicant had for sleep on each particular day, the Court finds it established that on many occasions the applicant was deprived of an adequate amount of sleep.",

First, the documents submitted do not cover all the dates on which the applicant was transferred to the court-house. Second, the number of persons indicated in the orders for dry rations did not always correspond to the number of dry rations indicated in the invoices for the relevant dates. Third, in respect of a similar complaint made by the applicant\u2019s co-defendant, the Government submitted two invoices dated 11\u00a0and 20 May 2005 concerning the provision of dry rations to a certain number of detainees (see Strelets, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 59) which do not match the invoices for the same dates submitted in the present case. Fourth, the Government\u2019s assertion that on court days the applicant was provided with hot water necessary to prepare packed meals (see paragraph\u00a037 above) contradicts the statement by the regional Ombudsman, who pointed out that detainees in the Volgograd Region were not allowed to have hot water at the relevant time (see paragraph 40 above).",

The orders for dry rations and the invoices were drawn up and signed by prison officers only. The fact that some dry rations were ordered and received by the officers does not necessary imply that the applicant was provided with them. The Government were unable to make available to the Court documents that would have proved the provision of dry rations to the applicant.

The Court reiterates in this respect that it is incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish the existence of specific facts relevant to the grounds for continued detention. Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7 67, 7 April 2005, and Fedorenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 39602/05, \u00a7 68, 20 September 2011).",

Although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can a continuation of detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see, among other authorities, Fedorenko, cited above, \u00a7 67). This is particularly true in cases such as the present one, where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 was determined by the prosecution without judicial review of whether the evidence collected supported a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences he was charged with (see Rokhlina, cited above, \u00a7 66).",

However, the mere fact of being on a \u201cwanted list\u201d does not mean that the person has gone into hiding. The important factor in measuring the risk of absconding is the actual behaviour of the suspect, and not his formal status as a \u201cperson on a wanted list\u201d. At no time in the present case did the domestic court address the applicant\u2019s argument that his placement on the wanted list had been unlawful and that he had not known until 7 October 2003 and could not have known about the institution of the criminal proceedings against him. The \u201coperational information\u201d which served as a basis for the placement of the applicant\u2019s name on the wanted list was not examined in the court proceedings, and, as such, reference to such \u201cinformation\u201d is too imprecise to support the conclusion that the applicant was absconding (see, mutatis mutandis, Govorushko v. Russia, no.\u00a042940/06, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 46, 25\u00a0October 2007, and Aleksanyan v. Russia, no.\u00a046468/06, \u00a7 187, 22 December 2008). This is all the more true in the present case where the \u201coperational information\u201d as to the applicant\u2019s whereabouts (in the UK or Canada) proved to be inaccurate, given that the applicant was arrested in his hometown in Russia. It further appears that the domestic court gave no consideration at all to the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s arrest, which, in the Court\u2019s view, was an important factor in the assessment of the applicant\u2019s behaviour and intentions and of the possible risks he might represent for the normal conduct of the proceedings.\u00a0Thus, this aspect of the case could not reasonably justify the domestic courts\u2019 conclusions that the applicant would abscond.",

The Court reiterates in this connection that whilst at the initial stages of the investigation the risk that an accused person might pervert the course of justice may be self-evident and justify keeping him or her in custody, after the evidence has been collected that ground becomes less strong (see Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7 79, 1 June 2006).

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v. France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 273-B, and Toth v. Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series A no. 224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per level of jurisdiction may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 \u00a7 1 cases, Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v. the United Kingdom, no. 50272/99, \u00a7 79, ECHR\u00a02003-IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v. Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7 76, 4 October 2001).",

What is taken into account is the diligence shown by the authorities, the delay attributable to the applicant and any factors causing a delay for which the State cannot be held responsible (see Jablonski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 91-94, and G.B. v.
