It considered that the Regional Court had complied with the procedural safeguards under domestic law. Under Article 168c of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 56 above), the accused and defence counsel were, as a rule, permitted to be present during the judicial examination of a witness at the pre-trial stage. However, it had been justified to exclude the applicant, who had not yet been assigned a lawyer at that time, from the hearing of O. and P. by the investigating judge in accordance with Article 168c \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The investigating judge\u2019s concern that the suspects would put pressure on the witnesses once they or counsel were informed of the hearing, thus jeopardising the ongoing investigations, had been well-founded. The Chamber also took note of the Government\u2019s submission that, at the time of the hearing, it had not been foreseeable that the witnesses, who had already given evidence on several occasions, would refuse to testify at the trial.",

In any event, this would not have justified his and his counsel\u2019s exclusion from that hearing as there were various means of allaying such fears.

The Regional Court had made all reasonable efforts to hear the witnesses, who had resided and worked legally in Germany, in person at the trial or to examine them via video-conference with the help of the Latvian courts. It had summoned the witnesses for a hearing and, following the submission of medical certificates by the witnesses, had again attempted to secure their presence by informing them that they would be protected and asking them to state in which circumstances they would be prepared to testify. The Regional Court had no jurisdiction to compel the witnesses, who were Latvian nationals residing in Latvia, to attend a hearing in Germany, as coercive measures were prohibited under Article 8 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (see paragraph 66 above).",

It reasoned that applying in an inflexible manner the so-called \u201csole or decisive rule\u201d (under which a trial was unfair if a conviction was based solely or to a decisive extent on evidence provided by a witness whom the accused had been unable to question at any stage of the proceedings \u2013 ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 128 and 147) would run counter to the traditional way in which the Court approached the right to a fair hearing under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1, namely to examine whether the proceedings as a whole had been fair.

Russia, no. 23880/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011819, 3 May 2012; Asadbeyli and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 3653/05 and 5 others, \u00a7 134, 11 December 2012; Yevgeniy Ivanov v.

However, in other cases, the lack of a good reason for a prosecution witness\u2019s absence alone was considered sufficient to find a breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) (see Rudnichenko v. Ukraine, no. 2775/07, \u00a7\u00a7 10510, 11 July 2013, and Nikolitsas v. Greece, no. 63117/09, \u00a7 35, 3 July 2014; in the latter case the Court nevertheless addressed the others steps of the AlKhawaja and Tahery test, ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 36-39). In yet other cases a differentiated approach was taken: the lack of good reason for a prosecution witness\u2019s absence was considered conclusive of the unfairness of the trial unless the witness testimony was manifestly irrelevant for the outcome of the case (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos.\u00a011082/06 and 13772/05, \u00a7\u00a7 709-16, 25 July 2013; Cevat Soysal v. Turkey, no. 17362/03, \u00a7\u00a7 76-79, 23 September 2014; and Suldin v. Russia, no. 20077/04, \u00a7\u00a7 56-59, 16 October 2014). The Grand Chamber, in the light of the foregoing (see paragraphs 111-12 above), considers that the absence of good reason for the non-attendance of a witness cannot of itself be conclusive of the unfairness of a trial. This being said, the lack of a good reason for a prosecution witness\u2019s absence is a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness of a trial, and one which may tip the balance in favour of finding a breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 3 (d).",

Armenia, no. 8088/05, \u00a7\u00a078, 10 April 2012; Tseber v. the Czech Republic, no. 46203/08, \u00a7 48, 22\u00a0November 2012; and Kostecki v.

The fact that the domestic courts were unable to locate the witness concerned or the fact that a witness was absent from the country in which the proceedings were conducted was found not to be sufficient in itself to satisfy the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d), which requires the Contracting States to take positive steps to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him (see Gabrielyan, cited above, \u00a7 81; Tseber, cited above, \u00a7 48; and Lu\u010di\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 5699/11, \u00a7 79, 27\u00a0February 2014). Such measures form part of the diligence which the Contracting States have to exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see Gabrielyan, cited above, \u00a7 81, with further references).

The national courts characterised the statements of O. and P. as \u201cma\u03b2geblich\u201d, meaning decisive, thus identifying O. and P. as key witnesses. In this regard it is important that the Court look beyond the wording of the national court\u2019s characterisation, in the light of the second step (as done in paragraphs 143-44 of the present judgment).

There is a recent trend at the national level to shift procedural measures which belong to the trial stage forward to the investigation stage; the proceedings against the applicant in the present case are a good example of this trend. When the Court finds itself confronted with such a shift, we see two different possible reactions. On the one hand, the Court could find that bringing procedural steps forward to the investigation stage is entirely incompatible with the Convention. This is not the approach that the Court has adopted. On the other hand, the Court could allow such procedural measures to be taken as early as the investigative stage. However, if the Court considers this shifting of procedural measures to the investigation stage to be in accordance with the Convention, it must make unmistakably clear that the relevant procedural safeguards must be rigorously adhered to. Otherwise, the right to confront a witness at the trial stage would be seriously undermined. In Salduz v. Turkey ([GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2008), this Court already stressed \u201cthe importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial\u201d.",

Under Article 168c \u00a7\u00a02 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d), the accused (and his or her lawyer) is allowed to be present if a witness is questioned by a judge at the pre-trial stage. In exceptional cases the accused may be excluded if his or her presence would endanger the outcome or purpose of the questioning, in particular if it is reasonably to be feared that a witness will not tell the truth in the presence of the accused (Article 168c \u00a7 3 of the CCP). We have doubts as to whether the exclusion of the accused in the case in issue was in accordance with the requirements of Article 168c \u00a7 3 of the CCP. The accused and the witnesses already knew each other. In this regard, the case can be differentiated from that in Pesukic v. Switzerland (no. 25088/07, 6 December 2012) in which the disclosure of the witness\u2019s identity was at stake.

We agree with the Grand Chamber\u2019s finding in the present case that the rationale underlying the Court\u2019s judgment in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, in which it departed from the so-called \u201csole or decisive rule\u201d, was to abandon an indiscriminate rule and to have regard, in the traditional way, to the fairness of the proceedings as a whole. It would have amounted to the creation of a new indiscriminate rule if a trial were considered to be unfair for lack of a good reason for a witness\u2019s non-attendance alone, even if the untested evidence was neither sole nor decisive and was possibly even irrelevant for the outcome of the case (see paragraph 112 of the present judgment). In line with that finding, a large majority of the Al-Khawaja and Tahery follow-up cases did indeed not consider the lack of good reason for a prosecution witness\u2019s absence alone to entail an automatic breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) (for further references, see paragraph 113 of the present judgment).",

However, the fact that it must be considered as foreseeable that the witnesses would leave Germany shortly after the hearing before the investigating judge cannot be equated, in our view, to a finding that it would have been impossible to hear evidence from them in person at a subsequent trial, at least via a video-link. The witnesses were to leave for a State, Latvia, which was bound by international treaties to provide assistance in criminal matters to the German authorities, including the hearing of witness evidence by videoconference. We see our finding further confirmed by the applicant\u2019s own submission that he had assumed that he would be able to cross-examine the witnesses at the trial and had not therefore had any reason to request a repetition of the witnesses\u2019 hearing by the investigating judge (see paragraph 82 of the present judgment).",

According to that rule, if the statement of an absent witness is of such relevance and importance to the case that the domestic court will allow it to be used as evidence against the accused, there should be a good reason for not summoning the witness to give testimony at the hearing.",

The question of the use of written statements by absent witnesses will arise at different stages of the proceedings. Firstly, the question will arise when the trial court assesses a request from the prosecutor to use the written statement of an absent witness as evidence against the accused, or an objection from the defence to such a measure. This assessment will take place during the hearing. Secondly, the question will arise when the trial court assesses whether there is sufficient basis for convicting the accused. This assessment will take place at the end of the hearing. Thirdly, the question will arise when the fairness of the criminal proceedings is assessed, either by a domestic appeal court or subsequently by the Court. At the point where the trial court decides whether the prosecutor should be allowed to use a written statement by an absent witness as evidence, it will often be difficult, if not impossible, to assess whether the evidence will be the sole or decisive basis for a conviction. Therefore, in practice, the three steps will in most cases have to be assessed in the order stated in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, and, most often, at different moments in time. Furthermore, the principles whereby all evidence against an accused must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument, and the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, are so important that they should not be departed from unless there is a good reason to do so.

For example, in some cases it will be clear to the trial court at the outset that the written statement will be the sole or decisive evidence and that it would therefore render the proceedings unfair if the evidence was admitted and used. Likewise, there may be situations where the Court, for practical reasons, finds it appropriate to assess the three steps in a different order.

In my view, the Court should in its case-law pay equal attention to, and protect, the rights and interests of the victims of crimes; in the specific circumstances of this case, there were good reasons to protect the victims. Furthermore, the domestic courts did not consider it contrary to Article 141 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, read in conjunction with Article 140 \u00a7 1 and as interpreted by the Federal Court of Justice (see paragraphs 2829, 57-59 and 62 of the present judgment), that no defence counsel had been appointed to represent the applicant at the time of the witnesses\u2019 hearing before the investigating judge. I take note in that context of the Government\u2019s explanation (see paragraph 94) to the effect that, under Article 168c \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial court was authorised to dispense with giving notice of the hearing to any lawyer appointed to represent the applicant if it considered that notification would endanger the success of the investigation.",

Admittedly, there was a risk that the witnesses would not appear at the hearing, and there will always be such a risk when evidence is secured at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings. However, in the specific circumstances of the case, there is insufficient basis for arguing that it was foreseeable that O. and P. would not appear before the trial court and give testimony. The fact that it was foreseeable that the witnesses would leave Germany shortly after the hearing before the investigating judge cannot be equated to a finding that it would have been impossible to hear evidence from them at a subsequent trial, either in person or via a video-link. In this context I would also like to refer to the applicant\u2019s own submission to the effect that he had assumed that he would be able to cross-examine the witnesses at the trial and had not therefore had any reason to request a repetition of the witnesses\u2019 hearing by the investigating judge (see\u00a0paragraph 82).",
