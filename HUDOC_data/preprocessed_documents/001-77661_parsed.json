We cannot, however, stigmatise these proceedings as abusive. They were strictly in accordance with a procedure prescribed by Parliament to apply in such cases. There was not, as is accepted, any attempt to over reach or oppress or prejudice the appellant. He had all the safeguards which a defendant in any court-martial is entitled to enjoy. Steps were taken to ensure that all members of the tribunal save one were not under the command of the convening officer, and also to ensure that the convening officer and the confirming officer were not the same person. Had the appellant been held in Germany to await trial, as he could have been, his claim to trial in  would have appeared weaker. Whether or not it proved necessary in the event to adduce the oral evidence of German factual witnesses, the greater availability of such witnesses as a trial in  was a legitimate reason for favouring trial there.",

It cannot be assumed that the Director would have been willing to take proceedings in  without knowing more about the factors which he would have wished to take into account. One obvious factor, I would have thought, was the availability of witnesses. In his letter of 14 June 1994 to the Attorney General the Director of Army Legal Services had stated that many of the witnesses were German and that they could not be forced to attend a trial in . Further details were provided at the request of the Attorney General in a letter by the Director of Army Legal Services dated 25 November 1994. In this letter it is stated that there were 13 German witnesses who could be divided into three categories\u2014those who saw the appellant in the woods near the scene of the murder, those concerned with the finding of the body and police and forensic experts. The defence had not yet indicated what evidence would be agreed. The Director thought that, while some of their evidence might be agreed, it was unlikely that this would include the police and forensic experts. He believed that they were the witnesses who would be most unlikely to cause difficulties if asked to travel to  to give evidence. He added that one of the forensic scientists who was responsible for examining secretions and bloodstains\u2014a matter which was of crucial importance in this case as there were no eyewitnesses\u2014was being difficult to deal with and would only attend meetings if they were arranged through the German public prosecutor in the nearest large town.

In the event, as the respondent has recorded in his written case, no agreement was reached, despite several written requests and reminders, about any of the evidence until the commencement of the trial when the evidence of the witnesses was agreed piecemeal during the opening days.

While it cannot be contended that the Convention absolutely excludes the jurisdiction of military courts to try cases in which civilians are implicated, the existence of such jurisdiction should be subjected to particularly careful scrutiny, since only in very exceptional circumstances could the determination of criminal charges against civilians in such courts be held to be compatible with Article 6 (op. cit., \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 44). The power of military criminal justice should not extend to civilians unless there are compelling reasons justifying such a situation, and if so only on a clear and foreseeable legal basis. The existence of such reasons must be substantiated in each specific case.

It notes that in Cooper, none of the ordinary members was serving under the command of the convening authority, prosecuting authority or higher authority (these three authorities had been created by the Army Act 1996 to replace the role of Convening Officer and separate the convening, prosecuting and referral functions of the court-martial). The Grand Chamber nonetheless considered the junior rank of the ordinary members (who were subordinate to the permanent president and may have been subordinate to other participants in the court-martial including the prosecuting authority) and the ad hoc nature of their appointment, might give rise to concern as to their independence and required \u201cparticularly convincing safeguards against outside pressures being brought to bear on those officers\u201d (Cooper, \u00a7 120).",

However, the mere presence of civilians during the proceedings will not of itself provide adequate guarantees of independence and impartiality; the role that the civilians play in the court-martial process must also be taken into account.\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in Grieves, the presence of a civilian Court Administration Officer was found to contribute to the independence and impartiality of the tribunal (Grieves \u00a7 78), but was not sufficient in itself to ensure that the court-martial process as a whole conformed with Article 6. Conversely, in Cooper the Court considered that the civilian post of Judge Advocate provided \u201cone of the most significant guarantees of the independence of the court-martial proceedings\u201d. In reaching this conclusion, significant emphasis was placed on the pivotal role played by the Judge Advocate, including his ability to give binding rulings and directions on points of law to the ordinary members of the court-martial (Cooper \u00a7 117). In the present case, while the participation of civilians as ordinary members of the court-martial may have contributed somewhat to its independence, they did not have sufficient influence over the proceedings as a whole, including over the military members of the court-martial, to satisfy the independence and impartiality requirements of Article\u00a06.",
