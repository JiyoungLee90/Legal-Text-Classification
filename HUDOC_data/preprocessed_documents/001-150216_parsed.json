In setting out its reasons, the court held that before arriving in Lithuania the child had lived in London for some seven months. It was therefore his mother, who did not go out to work, who had predominantly taken care of him during that time. Moreover, his living conditions in the United Kingdom were worse than those in Lithuania. In particular, the boy and his parents had lived in London in one small room, with construction work going on close by. By contrast, in Lithuania the child lived at V.T.\u2019s parents\u2019 house where, according to a child care representative, the boy felt happy and was spry, active, communicative and loved. The court also observed that the boy\u2019s mother had taken care of him the entire time since birth, that they were very close and that the boy had never been left with a nanny or any other person. Furthermore, even though there was no evidence that the applicant had ever behaved improperly in front of the child, or that he had abused alcohol, used drugs or resorted to violence, the applicant had not demonstrated that he had the skills to take care of such a small child. Accordingly, the boy\u2019s separation from the mother and transfer to the father would not be in the child\u2019s interests. It followed that the child could be returned to the United Kingdom only with the mother. Given that the mother could not survive financially in London on her own and that the applicant refused to guarantee having enough money to maintain the child\u2019s mother or to guarantee living conditions for her if she were to come back with the child to the United Kingdom, the applicant\u2019s request that the child be returned to the United Kingdom had to be denied.",

The guardian noted that she had been made aware that the applicant had made an application to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal against the HCJ judgment and order of 18\u00a0June\u00a02010.

The guardian also noted that the previous month the applicant had informed the United Kingdom authorities of his intention to leave the United Kingdom following the last session of his July\u00a02010 contact period. Furthermore, the HCJ order of 18 June 2010 had allowed for the applicant to apply for a Romanian or Moldovan passport.

For the above reasons, the boy\u2019s guardian ad litem had serious concerns that there was an increased risk of A.M. being abducted by his father.

By email of 9 December the applicant asked the bailiff to update him in writing about the steps she had taken to enforce the contact order.

He asked the bailiff what would be the reason for his appearance in court, but the bailiff did not respond. In an email of 8\u00a0February the applicant also wrote that, according to the bailiff, V.T. had not complied with the contact order because he had not paid her the GBP\u00a0600. The applicant explained however, that he had paid that sum, as mentioned in the letter of 16\u00a0September from 2010 V.T.\u2019s lawyers, and asked the bailiff whether that evidence had been put before the Lithuanian court. Lastly, by an email of 10 February the applicant wrote that he could not understand the bailiff\u2019s silence and why his emails went unanswered.

The court reiterated that the applicant had not communicated directly with his son since June 2010. Similarly, there was no evidence of the applicant ever having visited his son either after the court decision of 1 March 2011 regarding interim protective measures or after the subsequent decision of 26 June 2012, both of which allowed the applicant to see his child for several hours each day. As to the applicant\u2019s plea that the Lithuanian court order would cause him inconvenience \u2013 especially the necessity of travelling to Lithuania \u2012 this did not mean that the contact as established by the Utena District Court on 26\u00a0June 2012 had established was negligible. According to the contact order, the applicant could see his son on workdays, ten to twelve days a month. Knowing about such a contact order, the applicant could plan his work and income accordingly. It was also significant that, according to the contact order issued by the HCJ on 18 June 2010, the child had to be collected from the Romanian embassy in Vilnius. Consequently, the applicant would in any case have to leave his place of residence and job in England and come to Lithuania. He would also inevitably have to invest time and money. Accordingly, taking into account the child\u2019s interests \u2013 his age, state of health, need for mother\u2019s attention, and the fact that the applicant had not directly communicated with his son since June 2010 \u2012 the contact order as set by the Utena District Court on 26 June 2012 reasonably gave priority to the child\u2019s interests whilst not neglecting the applicant\u2019s right to be in contact with his son.",

Firstly, as regards the non-enforcement of the HCJ judgment and order in Lithuania, the applicant, who saw the bailiff\u2019s actions to be insufficient, could have complained about those actions or the lack thereof to the court, but had failed to do so. Similarly, the applicant had not appealed against the Utena District Court\u2019s decision of 27 April 2011, in which the court rejected the bailiff\u2019s complaint against V.T. as regards the contact visit of December 2010. Given that in that decision by the Lithuanian court it had been established that the applicant himself had not fulfilled the requirements of the United Kingdom court and had thus been responsible for the non-enforcement of the contact order, it could only be presumed that the applicant had agreed with the facts established therein, particularly since it was clearly stated in the said decision that it was subject to appeal (see paragraph 40 above). The Government admitted that the question of interim protective measures had been decided on 1 March 2011 without informing the applicant about the court hearing. However, it had been within the Lithuanian court\u2019s prerogative to ensure that the application of interim protective measures was not impeded. Having regard to the fact that the meeting foreseen by the HCJ was to take place on \n19-28\u00a0March\u00a02011 outside Lithuania, the Utena court had exercised precisely that prerogative.",

In view of the fact that the applicant had not visited his son, it could only be presumed that he had found the aforementioned order too difficult to put into effect. At this point it also had to be noted that the decision of the Lithuanian court mentioning the possibility of appeal had been translated and served on the applicant.

On the contrary, he had applied for legal aid and had written a great number of emails to the bailiff, the Utena court and the lawyer appointed to defend his interests. Nevertheless, his efforts and email communications with those persons and institutions had been one way only and of no benefit for the applicant (see \nparagraphs\u00a034-36, 39 and 41 above). Firstly, he had not been notified about the forthcoming court hearing of 1\u00a0March 2011 concerning interim protective measures, and had not received an official copy of that decision until 1 June 2011, when, in his view, an appeal would no longer in practice have been effective or adequate. Secondly, the State-appointed lawyer had disregarded the applicant\u2019s explicit request to appeal against the Utena District Court\u2019s decision of 27 April 2011 not to fine V.T. for the contact visit of December 2010 that had never taken place.

Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to show that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that special circumstances existed which absolved him or her from this requirement (see Melnik v.

Subsequently, having been informed about this possibility and provided with a list of bailiffs by the Service, in November\u00a02010 the applicant had contacted the bailiff and submitted a certificate issued following a procedure established by the Regulation (EC) No.\u00a02201/2003.

In line with the HCJ judgments and orders, it was decided that the child\u2019s mother would be free to take him to reside permanently in Lithuania after the initial six-week contact session in London. The HCJ thus determined that the Republic of Lithuania should be the child\u2019s permanent place of residence. Furthermore, regarding the Lithuanian courts\u2019 jurisdiction in the present case, the HCJ emphasised that following Article 9 \u00a7 1 of the Council Regulation (EC) No.\u00a02201/2003, three months after the child\u2019s leaving the jurisdiction of England and Wales to live permanently in Lithuania, the Lithuanian courts would have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility, including contact. The English court only reserved jurisdiction regarding the issues related to the child\u2019s Romanian and/or Moldovan passports and travel documents (see paragraphs 22 and 24 above). Consequently, pursuant to Article 9 \u00a7 1 of the Regulation, three months after the child had left the United Kingdom in July\u00a02010, that is in October 2010, jurisdiction passed over to the Lithuanian courts and the Utena District Court in particular, which examined the application for interim protective measures and for the amended contact order that V.T. had lodged in December 2010.",

There had been another ground for the court proceedings in Lithuania and for the adoption of an interim measure in particular, namely there existed a justifiable suspicion that, if the next contact (due in March 2011) ordered by the HCJ were to be executed in the manner prescribed by the English court, whereby the applicant would be able to remove the child from Lithuania and travel worldwide, the applicant might abscond with his son, thereby putting the child into a psychologically harmful situation and aggravating the implementation of the future decision of the Utena court in respect of parental contact rights. The danger was real, as evidenced by the letter of 9 July 2010 sent to the applicant by Cafcass and the HCJ order instructing the Romanian and Moldovan embassies to refrain from issuing travel documents for the child.",

The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and co-operation of all concerned will always be an important ingredient. Whilst national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such co-operation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention. Where contacts with the parent might appear to threaten those interests or interfere with those rights, it is for the national authorities to strike a fair balance between them (see Hokkanen v. Finland, 23 September 1994, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 299A). The child\u2019s best interests must be the primary consideration and may, depending on their nature and seriousness, override those of the parents (see P\u0142aza v.\u00a0Poland, no. 18830/07, \u00a7 71, 25 January 2011).",

The Court has also acknowledged that arrangements of contacts may require great efforts on the part of the parent with whom the child no longer lives (see Kajari v. Finland, no. 65040/01, \u00a7\u00a042, 23 October 2007). The Court has equally held that the alleged lack of action on the part of the applicant cannot lift the responsibilities incumbent on the public authorities, as the depositary of public force, for the enforcement of judicial decisions (see Fu\u015fc\u0103, cited above, \u00a7\u00a030). The responsibility of a State under the Convention may arise for acts of all its organs, agents and servants. As is the case in international law generally, their rank is immaterial since the acts by persons accomplished in an official capacity are imputed to the State in any case.

The Court cannot share this view. Like the Government, it notes that the HCJ had indeed acknowledged that once the child had moved permanently to Lithuania for a period longer than three months, jurisdiction over the question of contact rights would pass to the Lithuanian courts (see paragraphs 22 and 94 above). The Court therefore accepts that the Lithuanian courts had jurisdiction to decide the issue of parental contact when V.T. addressed her request to them in December 2010 (see paragraph 43 above).",

In the applicant\u2019s view, the Lithuanian authorities\u2019 failure to act diligently and honestly resulted in the situation in which he now finds himself, namely alienated from his son. In this connection the Court reiterates that whilst Article 8 contains no explicit procedural requirements, the decision-making process leading to measures of interference must be fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded by Article 8 (see McMichael v. the United Kingdom, 24 February 1995, \u00a7\u00a087, Series A no.\u00a0307B). Consequently, the Court must first determine whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and notably the serious nature of the decisions to be taken, the applicant was sufficiently involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, in order to ensure the requisite protection of his interests. If he has not, there will have been a failure to respect his family life, because the interference could not be regarded as having been \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 (see, mutatis mutandis, W. v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1987, \u00a7 64, Series A no. 121, p.\u00a029).",

The applicant then contacted a bailiff in the district where V.T. and their son lived. It is apparent from the applicant\u2019s correspondence with the bailiff that their email communication was mostly one way. The Court finds it significant that within a time-frame of three months, the applicant wrote some 25\u00a0emails to the bailiff enquiring about the non-enforcement of the contact order. Initially, the applicant was constructive, offered to explain the situation, and paid the fee for the execution of the HCJ judgment. The applicant\u2019s efforts to make himself understood and to assist the bailiff, inasmuch as this was possible whilst living in another country, are also apparent from the fact that his emails were drafted in English but Google-translated into Lithuanian. Later on, the applicant must have become more agitated and, in his own words, when faced with a dearth of information, started suspecting the Lithuanian authorities of concerted efforts to limit his right to have contact with his son. The applicant also asked the bailiff to provide him with a copy of the rules concerning \u201cComplaints and Procedures\u201d, but it transpires that no response was given to him (see paragraph 36 above).",

However, it transpires that the bailiff disregarded this last piece of information because, as the Utena court decision of 27 April 2011 reads, it was also on the basis of the bailiff\u2019s testimony that the Utena court concluded that the December 2010 contact visit had not taken place because the applicant had failed to make a money transfer (see paragraph 40 above). Indeed, even though it was the missed September 2010 visit that prompted the United Kingdom authorities to contact the Lithuanian Service as regards the execution of a foreign judgment (see paragraphs 31 and 32 above), the missed visit of September 2010 is not even mentioned in the Utena District Court decision of 27 April 2011. The Court thus concludes that the Lithuanian authorities did not impose even the lightest of sanctions on V.T., thereby condoning her uncooperative behaviour and disregard for the HCJ judgment (see Shaw v. Hungary, no. 6457/09, \u00a7 73, 26 July 2011). As a result, the applicant was denied a right under Article 8 of the Convention to have his son stay with him for a visit so that they could engage in a meaningful contact without \u201cthe very real difficulties\u201d which the applicant would feel if it were to take place initially in Lithuania (see paragraph 16 above; see also Lafargue v.

She also asked the Utena court to issue a temporary protective measure, and not to allow the applicant to be alone with his son (see paragraph 44 above).",

It is true that it appears from V.T.\u2019s claim of 13\u00a0December 2010, and her amended claim of 9 February 2011 that she added documents concerning the applicant\u2019s purported wish not to return their child. However, as the HCJ concluded on 9 July 2010, the allegation made by V.T. and also by Cafcass was ill-advised (see paragraph 29\u00a0above). Above all, by that time the child was already residing permanently with V.T. in Lithuania. It was therefore rather unlikely that the applicant would abduct the child \u2012 a hypothesis not even mentioned in the Utena District Court decision of 22 February 2011 not to inform the applicant about the hearing \u2012 if he were to go to Lithuania to attend that hearing (see paragraph\u00a045 above). Since the applicant had no knowledge that hearing was to take place, he was unable to be there and to comment on any accusatory or exculpatory evidence. In this context the Court notes that the circumstances as presented by V.T. in support of her request for interim protective measures were not entirely accurate. Even though she stated that in July 2010 the applicant was prohibited from seeing the boy for four days, that information was not true (see paragraphs 29 and 46 above).",

Assuming that the basis for the temporary protective measure was V.T.\u2019s indication of a potential abduction, the proceedings would have involved an assessment of the applicant\u2019s character. In the Court\u2019s view, this was a question of fact which could not be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file alone. In such circumstances, where an assessment of this kind played such a significant role and where the outcome could be of major detriment to the applicant, it was essential for the fairness of the proceedings that the Utena court afford the applicant an opportunity to be heard and to participate fully in order to assure his right to be in contact with his son in the future (see Jucius and Juciuvien\u0117 v.

The Court further observes that once the applicant had learned about the decision of 27 April 2011, he asked the lawyer to appeal against it.

Be that as it may, the applicant\u2019s genuine and serious interest in his son was unequivocally noted by the HCJ in its judgment of 28 April 2010 (see paragraph 15 above). The HCJ also emphasised that there had been two\u00a0important reasons why the contact between the applicant and his son had been scheduled to take place in England, namely the absence of the pressures the applicant would undoubtedly feel in Lithuania and the fact that the preferred timing was \u201cclearly as soon as possible\u201d (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above). The rules set out by the Utena District Court however are in clear contrast to the guidance laid down by the HCJ. According to the Lithuanian court\u2019s decision of 1 March 2011, the applicant was permitted to see his son in the presence of the child care authorities and on their premises (see paragraph 49 above). Concerning the rules set out by the Utena District Court on 26 June 2012, they were even less favourable for the applicant, because V.T. was to be present during those meetings. V.T. also retained the right to decide whether a particular place was appropriate for those meetings (see paragraph 58 above).",

Looking at the facts of the case, the Court does not see any such significant change, except for V.T.\u2019s hostility towards the applicant. Indeed, she refused to take their child to London in September 2010 and lodged a petition to change the contact order almost as soon as the three-month time-limit set out in Article\u00a09 of the Council Regulation (EC) No.\u00a02201/2003 had expired (see paragraph 43 above). Moreover, even though in support of her request V.T. had provided the Utena District Court with medical reports, that evidence is not even mentioned in its decisions of 1 March 2011 or 27 April 2011 (see, by converse implication, Z.J. v. Lithuania, cited above, \u00a7 103).

From the above considerations it also transpires that the applicant\u2019s contact with his son so that the boy would get to know his father \u201cin the father\u2019s own environment\u201d (see paragraph 16 above) was prevented by the Lithuanian authorities at precisely the initial stage when it was most important.
