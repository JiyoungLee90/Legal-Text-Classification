Furthermore, military judges enjoy constitutional safeguards identical to those of civilian judges. They may not be removed from office or made to retire early without their consent; as regular members of a Martial Law Court they sit as individuals. According to the Constitution, they must be independent and no public authority may give them instructions concerning their judicial activities or influence them in the performance of their duties (see, the \u0130ncal v. Turkey judgment of 9\u00a0June\u00a01998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1571, \u00a7 67, and the \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey judgment of 28\u00a0October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, p. 3073, \u00a7 39).",

In deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular court lacks independence or impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important without being decisive. What is decisive is whether his doubts can be held to be objectively justified (see the Gautrin and Others v.

That court tried a civilian for an offence under the ordinary criminal law. In the Incal case the majority of the Court reached the conclusion that, in spite of the safeguards enjoyed by military judges in Turkey\u2019s judicial system, the National Security Court could not be objectively regarded (according to the doctrine of appearances) as an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 because one of its members was a military judge, who might have aroused doubts in the mind of the public as to his impartiality and independence. That standpoint was defensible, as the case concerned a civilian court trying a civilian for an ordinary offence.",

It is common knowledge that martial-law courts are military courts par excellence. Their jurisdiction is limited: in cases involving civilians, they are competent to deal with offences of a strictly military nature and with offences that have led to a declaration of martial law in the region in which the military authorities \u2013 and, with them, the martial-law courts \u2013 assume jurisdiction ratione loci.",

To hold, on the basis of the Incal precedent, that a court on which a military judge sits is not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 would, by logical implication, amount to finding that all military courts contravened Article 6 \u00a7 1 and should accordingly be banished from the judicial system. That is the general conclusion which I am unable to accept. Military courts have existed since time immemorial; they currently exist, as far as I know, in all States that possess an army, and they will continue to exist until such time as armed forces and martial law are abolished.",
