It originated in five applications (nos. 18747/91, 19376/92, 19379/92, 28208/95 and 27755/95) against the Hellenic Republic lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by five Greek nationals, Mr\u00a0Konstantinos Gitonas, Mr Dimitrios Paleothodoros, Mr\u00a0Nicolaos Sifounakis, Mr Ioannis Kavaratzis and Mr Gerassimos Giakoumatos on 12\u00a0June 1991, 22 November 1991 and 16 and 28 May 1995.

The possibility that a civil servant will use his post to prepare for his political career does in fact exist in this case too, as the effects of such preparations are not limited to the election immediately following the taking up of the post but may extend to subsequent elections; consequently, it has to be accepted that the civil servant continues to be disqualified under the Constitution, if the election takes place within three years as specified in the Constitution. A public undertaking is an undertaking which under the law ... exists to promote the general interest, in the form of a legal entity over which the State exerts a decisive influence and which operates according to economic criteria, not by speculating ... but by making profits that will enable it to achieve its fundamental objectives ... Section 1 of Law no. 1730/1987 established a private-law entity in the form of a company called \u2018Greek Radio-Television\u2019... Section 1 (3) provides that ERT-AE is a public undertaking belonging to the public sector (Law no.\u00a01256/1982); it is controlled and supervised by the State.  By section 2 (1) of the aforementioned Law, the objects of ERT-AE are to organise, operate and develop radio and television broadcasting, and contribute to informing, educating and entertaining the Greek people. That provision also lays down that ERT-AE is not a profit-seeking entity ... The [ERT-AE\u2019s] main departments set out and apply, for the areas within their responsibility, the basic principles laid down by the board of governors and are financially independent ... The board of governors appoints a director-general to head each department (section 3). It follows that a director-general - appointed by the board of governors and given the task of applying in the area for which he is responsible the basic principles laid down by the board, to whose supervision he is moreover subject - is the employee of a public undertaking within the meaning of Article 56 para. 3 of the Constitution; because of that position ..., he is liable to the disqualification referred to in that Article.",

The governor is the highest-ranking administrative organ of the IKA; he [is empowered] to decide any question not expressly reserved by law to the board of directors, to act as the head of all the Fund\u2019s departments and to supervise them and review their actions, to take all appropriate measures, to recruit staff and take disciplinary action, to represent the Fund in court and other proceedings, to chair the board of directors; more generally, he is the highest-ranking administrative organ of the Fund; that organ is not subordinate to any other organ of the entity and manages the IKA jointly with the board of directors (see judgments nos. 4 and 5/1991 of the Special Supreme Court).  The post of First Deputy Director of the IKA was created by Royal Decree no.\u00a011 of 15 May 1957, and that of Second Deputy Director by section 15 of Law no.\u00a01573/1985. Neither organ, which the aforementioned provisions ... classify as deputy director, is a governor of the IKA so as to be subject to disqualification from election under Article 56 of the Constitution ... The fact that the deputy director acts as the governor\u2019s replacement is not sufficient for him to be ascribed governor status, especially as by law, and in particular section 15 (2) of Law no. 1573/1985, it is the governor who appoints one of the deputy directors to act as his replacement and as that delegation [of powers] ... does not alter the nature of that organ even during periods when the replacement is effective ... In the instant case, during the period in issue, the governor of the IKA, by decision ..., delegated to the [applicant] - the second deputy director - certain powers concerning questions within the remit of the IKA\u2019s departments, but excluding matters relating to `the development of the Fund\u2019s general strategy\u2019. By the same decision the governor of the IKA appointed the [applicant] to act as his replacement for the period from 1 April to 30 September of each year. The second deputy director is appointed for three years and takes part in deliberations of the board of directors in a consultative capacity.  It is apparent from the foregoing that, although the second deputy director of the IKA is not subject to the Civil Service Code ..., his relationship with the IKA is that of employee and he is a salaried member of staff - for the duration of his term in office - of a public-law entity; consequently, he is subject to the disqualification from election provided for in Article 56 para. 3 ...",

Moreover, the realities of Greek political life had been taken into account in the restrictions, which in addition tended to preserve the neutrality of the civil service, the independence of members of parliament and the principle of the separation of powers.

Secondly, no account was taken of the exact period - which in addition was very short - when the position giving rise to disqualification had been held during the three years preceding the elections. Thirdly, the virtually irrebuttable presumption of disqualification created by the said paragraph prevented the courts considering the nature of the post concerned, the effective length of time it had been held and the level of responsibility it implied. Lastly, it had not been shown in the instant case that the applicants had derived a benefit from their positions or gained an advantage over other candidates.

Mayors and heads of municipalities, in company with members of parliament, owe their position directly to the electorate.  Governors and presidents of public-law entities and other high-ranking civil servants appointed by the Government conceive and implement Government policy in their field of activity and are thus subject, like ministers, to parliamentary scrutiny.",

More particularly, Mr Gitonas\u2019s secondment could not alter his status as an employee of the Investment Bank and could not be compared with an appointment as a civil servant since the post of Deputy Head of the Prime Minister\u2019s private office had been created illegally, as it had no statutory basis. The posts of Mr\u00a0Paleothodoros and Mr Sifounakis (Directors-General of the first and second national television channels) could not be equated with that of the Chairman of the Greek Broadcasting Company or of a member of staff of a public undertaking with responsibilities in all Greek constituencies.
