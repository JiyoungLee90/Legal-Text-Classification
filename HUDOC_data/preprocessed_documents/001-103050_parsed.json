That being so, the applicant had the guarantee that he would be able, as soon as he arrived in Greece, to submit an application for asylum, which would be examined in conformity with the relevant rules and regulations.

It has come to be considered a rule of customary international law binding on all States. In addition, international human rights law has established non-refoulement as a fundamental component of the absolute prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The duty not to refoule is also recognised as applying to refugees irrespective of their formal recognition, thus obviously including asylum-seekers whose status has not yet been determined. It encompasses any measure attributable to a State which could have the effect of returning an asylum-seeker or refugee to the frontiers of territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened, or where he or she would risk persecution. This includes rejection at the frontier, interception and indirect refoulement, whether of an individual seeking asylum or in situations of mass influx.\u201d",

On 9 December 2008, date of the Commissioner\u2019s visit, at the two separate warehouse-type detention rooms of the Feres border guard station, which dates from 2000, there were 45 young, male, irregular migrants in detention, most of them Iraqis. ... They were in fact crammed in the rooms, sleeping and stepping upon mattresses that had been placed on the floor and on a cement platform, one next to the other. In the bathrooms the conditions were squalid. Some detainees had obvious skin rashes on their arms and one with bare feet complained that the authorities did not provide him with shoes and clean clothes. ... On 9 December 2008 the police authorities informed the Commissioner that at Kyprinos (Fylakio) there were 320 inmates in seven detention rooms, the majority of them being of Iraqi and Afghan nationalities.\u201d",

The delegates were able to view two of the cells, each of which contained only one bed (a concrete base with a mattress on top) and held between fourteen and seventeen individuals. There were not enough mattresses, and detainees slept on the floor. As a result of the overcrowding and mattresses on the floor, there was no space to move around. The detainees told Amnesty International that, because of the lack of space, they could not all lie down and sleep at the same time.

The Afghan government and their international allies are pitted against groups of insurgents including the Taliban, the Hezb-e Eslami and al-Qaeda. A complex array of legal and illegal armed groups and organised criminal groups also play an important role in the conflict. Despite efforts at reform, Afghanistan is still faced with widespread corruption, lack of due process and an ineffective administration of justice. Human rights violations are rarely addressed or remedied by the justice system and impunity continues to be pervasive. The progressive strengthening of religious conservatism has pressured the Afghan government and Parliament into curtailing fundamental rights and freedoms.",

The detention of an asylum-seeker for three months on police premises pending the application of an administrative measure, with no access to any recreational activities and without proper meals has also been considered as degrading treatment (see Tabesh v.

The Government of the United Kingdom were convinced that such complaints, which were understandable in cases of expulsion to a State not bound by the Convention, should be avoided when the State responsible for handling the asylum application was a party to the Convention. In such cases, as the Court had found in K.R.S. v. the United Kingdom (cited above), the normal interpretation of the Convention would mean the interested parties lodging their complaints with the courts in the State responsible for processing the asylum application and subsequently, perhaps, to the Court. According to the United Kingdom Government, this did not absolve the transferring States of their responsibility for potential violations of the Convention, but it meant that their responsibility could be engaged only in wholly exceptional circumstances where it was demonstrated that the persons concerned would not have access to the Court in the State responsible for dealing with the asylum application.

They pointed out considerable disparities in the way European Union member States applied the Dublin Regulation and the domestic courts assessed the lawfulness of the transfers when it came to evaluating the risk of violation of fundamental rights, in particular when the State responsible for dealing with the asylum application had not properly transposed the other Community measures relating to asylum. The AIRE Centre and Amnesty International considered that States which transferred asylum-seekers had their share of responsibility in the way the receiving States treated them, in so far as they could prevent human rights violations by availing themselves of the sovereignty clause in the Dublin Regulation. The possibility for the European Commission to take action against the receiving State for failure to honour its obligations was not, in their opinion, an effective remedy against the violation of the asylum-seekers\u2019 fundamental rights. Nor were they convinced, as the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) had not pronounced itself on the lawfulness of \u201cDublin\u201d transfers when they could lead to such violations, of the efficacy of the preliminary ruling procedure introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon.",

GHM considered that the Belgian authorities could not have been unaware of this, particularly as the same documents had been used in internal procedures to order the suspension of transfers to Greece.

Secondly, it notes that the agreement document was worded in stereotyped terms (see paragraph 24 above) and contained no guarantee concerning the applicant in person. Nor did the information document the Belgian Government mentioned, provided by the Greek authorities, contain any individual guarantee; it merely referred to the applicable legislation, with no relevant information about the situation in practice.",

This statement, which is analysed and elaborated further in paragraph\u00a0223 of the judgment, correctly describes the general situation which prevails in many northern Mediterranean coastal countries. However, in the case of Greece, with its extensive northern borders but also a considerable maritime front, the migratory phenomenon has acquired a truly dramatic dimension in recent years. Statistics clearly show that the great majority of foreign immigrants \u2013 mainly of Asian origin \u2013 attempt to enter Europe through Greece, and either settle there or move on to seek a new life in other European countries. As it has already been stated, almost 88% of the immigrants (and among them asylum-seekers) entering the European Union today cross the Greek borders to land in our continent. In these circumstances, it is clear that European Union immigration policy \u2013 including the Dublin II Regulation \u2013 does not reflect the present realities, or do justice to the disproportionate burden that falls to the Greek immigration authorities. There is clearly an urgent need for a comprehensive reconsideration of the existing European legal regime, which should duly take into account the particular needs and constraints of Greece in this delicate domain of human rights protection.",

Nor does Article 3 entail any general obligation to give refugees financial assistance to enable them to maintain a certain standard of living\u201d. However, as the Court rightly points out, in the circumstances of the case \u201cthe obligation to provide accommodation and decent material conditions to impoverished asylum-seekers has now entered into positive law and the Greek authorities are bound to comply with their own legislation, which transposes Community law\u201d (see paragraph 250). What the Court meant by \u201cpositive law\u201d is duly explained in paragraph 251, where it referred to the \u201cexistence of a broad consensus at the international and European level concerning [the need for special protection of asylum-seekers as a particularly underprivileged and vulnerable population group], as evidenced by the Geneva Convention, the remit and the activities of the UNHCR [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] and the standards set out in the Reception Directive\u201d. Indeed, this last European document clearly requires that the European Union\u2019s member States guarantee asylum-seekers \u201ccertain material reception conditions, including housing, food and clothing, in kind or in the form of financial allowances.

The Court has held on numerous occasions that to fall within the scope of Article 3 ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum is relative and it depends on all the circumstances of the case (such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some instances, the sex, age and state of health of the victim). In the circumstances of the present case, the combination of the long duration of the applicant\u2019s treatment, coupled with Greece\u2019s international obligation to treat asylum-seekers in accordance with what the judgment calls current \u201cpositive law\u201d, justifies the distinction the Court makes between treatment endured by other categories of people \u2013 where Article 3 has not been found to be transgressed \u2013 and the treatment of an asylum-seeker, who clearly enjoys a particularly advanced level of protection.",

In previous cases, the Court has had no hesitations in examining the issue of refoulement first under Article 3 and then under Article 13 and finding violations under both provisions (see, for example, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, and Jabari v.

I am all in favour of the principle of subsidiarity, but I think here is the wrong place to apply it. Tribute has already been paid to subsidiarity in this case by testing the complaint expressly or implicitly with various admissibility conditions and in particular with that of the exhaustion of domestic remedies (which is in itself an application of the principle of subsidiarity par excellence). Subsidiarity plays an important part, for instance, in applying the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Its role must surely be more restricted in the light of a cardinal provision such as Article 3 and in view of the central importance of the applicant\u2019s refoulement for this case. In any event, in my opinion, subsidiarity does not permit such a complaint to be \u201cdowngraded\u201d so that it is no longer independently examined.",

In such circumstances, the Greek Government should have provided convincing evidence about the conditions of the applicant\u2019s actual detention. However, the Government failed to provide the Court with reliable information as to which sector the applicant was actually held in (cf. paragraph\u00a0228). Given the above-mentioned legitimate suspicion, the absence of appropriate documentation becomes decisive, even if the detention was of short duration. The Greek Government should have proved that the placement was not in an overcrowded place in appalling conditions of hygiene and cleanliness, amounting to degrading treatment prohibited by Article 3, but they failed to do so. Of course, in A.A. v. Greece (no. 12186/08, \u00a7\u00a7 57-65, 22 July 2010), where these conditions were found to amount to humiliation, the period was considerably longer, namely three months. For the Court, the duration of the detention in the present case is comparable in its effects to much longer stays in detention because of the assumed vulnerability of the applicant. I do not find the applicant particularly vulnerable (see below) but I do find the short term of detention inhuman because, as a rule, the relatively short-term restriction of freedom under deplorable conditions of people not accused of wrongdoing (as is the case here, at least for the first period of detention) causes considerable humiliation in itself.",

Unlike this undeniably vulnerable group, however, asylum-seekers will be entitled to government-provided services. In terms of vulnerability, dependence, and so on, the mentally disabled (and other vulnerable groups, whose members are subject to social prejudice) are in a more difficult situation than asylum-seekers, who are not a homogeneous group subject to social categorisation and related discrimination. The passivity of the State did not cause the alleged vulnerability of the asylum-seekers; they might be caught up in a humanitarian crisis, but this was not caused by the State, although the authorities\u2019 passivity may have contributed to it (see below).

At the material time (2009), referring to the Court\u2019s decision in K.R.S. v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 32733/08, 2 December 2008), the UNHCR did not consider that the danger of refoulement existed in Greece (paragraph\u00a0195).

Only a system of proper review of an asylum request and/or deportation order with suspensive effect satisfies the needs of legal certainty and protection required in such matters. Because of the shortcomings of the procedure in Greece, as described in paragraph 320 of the judgment, the applicant remains without adequate protection, irrespective of his non-participation in the asylum procedure, irrespective of his contribution to the alleged humiliation due to the deficiencies of the asylum procedure, and irrespective of the present risk of refoulement.

It is apparent that the K.R.S. v. the United Kingdom case was applied by national authorities as a recent and authoritative decision on the compatibility with the Convention of returns to Greece, more particularly by the House of Lords in the case of Nasseri (cited above), in which judgment was delivered on 6 May 2009.

It is noted in the judgment that numerous reports and materials have been added to the information which was available to the Court when it adopted its K.R.S. v. the United Kingdom decision, which agree as to the practical difficulties involved in the application of the Dublin system in Greece, the deficiencies of the asylum procedure in that country and the practice of direct or indirect refoulement on an individual or collective basis. These reports, it is said, have been published at regular intervals since 2006 \u201cand with greater frequency in 2008 and 2009, and ... most of them had already been published when the expulsion order against the applicant was issued\u201d (paragraph 348 of the judgment).

Reliance is also placed on the fact that, since December 2008, the European asylum system has itself entered a \u201creform phase\u201d aimed at strengthening the protection of asylum-seekers and implementing a temporary suspension of transfers under the Dublin Regulation to avoid asylum-seekers being sent back to member States unable to offer them a sufficient level of protection of their fundamental rights.",

The graphic detail in those reports and in the powerful submissions to the Court by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights and the UNHCR as to the living conditions for asylum-seekers in Greece, the grave deficiencies in the system of processing asylum applications in that country and the risk of onward return to Afghanistan unquestionably provide a solid basis today on which to treat the presumption of compliance as rebutted.

The letter went on to express the belief of the UNHCR that it was still not the case that the reception of asylum-seekers in Greece complied with human rights standards or that asylum-seekers had access to fair consideration of their asylum applications or that refugees were effectively able to exercise their rights under the Geneva Convention.

However, the assurances given in K.R.S. v. the United Kingdom were similarly of a general nature and were not addressed to the individual circumstances of the applicant in the case. Moreover, there was no reason to believe in June 2009 that the general practice and procedures in Greece, which had been referred to in the assurances and summarised in the K.R.S. v. the United Kingdom decision, had changed or were no longer applicable. In particular, there was not at that time any evidence that persons were being directly or indirectly returned by Greece to Afghanistan in disregard of the statements relied on by the Court in K.R.S. v. the United Kingdom. Such evidence did not become available until August 2009, when reports first emerged of persons having been forcibly returned from Greece to Afghanistan on a recent flight, leading the Court to reapply Rule 39 in the case of the return of Afghan asylum-seekers to Greece.",
