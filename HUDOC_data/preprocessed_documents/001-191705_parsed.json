Speaking unaccented Russian, they asked Mr\u00a0Ismail Dashtayev and Mr\u00a0L.A.Ch. for their identity documents. A few minutes later, two grey UAZ minivans without registration plates arrived.

Thereafter, the servicemen searched Mr\u00a0L.-A.Ch., put a black plastic bag over his head, forced him into the other UAZ minivan, drove him to Shali, and then released him in front of the central district hospital.",
