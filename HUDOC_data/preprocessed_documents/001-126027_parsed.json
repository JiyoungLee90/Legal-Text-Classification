Before the Migration Board (Migrationsverket) he submitted that he had been born in Mogadishu and had lived there all his life, with the exception of a few years when, as a child, he had lived in the village of Baydhabo, 250 km northwest of Mogadishu. He belonged to the Sheikal clan and had been trained as a teacher. Between 1992 and 2005 he had worked as an administrator for the American Friends Service Community, an organisation providing humanitarian service, which had closed in 2005 because of the security situation. In the period from 2005 until 2009 he had worked as a teacher in his home. In 2007 he had received threatening telephone calls from people claiming to represent the Islamic courts, telling him to stop spreading Christianity. The applicant had told them that he had stopped working for the American Friends Service Community and that he was a Muslim but that had made no difference. When the conflicts between the Islamist courts and the Ethiopian troops had escalated, the telephone calls had stopped for a while. At the beginning of 2009 the applicant had received more threatening telephone calls, but this time from al-Shabaab, with a similar message as before. On 2 March 2009 members of al-Shabaab had gone to the applicant\u2019s home and asked for him. He had not been at home at the time but had immediately decided to leave the country when he heard that they had been looking for him. His wife and children had still been in Mogadishu when he left the country but had later also left the city. The applicant claimed that, upon return, he would risk serious assault by al-Shabaab and that he would not be able to obtain any protection from his clan.",

Furthermore, it could be assumed that he originated from Somalia, which was supported by the language analysis undertaken. Therefore, the Board held that the applicant\u2019s asylum claims were to be examined on the basis of a return to Somalia. It found that the possibility for a clan to give protection to its members had deteriorated due to the political development in Somalia where Islamist groups had come to play a more important role. It also pointed out that al-Shabaab was the most influential group and had developed in a fundamentalist direction. The Board noted that al-Shabaab had destroyed the traditional protection which clans could usually provide to their members. It further noted that clan protection in general was not reliable in Mogadishu.",

However, he had not made it credible that he had resided in Mogadishu in the years prior to his arrival in Sweden. The Board noted that the submissions about his place of residence did not correspond to the information given by his brother to the Migration Board on 16 September 2002 (who had stated that of his four brothers, one was living in Great Britain, one in the Netherlands, one in Afgoye and one as a nomad in Somalia, but none in Mogadishu). Moreover, when the applicant\u2019s nephew\u2019s wife had applied for a residence permit in Sweden on 25 June 2008 she had submitted that she and the applicant had been neighbours in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Furthermore, the Board found the applicant\u2019s submissions regarding the alleged threats from the Islamic courts and al-Shabaab to be vague and lacking in detail. In the light of that, and the fact that he was supposed to have received the alleged threats in a period during which he had not substantiated that he had been residing in Mogadishu, the Board concluded that he had failed to substantiate a well-founded fear of persecution. Consequently, the Board rejected his application for asylum.",

The court stated that there was no reason to question that he had been living in Mogadishu for periods of his life.

It noted that al-Shabaab no longer held any military power in Mogadishu and there was at present no general conflict or fighting on the streets of the city. Moreover, it noted that the improved security situation had now led to people returning to the city and humanitarian organisations had been able to establish themselves in the area again. The Migration Board also noted that there was significant political instability in the city and no functioning public administration. It concluded that it could no longer be considered that everyone who was present in the city would be at risk of persecution or illtreatment on the ground of the general security situation and the level of conflict was no longer such as to consider it to be a situation of armed conflict. However, in the light of the political instability and the lack of functioning public administration, a high level of criminality and the occurrence of security incidents that were harmful to the civilians, it found that the present security situation was one of severe conflict (sv\u00e5ra mots\u00e4ttningar).",

There is no frontline in the city anymore and there have been some improvements in the infrastructure, such as electricity, which affect everyday life.

Somalis return to Mogadishu, both from other parts of Somalia and from abroad, but most of them stay a short while to make business and then return to their families outside the city or in the diaspora. Investments in land and real estate have led to a construction boom. This in turn leads to work opportunities for day labour in the city but also means that internally displaced persons (IDP), with short notice and without having a new place to go to, are driven from their homes. The widespread criminality and the fact that the police lack capacity to investigate crimes, and that corruption in the administration is widespread, leave the ordinary man in an unsecure situation. Weapon related injuries are common. There were 3,000 weapon related injuries reported during February to May 2012. For the ordinary man the biggest risk is to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and be exposed to a bomb attack of some kind or a shoot out and be accused by TFG of being an Al Shabaab member or vice versa. As Al Shabaab no longer controls any part of the city and the Al Shabaab members are mixed in with the civilian population it is hard to know who is who and the suspicion is high from all sides. It does not take much for someone to become suspicious of someone else to belong to the other side, causing this person to be a target for violence.

This decrease is due to front-line fighting having moved out of Mogadishu. There are now fewer mass-casualty attacks and killings, in particular due to the cessation of shelling in Mogadishu.

In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v.

TFG\u2019s mandate ended on 20 August 2012 and a new administration was inaugurated (see the Human Rights Watch World Report, paragraph 46 above). The main challenge for the new Somali National Government is improving security (ibid) and at least one source states that the security situation deteriorated again in the first two months of the new administration, i.e. September and October 2012 (see the joint report from the Danish and Norwegian Immigration services of January 2013, paragraph 35 above, referring to a director of operations of a local NGO).",

Since then, that number has risen to 360,000 as masses of internally displaced persons (IDPs) live in makeshift tents in crowded conditions in the city. Human Rights Watch further confirms that the diversion of humanitarian aid within Mogadishu by government forces, allied militia, officials and others, and insecurity at food distribution sites have significantly limited the access that displaced persons have to assistance.

The situation in the region remains volatile and can change from day to day. In view of the objective situation of instability and violence, the UNHCR in 2013 has continued to reinforce its advocacy for protection against refoulement.",

However, given the devastating human rights abuses throughout the twenty year civil war and the ongoing human rights abuses under the current regime, it is premature, to my mind, to conclude that the situation has changed so fundamentally in the two years since the Court delivered its judgment in Sufi that Mogadishu can now be considered as a place to which failed asylum seekers may be returned safely and without posing a real risk under Article 3 of the Convention.",

This, it was noted, was a moment of hope for the people of Somalia. However, there is a world of a difference between a small number of people choosing, voluntarily, to assume the risks involved in returning to their war torn homes and the forcible expulsion by a Convention State of vulnerable people to a still volatile conflict zone with dire humanitarian deficiencies. In view of the objective situation in Somalia, the UNHCR continues to advocate that returns should be, first and foremost, voluntary. The Commissioner concluded that at this time \u201cthe vast majority of Somalis in exile are still in need of asylum\u201d as conditions are not yet safe for a large-scale repatriation.",
