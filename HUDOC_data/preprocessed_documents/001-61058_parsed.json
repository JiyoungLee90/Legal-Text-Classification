The medical and nursing notes indicated that Judith McGlinchey had not been seen to vomit during the night and that she collapsed, vomiting, in the morning. The Court does not find that in the urgency of her immediate transferral to hospital the failure to ensure that Judith McGlinchey was adequately cleaned discloses any element of treatment that could be characterised as degrading. As regards complaints made to her mother that she was having to clean up her own vomit, there is no substantiation of this in the hospital or prison records although one entry refers to Judith McGlinchey refusing to clean her cell. The Government, relying on a statement by the head of nursing care, submitted that this was a general tidying requirement, not in response to a vomiting incident. The Government asserted that the practice was for nurses to clean any vomit which landed on the floor or elsewhere in the cell.

For the heroin withdrawal symptoms, he initially prescribed a withdrawal drug, Lofexidine. One dose of this drug was omitted at midday due to her low blood pressure. On 10 December 1998 she was seen again by Dr K., who prescribed an intra-muscular injection for the continuing withdrawal symptoms. He found no signs that she was dehydrated and placed more importance on his clinical impressions than her apparent drop in weight from 50 kg to 43 kg since there was known to be a discrepancy between the scales used on admission and those in the health-care centre. He was aware however that there was a potential problem and gave instructions for her weight to be monitored. On 11 December 1998 she was examined again by Dr K., who found no signs of dehydration and considered that her condition was generally stable. He ordered a further injection which was observed to have some effect as she was able to keep down fluids during the rest of the day. Oral doses of the anti-emetic drug were prescribed to continue over the weekend. The nursing notes indicate that on occasion during this period the nurses administered mild anti-nausea medication to assist Judith McGlinchey with her symptoms and were encouraging her to take fluids.",

It appears therefore that Judith McGlinchey was not examined by a doctor for two days. On 12 December 1998 her temperature, blood pressure and pulse were observed to be normal.

Dr K. emphasised that, throughout, her vital signs were within the normal range, and that a person suffering serious dehydration would be expected to show lassitude and identifiable physical symptoms which were not present in Judith McGlinchey. However, at the inquest, Dr Tobin considered that, although it had not been established by specific analysis that Judith McGlinchey was dehydrated on entry to hospital due to an inability to insert a central line, there were strong indications to that effect. While the findings could be accounted for by significant blood loss, one episode of coffee-ground vomiting would not provide an adequate explanation. ",

This was the result of a week of largely uncontrolled vomiting symptoms and an inability to eat or hold down fluids. This situation, in addition to causing Judith McGlinchey distress and suffering, posed very serious risks to her health, as shown by her subsequent collapse. Having regard to the responsibility owed by prison authorities to provide the requisite medical care for detained persons, the Court finds that in the present case there was a failure to meet the standards imposed by Article 3 of the Convention. It notes in this context the failure of the prison authorities to provide accurate means of establishing Judith McGlinchey\u2019s weight loss, which was a factor that should have alerted the prison to the seriousness of her condition, but was largely discounted due to the discrepancy of the scales. There was a gap in the monitoring of her condition by a doctor over the weekend when there was a further significant drop in weight and a failure of the prison to take more effective steps to treat Judith McGlinchey\u2019s condition, such as her admission to hospital to ensure the intake of medication and fluids intravenously, or to obtain more expert assistance in controlling the vomiting.",

It is not apparent that, in an action for judicial review, which Judith McGlinchey could have brought alleging that the prison had failed in its duty to take reasonable care of her in custody and which could have provided a means of examining the way in which the prison authorities carried out their responsibilities, damages could have been awarded on a different basis.

But I would add immediately that in the Court\u2019s view \u201cthe absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3\u201d (see V. v. the United Kingdom, no. 24888/94, \u00a7 71, ECHR 1999IX, and Peers v.

Moreover, I firmly believe that the facts of the case should not be assessed with \u201cthe wisdom of hindsight\u201d, nor should one be influenced by the fact that Judith McGlinchey unfortunately died, on 3 January 1999, as a result of the cardiac arrest she suffered on 14 December 1998 and its after-effects. But, for the reasons I shall give, even if I confine my attention to the position at the time of her incarceration, disregarding its tragic outcome, I can reach the conclusion that the treatment suffered by Judith McGlinchey was objectively inhuman and/or degrading.",

The victim was a heroin addict and suffered from asthma \u2013 she had been taken into hospital six times in the previous year on that account. In spite of her run-down state of health she was sentenced to prison, although there had been an alternative proposal for a probation order. As soon as she entered New Hall Prison she began to suffer frequent attacks of vomiting. Although she had stated that she wished to come off heroin and the prison doctor had immediately prescribed her medicine to ease the withdrawal symptoms, this drug was not given to her on her second day in prison (perhaps for good reasons, but the fact remains). She was also twice locked in her cell as a punishment for bad conduct. But above all, the vomiting did not cease, day or night, and it was accompanied by a steep and heavy loss of weight \u2013 7 kg in forty-eight hours and 10 kg between the Monday of her arrival and the following Saturday. I can accept that the prison doctor\u2019s absence during the weekend was not decisive, as there was a locum doctor in attendance, and she could have asked to see him. But I cannot understand why the prisoner was not taken into hospital during the first few days of her sentence, when she was vomiting continually, had lost 20% of her body weight in five days and was known to be simultaneously trying to come off drugs. It was only on Monday morning, that is one week after she began her sentence, that she was taken to hospital by ambulance, because she had collapsed and the appearance of her vomit revealed the presence of blood in her stomach. That factual nexus is the reason why I and the majority of my colleagues reached the finding of a violation.",

Finland, judgment of 16 December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VIII, pp. 2821-22, \u00a7 55). I might also mention, although the facts were different (the prisoner being seriously disabled), Price v. the United Kingdom (no. 33394/96, ECHR 2001-VII), with the separate opinion of Sir Nicolas Bratza, whom I joined, and the separate opinion of Judge Greve; the authors of those opinions considered that the very principle of committing the applicant to prison was incompatible with Article 3 on account of her condition. See also the recent Mouisel v. France (no. 67263/01, ECHR 2002-IX) in which the Court unanimously held that there had been a violation of Article 3 on account of the conditions of treatment and continued detention of a person suffering from an incurable illness.",

But if I return to the instant case, I think that all those authorities, for their part, underestimated the seriousness of Judith McGlinchey\u2019s personal condition. The accumulation of errors was such, in my opinion, as to constitute in the final analysis a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. And I would have reached the same conclusion if the victim had in the end survived; the emotion aroused by her death must not be allowed to distort the assessment of her detention and conditions of treatment as such.",

The Chamber has similarly found unsubstantiated the allegation that asthma medicine was not administered, the nursing notes indicating that inhalers were provided when Judith McGlinchey was seen to be wheezing. As to the fact that, out of a total of twenty doses of antibiotic medicine for Judith McGlinchey\u2019s arm over a five-day period, four were either not administered or not entered in the drugs record, the Chamber, while observing that in either event a regrettable lack of procedure was indicated, has found that there is nothing to show that this failure had any adverse effect on Judith McGlinchey\u2019s condition or caused her any discomfort.",

During 13 December, when she took a small dinner and did not vomit during the day, she was regarded by the nursing staff as improving, to the extent that it appears that it was not considered necessary to give her the prescribed anti-emetic medicine. Although she did vomit again twice that evening, no problems were observed during the night. Further, while the lack of any examination of Judith McGlinchey by a doctor, qualified, for example, to discern any problems of dehydration during a two-day period causes me some concern, I note that it was not established by the evidence at the inquest that Judith McGlinchey was in fact dehydrated when she arrived at hospital after her collapse on the morning of 14 December. Dr Tobin was unable to inject a central line due to her condition and, though there were in his view signs consistent with dehydration, he did not exclude that these could also have been the result of significant blood loss. More important still, to my mind, is the fact that none of the doctors who gave evidence at the inquest criticised Dr K. for failing to have Judith McGlinchey admitted earlier to hospital. ",
