It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply the domestic law, even in those fields where the Convention \"incorporates\" the rules of that law: the national authorities are, in the nature of things, particularly qualified to settle the issues arising in this connection (see the Winterwerp judgment, cited above, p. 20, para. 46, the Bozano v.

It had no longer been necessary to keep him away from the witnesses after the end of the trial hearing of his co-accused Ceccio, on the evening of 13 June, particularly as he had had every opportunity to make contact with them during the three years of liberty prior to his reincarceration. The reason given by the Alpes-Maritimes Assize Court on 13 June 1990, namely that \"mere court supervision, even subject to the payment of a security, appears at this stage of the proceedings inadequate to ensure that the accused Kemmache will appear for trial\" (see paragraph 11 above), had likewise lacked relevance.
