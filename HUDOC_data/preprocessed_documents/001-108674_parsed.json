The inability of the applicant credit union to challenge the imposition of the receivership before a court was also found to be in violation of Article 6 of the Convention (\u00a7 67 of the principal judgment). At the same time the Court did not find a violation of the Convention in the issuing of the receivership order as such, and indeed expressly found that the take-over of the applicant credit union by the interim receiver could in itself be regarded as compatible with that margin of appreciation in so far as the applicant credit union had failed to establish that the State\u2019s suspicions that its financial situation required its placement in interim receivership had been unreasonable (see the principal judgment, \u00a7 51).",
