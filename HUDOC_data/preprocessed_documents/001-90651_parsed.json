They maintained that the affirmation of the ideas of the Movement, as a terrorist association, would in practice mean killings, terrorist activities and support of fascism and its ideology. That had caused disorder and public reactions, resulting in two incidents at the Association\u2019s opening ceremony. They presented a number of documents concerning Ivan Mihajlov\u2019s life and his activities; the activities of the organisation called the VMRO (\u0412\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u041e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430) under his leadership, in particular in the period 1924-1934, and his alleged alliance with the fascist regime during the Second World War. Referring to that material, they maintained that Ivan (Van\u010do) Mihajlov (Radko) was considered as a person who used terrorist methods to impose the fascist idea of denunciation of the Macedonian people\u2019s identity and to promote the latter as a fictitious and non-existent people called \u201cMacedonian Bulgarians\u201d (\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438). They stated that in pursuance of that idea, he and his followers had killed and massacred a considerable number of Macedonians who had fought for the national freedom of their people. The Government stated that the creation and operation of an Association, the name, platform and programme activities of which had been inspired by the name and image of Ivan Mihajlov, had irrefutably been directed towards incitement to national hatred or intolerance, contrary to Article 20 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution, something that could result in clashes between the Macedonian people and the citizens associated with the Association. They claimed that repudiation of the identity of the Macedonian people and its statehood had been at the heart of the Association\u2019s activity. Accordingly, violent destruction of the constitutional order was the fundamental objective of the Association. As stated by the Government, the public reaction on the opening ceremony had been clear evidence that the Association would incite to national hatred. The Association\u2019s members had had recourse to brutal physical force against their adversaries, causing injuries for which they had been subsequently convicted by a court and sentenced to imprisonment. The Government submitted that the existence of the Association should be considered as an abuse of freedom of association, as its aim had not been the expression of thoughts and beliefs, but negation of the identity of the Macedonian people through promotion of the fascist ideas of Ivan Mihajlov concerning the \u201cMacedonian Bulgarians\u201d, who were unknown in history, legal science and practice. The ultimate objective of the Association was to initiate national hatred, religious unrest and a revival of the terror that Ivan Mihajlov had practiced in his time, when he executed hundreds of opponents.",

In the absence of any concrete evidence to demonstrate that in choosing to call itself \u201cRadko\u201d the Association had opted for a policy that represented a real threat to the Macedonian society or the State, the Court considers that the submission based on the Association\u2019s name cannot, by itself, justify its dissolution (see, mutatis mutandis, Ouranio Toxo and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041 and United Communist Party of Turkey and Others, cited above, \u00a7 54).",

However, sweeping measures of a preventive nature to suppress freedom of assembly and expression other than in cases of incitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles \u2013 however shocking and unacceptable certain views or words used may appear to the authorities, and however illegitimate the demands made may be \u2013 do a disservice to democracy and often even endanger it. One of the principal characteristics of democracy is the possibility it offers of resolving problems through dialogue, without recourse to violence, even when those problems are irksome. Democracy thrives on freedom of expression. From that point of view, there can be no justification for hindering a group solely because it seeks to debate in public certain issues and to find, according to democratic rules, solutions (see \u00c7etinkaya v. Turkey, no. 75569/01, \u00a7\u00a029, 27 June 2006; Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088 and 97; and United Communist Party of Turkey and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a057). To judge by its constitutive acts, the Court considers that that was indeed the Association\u2019s objective. In addition, the Association confined itself to realising these objectives by means of publications, conferences and cooperation with similar associations. The Association\u2019s choice of means could hardly have been belied by any practical action it took, since it was dissolved soon after being formed and accordingly did not even have time to take any action. It was thus penalised for conduct relating solely to the exercise of freedom of expression. In this connection, the Court points out that it is not in a position nor is it its role to take the side of any of the parties as to the correctness of the applicants\u2019 ideas.
