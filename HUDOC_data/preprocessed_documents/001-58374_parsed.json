In that connection the majority relied on the suspensive effect of the appeal. The majority considered that in the circumstances the requirement in question imposed on a \u201cdefendant\u201d (see paragraph 49 of the judgment) the obligation to deprive himself of his liberty, and that respect for the presumption of innocence combined with the suspensive effect of the appeal was incompatible with the obligation for a free \u201caccused\u201d person to become a prisoner irrespective of the duration of his imprisonment (ibid.).",

Such a dismissal is a reasonable probability and the requirement to surrender for a short period, i.e. the day before the hearing of the appeal, appears to me quite a reasonable safeguard against the possibility of the convict\u2019s escape.

I do not agree with this conclusion. I would recall, in this connection, the case of an arrest or detention on remand of a suspect before he is even tried in order to prevent his escape, a situation which is reasonable and legally justified. This should apply a fortiori in respect of the placing in custody of an appellant, in cases like the present, in view of the existence of the impugned judgment convicting him.",

The procedure in the Monnell and Morris case was an extension of the detention of a person for a period equal to the time spent by him pending the hearing of his application for leave to appeal because the application was found to be unmeritorious. The aim of that sanction was to discourage unmeritorious appeals and thereby ensure that criminal appeals were heard within a reasonable time. However, if such a restriction on the right of access to a court was considered by the Court to be acceptable for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention, I fail to see how the restriction at issue in the present case, which I believe is of a much lighter effect, can be found to be excessive.",
