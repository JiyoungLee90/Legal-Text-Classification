For this reason, the citizens of other republics, upon the expiry of the time-limits set in subsection 2 of section 81, found themselves in an insecure legal position. From the text of the transitional provisions, which specify that the provisions of the Aliens Act are to be applied, the said persons could not have grasped what their position would be as foreigners and which statutory provisions should apply to them.

The principle of legal certainty as one of the principles of a State governed by the rule of law under Article 2 of the Constitution requires that the position of the persons concerned should not remain unregulated for any period of time. Permanent resident status is an important linking aspect for claiming certain rights and legal benefits which the persons concerned could not claim owing to the legally unregulated state of affairs. Their position in the Republic of Slovenia was legally uncertain owing to the unregulated state of affairs, as by acquiring the status of foreigner they lost their permanent resident status in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia and found themselves in an unregulated position or in an essentially worsened legal position (for example, that of having temporary resident status), which has lasted, in the case of some of the adversely affected persons, for as much as ten years. From the recommendation that the National Assembly made in the light of the 7th annual report of the Human Rights Ombudsman for the year 2001 (Official Gazette RS, No 2/03), it follows that the issue of the legal position of such citizens of other republics still calls for legal regulation. ...",

Having regard to this lengthy period in which the applicants experienced insecurity and legal uncertainty and to the gravity of the consequences of the \u201cerasure\u201d for them, the Grand Chamber, unlike the Chamber, considers that the acknowledgment of the human rights violations and the issuance of permanent residence permits to Mr Kuri\u0107, Ms Mezga, Mr\u00a0Ristanovi\u0107, Mr Berisha, Mr Ademi and Mr Mini\u0107 did not constitute \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d redress at the national level (see, mutatis mutandis, Aristimu\u00f1o Mendizabal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 67-69 and 70-72; Mengesha Kimfe, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-47 and 67-72; and Agraw, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30-32 and 50-55).",

This means, amongst other things, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 68-69; Orchowski v.

The absence of any notification or personal information could have led them to believe that their status as residents had remained unchanged and that they could continue residing and working in Slovenia as they had done for several years.

Where the difference in treatment is based on race, colour or ethnic origin, the notion of objective and reasonable justification must be interpreted as strictly as possible (see, among many other authorities, Or\u0161u\u0161 and Others v.

At the relevant time, citizenship of the federal State could have been looked at as an objective ground for such preferential treatment.

Also, the twenty-year postponement in legally resolving this question \u2013 on a case-by-case basis! \u2013 in the domestic legal system was to some extent due to the contrived and disingenuous impression, maintained in the misled Slovenian public, to the effect that at least some of the aggrieved had brought the problem upon themselves; allegedly their procrastination was due to their own nationalist (Serbian, Croatian etc.) ambivalence as to their animus manendi concerning their continued residence in the then newly established Republic of Slovenia. This was before, during and after the Balkan wars twenty years ago. One must therefore keep in mind that \u2013 at the time \u2013 it was far from obvious for many of those concerned, in the context of their own wishful thinking, that the megalomaniac myths of Greater Serbia or greater whatever in the Balkans were unfounded. The real, and not merely legal, victims of these primitive tribal wars \u2013 fraught with the narcissism of small differences and with the consequent unspeakable atrocities that followed in Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2013 are now counted in the hundreds of thousands of those killed, tortured, raped, and so on. Moreover, the perfidious instigation of certain continental European foreign intelligence services interested in the disintegration of , which triggered the rest of the insane activation of the chauvinist and revanchist collective unconscious, has been duly publicised, especially in the American press, and is now an established historical fact. This unfortunate process caused the surfacing of figures now known to be psychopaths, who were personally responsible for all manner of inhuman callousness. The latter was simply unimaginable in  before this tsunami of cruelty actually started to roll over the country. The historian A.J.P. Taylor, for example, considered Josip Broz Tito to be the last of the Habsburgs, capable of keeping together a tolerant multinational community; A.J.P. Taylor did not live to see it disintegrate. On the other hand, from the corroborated retrospective view of twenty years, the disintegration of  was and continues to be an unmitigated disaster. In this historical reassessment, the French would say: \u201cA quoi tout cela a-t-il servi?\u201d No reasonable person can reasonably answer this question except by saying, as Erich Fromm would have, that this was a folie \u00e0 millions. We do not wish to draw parallels here with the disintegration of the ex-Soviet empire and its consequences; suffice it to say, because this is a matter of international law, that Woodrow Wilson, before launching, under the influence of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk, his famous catchphrase concerning the self-determination of nations \u2013 had been explicitly and repeatedly forewarned about the possible consequences. The consequences are now here; that is to say, the particularisation and balkanisation of national entities has in fact materialised. This will hopefully be compensated for, as I emphasised at the time in an article in El Pa\u00eds, by universalisation in the context of the European Union. Nationalist squabbles would be in the Hegelian sense transcended and would, including border disputes, become largely inapposite within the context of the European Union. The European free movement of people, for example, makes what is at stake in this case simply sans objet. What has come apart on one level is, with the tragic historical delay, slowly coming together on a higher level. It is also increasingly clear that the keeping together, in the manner of A.J.P. Taylor, of this, in other words, the European entity, will require much political wisdom. Still, the historical delay has caused this case and many other still more appalling consequences. Some of them have ascended to international jurisdictions, most of them have not.",

This is why we have a precise historical record of the number of the aggrieved, the number of those who were not provided for by the domestic system, in the manner of Article 41 of the Convention, and so on. The above-mentioned two-faced legalistic legacy of the communist system reminds us of the case of Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany ([GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, ECHR 2001II); there, too, the fa\u00e7ade of schizophrenic legality had been maintained, in , as seemingly intact. Behind the fa\u00e7ade the impunity had continued unimpeded. In the case before us we had an intentional lacuna in the law, which was then filled in by the semi-official but unpublished d\u00e9p\u00eaches issued by the then Minister of the Interior and his Secretary of State. They were explicitly approved by the then Prime Minister and his Government. In terms of criminal law we may therefore speak of dolus directus in the first case and at least of dolus eventualis in the latter case. Meanwhile, the public had been misled to believe, as I said, that the thousands affected by this were simply negligent in failing to apply for their Slovenian citizenship. Fortunately, owing to the legalistic nature of the abuse, all these actions, correspondence and so on, as pointed out above, were recorded and are on file; the Grand Chamber had the opportunity to see the relevant correspondence and the d\u00e9p\u00eaches and to take them into account. It remains to be seen whether the domestic criminal legal system will, vis-\u00e0-vis the protagonists, react accordingly; if not the issue will again come to  under the procedural limbs of Articles 3 and 8, among others. Similarly, when it comes to compensating the 25,671 allegedly aggrieved persons, the judicial branch of the domestic legal system would, as in the judicial delay cases (see Lukenda v. Slovenia, no. 23032/02, ECHR 2005X), be well advised to process all of the situations fairly and on a caseby-case basis.",

Since the Court found that the domestic remedies were not sufficiently effective, it should not have been necessary to exhaust them, and the reasoning in the judgment is contradictory in this respect; I shall not labour the point.",

Mr Dabeti\u0107 and Mrs Ristanovi\u0107 were in very difficult circumstances for reasons relating to ill health and geographical distance, and the complexity of the various legal changes affecting their situation did not make it any easier for them to become acquainted with the instruments that might have formed the basis for their requests. It is therefore harsh to maintain that their subjective \u2013 and, I repeat, apparent \u2013 lack of interest can be taken to equate to loss of victim status, which is an objective factor. A shift from subjective to objective considerations is not impossible in certain special circumstances, but it can certainly not be presumed.",

In our view similar concerns were applicable to the conclusions reached by the Chamber of the Third Section in its judgment of 31 May 2007 in respect of the victim status of the applicants Mr Petre\u0161 and Mr Jovanovi\u0107. In this regard the Chamber on the one hand found that \u201cthe issuing of the retroactive residence permits, in line with the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision, constitutes an adequate and sufficient remedy for their complaints\u201d (see paragraph 311 of the Chamber judgment), while on the other hand finding a violation of Article 13 of the Convention, holding that \u201cthe respondent Government have failed to establish that the [same] remedies at the applicants\u2019 disposal can be regarded as effective remedies\u201d (see paragraph 385 of the Chamber judgment).",

For the same reasons why we disagree that an applicant may be required to make use of remedies that are unable to provide \u201cadequate and sufficient\u201d redress, we equally fail to see how the implementation of the same measures could deprive an applicant of his or her victim status. In previous cases the Grand Chamber has subjected the victim status of applicants to scrutiny in the light of the (in)appropriateness and (in)sufficiency of the remedies available at the national level as two issues that should be examined together, since they reflect two sides of the same coin (see G\u00e4fgen v.
