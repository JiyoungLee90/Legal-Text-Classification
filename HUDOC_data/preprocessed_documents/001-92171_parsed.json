For example, the latter activity is an essential preparatory step in journalism and is an inherent, protected part of press freedom (see Dammann v. Switzerland (no.\u00a077551/01, \u00a7\u00a052, 25 April 2006). \u00a0The function of the press includes the creation of forums for public debate. However, the realisation of this function is not limited to the media or professional journalists. In the present case, the preparation of the forum of public debate was conducted by a non-governmental organisation. The purpose of the applicant\u2019s activities can therefore be said to have been an essential element of informed public debate. The Court has repeatedly recognised civil society\u2019s important contribution to the discussion of public affairs (see, for example, Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a068416/01, \u00a7\u00a089, ECHR 2005II). The applicant is an association involved in human rights litigation with various objectives, including the protection of freedom of information.

It considers that the present case essentially concerns an interference \u2013 by virtue of the censorial power of an information monopoly \u2013 with the exercise of the functions of a social watchdog, like the press, rather than a denial of a general right of access to official documents. In this connection, a comparison can be drawn with the Court\u2019s previous concerns that preliminary obstacles created by the authorities in the way of press functions call for the most careful scrutiny (see Chauvy and Others v. France, no.\u00a064915/01, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2004VI). Moreover, the State\u2019s obligations in matters of freedom of the press include the elimination of barriers to the exercise of press functions where, in issues of public interest, such barriers exist solely because of an information monopoly held by the authorities. The Court notes at this juncture that the information sought by the applicant in the present case was ready and available (see, a contrario, Guerra and Others v. Italy, 19 February 1998, \n\u00a7 53 in fine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I) and did not require the collection of any data by the Government. Therefore, the Court considers that the State had an obligation not to impede the flow of information sought by the applicant.",

It is true that he had informed the press that he had lodged the complaint, and therefore his opinion on this public matter could, in principle, be identified with his person. However, the Court considers that it would be fatal for freedom of expression in the sphere of politics if public figures could censor the press and public debate in the name of their personality rights, alleging that their opinions on public matters are related to their person and therefore constitute private data which cannot be disclosed without consent. These considerations cannot justify, in the Court\u2019s view, the interference of which complaint is made in the present case.",
