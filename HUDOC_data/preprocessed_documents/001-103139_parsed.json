He informed the police that his son had thrown him out of the house and had locked himself inside with a number of different sorts of weapons including an air rifle, axe and knives. When the police arrived the applicant had an axe in his hand. He told the police officers to leave the property while threatening them with an air rifle. The police officers decided not to continue the intervention. When the applicant's father informed them that the applicant was under psychiatric care and recently refused to take the prescribed medications, they called a psychologist, negotiators and a doctor. Following two-hour negotiations, which failed \u2013 the applicant fired several shots at the negotiators who were approaching the house with shields - the police called the antiterrorist brigade. Considering that the situation posed a threat to the applicant's family members and those who arrived on the spot, at about midnight a brigade of eight policemen commenced their intervention, which consisted in forcing the entrance door to the apartment, deafening the applicant with a grenade and immobilising him. The applicant was aggressive; he was armed with an axe, knives and an air rifle and he fired at the policemen. According to the applicant, the policemen were also aggressive: they shouted, swore and kicked him and one of them shot him in the left leg. The applicant, even when hurt on his leg, still threw the earlier prepared bayonets at the police officers. According to the police, the shot at the applicant's leg was preceded by one warning shot.

The Court considers it uncontested that the applicant posed a threat to himself, his family and all persons taking part in the intervention. As was found by the expert psychologist later during the investigation, the applicant was incapable of understanding the significance of his behaviour. Thus, his behaviour could have given rise to unexpected developments. By calling the police negotiators the domestic authorities first took steps to calm down the applicant and only when these methods proved ineffective did they have recourse to physical force. As regards the shot fired at the applicant's leg, the Court is persuaded by the Government's arguments that it was unavoidable in the circumstances of the present case and that the police officer who wounded the applicant took the shot while facing a direct threat to his life. The Court finds it impossible to assess, as the applicant claims, that the use of the restraining net would have been sufficient in the circumstances of the present case.",

The fact that the appeal was unsuccessful cannot be considered pertinent. There is no evidence that the prosecution should have taken any other steps in order to establish the facts alleged by the applicant. The Court considers that the procedural shortcomings relied on by the applicant's family were not crucial for establishing the responsibility of the police officers. By way of example, as regards the applicant's allegations concerning the number of bullets still remaining in the walls of his house the Court notes that this circumstance has not been confirmed by the domestic authorities. What is more, the request for institution of investigation into the alleged abuse of power by the police officers had been lodged about six months after the events in question (see paragraph\u00a021 above). As regards the distance from which the shot was fired, it was examined and established in the proceedings before the Ombudsman, who, in fact, had conducted additional examination of the circumstances of the present case (see paragraph 21 above).",
