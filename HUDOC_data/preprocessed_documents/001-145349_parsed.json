This principle equally applies to the present case. As regards non-pecuniary damage, the Court considers that the applicant sustained some non-pecuniary loss arising from the breaches of the Convention found in this case. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, and having regard to the amounts awarded in \u010coli\u0107 and Others (cited above, \u00a7 21), it awards the applicant EUR 1,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable thereon.",
