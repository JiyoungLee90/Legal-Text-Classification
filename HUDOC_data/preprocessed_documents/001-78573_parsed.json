The Court agrees that, assuming that the applicant had violated the conditions of his release, this factor justified keeping him in custody in the initial stages of the proceedings. However, the Court considers that that ground gradually lost its force and relevance as the proceedings progressed. In particular, given the absence of any further attempt on the part of the applicant to obstruct the proceedings, it is difficult to accept that this single incident could justify the conclusion that the risk of his tampering with evidence or going into hiding persisted during the entire period that he spent in custody (see Harazin v. Poland, no.\u00a038227/02, \u00a7\u00a042, 10\u00a0January 2006).",

In this connection the Court reiterates that in cases where characteristics pertaining to the applicant's personality and level of maturity and reliability are of importance in deciding on his dangerousness, Article 5 \u00a7 4 requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation (see Waite v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a053236/99, \u00a7\u00a059, 10 December 2002). The Court considers, however, that in the present case the question of the assessment of the applicant's character or mental state did not arise. His personal attendance at all of the sessions at which his detention on remand had been prolonged was therefore not required, and the presence of his lawyer would have ensured respect for equality of arms in those proceedings.",
