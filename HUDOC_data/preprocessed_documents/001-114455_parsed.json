In assessing evidence, the Court has adopted the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on the responsibility of the Contracting States under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, among others, Nachova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], nos.\u00a043577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0147, ECHR 2005-VII; Ila\u015fcu and Others v.\u00a0Moldova and Russia [GC], no.\u00a048787/99, \u00a7\u00a026, ECHR 2004-VII; Akdivar and Others v.

In particular, the psychological and physical ill-treatment complained of is alleged to have occurred in private at a police station in the absence of any eyewitnesses. Accordingly, the privacy in which the events took place, whether arranged by the police officers deliberately or not, narrowed, even further, the opportunities of establishing the truth. Similarly, it should not be overlooked that the applicant was a person with a long history of mental illness and his arrest and detention without any access to a doctor and lawyer on that evening must have placed him in a particularly vulnerable position. The Court therefore concludes that in the circumstances of the present case it was for the domestic authorities to refute the applicant\u2019s allegations of psychological and physical ill-treatment.",
