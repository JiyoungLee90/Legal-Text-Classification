In the reasoning part of the judgment it held that the applicant had failed to provide the court with written or oral reasons for his appeal (recurs), as required by the applicable rules of criminal procedure and that the court could not identify any reasons that would require the Court of Appeal to quash the judgments of the lower courts. At the same time the court allowed the appeal (recurs) lodged by S.I., and ordered the applicant to pay ROL\u00a0100,000,000 (approximately EUR\u00a02,600) to S.I. for pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage, out of which ROL\u00a030,000,000 (approximately EUR\u00a0800) would be paid jointly with the insurance company A., for the mental and physical suffering which S.I. had endured and the medical expenses she had incurred. It held that the lower courts had misapplied the law with regard to the civil limb of the proceedings, and considered that they had erred in acquitting the applicant on the ground that he could not have anticipated the presence of the cart on the road. According to the evidence in the file, the applicant had committed the unlawful act in respect of which he had been indicted and could have foreseen the danger in question.

According to its established caselaw there are three criteria to be taken into account when deciding whether a person was \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d for the purposes of Article\u00a06, namely the classification of the proceedings under national law, their essential nature and the type and severity of the penalty that the applicant risked incurring (see Phillips v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, no.\u00a041087/98, \u00a7\u00a031, ECHR\u00a02001VII and A.P.,\u00a0M.P.\u00a0and\u00a0T.P. v.\u00a0Switzerland, 29\u00a0August\u00a01997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997V, \u00a7\u00a039). Moreover, the scope of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 is not limited to criminal proceedings that are pending (see Allenet\u00a0de\u00a0Ribemont v.\u00a0France, judgment of 10\u00a0February\u00a01995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0308, \u00a7\u00a035). In certain instances, the Court has also found the provision applicable to judicial decisions taken after the discontinuation of such proceedings (see, in particular, Minelli v. Switzerland, 25\u00a0March\u00a01983, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a062, and Lutz, Englert and N\u00f6lkenbockhoff v. Germany, 25\u00a0August\u00a01987, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0123), or following an acquittal (see Sekanina\u00a0v.\u00a0Austria, 25\u00a0August\u00a01993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0266A; Rushiti v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a028389/95, 21\u00a0March\u00a02000; and Lamanna v. Austria, no.\u00a028923/95, 10\u00a0July\u00a02001). Those judgments concerned proceedings related to such matters as an accused\u2019s obligation to bear court costs and prosecution expenses, a claim for reimbursement of his (or his heirs\u2019) necessary costs, or compensation for pretrial detention, and which were found to constitute a consequence of, and to be concomitant to criminal proceedings. Accordingly, the Court will examine whether the compensation proceedings in the present case gave rise to a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d against the applicant and, in the event that this was not the case, whether the compensation proceedings were, nevertheless, linked to the criminal trial in such a way as to fall within the scope of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a02.",

However, this concerned only the initial criminal charge of which he was acquitted; it was of no relevance to the compensation claim. The Court notes that the latter had its legal basis in the general principles of the national law on torts applicable to personal injuries. According to the aforementioned principles, criminal liability is not a prerequisite for liability to pay compensation. Even where, as in the present case, the victim had opted to join a compensation claim to the criminal trial, the claim would still be considered a \u201ccivil\u201d one. This is also apparent from the domestic courts\u2019 judgments in the applicant\u2019s case, which described the claim as \u201ccivil\u201d. Thus, the Court finds that the compensation claim at issue was not considered to be a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d under the relevant national law.",

The outcome of the criminal proceedings was not decisive for the compensation case. The victim had a right to claim compensation regardless of whether the defendant had been convicted or, as in the present case, acquitted, and the compensation issue was to be the subject of a separate legal assessment, based on criteria and evidentiary standards which differed in several important respects from those applicable to criminal liability.",

Nor can the fact that evidence from the criminal trial has been used to determine the civil law consequences of that act warrant such a characterisation. Otherwise, Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a02 would give a criminal acquittal the undesirable effect of preempting the victim\u2019s possibilities for claiming compensation under the civil law of tort, thereby constituting an arbitrary and disproportionate limitation on his or her right of access to court under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. This again could give an acquitted defendant, who is deemed responsible according to the civil burden of proof, the undue advantage of avoiding any responsibility for his or her actions. Such an extensive interpretation would not be supported either by the wording of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a02, or by any common ground in the national legal systems within the Convention community. On the contrary, in a significant number of Contracting States, an acquittal does not preclude the establishment of civil liability in relation to the same facts (see Y. v.\u00a0Norway, no.\u00a056568/00, \u00a7\u00a041, 11\u00a0February\u00a02003).",
