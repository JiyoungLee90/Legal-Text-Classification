The Government also submitted that the bankruptcy proceedings should be considered separately from the negligence action: the bankruptcy proceedings were not an automatic consequence of the costs\u2019 order but rather the result of an independent decision by KC to issue a bankruptcy summons and the applicant had not specifically complained about delay in the taxation or bankruptcy proceedings.

The Court also observes that the applicant made extensive use of the procedural opportunities open to him in the proceedings: he, inter alia, made three applications for discovery (1989-1992); he applied to strike out KC\u2019s defence; he applied for leave to amend his appeal in April 1997; and he requested that his appeal be heard by a differently constituted Supreme Court. In addition, the Court considers the delay in the proceedings after the issuance of the taxation certificate (April 1999) to be entirely attributable to the applicant who has, to date, failed to pay the costs established on taxation as due to KC.
