Russia, no. 31535/09, \u00a7 62, 6 March 2014, with further references) and that \u2012 where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition \u2012 supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at successfully treating the detainee\u2019s health problems or preventing their aggravation (see, inter alia, Ukhan v.

The Court stresses that medical treatment within prison facilities must be appropriate and comparable to the quality of treatment which the State authorities have committed themselves to providing for the entirety of the population. Nevertheless, this does not mean that each detainee must be guaranteed the same level of medical treatment that is available in the best health establishments outside prison facilities (see Sadretdinov v. Russia, no. 17564/06, \u00a7 67, 24 May 2016, and Konovalchuk v. Ukraine, no. 31928/15, \u00a7 52, 13 October 2016, with further references).",

The Court observes that the applicant died because of several conditions, including lower lobe pneumonia complicated by an abscess and pulmonary heart disease (see paragraph 29 above). However, it does not appear that any pulmonary issue was identified by medical staff prior to his death, or that the applicant was provided with any treatment in that regard.",
