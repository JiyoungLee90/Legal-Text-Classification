However, it considers that such a conclusion is not readily applicable in the present case, where it deals with ex post facto procedural guarantees only in respect of compensation for the asset transfer. The Government failed to specify what legitimate aim was served by the legislation allowing majority shareholders to unilaterally choose arbitration for these disputes. Even if the Court accepts that there was some public interest, such as the economic well-being of the country, it was of relatively minor significance in the present case.",
