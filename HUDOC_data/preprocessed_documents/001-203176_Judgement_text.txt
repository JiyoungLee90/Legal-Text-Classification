The application concerns an alleged scheme to defrauding the applicant with the involvement of the Bălţi Court of Appeal and the State organs responsible for the enforcement of final judgments. In particular, the applicant alleged that a final judgment of 2006 awarding him the equivalent of some 66,000 euros (EUR) and enforced in 2007 had been abusively quashed in 2013 as a result of an appeal lodged out of time. After the quashing and before the Supreme Court of Justice had had a chance to annul the quashing, the enforcement of the above initial judgment was reversed and the defendant quickly disposed of all its property. The Supreme Court of Justice restored the initial judgment, but to no avail because the applicant was never able to recover his money.
The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Drochia. He was represented by Ms I. Soțchi, a lawyer practising in Chișinău.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr O. Rotari.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
Between 1995 and 2005 the applicant was employed by a company called L. In 2001 L. discontinued the payment of the applicant’s salary. On 23 February 2006 the applicant initiated proceedings against N.I., a trust fund administering L., seeking payment of salary arrears and interest.
By a judgment of 22 May 2006, the Drochia District Court found in favour of the applicant and ordered L. to pay him 1,095,725 Moldovan lei (MDL – the equivalent of 65,906 euros (EUR)). Neither L. nor N.I. challenged the judgment and it became final on 6 June 2006.
On 3 January 2007 the Drochia Department for the Execution of Judgments issued the record of the execution of the above judgment. Since L. did not have sufficient money to cover the judgment debt, the bailiff seized and transferred several movable and immovable goods into the applicant’s ownership. On 21 March 2007 the applicant registered his ownership title over the above property with the local land registry office.
On 22 March 2011 L. lodged an appeal against the judgment of 22 May 2006. It argued that it had received a copy of the judgment of 22 May 2006 only on 4 March 2011.
On 28 February 2012 the Bălţi Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal for being lodged out of time. It found inter alia that, while there was no proof of the fact that the judgment of 22 May 2006 had been served on N.I.’s representative, N.I. had certainly known about the judgment after its enforcement in January 2007. The fact that N.I. had not sought to obtain a copy until March 2011 was not a valid excuse justifying the extension of the twenty-day time-limit for lodging the appeal.
L. challenged the above decision with an appeal on points of law; however, the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed it on 1 June 2012.
On 6 September 2012, L. lodged an application for extraordinary review (revizuire) of the judgment of 22 May 2006. It argued, inter alia, that an audit had been carried out on 18 June 2012 and that, according to the conclusions in it, the amount awarded in the judgment of 22 May 2006 had been too high.
On 8 November 2012 the Drochia District Court dismissed the application for extraordinary review as ill-founded. L. lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment.
On 31 January 2013 the Bălţi Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on points of law and upheld the judgment of the Drochia District Court of 8 November 2012.
On 14 March 2013 N.I. lodged a new appeal against the judgment of 22 May 2006. This time, it argued that it had found out that the judgment of 22 May 2006 had been sent by the Drochia District Court to an address which had not been valid at the time of sending. It also argued that it had learned of the judgment of 22 May 2006 only on 28 February 2013.
On 16 May 2013 a panel of the Bălţi Court of Appeal composed of Judges A.G., V.H. and N.C. held a public hearing in the case.
In a decision dated 16 May 2013 a different panel of judges composed of A.G., A.R. and N.C. accepted the new arguments adduced by N.I., including the one according to which N.I. had learned of the judgment of 22 May 2006 only on 28 February 2013, and decided to extend the time-limit for lodging its appeal.
On 2 July 2013 a panel of the Bălţi Court of Appeal composed of judges A.G., N.C. and A.R. upheld the appeal lodged by N.I. and quashed the judgment of the Drochia District Court of 22 May 2006. In so doing, it dismissed the applicant’s arguments to the effect that the allowing of the appeal lodged out of time would result in a breach of the principle of legal certainty. The applicant challenged this judgment with an appeal on points of law.
On the same date, 2 July 2013, the Bălţi Court of Appeal issued an enforcement writ, ordering the reversal of the enforcement of the judgment of 22 May 2006.
On 18 January 2014 N.I. transferred the property which it had obtained from the applicant to a third company, to cover a debt.
On 6 March 2014 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the applicant’s appeal on points of law against the judgment of the Bălţi Court of Appeal of 2 July 2013. In so doing, the Supreme Court found that the allowing of N.I.’s appeal by the Bălţi Court of Appeal had been an abuse and contrary to the principle of legal certainty and finality of judgments. The Supreme Court ordered a fresh examination of N.I.’s appeal by the Bălţi Court of Appeal.
On 8 April 2014 the Bălţi Court of Appeal re-examined N.I.’s appeal against the judgment of 22 May 2006 and rejected it for being lodged out of time. N.I. lodged an appeal on points of law, but it was rejected by the Supreme Court of Justice on 11 June 2014.
On 19 March 2015 the applicant applied to the Drochia District Court for a writ of enforcement of the judgment of 22 May 2006. However, the court refused to issue it on the grounds that such a writ had already been issued in 2007 and enforced.
The applicant lodged a request with the authority responsible for the enforcement of court judgments. It informed him that he needed to obtain a duplicate of the writ from the Drochia District Court.
The applicant’s application to obtain a duplicate of the enforcement writ was dismissed by the Drochia District Court on 24 August 2018 on the grounds that the applicant had not provided evidence that the initial writ had been lost or damaged. The applicant challenged the refusal before the Bălţi Court of Appeal, but without any success and, to date, he has been unable to recover his money from N.I.
Under Article 362 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as in force at the material time, a judgment issued by a first-instance court could be challenged by way of an appeal within twenty days of the date a reasoned judgment.
According to the case-law of the Supreme Court of Justice, a litigant is expected to act with due diligence and in good faith and to enquire about the progress of the proceedings to which he or she is a party within a reasonable time. It is not open to parties to proceedings to disregard them for lengthy periods of time and to rely on their own passivity and lack of diligence in support of an application to extend a time-limit to lodge an appeal. The above principles were restated in numerous Supreme Court of Justice judgments, including Oferta Plus v. S.A. Seminte Nord (28 May 2009, case no. 2rae-130/09), Balan and Balan v. Asociația Proprietarilor de Locuințe Privatizate, Nr. 51/162 COOP (5 December 2018, case no. 2ra2467/18) and Prus v. the Ministry of Justice (19 December 2018, case no. 2ra-2422/18).
