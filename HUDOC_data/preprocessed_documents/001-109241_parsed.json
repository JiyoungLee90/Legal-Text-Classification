The applicant complained to the Supreme Court about this letter. By a letter of 19 May 2005, the Supreme Court ignored the applicant\u2019s appeal against his conviction, noting that the Court of Appeal had misinterpreted the relevant law. Following a further complaint by the applicant, by a letter of 1 September 2005 the Supreme Court noted that the applicant should apply to a first-instance court regarding the commutation of the death penalty.

This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature such as the prescribed manner and prescribed time for lodging appeals.
