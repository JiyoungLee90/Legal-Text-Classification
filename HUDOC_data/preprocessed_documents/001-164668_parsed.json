Mrs Marinova argued that this had amounted to harassment, and said that her son had become demotivated. The Agency examined the complaint, heard the teacher, Mrs Marinova\u2019s son and other witnesses, and concluded that the allegation of ill-treatment had not been made out. It found that relations between Mrs Marinova and the teacher had been strained since 2003, when the father of her son had threatened the teacher in front of other pupils. The teacher had brought a private criminal prosecution against the father in relation to that, and the proceedings were pending.",

The court noted that relations between the teacher and Mrs Marinova had for a long time been bad. Having examined the findings of the Child Protection Agency and the prosecuting authorities in relation to Mrs Marinova\u2019s complaints, the court concluded that her allegations, the first of which had become known to the school\u2019s headmaster and a pedagogical counsellor in the school, had been false and therefore defamatory. The court also held, without specifying the basis for its conclusion on this point, that Mrs Marinova had acted with direct intent.

It sentenced him to a fine of BGN 5,000 (EUR 2,556) and a public reprimand. It partly allowed the officer\u2019s claim for damages, ordering Mr\u00a0Findulov to pay him BGN 3,000 (EUR 1,534). It also ordered Mr\u00a0Findulov to pay BGN 120 (EUR 61) in court fees. The court noted that in his complaints Mr Findulov had not named the officer, but found that he had been identifiable from the complaints, which clearly alleged that he had requested a bribe, thus accusing him of an offence before third parties. The offence of defamation did not require that those third parties \u2013 the officer\u2019s hierarchy \u2013 had actually believed the allegations or taken any action in relation to them. Mr Findulov, who under Article 147 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 49 above) bore the burden of proof in this respect, had failed to establish that the officer had in fact solicited a bribe. The court went on to say, without explaining the reasons for this conclusion, that Mr\u00a0Findulov had acted with direct intent. When fixing the sentence, the court noted that it could not replace Mr Findulov\u2019s criminal liability with an administrative punishment as this was a one-off possibility and Mr Findulov had previously benefited from a waiver of his criminal liability in relation to a road traffic offence. In fixing the award of non-pecuniary damages to the officer, the court noted that Mr Findulov\u2019s allegations had been particularly damning.",

The courts have explained that to hold otherwise would mean penalising any communication to the competent authorities in relation to potentially criminal actions that on examination turns out to be untrue, which would be contrary to the citizens\u2019 civic duty to notify those authorities when they witness an offence (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 435 \u043e\u0442 27.06.1955 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116 415/ 1955 \u0433., \u0412\u0421, \u0432. \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 441 \u043e\u0442 10.08.1970 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116\u00a0397/1970 \u0433., \u0412\u0421, I \u043d. \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 108 \u043e\u0442 26.02.2009 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116\u00a041/2009 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, II \u043d. \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 500 \u043e\u0442 04.12.2009 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116\u00a0458/2009 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, II \u043d. \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 453 \u043e\u0442 12.10.2010 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116\u00a0431/2010 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, III \u043d. \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 326 \u043e\u0442 11.11.2010 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116\u00a0258/2010 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, II \u043d. \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 505 \u043e\u0442 24.11.2010 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116\u00a0517/2010 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, III \u043d. \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 212 \u043e\u0442 20.04.2011 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116\u00a01235/2011 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, III \u043d. \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 110 \u043e\u0442 24.04.2015 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116\u00a0175/2015 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, III \u043d. \u043e.; and \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 87 \u043e\u0442 26.05.2015 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116\u00a01902/2014 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, III \u043d. \u043e.).",

It is true that the acknowledgement of receipt of that letter has not arrived back at the Court (ibid.), so as to confirm that the letter has reached the applicants and that their failure to reply to it, or the Registry\u2019s previous letter, is due to their having lost interest in the case. The Court is nevertheless satisfied that this is so. On 7 January 2013, just two months before they were invited to submit their observations and claims, Mr\u00a0and Mrs Dinchevi had informed it of the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s request that the criminal proceedings against them be reopened (ibid., as well as paragraph 39 above). There is no indication that they have attempted to contact the Court since then. This, coupled with the fact that the Supreme Court of Cassation allowed the reopening request, acquitted Mr\u00a0andMrs\u00a0Dinchevi, and dismissed the claims for damages against them on 7\u00a0March 2013 (see paragraph 40 above), just three days after they were invited to submit their observations and claims for just satisfaction, compels the conclusion that they regarded this as sufficient redress for their grievance and lost interest in pursuing their application to the Court.",

Tervel, where the events had taken place, was a town with a population of less than seven thousand people that only had one school \u2013 that in which the teacher was employed. The teacher had had more than twenty-five years of service in that school, and Mrs Marinova\u2019s allegations had seriously damaged her standing there. As evident from the findings of the criminal courts in the case against Mrs Marinova, she had been fully aware of that, and of the lack of any basis for her allegations, but had nevertheless chosen to make them and thus discredit the teacher. Even so, Mrs Marinova had been given the minimum administrative fine possible and ordered to pay the teacher a relatively low amount of damages.",

That provision makes it an offence to \u201cdisseminate\u201d injurious statements (see paragraph 49 above). It appears that under the case-law of the former Supreme Court and the current Supreme Court of Cassation, statements made in complaints or depositions to the authorities cannot be considered as such \u201cdissemination\u201d because their authors do not intend to harm the reputation of the persons to whom they refer but to exercise their right to make complaints, report irregularities, or seek the authorities\u2019 assistance (see paragraph 52 above). Such statements can apparently rather be characterised, in appropriate cases, as false accusations contrary to Article\u00a0286 of the Code (see paragraph 56 above). It is therefore open to doubt whether the applicants could reasonably foresee that by making their complaints they were breaking Article 147 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (see, mutatis mutandis, Siryk v.

Poland, no. 43425/98, \u00a7 34, 27 May 2003; Uj v. Hungary, no. 23954/10, \u00a7\u00a020, 19 July 2011; and Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others v.

Moreover, the limits of acceptable criticism with regard to public officials may in some circumstances be wider than in relation to private individuals (see Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2002-II; Steur v. the Netherlands, no. 39657/98, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2003-XI; and Mariapori v.\u00a0Finland, no. 37751/07, \u00a7 56, 6 July 2010).",

But they were made by the applicants in the exercise of the possibility in a democratic society governed by the rule of law for a private person to report an alleged irregularity in the conduct of a public official to an authority competent to deal with such an issue. This possibility is one of the precepts of the rule of law (see Zakharov, \u00a7 26; Kazakov, \u00a7 28; and Siryk, \u00a7 42, all cited above), and serves to maintain confidence in public administration. Indeed, in Bulgaria it has been enshrined as a fundamental right in Article 45 of the Constitution (see paragraph 41 above). Naturally, it is then for the authority concerned to decide what procedural steps may be required in response to such complaints. However, the mere fact that the applicants\u2019 complaints led to inquiries cannot be seen as unduly impinging on the officials\u2019 reputation. It was precisely the purpose of those inquiries to confirm or lay to rest the applicants\u2019 allegations.",

Nor did the applicants have a special connection with the targets of their allegations, such as to impose on them a duty of discretion and loyalty vis-\u00e0-vis those persons (contrast Heinisch v. Germany, no. 28274/08, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2011 (extracts), and Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 70-76, where such connection was found to exist between employees and the private companies by which they were employed). All three applicants were private persons confronted with public officials whom they suspected, correctly or incorrectly, of wrongdoing. As noted in the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s request for reopening of the case against Mr and Mrs Dinchevi, reacting to complaints by non-lawyers against public officials by way of criminal law measures would mean that any such person would run the risk to be sanctioned for doing so (see paragraph 39 above). Private citizens must in principle be able to make complaints against public officials to their hierarchical superiors without the risk of criminal sanctions, even where such complaints amount to allegations of a criminal offence and even if their allegations prove on examination to be groundless.",

The Government also noted that Mr Zlatanov had already paid the sums under points (c)-(e) to his lawyers, and expressed surprise that in these circumstances he would request that any award made in relation to them be made payable to his legal representative.
