After receiving the letter of 1996, the applicant company had even more grounds for doing so, as it had complained that the authority issuing that letter did not have the competence to do so. It followed that the applicant company could not blame the authorities as it was the applicant company that had failed to take up such a remedy, which would have satisfied Article 6 requirements.

The PAPB\u2019s decision of 1986 had only been a recommendation, which, moreover, required the Minister\u2019s further approval.

The requirement to apply for a permit was a measure in accordance with the law and in the public interest, with the legitimate aim of ensuring rational development while safeguarding the environment in the country.

Under the 1992 Act, it was the DCC within the PA that was entrusted with the function of issuing or refusing permits (see section 13 of the Act under Relevant Domestic Law above) and the legislation did not delegate such authority to the DCU. Moreover, under the Act, an appeal had to be lodged within thirty days of the date when the decision was communicated to the applicant (see paragraph 40 above). However, the letter allegedly containing the decision was sent only to the applicant company\u2019s architect and not to A. on behalf of the applicant company. Thus, the applicant company considered that the authority had failed to follow the statutory procedure for indicating a formal refusal. The letter was part of an ongoing exchange between the authority and the applicant company. It was evident that the decision had not been final, given the further discussions that had ensued with the authorities. In that light, the applicant company had been of the view that proceedings were still ongoing. It transpired only during subsequent proceedings that the authorities considered the letter of 7 October 1996 as a decision on the permit, by which time the deadline for lodging an appeal had expired. It followed that the applicant company had been denied the right to appeal against that \u201cdecision\u201d before the Planning Appeals Board (\u201cthe PAB\u201d) (see paragraph 40 above) and eventually the Court of Appeal.",

In such circumstances, it could not be said that the content of the decision had not been made known to the applicant company or that its content had not been comprehensible. The Government stressed that that decision had been subject to appeal to the PAB and further appeal to the Court of Appeal, but that the applicant company had failed to pursue such remedies.

If the applicant company felt that it had been precluded from appealing before the PAB or that such an appeal would have been futile in terms of Legal notice 133 of 1992, it could have challenged the decision by instituting judicial review proceedings of the administrative action before the ordinary courts (Article 469 A of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure (\u201cthe COCP\u201d)). Given that the decision at issue was a procedural act in terms of Article 469 A (2) of the COCP, the applicant company could have pursued that avenue had it felt that the decision had been procedurally or substantively ultra vires. Furthermore, had the applicant company felt that Regulation 4 (2) (c) of the Development Permission (Method of Application) Regulations 1992 (see paragraph 43 above) had itself been ultra vires, had violated its vested rights or had been inapplicable, it could have sought to impugn that regulation by means of ordinary proceedings before the civil courts, which had in their consistent case-law over the years asserted a residual power to control the legality of the acts of the administration. The same remedy would have been available had the applicant company claimed that the permit had already been granted under the 1988 Act, as the claim would have involved the interpretation of the law. In addition, the Government noted that Article 116 of the Constitution granted to all persons who impugn a law an action before the Civil Court (First Hall), together with an appeal to the Constitutional Court. Lastly, the domestic courts had on numerous occasions held the authorities liable for the payment of damages in tort as a consequence of ultra vires acts, as accepted by the Court in Sammut and Visa Investments Ltd. v. Malta ((dec.), no 27023/03, 16 October 2007).",

The right of access to a court is an inherent aspect of the safeguards enshrined in Article 6. Thus, Article 6 \u00a7 1 secures to everyone the right to have a claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court (see Markovic and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 1398/03, \u00a7 92, ECHR 2006XIV). At the same time, the \u201cright to a court\u201d is not absolute; it is subject to limitations permitted by implication, since by its very nature it calls for regulation by the State, which enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in this regard. However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce a person\u2019s access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired (see Edificaciones March Gallego S.A. v.

Indeed section 13(7) of the 1992 Act provided for staff to service the DCC, and the October 1996 letter was sent by the manager of the DCU to whom the DCC Chairman had forwarded the request from the applicant company\u2019s architect. It was sent on an official letterhead and it clearly indicated that the permit could not be issued, and the reasons for that decision. The Court observes that the letter contained sufficient reasons for the applicant company to be able to contest its substance. Moreover, the letter included the phrase \u201cI trust that the above information is sufficient for your guidance\u201d, a clear indication on behalf of the authority that no further decision would be taken and that it was for the recipient to take any further steps deemed necessary.",

It was therefore reasonable to conclude that given that the applicant\u2019s architect had the authority to enquire about and solicit the issuance of a permit on behalf of her client (as clearly stated in the letter of 16 May 1996, despite the fact that it referred to A. as the client and not to the applicant company), the architect was also authorised to receive notification of a decision on the client\u2019s behalf. In this connection the Court reiterates that Article 6 of the Convention does not provide for specific forms of service of documents. The question is whether an individual\u2019s access to court has been denied in the circumstances of the case (see Hennings v. Germany, 16 December 1992, Series A no. 251A, and Bogonos v. Russia (dec.), no. 68798/01, 5 February 2004).",

Therefore the applicant company was given a clear, practical and effective opportunity to challenge the administrative act at issue. Also bearing in mind that it is incumbent on the interested party to display special diligence in the defence of his interests (see Muscat v. , no. 24197/10, \u00a7 59, 17 July 2012), and that in the present case the applicant company could have at least enquired as to the scope of such a letter, the Court concludes that the applicant company had at its disposal an effective legal avenue which it failed to make use of.

Moreover, the authorities had last sent the bill in 1992, a few months before it was paid. The bill itself did not mention that failure to pay within a specified time would entail the loss of the right to obtain a permit. As to the regulations referred to by the Government, the applicant company noted that they had not been applicable when the bill had been paid (14 December 1992), since they did not enter into force until 31 December 1992, as admitted by the Government.

In each case the issue that needs to be examined is whether the circumstances of the case, considered as a whole, conferred on the applicant company title to a substantive interest protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Iatridis v.\u00a0Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999-II, and Brosset-Triboulet and Others v.

The first rule, set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The three rules are not distinct in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. They should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, for example, Bruncrona v. Finland, no. 41673/98, \u00a7 65, 16 November 2004). They must comply with the principle of lawfulness and pursue a legitimate aim by means reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised (see, for example, Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7\u00a7 108-14, ECHR 2000-I, and J.A. PYE (Oxford) Ltd v. the United Kingdom, no. 44302/02, \u00a7 42, 15\u00a0November 2005). The requisite balance will not be struck where the person concerned bears an individual and excessive burden (see Brum\u0103rescu v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7 78, ECHR 1999-VII). The Court also reiterates that in the area of land development and town planning, the Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in order to implement their town and country planning policies. Nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review the Court must determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant\u2019s right of property (see Abdilla v. Malta (dec.), no 38244/03, 3\u00a0November 2005, and J. Lautier Company Limited v. Malta (dec.) no.\u00a037448/06, 2\u00a0December 2008).",

The same was contended by the Government before this Court. In particular, the Government submitted that the decision to reject the permit on the basis that the deadline for paying the bill had lapsed was in accordance with the law, namely Regulation 4 of the Development Permission (Method of Application) Regulations 1992, which entered into force on 31\u00a0December 1992 by means of Legal Notice 133.",

Moreover, the Convention contains no provision ruling out the possibility of relying on facts preceding enactment of the law (see Herri Batasuna and Batasuna v.\u00a0Spain, nos. 25803/04 and 25817/04, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2009, in relation to the assessment of the lawfulness of a measure under Article 11). In the present case the 1992 Act explicitly contained retroactive provisions (see, conversely, Kechko, cited above, \u00a7 27) which were both accessible and foreseeable to the applicant company, even before he actually received and paid the bill, the legislation having been enacted in January 1992 and being therefore published in the Government Gazette (see conversely, mutatis mutandis, Lykourezos v. , no. 33554/03, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2006VIII, in the context of a complaint under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1).

However, the Court notes that the applicant company failed to take the steps required, in a timely manner, to safeguard its interest and conclude the matter rapidly. Most importantly, when the applicant company became the owner of the entire plot of land, it omitted to inform the authorities of this until 1996 \u2013 more than a decade later. Making the relevant changes to the application would have allowed it to receive the relevant bill first issued in 1987. While the Court accepts that in 1987 the applicant company enquired in vain as to the state of its application, it took no further action until 1992, when A. paid the bill after it had been passed on to him by C. Following payment, the applicant company did not enquire about the permit until 1995. When it enquired again in 1996, it failed to contest the rejection, opting to engage in further discussions. It undertook legal action only when faced with a stop notice for illegal construction, in 1999. The Court considers that given the applicant company\u2019s inactivity and lack of diligence in pursuing its building permit application, it was not disproportionate for the authorities to reject the said application (see, mutatis mutandis, Bellizzi v. , no. 46575/09, \u00a7 73, 21\u00a0June 2011). Neither is the Court convinced that the applicant company suffered an excessive individual burden as a result.
