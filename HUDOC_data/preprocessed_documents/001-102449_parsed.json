In fact, in the applicants' case the investigation was reopened several times, but nothing indicated that the reopening entailed additional and relevant investigative actions on the part of the investigating authority. Against that background it would be unreasonable to require the applicants to challenge in court every act or omission of the investigation, particularly taking into account that the State authorities were under an obligation to act of their own motion. As regards the examples referred to by the Government, the applicants argued that, to their knowledge, the court decisions ordering the investigating authorities to reopen the investigation had no bearing on the progress of investigation. The applicants also stated that in a number of cases before the Court concerning similar events, where the investigation was ineffective, the applicants' complaints under Article 125 of the CCP had not brought about any positive results. They referred, among others, to the cases of Vakhayeva and Others v. Russia (no. 1758/04, 29\u00a0October 2009) and Alaudinova v.\u00a0Russia (no. 32297/05, 23\u00a0April 2009).",
