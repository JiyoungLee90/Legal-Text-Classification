Croatia, no. 66485/01, \u00a7 68, 13 November 2003, with further references).

In particular, a measure by means of which an individual is denied the use of an identity document which, had he so wished, would have permitted him to leave the country, amounts to an interference within the meaning of Article\u00a02 of Protocol No. 4 (see Napijalo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 69 and 73; Baumann v.

The Convention organs have previously accepted that restrictions imposed following a failure to comply with military service obligations (see Marangos v. Cyprus, no. 31106/96, Commission decision of 20 May 1997, unreported), or restrictions on the travel of a mentally ill person who had no arrangements for appropriate care in the destination country (see Nordblad v. Sweden, no. 19076/91, Commission decision of 13 October 1993, unreported), were permissible. The Court has dealt with the withdrawal of travel documents and passports in applications concerning criminal (or bankruptcy) proceedings against applicants or third parties (see, for example, Luordo v. Italy, no. 32190/96, ECHR 2003IX). So far there has been no application to the Convention institutions where a person was denied the right to travel abroad on the sole ground of his or her knowledge of certain \u201cState secrets\u201d. The applicable test is nonetheless similar: in order to comply with Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 such a restriction must be \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, pursue one or more of the legitimate aims contemplated in paragraph 3 of the same Article and be \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d (see Raimondo v.

The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure in issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported \u201cprotective function\u201d of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning \u201cState secrets\u201d. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration, and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of \u201cState secrets\u201d became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that \u201cthe test of necessity and the requirements of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of \u2018State secrets\u2019\u201d (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph 30 above).",

The express mention in the Parliamentary Assembly\u2019s Opinion on Russia\u2019s accession request of Russia\u2019s undertaking to cease restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggests that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe.
