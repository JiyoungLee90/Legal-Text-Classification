It observed that the applicant had no means to pay the State fee of 1,000 kroons (EEK) (corresponding to approximately 64 euros (EUR)), but considered that this fact did not automatically mean that he should be granted exemption. The purpose of the possibility of granting an exemption was to secure the right to a court regardless of a person\u2019s economic situation. At the same time, the requirement to pay the State fee served the purpose of discouraging the lodging of ill-considered complaints. In deciding whether to exempt an indigent person from the obligation to pay the State fee, a court had to make a preliminary assessment of the necessity and importance of the protection of the person\u2019s rights. The more important the right to be protected and the fewer the possibilities for protecting it by other means, the more justified was the exemption from the State fee. The opposite was also true: it was not justified to exempt an indigent person from the State fee in cases where there were no rights to be protected or the matter was of no importance for the person concerned. The  considered that the applicant\u2019s claim was not a matter of importance for him. The court considered that important matters in this context were ones relating to a person\u2019s essential interests or his or her way of life. The receipt of a pecuniary award for alleged emotional and physical suffering of a temporary nature was not of such importance as to justify his exemption from the State fee. The court referred to the State Legal Aid Act (Riigi \u00f5igusabi seadus), which stipulated that State legal aid was not granted if it was requested in order to claim compensation for non-pecuniary damage and there was no predominant public interest involved. The court also noted that the applicant had directly applied to an administrative court, whereas he could have first claimed compensation from the prison administration without needing to pay a State fee. In respect of the well-foundedness and prospects of success of the applicant\u2019s complaint, the court considered that the applicant\u2019s placement in a punishment cell might have caused him emotional hardship and inconvenience but the existence of the non-pecuniary damage that allegedly ensued was questionable and had not been adequately substantiated in the complaint.",

It found that the scope of regulation of the use of that means of restraint was insufficient and therefore its subsequent judicial review was seriously impeded. The report drawn up in respect of the use of the measure had not contained sufficient reasoning. Therefore, it was not possible to assess the considerations of the prison administration in finding that the prisoner had continued to behave aggressively for four hours, how the aggressiveness had been established or what kind of threat he had posed to the security of the prison or to himself. The Supreme Court found that the complainant\u2019s placement in the restraint bed for four hours had been unlawful.",

Nevertheless, the Court observes that domestic authorities\u2019 findings on that point included no consideration of the quality of the applicable law. The Court considers that the grounds, conditions and procedure for the use of so restrictive a means of restraint as that used in the present case need to be defined with the utmost precision in the domestic law. The Court has doubts whether this was so in the present case. It observes that the pertinent regulation was quite superficial and general, allowing the use of the means of restraint on the same grounds as, for example, the imposition on a prisoner of a prohibition from taking part in sports. Additional security measures (of which the use of means of restraint formed a part) could also be applied, for example, in case of regular violation of prison rules. Furthermore, the Imprisonment Act only referred to physical restraint, without specifying the exact nature of the means to be used and set out no details whatsoever in respect of the procedure to be followed during the use of a restraint bed. The only limitation was the twelve-hour maximum duration of the restraint. No regulation had been put in place in respect of the monitoring of the restrained prisoner or the frequency of checks by prison officers or medical staff. Furthermore, no regulation existed as to the records to be kept in respect of the use of the means of restraint. The Court also takes note of a recent judgment of the Estonian Supreme Court where it found that the law concerning the use of a restraint bed was not sufficiently detailed and that the reasons given by the prison administration for the use of this measure in that particular case (where the period of restraint was shorter than in the present case) had been insufficient (see paragraph 94 above).",

The Court observes that the way the authorities acted in the present case offered the applicant some further guarantees compared to those directly provided in the legislation: the applicant\u2019s situation was reviewed once an hour and he was seen twice by medical staff. Their observations were recorded in the report drawn up on the applicant\u2019s confinement in the restraint bed.",

                                        "content": "127.\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, the Court is concerned about the summary nature of the reasons given for the applicant\u2019s placement in the restraint bed, the even more concise remarks on the necessity to continue the use of this measure of restraint entered in the record and, in particular, the length of the period of use of the measure. It also notes that medical checks were only performed at the beginning and at the end of the applicant\u2019s confinement and that there was a period of more than eight hours when he was not seen by medical staff. The Court reiterates that means of restraint should never be used as a means of punishment but rather in order to avoid self-injury or serious danger to other persons or prison security. The Court accepts that the applicant\u2019s behaviour, as described in report no.\u00a057, appears to have been aggressive and disturbing. However, considering that the applicant was locked in a single-occupancy disciplinary cell, the Court has doubts that at the material time he posed a threat to himself or others that would have justified applying such a severe measure. Even assuming that his banging on the door of the cell had severely disturbed peace and order in the prison, the Court doubts that confinement in the restraint bed can have been the least intrusive measure available in this context. There is no indication that before the applicant\u2019s placement in the restraint bed, or in the course of the application of this measure, alternatives such as confinement to a high-security cell were considered. Most importantly, even if the applicant\u2019s initial confinement in the restraint bed was justified, the Court is not persuaded that the situation remained as serious for nearly nine hours. Confinement to a restraint bed, without medical reasons \u2013 which have not been shown to have existed in the present case \u2013 should rarely need to be applied for more than a few hours. The Court notes that according to report no. 57, after the applicant had been confined in the restraint bed for six hours it was decided to continue his restraint because his \u201cbehaviour\u201d was \u201cabnormal\u201d although he was \u201csilent\u201d. An hour later it was decided to continue the restraint on the same grounds. The Court considers that these reasons are wholly insufficient for the extension of the restraint for such a long period of time. Having regard to the great distress and physical discomfort that the prolonged immobilisation must have caused to the applicant, the Court finds that the level of suffering and humiliation endured by him cannot be considered compatible with Article 3 standards (compare Wiktorko v.\u00a0Poland, no. 14612/02, \u00a7 55, 31 March 2009).",

Indeed, given that the applicant resisted being handcuffed \u2013 which he did not deny \u2013 and given that he verbally expressed his discontent \u2013 which amounted to threats and insults according to the officers \u2013 the Court accepts that the prison officers may have needed to resort to physical force in order to handcuff him. Moreover, it has not been alleged that the applicant was beaten; rather, he appears to have been pushed with a shield against the bars in order to limit his freedom of movement and then forced to the floor where his resistance to the placement of handcuffs could be overcome. The Court is prepared to accept that the injuries on the applicant\u2019s body that were subsequently noted \u2013 a small abrasion next to his eye and four bluish marks on his neck \u2013 are consistent with the minor physical confrontation which occurred between the applicant and the prison officers when the latter suppressed his resistance. On the basis of the description of the events by those present, as well as the medical report, the accuracy of which has not been disputed by the applicant, the Court considers that the applicant must have felt some degree of pain when force was used. However, having regard to the circumstances of the case, and particularly to the fact that the prison officers acted in response to the applicant\u2019s disorderly conduct, the Court is unable to conclude that the authorities had recourse to physical force which had not been rendered strictly necessary by the applicant\u2019s own behaviour. The Court is thus not persuaded that the force used had such an impact on the applicant\u2019s physical or mental well-being as to give rise to an issue under Article 3 of the Convention.",

The Court observes that in the present case the descriptions of the events in the applicant\u2019s and the prison officers\u2019 written statements did not contain important differences. Their main difference appears to have been limited to different descriptions of the language used by the applicant to express his discontent.

Poland, no.\u00a048140/99, \u00a7\u00a061, 10\u00a0January 2006, and Podbielski and PPU Polpure v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a039199/98, \u00a7\u00a065 in fine, 26 July 2005). It is true that in the applicant\u2019s case the question of the State fees was determined at the preliminary stage of the proceedings on the basis of his written submissions, which meant that his claims were never examined on the merits (compare Weissman and Others v. Romania, no. 63945/00, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2006VII (extracts), and Bakan, cited above, \u00a7 78). However, the Court accepts that a preliminary assessment of the prospects of success of a complaint cannot involve an establishment of the facts in the same manner and to the same extent as in the main proceedings. Furthermore, it observes that the Administrative Court found that the existence of non-pecuniary damage allegedly sustained by the applicant was questionable (see paragraph\u00a017 above) and that the Court of Appeal considered that, even assuming that all of the applicant\u2019s allegations were true, it was questionable whether he had sustained such non-pecuniary damage as required compensation (see paragraph 18 above). The Supreme Court in substance endorsed the lower courts\u2019 findings, declining to examine the applicant\u2019s appeals. Thus, the applicant was able to present to two appellate jurisdictions his arguments against the lower courts\u2019 refusal to grant the exemption. The Court, reiterating that it is not its task to replace the assessment of the domestic courts by an assessment of its own (compare Bakan, cited above, \u00a7 76), considers that the procedure of reviewing the applicant\u2019s requests for exemption from the State fees offered him sufficient guarantees and that his right of access to a court was not restricted in a disproportionate manner.",

It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. The Court\u2019s role is to verify whether the effects of such interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see, as a recent authority, Nejdet \u015eahin and Perihan \u015eahin v.\u00a0 [GC], no. 13279/05, 20 October 2011, \u00a7 49, with further references). Furthermore, the Court has in several cases found that a particularly strict construction of procedural rules by the courts deprived applicants of their right of access to a court (see, mutatis mutandis and among others, B\u011ble\u0161 and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 47273/99, \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 69, ECHR 2002IX; Efstathiou and Others v.

In doing so, he relied on the relevant provision of the Constitution. Even if it could be said that a more profound legal analysis in the applicant\u2019s complaint would have been preferable and would have facilitated the examination of the complaint, the Court observes in this context that the applicant was a prisoner serving his sentence, was a native Russian speaker, and was complaining about an intrusion into his intimate sphere.

However, where the manner in which a search is carried out has debasing elements which significantly aggravate the inevitable humiliation of the procedure, Article 3 has been engaged: for example, where a prisoner was obliged to strip in the presence of a female officer, and his sexual organs and food were touched with bare hands (Vala\u0161inas, loc. cit.), and where a search was conducted in front of four guards who derided and verbally abused the prisoner (Iwa\u0144czuk, loc. cit.). Similarly, where the search has no established connection with the preservation of prison security and the prevention of crime or disorder, issues may arise (see, for example, Iwa\u0144czuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59, where a search of the applicant, a remand prisoner detained on charges of non-violent crimes, was conducted when he wished to exercise his right to vote; Van der Ven, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62, where strip-searching was a systematic and long-term practice without convincing security needs). Where the treatment in question does not reach the minimum level of severity prohibited by Article 3, it may nevertheless be in breach of the requirements under Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Wainwright v. the United Kingdom, no. 12350/04, 20 September 2006).",

The Court concludes that even if the prison officer in charge had initially intended to perform the examination himself, as alleged by the applicant, he must have changed his mind and acceded to the applicant\u2019s request to be taken to a doctor. The applicant did not claim that the rectal examination had in fact been carried out by the prison officers, or indeed that any physical contact had been involved. As regards the applicant\u2019s allegation that he had been derided by the prison officers present during this phase of his search and that his examination at the medical unit had been attended by two officers, there is no evidence to corroborate these statements. However, the Court notes that the report drawn up on the applicant\u2019s search was signed by five prison officers. This is in line with the applicant\u2019s assertion that the search was attended by five prison guards.",

Thus, the Court observes that the applicant\u2019s complaint does not concern a routine practice of body searches, unlike in the cases of Ciupercescu v. Romania (no. 35555/03, 15 June 2010), Van der Ven (cited above), Lors\u00e9 and Others v. the Netherlands (no. 52750/99, 4 February 2003), and McFeeley and Others v. the United Kingdom, (no. 8317/78, Commission decision of 15 May 1980, Decisions and Reports 20, p. 44), or a number of searches, as in the cases of El Shennawy v. France (no.\u00a051246/08, 20 January 2011) or Fr\u00e9rot v.  (no. 70204/01, 12 June 2007). Rather, the applicant\u2019s complaint relates to a strip search on one occasion. The Court has also found a breach of the applicants\u2019 rights if the manner in which a search was carried out had debasing elements which significantly aggravated the inevitable humiliation of the procedure. In this context, the Court observes that the applicant\u2019s search was carried out in a room set aside for that purpose and not in front of other detainees (see, by contrast, Malenko v. Ukraine, no. 18660/03, \u00a7 61, 19 February 2009). The search was performed by prison officers of the same sex (compare Vala\u0161inas and Wiktorko, both cited above). Furthermore, while the applicant, like all detainees, was in a vulnerable position in the hands of the authorities, he does not appear to have been in a particularly helpless situation (compare and contrast, Wieser v. Austria, no.\u00a02293/03, \u00a7\u00a040, 22\u00a0February 2007, and Wiktorko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54). The Court has also taken note of the Government\u2019s submission according to which the applicant was on several occasions caught in the possession of items prohibited in prison and had had a number of disciplinary punishments imposed on him. Furthermore, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s behaviour, including his repeated conflicts with the prison administration, as well as his behaviour towards himself (for example, stitching his mouth, see paragraph 13 above), appears to have given the authorities grounds to consider him as posing a higher than average security risk for the prison (contrast Iwa\u0144czuk, cited above, \u00a7 52, where the Court took into consideration the applicant\u2019s personality, his peaceful behaviour throughout his detention, and the fact that he was not charged with a violent crime and had no previous criminal record). For this reason, and taking into account that the search was performed on the applicant\u2019s return to the prison, the Court is satisfied that the authorities had sufficient justification for the applicant\u2019s search. The Court has no doubt that the search in question did cause the applicant distress, but that distress did not, in the Court\u2019s view, reach the minimum level of severity prohibited by Article 3.",

The Court is mindful that the attendance of several persons could have exacerbated the discomfort inevitably felt by the applicant owing to the intense interference with his intimate sphere and that the situation could have been capable of causing him to feel that he was being derided even in the absence of any such intention on the part of the officers. The Court is also mindful that the presence of more than one officer can be seen as a safeguard against abuse (compare McFeeley, cited above), and although the presence of prison staff during a body search should be kept to an absolutely necessary minimum in order to minimise the discomfort and distress which the procedure necessarily entails, the Court is not convinced that this was not done in the present case. Thus, having regard to the applicant\u2019s record of unruly and at times violent behaviour, the Court considers that the presence of five prison officers during the applicant\u2019s strip search did not render the interference with his right to respect for his private life disproportionate. As concerns the applicant\u2019s allegation that his examination in the medical unit took place in full view of two guards, the Court, assuming that this allegation is true, finds that there was no apparent reason to consider the applicant less dangerous when being taken to the medical unit and notes that the number of guards allegedly attending that procedure was nevertheless reduced. The Court therefore considers that there is no appearance of a disproportionate interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life in this respect.",

The applicant\u2019s personality and history of incidents were well known to the prison authorities and they should have done their best to avoid physical confrontation in a situation in which they could easily have foreseen it. The fact that the prison officers did not use truncheons or other active defence equipment, but rather relied on the use of shields, does not make much difference. In addition to the precautions taken to protect the prison officers \u2013 the provision of masks and shields (see paragraphs 65 and 133), the prison authorities could also have been expected to take steps to avoid causing injuries to the applicant.",

Having regard to the lengthy prison term imposed on the applicant and to the fact that his behaviour repeatedly caused problems, the prison authorities, in my view, could and should have drawn up a specific programme and regime of detention for the applicant (including the use of different kinds of additional measures, such as, for instance, educational and medical ones) in order to avoid having to respond to confrontations directly, each time they arose, and thus contribute themselves to a never-ending confrontational circle. With all due respect, and being aware that it is for the domestic authorities to decide how to perform their obligations under the Convention, the approach used in the present case does not seem to have produced the most appropriate solutions for long-term problems of the kind encountered here.",
