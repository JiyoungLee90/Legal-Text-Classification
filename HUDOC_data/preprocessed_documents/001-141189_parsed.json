In addition their poor command of Russian and their lack of legal knowledge concerning domestic and Convention standards of investigation, along with the absence of financial means to hire a lawyer, had precluded them from assessing the effectiveness of the investigation at its earlier stages.

Applying the abovementioned principles, it has concluded that it is sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case of abduction by servicemen, showing that their relatives fell within the control of the authorities, and it is then for the Government to discharge their burden of proof either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, among many examples, Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099). If the Government fail to rebut that presumption, this will entail a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive part. Conversely, where applicants fail to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof cannot be reversed (see, for example, Tovsultanova v.

Whether a failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee\u2019s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention depends on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on concrete elements, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7\u00a085, ECHR 1999-IV, and Ertak v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a020764/92, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2000-V).",

Therefore, the Government\u2019s argument concerning the applicability of Article 5 of the Convention instead of Article 2 is inconsistent. However, leaving this aside and assuming that the applicants\u2019 abducted relatives were under the control of State agents after their abduction, then the period of time having elapsed since the person was placed in detention is a relevant factor to be taken into account. It must be accepted that the more time that goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may, along with other elements of circumstantial evidence before the Court, provide grounds to conclude that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. The Court considers that such a situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere irregular detention in violation of Article\u00a05. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 cited above, \u00a7 86, and Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a023531/94, \u00a7\u00a083, ECHR 2000VI).
