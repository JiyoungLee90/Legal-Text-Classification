The Court takes note of the applicant\u2019s submission that this examination never took place and of the Government\u2019s failure to submit a copy of the report. However, the results of the fluorography conducted on 7\u00a0June 1998 were referred to in the judgment of the Sovetskiy District Court of Nizhniy Novgorod of 22 August 2002. Therefore, the Court has no reason to doubt that the fluorography was indeed conducted on 7\u00a0June 1998 and that it showed the results submitted by the Government. Furthermore, from the judgment of the Sovetskiy District Court, it follows that the applicant was diagnosed with post-specific changes in his right lung as early as 1995. The Court considers the statement of the applicant\u2019s cellmate to be too vague and insufficient to corroborate the applicant\u2019s allegations.
