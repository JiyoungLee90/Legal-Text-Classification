The court confirmed the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s dismissal for a repeated failure to properly perform his professional duties. Regarding the applicant\u2019s participation in the strike, the court relied on the Railway Acts of 1995 and 2003 (Articles 17 and 26 (2) respectively \u2013 see paragraphs 15 and 17 below). The Acts prohibited strikes of railway workers responsible, inter alia, for the circulation of trains, shunting, and services to passengers. The court stressed that those limitations were aimed at securing safety on the railway and that railway workers were subjected to stricter disciplinary rules than workers in other sectors of industry. The applicant was a locomotive driver; therefore, his work was directly linked to the circulation of trains, shunting, and the provision of services to passengers. The District Court concluded that the applicant had been precluded from participating in the strike. Relying on a report dated 29 April 2008 issued by the Moscow Interregional Transport Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the District Court furthermore noted that the strike had caused a number of cancelled and delayed trains which had resulted in \u201cmassive violations of the rights and lawful interests of citizens, leading to their belated arrival at their workplaces and educational institutions, at medical facilities providing health care, [and] for long-distance trains, bus runs and flights\u201d. The strike had also \u201ccontributed to the mass gathering of people on railway platforms, which [had] directly threatened their safety\u201d. Given the above and the applicant\u2019s earlier transgression, his dismissal had been justified. The District Court did not discuss the question of whether advance notice of the strike had been given or other issues related to the lawfulness of the strike of 28 April 2008.",

The Constitutional Court of Russia had declared that the above provision did not contravene the Russian Constitution (see paragraph 18 above). Specifically, the Constitutional Court had held that railway transport formed an integral part of the complex, interconnected transport system of the country and that railway transport bolstered the economy and ensured the needs of people, legal entities and the State. Accordingly, any circumstances capable of disrupting the normal functioning of railway transport could affect the interests of the people and the State and thus, justified the restrictions on the right to strike of certain categories of railway workers on whose part a temporary work stoppage could threaten the country\u2019s defence and State security, and the life and health of people.",

Transport workers had to comply with higher requirements in respect of their professional duties because breaches of discipline in respect of railway transport endangered the life and health of people, the safe circulation of trains and of shunting work, and the preservation of freight, luggage and other possessions, and also led to breaches of contract. In view of the above, Article 26 \u00a7 2 of the 2003 Railway Act declared strikes by railway workers whose activities were related to the circulation of trains, shunting, and the provision of services to passengers and of freight services on the public railway transport service, and whose occupations were defined by federal law, to be unlawful and prohibited.",

The granting of the right to strike represented without a doubt one of the most important of these means, but there were others. Such a right, which was not expressly enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention, might be subject under national law to regulation of a kind that limited its exercise in certain instances (see, for instance, Schmidt and Dahlstr\u00f6m v.

The applicant could not agree with the Government that any circumstances affecting regular train circulation and infringing someone\u2019s interests would necessarily threaten the country\u2019s defence, State security or the life and health of people and would thus justify a ban on certain categories of railway workers\u2019 right to strike.

When dealing with the applicant\u2019s case the national courts relied on both Articles\u00a017 and 26\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the 1995 and 2003 Railway Acts respectively.

The Court was not presented with the evidence of any contradictory application or diverging interpretations of the two provisions by public authorities or legal scholars, or of any alleged inconsistency with other laws (see, by contrast, Veniamin Tymoshenko and Others v.

The article simply defamed and insulted an official who was the local leader of a political party at that time. The Court proposed that the individual could bring a defamation case against the applicant newspaper, but this would not release the authorities from protecting the newspaper. Thus, the Court disregarded the balancing test. Again, by contrast, for the purposes of the balancing test, the domestic authorities had taken the insulting nature of the publication and the lack of neutrality (\u201cagitation against the candidate\u201d) into account when they imposed the administrative penalty.",

In such a situation (when the rights and freedoms of others are at stake) the Court does not always provide a clear criterion for the proportionality/balancing test. In the present case, in my view, the Court\u2019s assessment involves both problems, because the desire of the majority to impose general standards regarding the right to strike is in contradiction with a concrete situation. I must say that finding a violation of the Convention for pedagogical purposes is quite humiliating for the national authorities. The Court should be prudent, as much as possible, to be sure that the applicant is the only victim and that there are no other persons who could be regarded as victims as a result of his or her actions when the applicant exercised his fundamental rights and freedoms.",

But if the ban concerns only certain categories of workers, then it is not complete for the trade union. Therefore, the railway union was not prohibited from calling the strike in principle. The majority\u2019s position is that the applicant\u2019s right was violated. However, the majority had to make a link between the applicant\u2019s right to associate and the union\u2019s right to strike. As a result, the Court has concluded that since the applicant did not have an opportunity to strike, then his freedom of association was restricted. Indeed, this is a maximalist position because freedom of association does not cover every collective action.",

For that reason the Court considered that it did not have to decide whether the right to strike itself should be viewed as an essential element of freedom of association. Among other authorities, it is worth mentioning the judgment in the case of Hrvatski Lijecnicki Sindikat v. Croatia, where the Court concluded that strike action by medical personnel was protected only when a collective agreement was null and void. In the case of Trade union\u00a0in the factory \u201c4th November\u201d v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ((decision), no. 15557/10, 1 October 2015), the Court concluded that without peaceful negotiations, mediation and arbitration, which were obligatory before the strike, the latter was considered unlawful and the application was inadmissible. The above judgments confirm that, contrary to the conclusion of the Court in the present case, a strike is actually the most severe form of pressure which could be organised by employees against their employer; its application should be limited, so other more peaceful safeguards are preferable in this domain of economic activity, especially if it concerns the provision of public services or public safety.",

The Court does not propose any criterion of proportionality; it prefers not to discuss the negative consequences of the strike, but to link the proportionality with the severity of punishment. I believe that such a methodology is wrong. The principal assessment should concentrate on the balancing test, and the severity issue must be used in exceptional cases. The Court concluded that dismissal was the most severe penalty (paragraph 83 of the judgment), but a refusal to exercise duties on railway transport which leads to damage to property or health is punished under Russian criminal law (Article 263 of the Criminal Code); a breach of the safety rules may lead to an administrative penalty under Article 11.15.1 of the Russian Code on Administrative Offences. Thus it was not the most severe punishment. I believe that the authorities did not overstep their margin of appreciation, because the dismissal was applied by national courts not only for the refusal to exercise the duties, but because the refusal led to negative consequences for the public.",

The union did not agree with the decision to dismiss the applicant. The Court refers to the fact that the lawfulness of the strike was not challenged in the domestic courts, or before any other independent authority (see paragraph 81 of the judgment), but this does not clarify whether it was lawful or not. I have the opposite impression from the case file documents. It is obvious, and it was stated by the domestic courts in their decisions within the dismissal proceedings, that the trade union declared the strike within a period shorter than that prescribed by the Labour Code and without preliminary recourse to conciliation or arbitration. Thus the strike could have been considered unlawful for other reasons.\u00a0There was \u201canother independent authority\u201d, namely the Working group of the State Duma on the resolution and analysis of collective labour conflicts.

This looks like a cat and mouse game: the Government will always lose because of the uncertainty and unpredictability of the Court\u2019s reaction to their submissions. This is not acceptable in international relations. If the Court has not received the information which is critical for the decision, it should invite the parties to provide such information. The Court\u2019s procedure should not be equal to domestic adversary proceedings, where the result heavily depends on the quality of legal advice. The trade union committee\u2019s decision referred to minimum services during the strike on public transport, as set out in the Order of the Ministry of Transport, no. 12ts of 27 March 2003. Such a document does not exist. The issue is regulated by Order no. 197 of 7\u00a0October 2003. At the time of the event the Order did not contain any provisions regarding railway transport. Such provisions were included in the Order in 2009, i.e. after the impugned events. Under the applicable version, the safety and security concerns requiring a minimum service did not actually include transportation, only the maintenance of the railway infrastructure. It is not clear how to interpret the Order: whether after the consultations with the members of parliament, the Ministry of Transport positively reacted to the 2008 strike and in fact allowed the locomotive drivers to participate in a strike; or whether the minimum of safety services meant that some of the employees in charge, other than the locomotive drivers, could not participate in a strike, and the locomotive drivers were still banned from striking under the separate rules.

The decision to declare the strike does not directly refer to the participation of locomotive drivers, so I conclude that the administration was not actually informed that those drivers would participate in the strike and therefore the administration had to cancel the trains or to find alternatives during the strike, not before it. Owing to such a short period of time, it is obvious that the administration was unable to react. The passengers were not duly informed. Those deficiencies were aggravated by the fact that the strike was conducted in the morning. This period is vital for those who live in the suburbs of Moscow. Thousands of people use the trains to get to work. The railway system is also popular for travel within the territory of Moscow, at least for the first 4-5 stations, therefore Muscovites also use the trains for business purposes in the morning. It is worth mentioning that the majority of passengers do not have cars, so the train is the only means of transport for hundreds of thousands of people who live in Moscow or Kaluga oblasts and other regions to get to workplaces situated in Moscow.",

The domestic courts analysed the circumstances of the strike, noting that the platforms were overcrowded and that this created a risk for life; the trains were cancelled or delayed. They stated that other safeguards like conciliation and arbitration set out in the Russian Labour Code were obligatory for the trade union to exhaust before the strike. The administration did not have any chance to use them, because the strike happened in a very short period of time. The courts found that neither the union nor the applicant took any measures to ensure that the nuisance for civil society would be limited to a minimum.

If the legitimate aim relates to the public safety and essential public services then the protection of rights and freedoms of others (freedom of movement) is at stake and the State should thus be afforded a wide margin of appreciation. In the present case, in contrast, the Court has shifted to the general principle regarding the existence of a \u201cpressing social need\u201d. Without taking into account the specificity of the present case, the Court provides that the States have only a limited margin of appreciation, which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it (see paragraph 67 of the judgment). However, the Court used a different approach in other cases when it took into account similar circumstances. For example, in the case of Dubsk\u00e1 and Krejzov\u00e1 v.\u00a0the Czech Republic [GC], nos. 28859/11 and 28473/12, 15 November 2016, the Court stated as follows:",

In the present case, the applicant\u2019s right to strike is in conflict with the freedom of movement of those who need railway transport to get to work in the morning and to get back home in the evening. The balancing of the conflicting rights inevitably leads to the limitation of the right to strike.
