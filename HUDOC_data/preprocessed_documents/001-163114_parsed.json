He maintained that he had not been duly informed of the proceedings in Cyprus, although both the Cypriot lawyers who had represented the claimant company in the Limassol District Court and the Latvian lawyers who had represented it in the Latvian courts had been perfectly aware of his business address in Riga. In support of that allegation he submitted that he had had professional dealings with the Cypriot lawyers, who had telephoned him and sent faxes to his office, and had met the Latvian lawyers in person. Hence, they must all have been aware of his business address. He added that he could also have been reached at his home address in Garkalne, as he had a residence there that was officially declared in accordance with the law and the lawyers could have consulted the municipal land register, where the property he owned was registered under his name.

In the instant case, there had been a threefold breach of those requirements. Firstly, the claimant had only submitted the text of the Cypriot court judgment to the Latvian court and not the certificate required by Annex V to the Brussels I Regulation. In that connection the applicant acknowledged that under Article 55 \u00a7 1 of the Brussels I Regulation the court in which enforcement was sought could, in some circumstances, exempt the claimant from the obligation to produce a certificate. However, in the present case the Latgale District Court had not made clear whether it considered that the claimant could be exempted from that obligation and, if so, for what reason. Secondly, the Cypriot judgment had contained no reference to the fact that it was enforceable or to possible judicial remedies. Thirdly, although a judgment had to be enforceable in the country of origin in order to be enforced in accordance with the Brussels I Regulation, the claimant company had not produced any documentary evidence demonstrating that the judgment of 24 May 2004 was enforceable in Cyprus. In view of all these circumstances, the applicant contended that the judgment could on no account be recognised and enforced in Latvia.",

In that context, the Court has noted that, even before that treaty entered into force, it had found on several occasions that the right to a fair trial, which derives inter alia from Article 6 ECHR, constitutes a fundamental right which the European Union respects as a general principle under Article 6(2) EU (see, in particular, Case C-289/11 P Legris Industries v\u00a0Commission, paragraph 36).\u201d",

However, that provision does not preclude the grant of wider protection by European Union law. Under Article 7 of the Charter, \u2018[e]veryone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications\u2019.

These may be reviewed, if at all, only in the course of an appeal from the party against whom enforcement has been authorised. The court or competent authority is limited to making formal checks on the documents presented in support of the application; they are determined by the Regulation.

It held that the provision in question remained applicable where the defendant had lodged an objection against a judgment given in default and a court of the State in which the judgment was given had held the objection to be inadmissible on the ground that the time for lodging an objection had expired. Furthermore, even where a court in the State of origin had held, in separate adversarial proceedings, that service had been duly effected, Article 27 \u00a7 2 still required the court in which enforcement was sought to examine whether service had been effected in sufficient time to enable the defendant to arrange for his defence.",

The scope of the case was therefore confined to ascertaining whether, in ordering the enforcement of the Cypriot judgment in Latvia, the Latvian courts had observed the fundamental principles of a fair hearing within the meaning of that provision. In that connection the Chamber found that the observance by the State of its legal obligations arising out of membership of the European Union was a matter of general interest and that this also applied to the implementation of the Brussels I Regulation, based on the principle of \u201cmutual trust in the administration of justice\u201d. The Latvian courts had therefore had a duty to ensure the recognition and rapid and effective enforcement of the Cypriot judgment in Latvia. The Chamber further observed that the protection of fundamental rights afforded by the European Union was in principle equivalent to that for which the Convention provided (see Bosphorus Hava Yollar\u0131 Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v.

He submitted at the outset that the presumption of equivalent protection (the \u201cBosphorus presumption\u201d) was inapplicable in the present case for two reasons. Firstly, under the Brussels I Regulation the higher courts in Latvia (the Regional Court and the Senate of the Supreme Court) had not been obliged automatically to recognise the Cypriot judgment. On the contrary, Articles 34 and 35 of the Regulation had afforded them a broad margin of discretion to check that the applicant\u2019s fundamental procedural rights had been respected in the State of origin and to decide whether or not the judgment should be enforced in Latvia. To that extent, the Latvian courts had therefore retained full responsibility for ensuring compliance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Moreover, in declaring the judgment to be enforceable, the Senate of the Supreme Court had clearly breached the terms of Article 34 \u00a7 2 of the Regulation as interpreted by the CJEU. In that connection the applicant referred to the CJEU\u2019s judgment in Trade Agency Ltd v. Seramico Investments Ltd (see paragraph 60 above) and to the subsequent rulings of the Senate of the Latvian Supreme Court. In two cases, the latter had carefully examined whether the defendants had been duly and promptly summoned to appear before the courts in the State of origin. In both cases, the defendants had not attempted to appeal against the judgments in question and the Senate had not criticised them on that account.",

The applicant acknowledged that he had never requested that such a ruling be sought, but argued that he had had no opportunity to do so since only the other party had been allowed to make submissions on the merits of the case at the hearing of 31 January 2007. Hence, the Latvian courts had not made use of the review mechanisms existing in the European Union legal system. In the applicant\u2019s view, if the Latvian Supreme Court had requested a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, it would most likely have indicated that the Supreme Court was empowered to verify whether the applicant had been duly informed of the proceedings before the Cypriot court and whether it had been, or still was, open to him to appeal against the Cypriot judgment. The applicant referred in that connection to paragraph 38 of Trade Agency Ltd v. Seramico Investments Ltd. In his view, the present case was therefore more akin to the case in Michaud v. France (no. 12323/11, \u00a7\u00a7 112-15, ECHR 2012), in which the Court had found that the Bosphorus presumption did not apply, for several reasons including the one just cited.",

In the Court\u2019s case-law, that objective had never been regarded as sufficient justification for interference with fundamental rights unless it was accompanied by other legitimate aims such as the prevention of crime (the applicant referred to Michaud, cited above) or the protection of the rights of others (he referred to Povse v. Austria (dec.), no. 3890/11, 18 June 2013).

In his submission, he should not be criticised for not attempting to appeal against the Cypriot judgment, for three reasons. Firstly, the judgment itself had contained no reference to the available judicial remedies. Secondly, placing such a burden of proof on him ran counter to the approach taken by the CJEU in ASML Netherlands BV v. Semiconductor Industry Services GmBh (SEMSIS), according to which \u201cit [was] \u2018possible\u2019 for a defendant to bring proceedings to challenge a default judgment against him only if he was in fact acquainted with its contents, because it was served on him in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defence before the courts of the State in which the judgment was given\u201d (see paragraph 58 above). Thirdly, according to the information supplied by the Cypriot Government, the possibility of an appeal lodged out of time being allowed in Cyprus was highly speculative and was a matter for the court\u2019s discretion (see paragraph\u00a068 above). Moreover, since the Riga Regional Court judgment of 2\u00a0October 2006 refusing to declare the judgment enforceable had been in his favour (see paragraph 32 above), the applicant had had no reason to attempt to lodge an appeal in Cyprus at that point.",

Firstly, they submitted that the grounds for non-recognition provided for in Article 34 \u00a7 2 of the Brussels I Regulation could not be interpreted as granting the court in the member State in which enforcement was sought a margin of discretion, as the grounds for refusing recognition were clearly set out in the text of that Article. Referring to the explanatory memorandum concerning the Proposal for a Regulation (see paragraph 56 above) and to the CJEU\u2019s judgment in Apostolides v. Orams (see paragraph 61 above), the Government submitted that the legal form of a regulation had been expressly chosen by the European Union institutions in order not to leave any discretion to the member States. The provisions of the Regulation were autonomous and could not be interpreted or applied in the light of domestic law, and Article\u00a034 had to be interpreted strictly since it constituted an obstacle to the attainment of one of the fundamental objectives of the Regulation as a whole. Furthermore, the court with jurisdiction to rule on the enforcement of the judgment in the member State in question did not have any authority to review the possible grounds for non-enforcement on its own initiative. Consequently, the Senate of the Supreme Court had not enjoyed any discretion in deciding to recognise and enforce the Limassol District Court judgment. In so doing, it had simply complied with its strict obligations arising out of Latvia\u2019s membership of the European Union.",

The domestic courts referred a question for a preliminary ruling only where they had doubts as to the correct interpretation or application of EU legislation. They were not required to do so if they found that the question raised was not relevant, that the provision in question had already been interpreted by the CJEU or that the correct application of EU law was so obvious as to leave no scope for reasonable doubt. That was precisely the situation in the present case, as the CJEU\u2019s existing case-law had been sufficiently explicit with regard to the meaning and scope of the requirements of Article 34 \u00a7 2 of the Brussels I Regulation. Moreover, if the applicant had considered it necessary to obtain clarifications on that provision, he could have asked the Senate of the Supreme Court to refer the matter to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling.

The applicant had at no point alleged, still less proved, before the domestic courts or the Court that he had at least attempted to institute appeal proceedings in Cyprus. Moreover, it was reasonable to consider that in view of the six-month period that had elapsed between June 2006 (when the applicant had been apprised of the content of the Cypriot judgment) and January 2007 (when the Senate of the Supreme Court had examined the case), the applicant had had sufficient time to lodge an appeal in Cyprus. On that point the Government referred to the Cypriot Government\u2019s observations, from which it was clear that such a remedy had been available in theory and in practice and had not been subject to a strict time-limit (see paragraph 68 above). They submitted that Article 34 \u00a7 2 of the Brussels I Regulation was based on the premise that any defects in a judgment given in default should be remedied in the country of origin. If the applicant had lodged an appeal with the Cypriot courts, the Latvian Supreme Court could have stayed or adjourned the enforcement proceedings in accordance with Articles 37 \u00a7 1 and 46 \u00a7 1 of the Regulation.

Furthermore, given that the applicant had consented to the application of Cypriot law, he must be assumed to have been very familiar with the legal system in Cyprus, including the available remedies. Consequently, his argument that the Cypriot judgment had contained no references to the available judicial remedies lacked any relevance, bearing in mind that neither the Brussels I Regulation, nor Cypriot law, nor Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention required the courts to insert such a reference in their judgments.

Article 34 \u00a7 2 of the Regulation had to be read together with the other relevant provisions of the Regulation and with the Regulations on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (see paragraph 66 above).

Recognition and enforcement did not depend on whether the document instituting the proceedings had been served in accordance with the formal requirements, but rather on a specific examination of whether the defendant\u2019s right to adversarial process had in fact been respected. The Commission further observed that Article 34 \u00a7 1 of the Regulation provided for recognition and enforcement to be refused where \u201crecognition [was] manifestly contrary to public policy in the Member State in which recognition [was] sought\u201d.

In particular, in its judgment in ASML Netherlands BV v. Semiconductor Industry Services (SEMSIS) (cited at paragraph 58 above) it had held that a defendant in default of appearance could be deemed to have been in a position to bring proceedings to challenge a judgment given against him only if he was in fact acquainted with its contents, which presupposed that it had been served on him. Simply being aware of the existence of a judgment was not sufficient in that regard. Hence, the existence or otherwise of remedies in the country of origin had to be assessed with reference to the point at which the defendant had actually been apprised of the content of the judgment as distinct from merely learning of its existence.

With regard to the former, the applicant complained that his defence rights had been infringed, while in the case of the latter he complained that the courts had validated the proceedings in Cyprus by ordering the recognition and enforcement of the judgment. However, the Court declared the complaint against Cyprus inadmissible as being out of time (partial decision of 30 March 2010, see paragraph 4 above). At the present stage of the proceedings the application therefore concerns Latvia alone. Accordingly, the Court does not have jurisdiction ratione personae to give a formal ruling on whether the Limassol District Court complied with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1. However, it must ascertain whether, in declaring the Cypriot judgment to be enforceable, the Latvian courts acted in accordance with that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Pellegrini v.

In their third-party submissions, the Estonian Government stressed the importance of the distinction between the enforcement of a judgment emanating from another Contracting Party to the Convention and that of a judgment given by the authorities of a State that was not a Party to the Convention. In the first case, where there was a presumption that the parties could secure protection of their Convention rights in the country of origin of the judgment, the review by the court in the State addressed should be more limited than in the second case (see paragraph\u00a087 above). The Court notes that it has never previously been called upon to examine observance of the guarantees of a fair hearing in the context of mutual recognition based on European Union law. However, it has always applied the general principle whereby a court examining a request for recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment cannot grant the request without first conducting some measure of review of that judgment in the light of the guarantees of a fair hearing; the intensity of that review may vary depending on the nature of the case (see, mutatis mutandis, Drozd and Janousek v.

The task of interpreting and applying the provisions of the Brussels I Regulation falls firstly to the CJEU, in the context of a request for a preliminary ruling, and secondly to the domestic courts in their capacity as courts of the Union, that is to say, when they give effect to the Regulation as interpreted by the CJEU. The jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights is limited to reviewing compliance with the requirements of the Convention, in this case with Article 6 \u00a7 1. Consequently, in the absence of any arbitrariness which would in itself raise an issue under Article 6 \u00a7 1, it is not for the Court to make a judgment as to whether the Senate of the Latvian Supreme Court correctly applied Article 34 \u00a7 2 of the Brussels I Regulation or any other provision of European Union law.",

In arriving at that conclusion it found, firstly, that the European Union offered equivalent protection of the substantive guarantees, observing in that connection that at the relevant time respect for fundamental rights had already been a condition of the lawfulness of Community acts and that the CJEU referred extensively to Convention provisions and to Strasbourg case-law in carrying out its assessment (see Bosphorus, cited above, \u00a7 159).

According to the AIRE Centre this provision allowed the Latvian court a degree of discretion (see paragraph 94 above).

Turning to the specific circumstances of the present case, it notes that the Senate of the Supreme Court did not request a preliminary ruling from the CJEU regarding the interpretation and application of Article 34 \u00a7 2 of the Regulation.

It considers that it would serve no useful purpose to make the implementation of the Bosphorus presumption subject to a requirement for the domestic court to request a ruling from the CJEU in all cases without exception, including those cases where no genuine and serious issue arises with regard to the protection of fundamental rights by EU law, or those in which the CJEU has already stated precisely how the applicable provisions of EU law should be interpreted in a manner compatible with fundamental rights.",

The national courts must therefore state the reasons why they consider it unnecessary to seek a preliminary ruling (see Ullens de Schooten and Rezabek v. Belgium, nos. 3989/07 and 38353/07, \u00a7 62, 20\u00a0September 2011, and Dhahbi v. Italy, no. 17120/09, \u00a7\u00a7 31-34, 8 April 2014).

This review therefore differs from that which it conducts when, as in the present case, it examines the decision not to request a preliminary ruling as part of its overall assessment of the degree of protection of fundamental rights afforded by European Union law. The Court carries out this assessment, in line with the case-law established in Michaud, in order to determine whether it can apply the Bosphorus presumption to the decision complained of, a presumption which the Court applies in accordance with conditions which it has itself laid down.",

The present case is thus clearly distinguishable from Michaud, cited above, in which the national Supreme Court refused the applicant\u2019s request to seek a preliminary ruling from the CJEU even though the issue of the Convention compatibility of the impugned provision of European Union law had never previously been examined by the CJEU (ibid., \u00a7 114).

The Preamble to the Brussels I Regulation states that the approach underpinning the Regulation is one of \u201c[m]utual trust in the administration of justice\u201d within the European Union, which implies that \u201cthe declaration that a judgment is enforceable should be issued virtually automatically after purely formal checks of the documents supplied, without there being any possibility for the court to raise of its own motion any of the grounds for non-enforcement provided for by this Regulation\u201d (see paragraph 54 above). The Court is mindful of the importance of the mutual-recognition mechanisms for the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice referred to in Article 67 of the TFEU, and of the mutual trust which they require. As stated in Articles 81 \u00a7 1 and 82 \u00a7 1 of the TFEU, the mutual recognition of judgments is designed in particular to facilitate effective judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. The Court has repeatedly asserted its commitment to international and European cooperation (see, among other authorities, Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, \u00a7\u00a7 63 and 72, ECHR 1999I, and Bosphorus, cited above, \u00a7 150).

Hence, the CJEU stated recently in Opinion 2/13 that \u201cwhen implementing EU law, the Member States may, under EU law, be required to presume that fundamental rights have been observed by the other Member States, so that ..., save in exceptional cases, they may not check whether that other Member State has actually, in a specific case, observed the fundamental rights guaranteed by the EU\u201d (see paragraph 49 above). Limiting to exceptional cases the power of the State in which recognition is sought to review the observance of fundamental rights by the State of origin of the judgment could, in practice, run counter to the requirement imposed by the Convention according to which the court in the State addressed must at least be empowered to conduct a review commensurate with the gravity of any serious allegation of a violation of fundamental rights in the State of origin, in order to ensure that the protection of those rights is not manifestly deficient.",

In doing so it takes into account, in a spirit of complementarity, the manner in which these mechanisms operate and in particular the aim of effectiveness which they pursue. Nevertheless, it must verify that the principle of mutual recognition is not applied automatically and mechanically (see, mutatis mutandis, X v. Latvia [GC], no. 27853/09, \u00a7\u00a7 98 and 107, ECHR 2013) to the detriment of fundamental rights \u2013 which, the CJEU has also stressed, must be observed in this context (see, for instance, its judgment in Alpha Bank Cyprus Ltd v. Dau Si Senh and Others, paragraph 48 above). In this spirit, where the courts of a State which is both a Contracting Party to the Convention and a member State of the European Union are called upon to apply a mutual-recognition mechanism established by EU law, they must give full effect to that mechanism where the protection of Convention rights cannot be considered manifestly deficient.

This is a precondition which pursues the aim of ensuring the proper administration of justice in a spirit of procedural economy and which is based on an approach similar to that underpinning the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies set forth in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. This approach comprises two strands. Firstly, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system and, secondly, it is presumed that there is an effective remedy available in the domestic system in respect of the alleged breach (see, mutatis mutandis, Akdivar and Others v.

In so doing he relied on the grounds for non-recognition provided for by Article 34 \u00a7 2 of the Brussels I Regulation. That provision states expressly that such grounds may be invoked only on condition that proceedings have previously been commenced to challenge the judgment in question, in so far as it was possible to do so. The fact that the applicant relied on that Article without having challenged the judgment as required necessarily raised the question of the availability of that legal remedy in Cyprus in the circumstances of the present case. In such a situation the Senate was not entitled simply to criticise the applicant, as it did in its judgment of 31 January 2007, for not appealing against the judgment concerned, and to remain silent on the issue of the burden of proof with regard to the existence and availability of a remedy in the State of origin; Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, like Article 34 \u00a7 2 in fine of the Brussels I Regulation, required it to verify that this condition was satisfied, in the absence of which it could not refuse to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint. The Court considers that the determination of the burden of proof, which, as the European Commission stressed (see paragraph 92 above), is not governed by European Union law, was therefore decisive in the present case. Hence, that point should have been examined in adversarial proceedings leading to reasoned findings. However, the Supreme Court tacitly presumed either that the burden of proof lay with the defendant or that such a remedy had in fact been available to the applicant. This approach, which reflects a literal and automatic application of Article\u00a034 \u00a7 2 of the Brussels I Regulation, could in theory lead to a finding that the protection afforded was manifestly deficient such that the presumption of equivalent protection of the rights of the defence guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 is rebutted. Nevertheless, in the specific circumstances of the present application the Court does not consider this to be the case, although this shortcoming is regrettable.",

In accordance with Cypriot legislation and case-law, where a defendant against whom a judgment has been given in default applies to have that judgment set aside and alleges, on arguable grounds, that he or she was not duly summoned before the court which gave judgment, the court hearing the application is required \u2013 and not merely empowered \u2013 to set aside the judgment given in default (see paragraph 68 above). Accordingly, the Court is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s argument that such a procedure would have been bound to fail.

Moreover, as the Court itself has stated, the parties (and the Court) have to rely \u2013 in the proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights \u2013 on what the national courts took into consideration. According to the judgment of the Senate of the Latvian Supreme Court, \u201cthe Limassol District Court judgment became final\u201d because, among other reasons, no appeal had been lodged against it. (This cannot be attributed to the applicant.) However, it is exactly the impossibility of making such an appeal that is at the origin of the lack of procedural fairness: without proper service in the proceedings there was no possibility to appeal. I do not see at which point the applicant could have raised the issue of the possibility of appeal in Cyprus in the domestic proceedings: this lack of opportunity was accepted by all parties and the domestic courts, and the only point of dispute was whether such a judgment rendered in violation of the requirements of fair proceedings could be enforced or not. However, the judgment of the Senate of the Latvian Supreme Court and the Court blame the applicant, although the execution proceedings were already under way and the issue was only whether a judgment rendered in disregard of the requirement of a hearing could be enforced.",

However, according to the judgment, this shortcoming did not reach the level of a manifest deficiency. That is the applicable threshold in situations of presumed equivalent protection in matters of mutual recognition. It is because of this minimal scrutiny that the Court could be satisfied that there was no violation as, given that he allegedly did not appeal in Cyprus, the \u201cregrettable Latvian shortcomings\u201d do not amount to such a blatant violation.",

The standard justification given for the Bosphorus presumption, as applied by the Court in the above circumstances, is that the EU legal system already takes into consideration the Convention values and rights and it provides protection to these thanks to the CJEU. It is indeed reasonable to assume that where States transfer their sovereignty to an international organisation that recognises the fundamental rights of the Convention, as provided for in the directly applicable Charter of Fundamental Rights (Article 52 \u00a7 3), the rights will be protected. There is, indeed, a legal mechanism (the CJEU) that is there to ensure that these rights are actually protected.",

However, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the EU system provides equivalent protection in terms of its substantive law and also procedurally, through the CJEU, one should not sacrifice Convention rights for the sake of international cooperation, a consideration that is not recognised among the Convention grounds for limitation of rights. I can see good practical reasons for applying presumptions in favour of Convention conformity of standards of review within a regional international organisation like the EU which expressly recognises Convention rights (at least since the applicability of the Charter). Comity requires a certain respect in this regard. But the requirement of respect for human rights in the legal sources of the EU does not make the role of this Court fundamentally different from its supervisory role vis-\u00e0-vis national constitutional systems. After all, Convention rights are, as a rule, guaranteed by the respective constitutions and the national judiciary. Moreover, in the present case the CJEU had no opportunity to provide the expected human rights protection. While it is true that member States of the European Union may, under EU law, be required to respect Convention rights, and therefore courts in other States may assume that this obligation was observed, there is nothing that automatically guarantees that the first State did indeed satisfy that obligation, and therefore the second State, trusting the first one, cannot be said to be exempt from responsibility. Even if they are exempted from undertaking an in-depth examination of their own motion, they should nonetheless carry out a review to the extent necessary for the effective protection of rights and where the applicant makes a prima facie case that human rights were disregarded in the first country. Otherwise, a system not amenable to Convention review will be created. It is regrettable that the Latvian Supreme Court did not enable the EU system to review the allegation. This Court shall continue to assess whether State acts, whatever their origin, are compliant with the Convention, while the States are and will remain responsible for fulfilling their Convention obligations.",

There is also some inconsistency here; at least I do not see comparable assumptions of equivalent protection in matters of application of the United Nations Charter, even where the Security Council has exclusive jurisdiction. Lastly, the extension of the Bosphorus presumption to matters of mutual recognition (a matter certainly not limited to the Brussels Regulation on enforcement of judgments) seems to generate a presumption unsustained by the realities of life even according to the CJEU, as became clear most recently in its judgments in C404/15 and C659/15 PPU. This Court shall remain faithful to its position adopted in M.S.S. v.
