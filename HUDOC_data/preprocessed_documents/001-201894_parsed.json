The court referred to the interpretation which the Supreme Court had reaffirmed in a resolution (\u201cthe 2013 Resolution\u201d) and held that a valid complaint under section 5 of the 2004 Act could be lodged only in the course of the relevant proceedings, namely before a judgment had been rendered by the secondinstance court.

In the instant case, therefore, the complaint under the 2004 Act in respect of the main proceedings had been lodged too late and as such had been left without examination. The court further dismissed the complaint as regards the subsequent period, during which the case had been pending before the Supreme Court.

Their total length had been a result of a lack of diligence on the part of the domestic courts, which had failed to properly organise hearings so that he could be transferred from the detention centres, and to ensure that the experts complied with the relevant deadlines. Moreover the courts had committed various procedural and legal errors, which had resulted in the judgment being quashed and the case remitted for reconsideration on three occasions (once by the second-instance court and twice by the Supreme Court). The applicant himself had not contributed in any way to the overall length of the proceedings; he had not been responsible for a single adjournment of a hearing, nor for any other delay, during those thirteen years.",

In 2005 the Court reminded the Polish authorities that \u201cas it ha[d] already indicated on a great number of occasions, the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings must be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case taken as a whole. The Court\u2019s approach consist[ed] in examining the overall length of proceedings and in covering all stages of the proceedings\u201d (see Majewski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 52690/99, \u00a7 35, 11 October 2005).
