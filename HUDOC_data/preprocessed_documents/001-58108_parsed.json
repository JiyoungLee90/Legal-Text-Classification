In the light of the applicant\u2019s history, he was suspected of falsely reporting a criminal offence and the object of the inquiry was therefore modified and an investigation in two branches conducted. However, as the police had not found any pertinent evidence that the offence had been committed, the complainant was referred to the public prosecutor\u2019s office by an order of 17\u00a0September 1992. Contrary to his allegations, he was not taken into police custody for forty-eight hours but necessarily held for twenty-four hours so that the inquiry could be completed.

This behaviour had obliged the police to conduct further on-the-spot investigations and to transfer the applicant to the security police for questioning.

The existence of such a purpose must be considered independently of its achievement and sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not presuppose that the police should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges, either at the point of arrest or while the applicant was in custody (see the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, p. 29, \u00a7 53). The object of questioning during detention under sub-paragraph\u00a0(c) of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 is to further the criminal investigation by way of confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicion grounding the arrest. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see the Murray v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300-A, p. 27, \u00a7 55). However, for there to be reasonable suspicion there must be facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed an offence (see the Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, p. 16, \u00a7 32).",

What may by regarded as \u201creasonable\u201d will however depend upon all the circumstances. For the ascertainment of whether the essence of the Convention safeguard has been secured, it is incumbent upon the Government to furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the applicant was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence (see the Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, pp. 16 and 18, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a032 and 34).",

They had been informed about this incident by an anonymous telephone call and on arrival at the scene they had observed the damage and made a damage assessment report. When the applicant arrived at the scene some three hours later he asked that the premises be searched again before he opened the shop. He named the persons he suspected of the attack, including H.A., but decided against lodging a complaint and left the police station. Subsequently, however, he returned to the police station with two spent cartridge cases which he claimed to have found in the shop, lodged a complaint and demanded the arrest of H.A. Shortly afterwards, when a police team had gone to the shop and found no evidence of shots having been fired there, he was placed in custody on a charge of producing false evidence. He was not released until some time the next day.",

Moreover, the tenor of the covering letter of Chief Inspector Tun\u00e7 to the security police headquarters and the ensuing events (see paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 of the judgment) do not suggest the existence of a level of suspicion sufficient to amount to a \u201creasonable suspicion of having committed an offence\u201d so as to justify detention in order to further a criminal investigation.",
