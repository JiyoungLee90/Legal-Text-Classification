The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violations found. The Court considers it appropriate to award the applicant the equivalent in euros of the sum spent for housing during the period the final judgment in his favour was amended to his detriment (see paragraph 59 above), that is EUR 2,328, in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant.",
