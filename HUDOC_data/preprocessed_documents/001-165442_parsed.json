The application was thereafter allocated to the Fifth Section of the Court (Rule\u00a052 \u00a7\u00a01). On 4 June 2015 a Chamber of that Section, composed of Mark Villiger, President, Angelika\u00a0Nu\u00dfberger, Bo\u0161tjan M. Zupan\u010di\u010d, Vincent A.

It decided unanimously to declare the complaint concerning Article 3 of the Convention admissible, and held, by five votes to two, that the implementation of the deportation order in respect of the applicants would not give rise to a violation of Article\u00a03. The partly dissenting opinion of Judge Zupan\u010di\u010d and a statement of dissent by Judge De Gaetano were annexed to the judgment. On 25\u00a0August 2015 the applicants requested the referral of the case to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention.

In addition, the applicant must justify this. The shortcomings which still exist in the Iraqi legal system are then to be noted and evaluated in the context of the individual assessment of each asylum case. The circumstances on which an applicant relies in arguing that protection by the authorities is deficient are first of all examined in the usual way. In those cases in which the alleged risk of persecution or other abuses does not emanate from the authorities, which as a rule is the case in Iraq, the applicant must show what efforts he or she has made to be afforded protection by the authorities. The applicant can do this either by relying on evidence or by giving a credible account of events which appear plausible. When assessing the authorities\u2019 ability to protect against threats of violence emanating from terrorist groups or unknown perpetrators in a specific case, the individual\u2019s situation, as well as the severity of the violence or threats, their nature and their local reach, must be assessed individually (see Migration Agency, Legal opinion on protection by the authorities in Iraq, 5 April 2011, Lifos 24948).",

Since the publication of UNHCR\u2019s 2012 Iraq Eligibility Guidelines and the 2012 Aide M\u00e9moire relating to Palestinian refugees in Iraq, Iraq has experienced a new surge in violence between Iraqi security forces (ISF) and Kurdish forces (Peshmerga) on the one hand and the group \u2018Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham\u2019 (hereafter ISIS), which operates both in Iraq and Syria, and affiliated armed groups on the other hand. Civilians are killed and wounded every day as a result of this surge of violence, including suicide attacks and car bombs, shelling, airstrikes, and executions. As a result of advances by ISIS, the Government of Iraq is reported to have lost full or partial control over considerable parts of the country\u2019s territory, particularly in Al-Anbar, Ninewa, Salah Al-Din, Kirkuk and Diyala governorates. Although the ISF and Kurdish forces, supported by US airstrikes, have recently regained control over some localities, mostly along the internal boundaries with the Kurdistan Region, overall frontlines remain fluid. The conflict, which re-escalated in Al-Anbar governorate in January 2014 and since then spread to other governorates, has been labelled as a non-international armed conflict. Casualties so far in 2014 represent the highest total since the height of sectarian conflict in 2006-2007.",

As the situation in Iraq remains highly fluid and volatile, and since all parts of the country are reported to have been affected, directly or indirectly, by the ongoing crisis, UNHCR urges States not to forcibly return persons originating from Iraq until tangible improvements in the security and human rights situation have occurred. In the current circumstances, many persons fleeing Iraq are likely to meet the 1951 Convention criteria for refugee status. When, in the context of the adjudication of an individual case of a person originating from Iraq, 1951 Convention criteria are found not to apply, broader refugee criteria as contained in relevant regional instruments or complementary forms of protection are likely to apply. In the current circumstances, with massive new internal displacement coupled with a large-scale humanitarian crisis, mounting sectarian tensions and reported access restrictions, particularly into the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, UNHCR does in principle not consider it appropriate for States to deny persons from Iraq international protection on the basis of the applicability of an internal flight or relocation alternative. Depending on the profile of the individual case, exclusion considerations may need to be examined.\u201d",

Concerning the threats from 2008 onwards, the applicants claimed that the Swedish authorities and courts had dismissed the evidence submitted by them and had found that it was not likely that there were threats against the first applicant in his home country. It was common in the Swedish asylum process for evidence submitted by asylum-seekers to be investigated in order to ascertain its credibility. However, in the present case, the domestic authorities had categorically dismissed the evidence submitted by the applicants without making any effort to investigate its veracity by, for example, contacting the Iraqi authorities or the Alhurra media channel. They had thus not fulfilled their obligations under Articles\u00a03 and 6 of the Convention. Had the Swedish authorities \u2013 and the Chamber \u2013 had any doubts about the credibility of the evidence submitted, they should first have made a well-informed decision on whether or not to accept it as credible. Had they correctly evaluated the evidence submitted, their assessment would most likely have been different from the one they had made in their decisions. As the Swedish authorities had not questioned the veracity of the applicants\u2019 claims, they should have given the first applicant the benefit of the doubt.",

In the first applicant\u2019s case there had been no reason to call his credibility into question. There had been a natural reason for invoking his political activities late in the asylum process: he had not been afforded an opportunity to give a complete account of his arguments in his asylum interview and therefore he had focused on the most urgent threat, namely that posed by al-Qaeda. Whether the televised public debate had been aired in 2008 or 2010 did not in any way invalidate or mitigate the first applicant\u2019s credibility or the threat level against him. The fact that the debate had been aired should have been a sufficient reason to take it seriously and investigate it. The only reason why the first applicant had not been subjected to ill-treatment between 2008 and 2011 was that he had been in hiding.",

France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 95, ECHR 1999\u2011V, and the Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, p. 3288, \u00a7 93). The Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the victim\u2019s conduct (see the Chahal v. the United Kingdom judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, p. 1855, \u00a7 79).\u201d",

In these circumstances, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

For example, in R.C. v.

By the same token, the fact of past persecution is not necessarily conclusive of the possibility of renewed persecution, particularly where there has been an important change in the conditions in the country of origin\u201d (see paragraph 53 above). The Court considers that the UNHCR\u2019s general approach to the burden of proof is also of interest in the present context: while the burden of proof lies with the asylum-seeker, the State official examining the asylum claim shares the duty to ascertain and evaluate all relevant facts with the asylum-seeker (see paragraph 6 of the UNHCR 1998 Note on Burden and Standard of Proof in Refugee Claims and paragraph 196 of the UNHCR Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status \u2013 cited in paragraphs 53 and 54 above). Moreover, as regards the assessment of the overall credibility of an asylum claim, paragraph 11 of the Note on Burden and Standard of Proof in Refugee Claims states that credibility is established where the applicant has presented a claim which is coherent and plausible, not contradicting generally known facts, and therefore is, on balance, capable of being believed (see paragraph 53 above).",

The Court also notes that the applicants alleged in the proceedings before the Migration Agency that indirect threats against them and attacks on the first applicant\u2019s business stock had continued after 2008, that they had only escaped further abuses by going into hiding and that they had been unable to avail themselves of the Iraqi authorities\u2019 protection as the latter were infiltrated by al-Qaeda. The Court sees no reason to question this account. Thus, on the whole, the Court is satisfied that the applicants\u2019 account of events which occurred between 2004 and 2010 is generally coherent and credible. This account is consistent with relevant country-of-origin information available from reliable and objective sources (see paragraph 39 above). Having regard to the fact that the applicants had been subjected to ill-treatment by al-Qaeda, the Court finds that there is a strong indication that they would continue to be at risk from non-State actors in Iraq (see paragraph 102 above).",

In this connection attention must be paid to the fact that it has already been established that the first applicant was ill-treated until 2008. Moreover, another significant factor is that his contacts with the American forces were highly visible as his office was situated at the United States military base referred to by the applicants as \u201cVictoria Camp\u201d.

I fully agree with the need for such an analysis and I do not see any other possibility in a system aiming to offer effective and practical protection of the rights enshrined in the Convention. However, before deciding to conduct such an analysis and to proceed with the application of the general principles, as established in paragraphs 77-105 of this judgment, the Court should check whether the analysis conducted at national level in the particular case has been Convention compliant or not. By circumventing this check and avoiding giving a clear answer as to whether or not the national authorities have failed to do their job, I do not think that our Court helps them in applying the Convention standards at national level.

In my opinion, this conclusion on the risk assessment does not comply with the test required by the Convention in asylum cases brought under Article 3. The likeliness or probability of the protection of an asylum seeker upon his or her return does not comply with the test of a rigorous examination of the applicants\u2019 allegations. When absolute rights protected by the Convention are at stake, the national authorities cannot discharge their obligations by concluding that it is likely that these rights will not be violated in the country of destination. The rigorous test requires that in their assessment the authorities should check whether there are substantial grounds to believe that there would be no real risk for the applicants\u2019 rights in the event of their return to Iraq. The wording used by the Swedish Migration Court does not convince me that the required rigour was applied in the examination of the applicants\u2019 case.

Sweden highlights a fault line running through the Court\u2019s current case-law on asylum and immigration, at least to the extent that that jurisprudence concerns member States, like Sweden, of the EU. At the heart of this case, as the majority judgment highlights (see paragraphs 85-102) is how the question of risk is to be assessed, with reference to Article 3, when it is established or accepted that the asylum-seeker has been the subject of past persecution or serious harm in the country to which the respondent State is seeking to return him. As a member State of the EU, Sweden is subject to the detailed rules of the Common European Asylum System and, within that context, the Qualification Directive. Despite the fact that the Swedish legislation interpreted and applied by the competent authorities transposes this detailed EU secondary legislation, the majority judgment proceeds as if this is an irrelevance, referring only to EU asylum law when selectively borrowing elements to set its own jurisprudential standard for the burden of proof (see further paragraph 7 below). Nowhere in the Grand Chamber judgment, not even in the paragraphs setting out domestic law (paragraphs 23-29 of the majority judgment), are the provisions of Swedish law which transposed the relevant provisions of the Qualification Directive, particularly Article\u00a04, explained or reproduced.",

Latvia, the Grand Chamber, in a spirit of complementarity, rightly enjoined the domestic courts of EU member States to examine, regardless of the mutual recognition mechanism established by EU law, any complaint which raises \u201ca serious and substantiated complaint to the effect that the protection of a Convention right has been manifestly deficient\u201d where that situation cannot be remedied by EU law.

Without this information, particularly in the field of immigration and asylum law, the Court is provided with an insufficient overview of the relevant legal framework with which domestic authorities and courts are working and the interrelationship between its component parts. This lack of clarity does not serve applicants, respondent Governments or the national asylum authorities called on to apply both the decisions of this Court and that of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg well. In the words of a domestic judge engaged in a recent Article 3 risk assessment similar to that at issue in the present case:",

Yet, as Judge Ranzoni highlights in his dissenting opinion, it is not for the Grand Chamber to pick and choose preferred elements from either or both sources, leaving aside those elements which suit its judicial narrative less well and jettisoning all important context. The result is a well-intentioned but slightly cobbled together formula in paragraph 102 which competent authorities may have some difficulty with in practice. How is a national judge called on to apply Article 4(4) of the Qualification Directive via the prism of his or her transposing national legislation, while insuring compliance with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention, to reconcile the \u201cserious indication\u201d to which the former refers with the \u201cstrong indication\u201d which the Court now identifies as the relevant standard under Article 3? There is no explanation for this altered language. In addition, as regards paragraph 97, whatever about the UNHCR documents referred to, Article 4(5) of the Qualification Directive does not recognise, explicitly or implicitly, that the benefit of the doubt should be granted in favour of an individual seeking international protection. Article 4(5) states rather that where aspects of the applicant\u2019s statements are not supported by documentary evidence, those aspects shall not need confirmation where five clearly defined conditions are met. There is no need to reproduce all of those conditions in detail. Suffice it to say that by finding that asylum-seekers should be given the benefit of the doubt, without in anyway qualifying that statement with a general \u201cin certain circumstances\u201d or \u201csubject to certain conditions\u201d, the Grand Chamber glosses over essential details and conditions built into the sources on which it claims to rely. In order to find a violation of Article 3 in the instant case, this muddying of legal waters was not necessary and, given that this is a Grand Chamber judgment, far from desirable.",

                        "content": "8.\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, it should be stressed that the majority judgment is to be welcomed to the extent that it systematizes some of the general principles to be applied by domestic authorities in Article 3 cases and, in addition, clarifies the nature of the ex nunc assessment the Court engages in pursuant to this provision (see paragraphs 77-90). Nevertheless, when it comes to applying those general principles to the facts of the instant case, some of the unnecessary weaknesses identified above in paragraphs 97 and 102 find their mirror image when it comes to application of the general principles in paragraph\u00a0114. Some of these weaknesses are highlighted in the joint dissenting opinion annexed to the majority judgment. While I would disagree with the latter in their alternative assessment of risk, or rather the lack thereof, I would certainly agree that it was unnecessary for the majority to rely on such reductive reasoning in this crucial paragraph. This case turned on the evidentiary burden which had to be discharged once it was accepted, as it was, that the applicant and his family had been the victims of serious persecution, resulting in death and serious injury, in Iraq and that significant parts of their account were credible. The Grand Chamber had to assess in this context whether, given past events, the probability that the Iraqi authorities would be both willing and able to protect the applicant, a former U.S. army collaborator, and his family was a sufficient basis to be able to deport them. Despite evidence that the applicant had participated in a TV debate in which he had criticised the authorities precisely on this point, the Migration Board refused to re-examine their case, a fact alone which could have been examined more closely by the Court in the light of its recent decision in F.G. v. Sweden. In the context of the Court\u2019s own ex nunc assessment, given the situation in Iraq and Baghdad mid-2016, it was possible to provide more than the bare statement in paragraph 114 to the effect that past ill-treatment by al-Qaeda allowed the Court to find \u201cthat there is a strong indication that they would continue to be at risk from non-State actors in Iraq\u201d, referring in a circular manner in support of this statement to a previous paragraph under the general principles where this criterion of past ill-treatment in the assessment of future risk is enunciated. Again, the potential violation of Article 3 should the applicants be expelled to Iraq could have been established on a more solid basis. Once it is recognised, as it was by the Swedish authorities, that the attacks on the applicant, on the one hand, and the death of his daughter, on the other, occurred and the reason for those attacks, a prima facie case in favour of granting asylum began to form, and the evidentiary burden passed to the State, particularly when it came to disproving the risks posed by the general situation in the receiving State, the threat from non-State actors and the inability of the authorities in said State to protect the applicants when and if returned. I respectfully disagree with the joint dissent when they \u201cassume\u201d that, since threats to the applicant and his family had stopped when he ceased his collaboration with the U.S. forces, no future risk lay and when they state, without more, that \u201cthere appears to be no risk of persecution of the applicants on account of the activities of ISIS either\u201d. However, they are entirely correct in their contention that the Grand Chamber, in its ex nunc assessment, had to engage clearly and concretely with these issues. Was it not possible to refer, amongst others, to the UNHCR guidelines, albeit from 2012, which made clear that civilians (formerly) employed or otherwise affiliated with the former MNF-I/USF-I or international companies, as well as their families, were still at risk of being targeted by non-State actors for their (imputed) political opinion and identified who those non-State actors were? The Court itself has previously recognized that individuals who worked directly with the international forces or for a company connected to those forces must, as a rule, be considered to be at greater risk in Iraq than the average population.",

After concluding that there is a strong indication of this continued risk, the majority find that it is for the Government to dispel any doubts about it. Here the majority refer back to the assessments made by the Migration Agency and the Migration Court and find their reasoning to be lacking. However, the majority do not take into account the Government\u2019s submissions on the relevant points but conclude that the domestic decisions do not appear to have entirely excluded a continuing risk from al-Qaeda and that they instead appear to have supported the view that the Iraqi authorities\u2019 ability to protect the applicants had increased (see paragraph 115).",

Even though the domestic authorities\u2019 assessment of the facts, including the credibility of accounts provided by asylum-seekers, is very important for the Court\u2019s assessment of an application, the principal issue in the present case is not the Swedish immigration authorities\u2019 decisions at the time, but whether, in the present-day situation, the applicants would face a real risk of persecution if returned to Iraq (see paragraph 113 of the judgment). This inevitably means that the Court takes on the responsibility for determining all the facts on which it bases its risk assessment under Article 3. However, respecting the principle of subsidiarity, \u201cit is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them\u201d (see paragraph 84), and therefore any assessment of the relevant facts and evidence that has previously been made in the domestic context must be taken into account. As it is the Government who defend the State in the case before the Court, and as a possible potential violation of Article 3 is at issue, their submissions as regards the facts and the applicants\u2019 credibility must be taken into account in the Court\u2019s ex nunc assessment of any future risks for the applicants. All this must be done without the Court having had the opportunity to hear the applicants in person and, in this case, without any of the written evidence adduced in the domestic proceedings having been presented to all the judges. Furthermore, even accepting past ill-treatment as a \u201cstrong indication\u201d of risk (see paragraphs 99-102), if such ill-treatment ceased while the applicants remained in their home country, that risk indication is diminished in our opinion. However, we agree with the majority that any acceptance of past ill-treatment as an indication of a risk presupposes that the applicant \u201chas made a generally coherent and credible account of events\u201d (see paragraph 103).",

In our opinion the assessment of the applicants\u2019 credibility in this case should include the following aspects: an evaluation of the Government\u2019s claim that the first applicant had not mentioned in his interviews at the Migration Agency in 2011 his allegation that al-Qaeda had been searching for him only a few weeks previously; scrutiny of the report allegedly produced by the Iraqi authorities (to which the applicants claimed that they did not have access) in relation to the alleged burning down of the applicants\u2019 house in November 2011; an assessment of the claim that the applicants risk persecution on account of the first applicant\u2019s political activities, set against the Government\u2019s contention that this factor was not mentioned in the proceedings before the Migration Agency but only in the later appeal to the Migration Court; and an assessment of the claim by the applicants that al-Qaeda had searched for the first applicant in 2011, the only evidence of which is a report by a former neighbour in Baghdad, the evidentiary value of which is low according to the respondent State.",

However, the Court in R.J. v. France acknowledged the strong presumption solely on the basis of the veracity of past ill-treatment and the injuries sustained as recorded in a medical certificate. A similar approach was taken in R.C. v. Sweden (no. 41827/07, 9\u00a0March 2010). There, the term strong was also used, but again simply to qualify the assumption that the injuries noted in the medical certificate had been caused by (past) ill-treatment (presumably by the domestic authorities). Neither in R.J. v. France nor in R.C. v. Sweden did the Court conclude that past ill-treatment provided a strong presumption or a strong indication of future ill-treatment upon the asylum-seeker\u2019s return to his country of origin.",

The Court has stated in several judgments that if the veracity of the asylum-seeker\u2019s submissions is questioned, he or she must provide a satisfactory explanation for any alleged discrepancies (see F.G. v. Sweden [GC], no.\u00a043611/11, \u00a7 113, ECHR 2016, with further references). But it is also an important factor for the benefit of the doubt that the asylum-seeker\u2019s statements were coherent and not contradictory and that the very essence of those statements remained unchanged during the asylum procedure. Of course, if only some details of the account may appear somewhat implausible, that does not necessarily detract from the overall credibility of the applicant\u2019s claim. That is what the judgment of the Grand Chamber notes in paragraph 93 (last sentence), although it adds - without any explanation - the term general. However, the reference to Said v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands (no. 2345/02, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2005-VI) and, mutatis mutandis, N.\u00a0v.\u00a0Finland (no. 38885/02, \u00a7\u00a7 154-155, 26 July 2005) does not support this addition; the term general is not used in either of these two judgments.",

The expression general credibility in Article 4 \u00a7 5 (e) of the Directive does not constitute a valid basis because it refers not to the credibility of the account (in German: Glaubhaftigkeit) but to the credibility of the person (in German: Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit).
