The decision was adopted on 3 March 2006 and became final on 15 March 2006. The criminal proceedings before the Split Municipal Court were instituted further to an indictment lodged by the Split State Attorney\u2019s Office on 8 February 2005. The police report upon which the minor-offences proceedings were instituted was included in the case file. These circumstances show that both sets of proceedings were instituted on the basis of the police report. It is obvious that the police lodged a request for proceedings to be instituted against the applicant in the Split Minor Offences Court and also submitted the report on the same incident to the Split State Attorney\u2019s Office, which resulted in the applicant being prosecuted twice.",

However, there is one paragraph \u2013 which, moreover, serves little purpose in my view in terms of the reasoning of the judgment \u2013 which leaves me perplexed. Paragraph 29 states as follows: \u201cThe Court reiterates that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 does not necessarily extend to all proceedings instituted in respect of the same offence (see Falkner v. Austria (dec.), no. 6072/02, 30\u00a0September 2004). Its object and purpose imply that, in the absence of any damage proved by the applicant, only new proceedings brought in the knowledge that the defendant has already been tried in the previous proceedings would violate this provision\u201d. It is true that this passage is not new but has featured in previous judgments and decisions (see, in particular, Zigarella v. Italy (dec.), no. 48154/99, 3 October 2002, and Maresti v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 55759/0725, 25 June 2009, \u00a7 66). Nevertheless, the Grand Chamber judgment in Sergey Zolotukhin v. Russia (no. 14939/03, 10\u00a0February 2009), which is now seen as the locus classicus as regards interpretation of the ne bis in idem principle, contains no assertion of this kind but affords much greater protection to the individual.",

Indeed, the third paragraph of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention states as follows: \u201cNo derogation from this Article shall be made under Article 15 of the Convention\u201d. In other words, in view of its crucial importance in a State governed by the rule of law, the ne bis in idem principle features among the select group of norms which are nonderogable and even form an imperative part of the normative structure of the Convention and the Protocols thereto.",

Nevertheless, all the limitations in question form part of the rule itself as they are expressly articulated by it. As defined in the first and second paragraphs of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, the ne bis in idem principle may not be derogated from in any circumstances, not even in times of crisis. Any other exception, limitation, restriction or derogation, irrespective of its nature, which is not provided for by Article 4 itself is incompatible with the imperative nature of the principle recognised by that provision.",

Quite apart from the fact that no such exception can be derived from the letter or even the spirit of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, the conditions outlined above create significant potential for abuse which is liable to undermine the ne bis in idem principle.",

In my view the setting in motion of such proceedings, in whatever manner, would ipso facto occasion non-pecuniary damage to the person finally acquitted or convicted of the same offence, to say nothing of other negative consequences for him or her. As observed by the Grand Chamber, \u201cthe Court reiterates that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 is not confined to the right not to be punished twice but extends to the right not to be prosecuted or tried twice (see Franz Fischer [v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a037950/97, 29 May 2001] \u00a7 29). Were this not the case, it would not have been necessary to add the word \u2018punished\u2019 to the word \u2018tried\u2019 since this would be mere duplication. Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 applies even where the individual has merely been prosecuted in proceedings that have not resulted in a conviction. The Court reiterates that Article 4 of Protocol No.\u00a07 contains three distinct guarantees and provides that no one shall be (i) liable to be tried, (ii) tried or (iii) punished for the same offence (see Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7 36)\u201d (Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7 110).",

It seems obvious that each time new proceedings were brought for the same offence, the competent authorities could claim to have had no knowledge and to have therefore acted in good faith, with all the practical implications that this entails, not least as regards the burden of proof and the degree of compensation afforded to the person concerned. In Zolotukhin, the Grand Chamber was much stricter on this point, stating as follows: \u201cThe Court therefore accepts that in cases where the domestic authorities institute two sets of proceedings but later acknowledge a violation of the non bis in idem principle and offer appropriate redress by way, for instance, of terminating or annulling the second set of proceedings and effacing its effects, the Court may regard the applicant as having lost his status as a \u2018victim\u2019. Were it otherwise it would be impossible for the national authorities to remedy alleged violations of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 at the domestic level and the concept of subsidiarity would lose much of its usefulness\u201d (see Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7 115). In other words, the Grand Chamber does not simply accept that the national authorities lacked knowledge, but lays down very stringent and objectively measurable requirements \u2013 in the form of acknowledging the violation and affording redress for it, more specifically by terminating or annulling the second set of proceedings and effacing its effects \u2013 in order for the applicant no longer to be considered as a victim. Hence, as I see it, paragraph 29 of the present judgment departs significantly from the interpretation of the ne bis in idem principle derived in particular from the passages of the Grand Chamber judgment in Sergey Zolotukhin cited above.",

We are aware that, as far back as 1990, Article 54 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement extended the territorial scope of the principle in question to all the Contracting Parties. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union echoed this idea by extending the scope of the principle to all 27 Member States of the Union. Article 50 of the Charter states as follows: \u201cNo one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings for an offence for which he or she has already been finally acquitted or convicted within the Union in accordance with the law\u201d (my italics). It is true that the territorial scope of the ne bis in idem principle is a different issue from that under consideration here. Nevertheless, the gradual broadening of the scope of the principle represents a move towards strengthening and consolidating it at international level, whereas paragraph 29 of the present judgment tends in the direction of a relative approach to, and hence a weakening of, that principle.",
