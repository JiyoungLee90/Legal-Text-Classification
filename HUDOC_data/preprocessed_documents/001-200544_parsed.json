It appeared that the witness had absconded and had been placed on the wanted list, a search file had been opened and operational-search measures had been conducted to establish his whereabouts. The Ministry of Internal Affairs had been notified that his attendance in the current proceedings should be secured and they had been provided with information that he had connections to certain locations in the country and that he might leave the country. Accordingly, the absent witness\u2019s statements were read out at trial. The Government argued that the applicant\u2019s conviction was based on abundant other evidence, such as his pre-trial and trial testimony in which he had admitted that part of the drugs belonged to him and the remainder he had received from the absent witness for further transportation, testimony of the police officers who had conducted operational-search activities in respect of the applicant, and transcripts of the telephone calls between the applicant, absent witness and other buyers of the drugs.

In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 84, 16\u00a0November 2010, and Schatschaschwili v. Germany [GC], no. 9154/10, \u00a7 101, 15\u00a0December 2015, with further references therein). In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole, having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victim(s) that crime is properly prosecuted (see G\u00e4fgen v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 175, ECHR 2010, and Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0101) and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see, amongst many authorities, Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and 22228/06, \u00a7 118, 15\u00a0December 2011). It is also notable in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 162, and the references therein).",
