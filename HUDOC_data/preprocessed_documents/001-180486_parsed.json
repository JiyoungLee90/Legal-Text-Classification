She showed signs of accumulated tension, fear, worries, disappointment and anger towards the officials who had abandoned her to her own devices following her parents\u2019 arrest. She had no interest in her daily life or in the future and had become withdrawn as a result of her loss of confidence in the justice system.

They found that the applicant was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, which was probably the result of what she had gone through after her parents\u2019 arrest. The doctors stated in court that no improvement was likely in her case and that her condition was expected to become chronic. Another medical report ordered by the court in 2009 confirmed that the applicant was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and that, while she had been a healthy and energetic child prior to her parents\u2019 arrest, she had experienced frequent bouts of depression thereafter and had succumbed to overwhelming feelings of self-pity, insecurity and futility of effort and engagement.",

Furthermore, although the object of Article\u00a08 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private or family life (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, \u00a7 23, Series A no. 91). The Court has also held that the cumulative effect of the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to adopt measures, including but not limited to interim court measures, as required in a situation which adversely affected the applicants amounted to a failure to assist them, in breach of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 8 to secure respect for their private and family life (see Bevacqua and S., cited above, \u00a7 84). The Court has also found, albeit in the context of a complaint made under Article 3 of the Convention, that the failure of the authorities to organise care for an applicant, who was aged twelve when his parents were arrested and held at a police station for several hours, or to explain the situation to him, reached the threshold required by Article 3 and constituted degrading treatment (see Ioan Pop and Others v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a052924/09, \u00a7 65, 6\u00a0December 2016).",

Once the authorities had established the circumstances relating to the applicant\u2019s care in her parents\u2019 absence, if it appeared necessary, they had an obligation under domestic law to provide her with assistance, support and services as needed, either in her own home, in a foster family or at a specialised institution. This obligation, pursuant to domestic law, appeared to arise from the moment her parents were taken into custody (see paragraphs 45-46 above). The Government have not submitted that any of this was done by the relevant authorities at any point in time before the hearing on 6 December 2002, which was two days after the arrest of the applicant\u2019s parents. The Court thus finds that, as regards the period between the applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 arrest and the hearing on extending their detention, the authorities failed to comply with their positive obligation under Article\u00a08 of the Convention to act in order to ensure that the applicant, who was a minor left without parental care, was protected and provided for in her parents\u2019 absence.",

The Court considers that it is not its task to specify which authority could have done what exactly and when in order to prevent the applicant\u2019s potential exposure to suffering provoked by the uncertainty about her own fate and that of her parents after their arrest. However, it notes that the Government have not argued that at any point in time did any relevant authority visit the applicant, verify that she was not in fact alone following her parents\u2019 arrest, inform her about her parents\u2019 situation, clarify her own situation to her, or \u2013 given her age \u2013 take her to visit either or both of them in prison.",

In addition, the Government pointed out that the applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 own lawyer had been present during the hearing on extending their detention and had stated during the subsequent proceedings for damages brought by the applicant that he did not know what had happened to her. Similarly, the applicant\u2019s teacher had testified that she had no memory of the applicant having been hungry, cold or distressed at the time (see paragraph 35 above).

They were legally represented during the extradition proceedings by a lawyer of their own choosing. That lawyer had taken part in the court hearing when the judge had enquired into the applicant\u2019s care in the absence of her parents (see paragraph 17 above); he had continued to represent the applicant\u2019s parents throughout their subsequent detention and had, moreover, been a neighbour to the applicant\u2019s family (ibid.). Furthermore, in addition to being recorded as stating in court that there was someone to care for her daughter, the applicant\u2019s mother did not at any point in time \u2013 either before or after that hearing, at the time of her arrest or later from prison \u2013 raise with any authority the question of the applicant\u2019s care during her detention.

Consequently, their obligation under domestic law to take detained persons\u2019 children into care, if no care was available to them, was not relevant after the hearing on 6 December 2002. Accordingly, in the absence of any steps by or on behalf of the parents at the time of the events, the Court finds that, in the subsequent proceedings for damages brought by the applicant, the domestic courts\u2019 reliance on the record of the detention hearing and their conclusion that neither the police, nor the prosecution, nor the courts had needed to enquire any further about the applicant\u2019s situation did not amount to a failure to act appropriately in the context of their Article\u00a08 obligations.",

On that date questions were raised, at the initiative of the public prosecutor, regarding the provision of care for the applicant while her parents were detained. The parties disagreed regarding the manner in which the applicant\u2019s mother responded to the judge\u2019s question relating to care for her daughter. Her response was noted in the record of the hearing as indicating that the child (the applicant) had been taken care of (see \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 18 of the majority judgment); a record which the parents never sought to check or subsequently rectify (see further below).",

The lawyer, who was both a friend and a neighbour, was present during their arrest and was in contact with them between the time of the arrest and the court hearing two days later. When in court, the applicant\u2019s parents were assisted by that same lawyer and by a court-appointed interpreter. Moreover, when in prison, before and after the key court hearing on 6 December, there is no record of the parents enquiring into the care provided for their daughter in their absence or checking the court record according to which the mother had been understood \u2013 mistakenly it is argued \u2013 to have confirmed that the applicant had been taken care of.",

The court accepted that the mother had replied in the affirmative to the judge\u2019s question whether there had been someone to care for the applicant.

Crucially, in this case, the parties differed on the question whether the applicant had actually fallen into the category of a child in need, namely whether she had been effectively left unattended in her parents\u2019 absence so as to require (automatic or immediate) protection by the authorities. Despite extensive judicial proceedings at the domestic level, it was not proven that the applicant had indeed been left alone and without care during her parents\u2019 detention. There is, it must be conceded, no proof that the police notified the relevant competent authorities at the time of the arrest of the applicant\u2019s parents, alerting those authorities to the presence of a minor. However, neither is there anything in the file to suggest that her parents raised with the police the issue of her being left alone at the time of their arrest, that they brought up the question of her care in the immediate aftermath, or that they instructed their lawyer, who was present during the arrest and subsequently accessible to them, to do so. We note, in particular, that under domestic law the record of the hearing carries evidential force of the circumstances recorded therein. When answering that question at the hearing the applicant\u2019s mother had been legally represented and assisted by an interpreter. Moreover, it is noteworthy that from the first hearing on 6\u00a0December 2002 until 17 December 2002, the date of the appellate hearing and the release of the applicant\u2019s parents, neither of them signalled to any authority that there might have been a problem with the applicant\u2019s care or that they were worried about their daughter\u2019s well-being in their absence.",

The domestic courts did not find that the applicant had discharged the evidentiary burden incumbent on her relating to events during and following her parents\u2019 arrest.

The authorities mentioned in the recapitulation of the general principles (see \u00a7 58 of the majority judgment) are clearly distinguishable. For instance, reference is made to a recent judgment of another chamber of the Court \u2013 Ioan Pop v. Romania. In that case, a majority of 6 to 1 found that the failure to ensure that a twelve-year-old child was looked after by an adult while his parents were held in police custody for approximately 9 to 12 hours constituted inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. However, even if one were to consider that judgment a binding and persuasive precedent, several points distinguish the Ioan Pop case from the present one. The child, aged twelve at the time of the arrest of his parents, had witnessed scenes of considerable violence during the latter, including the forced sedation of his father; the Article 3 threshold was found to have been met because the competent domestic authorities had not taken measures to entrust the third applicant to an adult while his parents were at the police station or to explain to him his situation or that of his parents; and crucially, while the Court had also been confronted by divergent accounts of what had happened to the child after the arrest, it found that the domestic courts had not examined his complaint or established the relevant facts. In these circumstances and faced with diverging accounts, the Court found it sufficiently established that the applicant child had been left alone for several hours without adult supervision and it therefore went on to examine the authorities\u2019 positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention, finding a violation of the latter. However, as pointed out previously, in the present case the majority appear to reverse this sequence of reasoning \u2012 finding a violation of Article\u00a08 of the Convention due to the authorities\u2019 failure to respect their positive obligation towards the applicant despite the domestic courts\u2019 extensive examination of the facts alleged by her and its rejection of her version of events between the day of the arrest and the court hearing.",
