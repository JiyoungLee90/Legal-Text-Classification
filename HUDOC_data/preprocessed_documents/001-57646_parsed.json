The use of the discretionary life sentence is distinguished in the practice of the English courts from the use of the determinate or fixed-term sentence of imprisonment. In fixing the length of a determinate sentence the most important principle is that it should be related to the gravity of the offence. It is subject to one-third remission of sentence for good behaviour and there is the possibility of parole once a third of the sentence has been served.",

Rather it is necessary to cater for the presently perceived risk that, upon completion of any lawful determinate sentence, the prisoner would, if freed, remain a grave danger to society.

It is having to project its assessment many years forward and without the benefit of a constant process of monitoring and reporting such as will be enjoyed by the Parole Board.

It represented the judges\u2019 views as to the minimum period of detention necessary to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. The judges\u2019 recommendation in this respect, however, was relevant only to the fixing of the date for the first review. When considering release, the Secretary of State was not bound by the judicial view on \"tariff\", but had to take into account a variety of factors which it was impossible to subject to finite analysis. Furthermore, the fact that the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice were consulted a second time prior to the prisoner\u2019s release showed that consideration of the period necessary for punishment did not end at the expiry of the \"tariff\" period.

In subsequent cases the Court made it clear that this finding related only to \"the initial decision depriving a person of his liberty\" and did not purport \"to deal with an ensuing period of detention in which new issues affecting the lawfulness of the detention might arise\" (see, inter alia, the above-mentioned Weeks judgment, Series A no. 114, p. 28, para. 56). In this connection the concept of lawfulness under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires that the detention be in conformity not only with domestic law but also with the text of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) (ibid., p. 23, para. 42, and p. 28, para. 57).",

In cases concerning detention of persons of unsound mind under Article 5 para. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e) where the reasons initially warranting detention may cease to exist the Court has held that \"it would be contrary to the object and purpose of Article 5 (art. 5) ... to interpret paragraph 4 (art. 5-4) ... as making this category of confinement immune from subsequent review of lawfulness merely provided that the initial decision issued from a court ...\" (see the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, pp. 22-23, para. 52). This interpretation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) has also, in certain circumstances, been applied to detention \"after conviction by a competent court\" under Article 5 para. 1 (a) (art. 5-1-a) (see, inter alia, the Van Droogenbroeck judgment of 24 June 1982, Series A no. 50, pp. 23-27, paras. 44-49, the above-mentioned Weeks judgment, Series A no. 114, pp. 28-29, paras. 55-59, and the E. v.

It was an important feature of this category that the grounds relied on by the sentencing judges as the reason for imposing a life sentence on Mr Weeks, namely his mental instability and dangerousness, were, by their nature, susceptible of change with the passage of time. The Court inferred from this that, if the decisions not to release or to re-detain were based on grounds inconsistent with the objectives of the sentencing court, his detention would no longer be \"lawful\" for the purposes of Article 5 para. 1 (a) (art. 5-1-a) and the Court concluded that Mr Weeks was entitled, by virtue of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4), to have recourse to a court to decide on the lawfulness of his deprivation of liberty at the moment of any return to custody after being at liberty as well as at reasonable intervals during the course of his imprisonment (ibid., p. 29, para. 58).",

As regards the nature and purpose of the discretionary life sentence under English law, the Government\u2019s main submission was that it is impossible to disentangle the punitive and security components of such sentences. The Court is not persuaded by this argument: the discretionary life sentence has clearly developed in English law as a measure to deal with mentally unstable and dangerous offenders; numerous judicial statements have recognised the protective purpose of this form of life sentence (see, in particular, the remarks by Lord Chief Justice Lane and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in R v. Wilkinson and R v. Secretary of State, ex parte Bradley, paragraphs 50 and 53 above). Although the dividing line may be difficult to draw in particular cases, it seems clear that the principles underlying such sentences, unlike mandatory life sentences, have developed in the sense that they are composed of a punitive element and subsequently of a security element designed to confer on the Secretary of State the responsibility for determining when the public interest permits the prisoner\u2019s release. This view is confirmed by the judicial description of the \"tariff\" as denoting the period of detention considered necessary to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence (see paragraphs 52-53 above).",

The judgment shows that the majority of the Court has tried to limit itself to the cases in question and, in particular, to what the majority finds to be a legal distinction under English law between \"punitive\" and \"security\" periods of imprisonment where the life sentence is a discretionary one. At the same time it is stated in the judgment that the Court should not lose sight of the general context. I agree with this approach although in my view it means that thought should be given as to how the present judgment would influence the situation in other countries. I am not in a position to make a comprehensive study on this point, but I consider that the approach of the majority, which is difficult, if at all possible, to apply in the present case, would give rise to even greater difficulties if it were to be applied to sentences passed in other States. The words of the Convention do not require that our Court undertakes the difficult task of breaking up sentences passed by courts in member States into their \"tariff\" and \"security\" components. This latter part of a sentence is said to be based on grounds \"susceptible of change with the passage of time\". I find that it is not possible to make this distinction under the Convention.",

The Convention does not guarantee a right to be considered for parole nor does it contain rules as to the outcome of such procedures. I am of the opinion that the rights of the applicants Mr Wilson and Mr Gunnell are not changed by the fact that they were released on licence and then re-detained on the basis of their original sentences since these sentences were still in force.
