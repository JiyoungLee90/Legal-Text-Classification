The Court considered that there had been no grounds for assuming that the use of those remedies could effectively address the applicants\u2019 issues (see, for example, Melnik v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a072286/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06971, 28 March 2006; Znaykin v.

Accordingly, where the applicants failed to introduce the complaints within the six-month period after the continued situation ceased to exist, the Court rejected such complaints under the six-month rule (see Khayrov v.

In reaching that conclusion, the Court attached weight to the fact that the applicant\u2019s complaint concerned a relatively short period of detention. The Court further noted that the applicant\u2019s civil action for damages, which he had brought after his release, touched upon a number issues which might not have decisively resulted from the structural problems. Lastly, the Court observed that the civil courts had taken cognisance of the applicant\u2019s claim and after examination on them merits dismissed it as unsubstantiated.",

The Court should establish whether the applicant, a party to the civil proceedings, had been given a reasonable opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations made or evidence adduced by the other party and to present his case under conditions that did not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent. From the Convention standpoint, an applicant does not need to show that his absence from a hearing resulted in actual prejudice or affected the outcome of the proceedings, for such a requirement would deprive the guarantees of Article\u00a06 of their substance.
