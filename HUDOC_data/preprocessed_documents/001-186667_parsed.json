In reply to a direct question, he explained that no foul language had been used by protesters in his office, either in respect of him or of his colleagues. He remembered, however, Mr Dolidze inciting via cell phone other protesters to join them in the acting Rector\u2019s office. Lastly, G.Kh. noted that the incident in his office had lasted for about an hour and a half, paralysing not only his work but the functioning of the whole administration of the University.",

In that connection, they referred to the statements of witnesses who had noted that there had been two hundred people outside and twenty people inside the acting Rector\u2019s office during the events of 3 July 2006 and that it was impossible to identify the individuals who had allegedly insulted the acting Rector and forced their way into his office. The applicants also complained of the failure of the Tbilisi City Court to examine the acting Rector and his deputy in the course of the trial. Lastly, they challenged the categorisation of their actions as administrative offences by the first-instance court, submitting that they had simply been exercising their freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.",

Russia [Committee], no. 30395/06, \u00a7 34, 17 April 2018). In the current case, the thrust of the applicants\u2019 complaint was their allegedly forceful removal from the office of the acting Rector and the imposition of administrative fines for their role in the events of 3 July 2006. They claimed that these measures had amounted to an interference with their peaceful protest. In such circumstances, the Court is of the opinion that Article 11 is to be regarded as a lex specialis and that it is unnecessary to take the complaint under Article 10 into consideration separately (see, in this connection, Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, 12\u00a0June 2014, where the Court noted that in the exercise of the right to freedom of assembly the participants would not only be seeking to express their opinion, but to do so together with others). At the same time, notwithstanding its autonomous role and particular sphere of application, Article 11 must, in the present case, also be considered in the light of the principles developed under Article 10 of the Convention (see Kudrevi\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 85-86, with further references therein).",

The Court observes in this connection that the applicants had permission to organise a meeting on the premises of the University on 3 July 2006 and that they had availed themselves of that opportunity. During the first phase of their protest on that day they gathered, as duly authorised by the University administration, in one of the lecture halls (see paragraph 11 above). They moved, however, soon afterwards to the acting Rector\u2019s office, protesting against the ongoing University reform and demanding his resignation. The events which developed subsequent to their unauthorised entry to the Rector\u2019s office do not represent, in the Court\u2019s view, a standard situation of a \u201cpeaceful assembly\u201d within the meaning of Article 11 of the Convention. As noted in Kudrevi\u010dius and Others, although not an uncommon occurrence in the context of the exercise of freedom of assembly in modern societies, physical conduct purposely obstructing the ordinary course of life in order to seriously disrupt the activities carried out by others is not at the core of that freedom as protected by Article 11 of the Convention (cited above, paragraph 97; see also Annenkov and Others v. Russia, no. 31475/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0123-128, 25 July 2017). Nevertheless, the Court notes that the applicants were not held responsible for using violence. While the events at issue happened in a situation of tension, the applicants\u2019 conduct was not established to have been of a violent nature. The Court thus does not consider that the applicants\u2019 protest on 3 July 2006, viewed as a whole, was of such a nature and degree as to exclude them from the scope of protection under Article 11 of the Convention, read in the light of Article 10.",

The Court accepts that the impugned interference had a basis in domestic law. It notes that the police acted at the request of the acting Rector of the University (see paragraph 65 above). The removal was preceded by G.Kh. and other administrative staff members, and then by the police, explicitly and repeatedly asking the applicants to leave the acting Rector\u2019s office.

It notes in this connection the national court\u2019s conclusion according to which on 3 July 2006, after the impugned \u201celection\u201d of the second applicant as the new Rector of the University, the situation at the University escalated, with the applicants entering by force the office of the acting Rector and many more protesters chanting anti-G.Kh. slogans in the corridor of the University and in its courtyard (see paragraph 42 above). Although the parties disagree as to the extent of the disruption that the applicants\u2019 protest caused to the University, the Court is of the opinion that in view of the scale and duration of the protest, also having regard to the content of the video recording at the disposal of the Court, the disruption to the work of the University was noticeable. As the Tbilisi City Court concluded, the behaviour of the applicants \u2212 intensified by the number of protesters in the corridors of the building \u2013 intimidated the employees and students and disrupted the normal functioning of the educational establishment. At the same time, the applicants\u2019 protest at the very least impeded the work of the acting Rector and his immediate colleagues for about two hours. Against this background, the Court accepts the domestic court\u2019s conclusion that the decision of the police to remove the applicants and other protesters from G.Kh.\u2019s office was justified by the demands of public order and the interests of others (see Taranenko, and A\u00e7\u0131k and Others, both cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 78-79 and \u00a7 45 respectively; see also Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23\u00a0September 1998, \u00a7 97, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VII).",

This was a topic of public interest at the material time and there was little scope under Articles 10 \u00a7 2 and 11 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate relating thereto (see Taranenko, cited above, \u00a7 77, and Murat Vural v. Turkey, no. 9540/07, \u00a7 52, 21 October 2014). The Court notes, however, that the applicants were allowed to proceed, uninterruptedly, with a pre-authorised gathering in the Grand Hall of the main University building on the very same day for several hours (see paragraph 11 above). Subsequently, they had protested for about two hours in the office of the acting Rector, and the administration of the University (including the acting Rector) \u2212 and subsequently the police \u2212 showed the necessary tolerance (compare Kakabadze and Others v. Georgia, no.\u00a01484/07, \u00a7 88, 2 October 2012; A\u00e7\u0131k and Others, cited above, \u00a7 46; and Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, ECHR 2006XIV).

As to the allegations of insulting harassment, the national courts established that the applicants had forced their way into G.Kh.\u2019s office, calling for his resignation and demanding in an insulting manner that he leave his office, \u201cbag and baggage\u201d (see ibid.). In the Court\u2019s view, in calling for the resignation of a public official the applicants were exercising their right to freedom of expression (see, in this connection, Kandzhov v. Bulgaria, no. 68294/01, \u00a7\u00a070, 6 November 2008). Their call for the acting Rector\u2019s resignation could not in and of itself have been deemed to be insulting. The domestic courts did not identify any specific insulting phrases that the applicants had used with respect to G.Kh. or his colleagues (compare Ska\u0142ka v. Poland, no.\u00a043425/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02627, 27 May 2003; Janowski v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a025716/94, \u00a7 32, ECHR 1999I; and Kakabadze and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088-89).

Furthermore, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicants\u2019 conduct did indeed disrupt public order on the premises of the University (see the conclusion of the Court reached in paragraph 78 above). The Court is thus of the opinion that the interpretation of this provision given by the domestic courts in the present case was not arbitrary, and that the applicants could have foreseen, to a degree reasonable in the circumstances, that their actions entailing disruption to the functioning of the University, could have been deemed to amount to a minor breach of public order attracting the application of Article 166 of the CAO.",

The foregoing, in view of the overall context of the events \u2212 in particular the fact that the applicants were allowed to protest against the ongoing University reform for months, by, among other ways, holding meetings on the premises of the University, and in view of the nature of the protest on 3 July 2006 which culminated with the forceful entry of the applicants into the Rector\u2019s office, the disruption to the work of the University administration, and the refusal to obey explicit and reiterated requests of the police for them to leave the office of G.Kh.\u2212 is sufficient for the Court to conclude that the interference with the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 11 of the Convention read through the prism of Article 10 was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and necessary in a democratic society (see the overview of the Court\u2019s relevant case-law in Taranenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 81-89).",

Consequently, States do not have to answer for their actions before an international body before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999V, with further references therein). The Court notes that in the current case the applicants did not even once at the domestic level voice their grievances concerning the press conference given by the Minister of Education. They could have done so within the context of the impugned administrative proceedings (see, for example, Fatullayev v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 40984/07, \u00a7 153, 22 April 2010) or, as proposed by the Government, by lodging a civil complaint (see, for example, Martin Babjak and Others v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 73693/01, 30 March 2004). While it is true that in the absence of any domestic case-law concerning Article 18 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code, the Court is not in a position to conclude that that remedy was indeed available and effective in practice, it still finds unacceptable the applicants\u2019 failure to complain at the domestic level about the alleged violation of the principle of the presumption of innocence. By not giving the Government an opportunity to address this complaint at the domestic level, the applicants in the Court\u2019s view did not meet the requirements of Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Their complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention is therefore inadmissible owing to their failure to exhaust domestic remedies.",

Germany ([GC], no. 9154/10, \u00a7 111-31, ECHR 2015) the Grand Chamber confirmed that the absence of good reason for the non-attendance of a witness could not of itself render a trial unfair, although it remained a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness of a trial, and one which could tip the balance in favour of a breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d). Furthermore, given that the Court\u2019s concern is to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, it must review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors not only in cases in which the evidence given by an absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the accused\u2019s conviction. It must also do so in those cases where it finds it unclear whether the evidence in question was the sole or decisive basis but is nevertheless satisfied that it carried significant weight and that its admission may have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair will depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors will have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton v the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, \u00a7 59, 12 September 2016).",

Russia, no. 926/08, \u00a7 42, 20 September 2016, with further references therein; see also Mikhaylova v. Russia, no. 46998/08, \u00a7\u00a7 70-74, 19\u00a0November 2015, and Nicoleta Gheorghe v. Romania, no.\u00a023470/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a025-26, 3 April 2012). In view of the fact that the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 6 of the Convention consisted of two main limbs: firstly, the alleged manifestly arbitrary reasoning in the decisions suggesting the collective criminal liability of all the applicants; and secondly, the violation of the defence rights of the applicants on account of the failure to examine G.Kh. and his deputy in court \u2013 the Court will address them in turn.",

Starting with the administrative offence of resistance to the police, the Court notes that Ms Sikharulidze and Mr Bakhtadze (the sixth and ninth applicants) were acquitted of that offence since it was established that they had left the office of the acting Rector before the arrival of the police (see paragraph 39 above); the remaining applicants never challenged the official version of events regarding their encounter with the police officers in G.Kh.\u2019s office \u2013 they merely maintained that there had been no physical confrontation. However, the domestic courts concluded that even in the absence of a physical confrontation, those of the applicants who had remained in the Rector\u2019s office had refused to obey the official orders of the police, and that refusal had amounted to the offence of resisting the police (see paragraph 39 above). The Court sees no issue of arbitrariness arising with respect to the above-mentioned conclusion (see Moreira Ferreira v.\u00a0Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no. 19867/12, \u00a7\u00a7 83-85, 11 July 2017).",

(see the Court\u2019s conclusion in paragraph 82 above). However, the administrative offence in question was found to have been committed by the applicants not exclusively on account of their alleged insulting of G.Kh. but also on account of their being involved in a protest that had caused disruption to the University and violated public order and the rights of others (see paragraph\u00a038 above; see also the Court\u2019s conclusion in paragraph 78 above). While the reasoning of the national courts in this regard is not entirely careful or detailed, it is not in question that the applicants were part of a group of protesters that forced their way into the office of G.Kh., demanding his resignation and stayed there for at least two hours, disrupting the work of the University. In such circumstances, the Court does not see that any issue arises under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

They furthermore never contested the fact that as a part of a protest group they had demanded the resignation of G.Kh.

Thus, the charge of arbitrary behaviour referred exclusively to the episode of the allegedly unlawful election of the second applicant as Rector by a dissolved body. The applicants\u2019 line of argument was that the election had been lawful. In this connection, the national courts examined carefully the relevant legislative acts and concluded that the Grand Academic Council was an unlawful body. While G.Kh. and his deputy could have shed light on this matter, the main issue pending before the national courts within this context was purely legal \u2013 whether or not the old charter of the University was still valid (see, in this connection, paragraph 6 above). The Court is, thus, of the view that the evidence of G.Kh. and his deputy could not have been considered to constitute the sole or decisive evidence for the purposes of establishing the legal status of the Grand Academic Council and the impugned election.",
