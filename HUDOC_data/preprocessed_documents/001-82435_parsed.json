In this connection it notes that the considerable delay of one year and almost two months between 27 April 2001 and 22 June 2002 resulted from the mistakes and deficiencies of the investigating authority at the initial stage of the investigation. Furthermore, it is clear that during three weeks from 12 August 2002 to 2\u00a0September 2002 the examination of the case could not continue because of the authority's failure to serve a copy of the bill of indictment on the applicant's co-defendant. The Court also notes that the conduct of the defence and witnesses was a principal reason for the delay of one year and two months between September 2003 and November 2004. In this respect, the Court finds nothing in the case file or in the Government's submissions to suggest that the domestic courts availed themselves of the measures available to them under national law to discipline the participants to the proceedings and to ensure that the case be heard within a reasonable time (see, mutatis mutandis, Ku\u015bmierek v. , no. 10675/02, \u00a7 65, 21\u00a0September 2004). It therefore finds this delay attributable to the authorities. Further delays in the proceedings were caused by the deficiencies in the prosecution file which required the trial court to adjourn the proceedings for two months between 15 March and 18 May 2005 and the need \u201cto give the prosecution some time to study the case file\u201d which led to the adjournment of the hearings for another month and two weeks from 9\u00a0September to 26\u00a0October\u00a02005. Finally, the Court notes that the failure to comply with domestic time-limits was acknowledged by a special ruling of the Moscow Regional Court of 9\u00a0March 2006.",
