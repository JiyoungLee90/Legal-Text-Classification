Such a facility would have made it easier to assess the applicant\u2019s allegations in terms of ascertaining whether or not he had contracted the disease in the detention centre. However, in the absence of such a possibility, the Court must examine the applicant\u2019s allegations in the light of the evidence provided (see C\u0103t\u0103lin Eugen Micu v. Romania, no.\u00a055104/13, \u00a7\u00a056, 5 January 2016).

The treatment prescribed included, among other medicines, antivirals (see paragraph 35). The relevant extract from the applicant\u2019s medical file suggests that the applicant received the prescribed treatment in full; no evidence is available in the case file in support of the applicant\u2019s statements to the contrary. The applicant further failed to show that the diagnosis made by the SIZO doctors had not been correct or that the prescribed treatment had not corresponded to his condition and that other treatment should have been administered to him. No medical opinion was submitted by the applicant in this regard. The mere fact that a complex examination for hepatitis was not carried out in the SIZO cannot be regarded as proof of an overall deficiency in the medical assistance available to the applicant as it has not been shown that such an examination was indispensable in his particular situation and that his state of health was adversely affected (see, mutatis mutandis, Polufakin and Chernyshev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 30997/02, \u00a7 169, 25 September 2008).",

Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such a restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will, in principle, be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during questioning by police without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction. Accordingly, the test for assessing whether a restriction on access to a lawyer is compatible with the right to a fair trial is composed of two stages. In the first stage the Court must assess whether there were compelling reasons for the restriction. In the second stage, it must evaluate the prejudice caused to the rights of the defence by the restriction in the case in question. In other words, the Court must examine the impact of the restriction on the overall fairness of the proceedings and decide whether the proceedings as a whole were fair (see Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a050541/08, 50571/08, 50573/08 and 40351/09, \u00a7\u00a7 256 and 257, 13\u00a0September 2016). Where there are no compelling reasons for restricting access to legal advice, the Court must apply a very strict scrutiny to its fairness assessment. The onus will be on the Government to demonstrate convincingly why, exceptionally and in the specific circumstances of the case, the overall fairness of the trial was not irretrievably prejudiced by the restriction on access to legal advice (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0265).",

Ukraine raising issues similar to the present application (no. 36650/03, 12 January 2012). In that case, the Court observed that the applicable provision of the domestic law did not oblige the competent authority to adopt a formal decision on the request for a correspondence permit, to give reasons for such a decision or provide a copy thereof to the detainee concerned. Nor did that provision lay down a specific remedy enabling a detainee to contest the action or omission by the relevant authority. Due to the lack of those important procedural safeguards detainees\u2019 requests for a correspondence permit could remain unanswered or refused for no valid reason. The Court further noted that lack of the abovementioned guarantees was all the more disconcerting given that the domestic law, as a general rule, prohibited correspondence and obliged pretrial detainees to seek a permit as an exception thereto, rather than respecting, in principle, a detainee\u2019s right to correspondence and ensuring that any interference therewith was provided by and was in accordance with law. It therefore concluded that the relevant legislative provisions did not meet the requirements of quality of law for the purpose of the Convention and that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence was not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d as required by Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (ibid. \u00a7\u00a7 74-79).",
