However, by 30 June 2004 the detention order of 10 December 2003 had already expired. The Court reiterates in this respect that a period of detention cannot be considered \u201clawful\u201d automatically, where a case has been transferred to the trial court for further examination. The Russian Constitution and rules of criminal procedure vest the domestic courts with the power to order or extend custodial detention (see \u00a7paragraphs 20-26 above, and also the judgment of the Constitutional Court in paragraph 30 above). No exceptions to that rule are permitted or provided for, no matter how short the duration of the detention (see Lamazhyk v. Russia, no.\u00a020571/04, \u00a7 69, 30 July 2009). It follows that the applicant\u2019s detention could not have been lawful on the sole ground that the case had been transmitted to the District Court for re-trial, as suggested by the Government (see Razhev v. Russia, no. 29448/05, \u00a7 27, 12 June 2012, with further references). Therefore, a new decision on the preventive measure was required.",

Similarly, the District Court\u2019s decision of 12 August 2004 dismissing the application for release lodged by the defence (see paragraph\u00a013 above) could not serve as a \u201clawful ground\u201d for the extension of the applicant\u2019s detention during the period under consideration (see Melnikova v.
