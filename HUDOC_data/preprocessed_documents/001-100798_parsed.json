Moreover, the Court has held that there is no effective domestic remedy to challenge the constitutionality of a statutory provision, since the Ukrainian legal system does not provide an individual with the right of direct individual petition to the Constitutional Court (see Pronina, cited above, \u00a7 24, and Sheidl v. Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a03460/03, 25 March 2008). In this context the Court reiterates that for the remedy to be effective it must be independent of any action taken at the authorities' discretion and must be directly available to those concerned (see Gurepka v. Ukraine, no.\u00a061406/00, \u00a7 59, 6 September 2005). The Court notes that the applicant's request to the domestic courts for referral of the case to the Constitutional Court would be dependent on the discretion of the Supreme Court and, therefore, does not comply with the requirements of effective remedy for the purpose of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

It is not the task of the Court to decide what would have been the most appropriate way for the domestic courts to deal with this argument.
