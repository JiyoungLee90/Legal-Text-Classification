It took the view that the applicant had been at fault in blindly pursuing a fanciful objective without the slightest hope of redressing the situation; it confirmed the decision requiring him to make good part of the deficit in the company\u2019s assets.

Mr Davin\u2019s letter sheds little light on the course of the hearing because it merely confirms facts described in a letter from Mr de Chesse, a copy of which Mr Pardo was unable to produce (see paragraph 16 above). As regards the statement of Mr Roussel - who did not attend the hearing in person -, it is surprising that as early as 9 a.m., when the hearing had probably not yet begun, his client could have been sure that the hearing would be adjourned. There would seem to have been a misunderstanding, which converted into a certainty a possibility referred to by the president in the course of the interview which he had had with the lawyers immediately after the cases had been called. Such an explanation is substantiated by the word \"envisaged\" employed by the applicant in his letter of 24 January 1985 to the First President of the Court of Appeal, shortly after the impugned judgment had been delivered. There therefore remains the attestation of Mr de Chesse, Mr Pardo\u2019s lawyer; it cannot on its own suffice to establish the facts.",
