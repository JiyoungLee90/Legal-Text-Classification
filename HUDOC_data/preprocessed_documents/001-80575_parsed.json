The actions of the applicant outside the building were undisputed: all that was disputed was the applicant\u2019s intention in raising the hammer, and the Court of Appeal had been able to determine the facts on the basis of the case file. The Government also pointed out that other considerations, including the right to a trial within a reasonable time and the related need for the expeditious handling of the courts\u2019 case-load, had to be taken into account in determining the need for an oral hearing at second instance. Finally they argued that it followed from the domestic legislation that persons, who had no information material to the case, need not be called as witnesses. Considering S.H.\u2019s evidence at the pre-trial stage, it was highly improbable that hearing S.H. would have changed the appellate court\u2019s assessment of the case or that it would have been beneficial to the outcome of the applicant\u2019s appeal.",

The Court\u2019s task is to ascertain whether the proceedings considered as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was taken, was fair (see Schenk v. Switzerland, judgment of 12 July 1988, Series A no. 140, p. 29, \u00a7\u00a046). The Court has held on many occasions that Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(d) does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court. It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a particular witness (Bricmont v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, \u00a7 89, Laukkanen and Manninen v. , no. 50230/99, \u00a7\u00a035, 3\u00a0February\u00a02004). It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Perna v.  [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7\u00a029, ECHR 2003V).",

The publicity requirement is certainly one of the means whereby confidence in the courts is maintained. However, there are other considerations, including the right to trial within a reasonable time and the related need for expeditious handling of the domestic courts\u2019 case-load, which must be taken into account in determining the necessity of a public hearing at stages in the proceedings subsequent to the trial at first instance (Fejde, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031). Provided a public hearing has been held at first instance, the absence of such a hearing before a second or third instance may accordingly be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, although the appellant was not given an opportunity of being heard in person by the appeal or cassation court (Ekbatani, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031).",

It remains to be examined whether a departure from the principle that there should be such a hearing could, in the circumstances of the case, be justified at the appeal stage by the special features of the domestic proceedings viewed as a whole.\u00a0\u00a0In order to decide this question, regard must be had to the nature of the Finnish appeal system, to the scope of the Court of Appeal\u2019s powers and to the manner in which the applicant\u2019s interests were actually presented and protected before the Court of Appeal particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it (see, mutatis mutandis, Ekbatani, p. 13, \u00a7 28).",

In the instant case the appellate court was called upon to examine the case as to both the facts and the law. The applicant denied the facts upon which the charge against him was founded, requesting an oral hearing in order to elucidate the relevant events. The Court of Appeal had to make a full assessment of the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence as the applicant throughout the proceedings had denied any intention of threatening the police officers. For the Court of Appeal the crucial question concerned the credibility of the statements of the persons involved. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal decided, without a public hearing, to confirm the District Court\u2019s conviction. The Court finds that in the circumstances of the instant case the question of the applicant\u2019s intention and the credibility of the statements could not, as a matter of fair trial, have been properly determined without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the applicant and by the police officer M.H.",
