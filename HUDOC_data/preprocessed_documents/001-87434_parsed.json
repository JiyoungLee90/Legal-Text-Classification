However, he lodged appeals against the other decisions extending his detention. He also requested on several occasions that his detention be replaced by a more lenient preventive measure. The Court has already considered that those remedies, namely an appeal against a detention order and/or a request for release, whether submitted to the prosecutor or to the court, depending on the stage of the proceedings, and also an appeal against a decision to extend detention, serve the same purpose under Polish law. Their objective is to secure a review of the lawfulness of detention at any given time of the proceedings, both in their pre-trial and trial stage, and to obtain release if the circumstances of the case no longer justify continued detention (see Iwa\u0144czuk v. Poland (dec.), no. 25196/94, 9\u00a0November 2000, and Wolf v.\u00a0Poland, nos.\u00a015667/03 and 2929/04, \u00a7\u00a078, 16\u00a0January 2007). It follows from the Court\u2019s case-law that the applicant is not required to appeal against each and every decision extending his detention (see, a contrario, Bronk v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 30848/03, 11\u00a0September 2007). Furthermore, the Court considers that the applicant was not required to appeal against all refusals to release him in order to comply with the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies.

The applicant has not advanced any evidence that would establish that the authorities departed from the general rule and failed to summon the lawyer to other sessions at which the applicant\u2019s detention was extended. As to the applicant\u2019s own attendance, the Court reiterates that in cases where characteristics pertaining to an applicant\u2019s personality and level of maturity and reliability are of importance in deciding on his dangerousness, Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a04 requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation (see Waite v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a053236/99, \u00a7\u00a059, 10\u00a0December 2002). On the basis of the material before it the Court considers, however, that in the present case the questions of assessment of the applicant\u2019s character or mental state did not arise. Recalling that it was open to his lawyer to attend, the applicant\u2019s personal attendance at all of the sessions at which his detention had been extended was therefore not required.",
