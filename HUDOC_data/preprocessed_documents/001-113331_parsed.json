Turkey ([GC], 16 September 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 65-69, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 IV): The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies obliges those seeking to bring a case against the State before an international judicial or arbitral organ to use the remedies provided by the national legal system first. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, with which it has close affinity, that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights.",

In reaching this conclusion, the Court has taken into account, inter alia, that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are not theoretical or illusory, but rights that are practical and effective (see, for example, Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24833/94, \u00a7 34, ECHR 1999-I), that a matter as sensitive as the maintenance of a minor was at stake, and that various aspects of that matter were the subject of examination in three different sets of proceedings.",

Irrespective of the categorisation of the legal ground for such a denial of examination, the essential ground for it was that the applicants had failed to supply an actual address for the defendant. This reason however does not appear tenable because, in the same judgment, that is to say in the judgment of 19 June 2008, the District Court issued a maintenance order against A. for the period after the first judgment.
