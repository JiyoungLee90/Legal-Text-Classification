The investigation in case no.\u00a032000 was instituted on 6 January 2003, that is, four days after Abubakar and Salman Bantayev\u2019s abduction. While this delay, in itself, was not very long, the Court, having regard to the absence of any explanations by the Government in this respect, cannot accept that it was justified in a situation where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were delayed and were eventually taken only after the communication of the complaint to the respondent Government, or not at all. For instance, the Court notes that, for the first two months of the investigation, the investigators had questioned only one witness to the abduction (see paragraph 39 above) and one witness who had provided generic information about the disappeared men (see paragraph 40 above). The second witness to the abduction of the Bantayev brothers was questioned more than a year after the events (see paragraph 43 above) and the other three witnesses of the abduction were questioned only in August 2007, that is, more than four and a half years after the events and only after the communication of the application to the respondent Government (see paragraph 46 above). The investigators had failed to take such essential steps as identification or questioning of the Russian federal servicemen who had manned the checkpoints in the village of Komsomolskoye on the night of abduction; questioning of the servicemen of the military commander\u2019s office which had been located in the vicinity of the houses of the Bantayev brothers; establishing the owner of the UAZ vehicles that had moved around the village on the night of 2 January 2003; establishing whether any special operations had been carried out in the village of Komsomolskoye on the night in question; identification and questioning of the servicemen who had carried out the operation in the village of Komsomolskoye and could have been involved in the detention of Abubakar and Salman Bantayev. \u00a0It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",

They were the sons of the first applicant; Abubakar Bantayev was the husband of the second applicant and the father of the fourth, sixth, seventh and eleventh applicants; Salman Bantayev was the husband of the third applicant and the father of the fifth, eighth, ninth and tenth applicants. For more than five years the applicants have not had any news of their close relatives. During this period the applicants have applied to various official bodies with enquiries about their family members, both in writing and in person. Despite their attempts, the applicants have never received any plausible explanation or information as to what became of their family members following their kidnapping. The responses received by the applicants mostly denied that the State was responsible for their arrest or simply informed them that an investigation was ongoing. The Court\u2019s findings under the procedural aspect of Article 2 are also of direct relevance here.",

At the same time the Court notes that the ninth applicant was born in August 2003, more than seven months after Salman Bantayev\u2019s disappearance. Having regard to this the Court does not find that this applicant has suffered such distress and anguish as a result of the disappearance of her father that it would amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.",
