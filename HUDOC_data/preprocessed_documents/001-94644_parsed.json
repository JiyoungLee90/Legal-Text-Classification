The court ordered the applicants to publish apologies as\u00a0sought in the statement of claim and to pay PLN 10,000 to a charity. The applicants were also ordered to pay the plaintiffs PLN 11,500 to reimburse the costs of the proceedings. The court considered that the cartoon in\u00a0question had breached the personal rights of the plaintiff and discredited the products of the company. The words used by the applicants had an\u00a0unambiguous meaning relating to disgust and repulsion and were strongly pejorative. Accordingly, the court concluded that the applicants had overstepped the threshold of permissible criticism, in particular in\u00a0a\u00a0magazine aimed at children. The court dismissed the applicants\u2019 arguments that the cartoon had aimed to criticise the advertising campaign run by Star Foods and not their product. It considered that such an attack on the plaintiff\u2019s personal rights could not have been justified even by\u00a0the\u00a0argument that their campaign was ill-considered.",

It agreed with the lower court\u2019s assessment that the critical statement had not concerned the style of\u00a0advertisement adopted by Star Foods. Calling the product of the company \u201cmuck\u201d was surely not a critical assessment of their advertising campaign but had been aimed at the product, the brand, and the good name of the company. The statement in question \u201cI would be a murderer too if I ate this muck\u201d contained an obviously negative assessment of the taste and quality of the product. Thus, the applicants\u2019 action aimed to discredit, without justified grounds, the product of Star Foods and as such could not enjoy the benefit of legal protection. The appellate court also observed that the applicants had repeatedly relied on the interests of children to justify their actions, while they themselves had repeated, in the supplement for children, the slogan that in their opinion had had a negative impact on children\u2019s emotions and had terrified them.",
