A clear pattern of physical ill-treatment of prisoners by custodial staff emerged. The ill-treatment alleged consisted essentially of kicks, punches and truncheon blows to various parts of the body (excluding the face). The ill-treatment was said to have been inflicted principally in the central corridor of the detention facility, usually when prisoners were taken to an investigator's room for questioning or when they were returned to their cells after such questioning; apparently, prisoners were also on occasion physically ill-treated in the investigators' rooms. Investigators were said to have been fully aware of the ill treatment being inflicted, and some prisoners affirmed that it was inflicted at their instigation. In certain cases, the delegation has gathered medical evidence which is consistent with the allegations of ill-treatment made by the prisoners concerned.",

The CPT's delegation found a palpable climate of fear; many people who had been ill-treated and others who knew about such offences were reluctant to file complaints to the authorities.

If no remedies are available or if they are judged to be ineffective, the six-month period in principle runs from the date of the act complained of (see Hazar and Others v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 62566/00 et seq., 10 January 2002). Special considerations may apply in exceptional cases where an applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances which make that remedy ineffective. In such a situation, the six-month period may be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware, or should have become aware, of those circumstances (see Bulut and Yavuz v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no. 73065/01, 28 May 2002).",

This avenue, however, had proved futile, as despite their very serious and detailed allegations, corroborated with medical documents, the authorities had remained passive and failed to act with sufficient dispatch and diligence in response to their complaints. No investigation had taken place and their complaints had been rejected without proper examination. Moreover, the authorities had refused to grant them access to the documents in the file or even to provide them with a copy of the decision of 7 January 2002, referring to the provisions of the old procedural legislation, even though at the moment of their request new legislation had been in force which granted them the possibility of receiving a copy of that decision.

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used.

However, the Court cannot see any particular circumstances preventing the applicants from applying, either personally, or through their relatives or the SRJI, to courts once they became operational, given in particular that the complaints concerning the searches and seizure were mostly brought on behalf of the Chitayev family by the applicants' father and brother. The latter, for instance, applied repeatedly to law-enforcement agencies in connection with the searches and seizure not only in 2000 but in 2001-2002 as well (see paragraphs 51, 53 and 60).

The applicants insisted that they had been held incommunicado, had had no access to legal advice and therefore had been unable effectively to appeal against their detention. They also stated that they had only been allowed to meet their lawyer once in the presence of the guards, when they had been ordered to speak Russian and only to talk about their physical condition.

In this latter respect the Government stressed that since 25 April 2000 the applicants had been assisted by a lawyer and had been provided with legal information.

In that context, it has repeatedly stressed that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. To minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5 (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7\u00a0104, ECHR 1999IV).",

The provision does not deal with other remedies which may serve to review the lawfulness of a period of detention which has already ended (see Slivenko v.
