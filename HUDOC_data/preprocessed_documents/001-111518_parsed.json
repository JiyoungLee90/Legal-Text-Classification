In August 1991 the workers\u2019 council of the company adopted a decision on the issuance of internal shares to the company\u2019s employees as part of its reorganisation from a socially owned company into a joint-stock company under the applicable regulations. It was decided that one third of the employees\u2019 salaries would be allocated towards instalment payments for the internal shares to be issued to them. On 30 March 1993 the company\u2019s management board issued a series of resolutions authorising retention of earnings that resulted in an increase in the company\u2019s internal share capital. As a result of these board resolutions, the internal share capital amounted to 80.9% of the company\u2019s total share capital (the remainder being held by the State). The reorganisation process continued until August 1994, when the management of the company was taken over by the State following armed conflict in the north-western part of Bosnia and Herzegovina (where Velika Kladu\u0161a is located) during the 1992-95 war. Following the State taking control of the company, the applicants were effectively unable to exercise any of their rights as shareholders, although the company continued to state the privately-held internal share capital allotted to its employees on its annual balance sheets, as well as the State-owned capital, until 30 June 1999.",

The decision on the results of the renewed Revsar audit of 7\u00a0March 2001, which cancelled all internal shares in favour of state capital in Agrokomerc, deprived the applicants of these protected possessions. In addition, by exercising effective exclusive control over the management of Agrokomerc, the authorities of the Federation further interfered with the rights of the applicants to participate in the management and to share in the profits of Agrokomerc in relation to their paid internal shares. In these respects the Federation did not act \u201csubject to the conditions provided by law\u201d.

The Chamber imposed interim measures and ordered the authorities to take steps to provide appropriate redress in respect of the violations found; this implied a complicated procedure of international audit in order to determine the value of the applicants\u2019 shares in \u201cAgrokomerc\u201d and to enter their names in the register of shareholders. It is not contested that these steps were undertaken shortly after the decision and were completed by 29 October 2007, when the applicants\u2019 rights as shareholders were registered with the national Securities Commission, nor that the applicants exercised their rights as shareholders effectively thereafter. On 15 January 2009, several months prior to communication of the applicants\u2019 complaints by the Court, the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2013 responsible for supervising execution of the decisions of the Human Rights Chamber (see paragraph 18) \u2013 confirmed that it had been fully implemented. In my understanding, this was sufficient to conclude that the matters concerning enforcement of the decision were resolved, at the latest, on 29\u00a0October 2007. The grounds on which the applicants contest the full implementation of the impugned decision were not specified (see paragraph 21).",

In my opinion, it should not be overlooked that, in contrast to those cases, which concerned failure or delay in the payment of specific amounts, the present case involved far more complicated enforcement steps, such as an international audit for the purposes of determining the applicant\u2019s shares in a company - a process which no doubt entails \u201csomewhat complex financial and legal actions\u201d in all legal systems. In the instant case this process also involved difficulties in connection with missing or destroyed documents, and absent or improperly kept records from the war period (see paragraph 29). In the absence of any specific inaction or delay in enforcement for which the authorities were responsible, these difficulties are serious enough to explain the impugned five-year delay in implementation of the decision of the Human Rights Chamber. This situation should be distinguished from that examined in the cases cited in paragraph 29, where non-enforcement resulted from legislative amendments adopted to avoid, modify or at least delay the enforcement of final decisions ordering the payment of specified amounts to the affected individuals. In my view these differences suffice to find no violation of the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 6 and Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01.",

This issue should be distinguished from the question whether the applicants were entitled to any compensation for the subsequent delay in the enforcement of the impugned decision. It appears that in this regard the scope of the applicants\u2019 case as registered before the Court differed from that under parallel examination by the  in supervising enforcement of the Human Rights Chamber\u2019s decision. One can only regret that, having reached the Court in 2005, the applicants\u2019 complaints under the Convention were communicated to the respondent Government only after the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 2009, which was not called to rule on the reasonableness of the delay in implementation of the Human Rights Chamber\u2019s decision as adopted in 2002, but only on its completeness.",
