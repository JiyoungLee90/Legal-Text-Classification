The aggregated length of delays occasioned by the courts\u2019 failure to make the text of their judgments or decisions available to the applicant amounted to approximately one year and five months (for example, the applicant only received a copy of the judgment of 14 June 2001 on 18\u00a0September 2002).

Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases with a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v.
