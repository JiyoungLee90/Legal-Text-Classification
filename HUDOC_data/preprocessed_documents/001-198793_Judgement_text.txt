The case originated in 22 applications (Mr Sergey Aghanyan and 21 others (“the applicants”) – see the appended table) against the Republic of Armenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by 22 Armenian nationals on the dates indicated in the appended table.
The applicants were represented by Mr P. Muzny, Mr A. Carbonneau and Mr A. Martirosyan, lawyers practising in Strasbourg, Paris and Yerevan respectively. The Armenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Kirakosyan, Representative of the Republic of Armenia before the European Court of Human Rights.
On 13 December 2018 the Government were given notice of the complaints concerning the alleged breach of the applicants’ right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicants’ details are set out in the appended table.
The applicants are all Jehovah’s Witnesses who were convicted on various dates in 2012 after refusing to perform both military and alternative civilian service, alleging that the latter was not of genuinely civilian nature and that it contradicted their conscience. The applicants complained that the criminal proceedings against them and their convictions violated their rights guaranteed under Article 9 of the Convention.
The relevant domestic law and international documents are summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Adyan and Others v. Armenia (no. 75604/11, §§ 27-48, 12 October 2017).
