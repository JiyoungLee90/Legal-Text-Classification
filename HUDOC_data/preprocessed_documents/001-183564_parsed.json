Litigants must also take appropriate measures to ensure effective receipt of correspondence the domestic courts may send them (see Perihan and Mezopotamya Bas\u0131n Yay\u0131n A.\u015e. v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a021377/03, \u00a7\u00a038, 21\u00a0January 2014; Boyko v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a017382/04, 23\u00a0October 2007; and Darnay v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a036524/97, Commission decision of 16\u00a0April 1998). Moreover, the Court has noted that a lack or deficiency of reasons in domestic decisions as regards the proof of receipt of summonses by the applicants, as well as the domestic courts\u2019 failure to assess the necessity to adjourn hearings pending the applicants\u2019 proper notification or to delve on the nature of their legal claims which could have rendered the applicants\u2019 presence unnecessary cannot be made up ex post facto in the Court proceedings, for it cannot take the place of the national courts which had the evidence before them (see Gankin and Others, nos.\u00a02430/06 and 3\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-42, 31\u00a0May 2016).",
