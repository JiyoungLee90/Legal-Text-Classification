However, the limitations applied cannot restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired (see, inter alia, Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a042527/98, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 2001VIII).\u00a0\u00a0The compatibility of the limitations permitted under domestic law with the right of access to a court set forth in Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention depends on the special features of the proceedings in issue, and it is necessary to take into account the whole of the trial conducted according to the rules of the domestic legal system and the role played in that trial by the highest court, since the conditions of admissibility of an appeal on points of law may be more rigorous than those for an ordinary appeal (Delcourt v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 17\u00a0January 1970, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a011, p.\u00a015, \u00a7 26).",

Subsequently, the applicant requested that a legalaid lawyer be assigned to the case for the purpose of drafting an appeal to the Supreme Court against this procedural decision. The court dismissed his request. The applicant reiterated his request to obtain legal aid which was ultimately dismissed, the court indicating that the applicant had already hired a lawyer.
