It would appear from the applicant\u2019s statements that he has been ill-treated both during arrest and after being brought to the police station. Since he was at all times under the control of the police, the Court does not consider it necessary to distinguish between the injuries allegedly received during arrest and/or at the police station (see Corsacov v. Moldova, no.\u00a018944/02, \u00a7 56, 4 April 2006). The Government provided an explanation only in respect of the scratches on the applicant\u2019s face but not the rest of the injuries, such as the broken arm and the bruises to his chest and ribs. The statements of some of the witnesses which were favourable to the accused police officers appear to have been contradictory to the position of the police officers themselves. Thus, while the officers submitted that they had applied special fighting techniques in order to curb the applicant\u2019s resistance, the witnesses submitted that there had been no violence at all on the part of the police officers and that the applicant had only scratched his face against a concrete fence. The submissions of the police officers concerning curbing the resistance by the applicant are also inconsistent with the finding of the domestic authorities that the applicant did not resist the police officers (see paragraph 9 above). By contrast, the injuries to the applicant\u2019s body appear to be more consistent with his account of the events and with that of witness I.R. rather than with the account of the police officers and the other witnesses.",

The Court further notes that the applicant\u2019s complaint to the effect that the accused police officers made attempts to influence a witness have been disregarded. Moreover, the investigators did not try to reconcile the accounts of the witnesses which were favourable to the accused police officers and those of the police officers themselves. Here the Court recalls that while the former stated that there had been no violence at all with relation to the applicant, the latter admitted to having used special fighting techniques on the applicant. After making such statements, the accused police officers were not even asked what those techniques consisted of and whether they had involved any kicks or punches to the applicant\u2019s body.\u00a0Finally, the Court notes that there was no opportunity for the applicant to confront the accused police officers.",
