He pleaded that the incriminated news commentary did not fall within the scope of section 8 of the 1991 Act. He maintained that arguing and commenting on possible activities in which the PKK might engage during the Newroz celebrations could not be regarded as publishing a declaration of a terrorist organisation within the meaning of section 6 of the 1991 Act. As regards his freedom of expression, the applicant referred to Article 10 of the Convention and the case-law of the Commission and the Court. He stated that pluralism of opinion was essential in a democratic society including opinions which shock or offend. He argued that the provisions of sections 6 and 8 of the 1991 Act restricted freedom of expression in contravention of the Turkish Constitution and the criteria laid down in the case-law of the Commission and the Court.",

While the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, for the protection of vital interests of the state such as national security or territorial integrity against the threat of violence or the prevention of disorder or crime, it is nevertheless incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on political issues, including divisive ones. Not only has the press the task of imparting such information and ideas; the public has a right to receive them.

Furthermore, the limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion. Moreover, the dominant position which the government occupies makes it necessary for it to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of its adversaries. Nevertheless it certainly remains open to the competent State authorities to adopt, in their capacity as guarantors of public order, measures, even of a criminal-law nature, intended to react appropriately and without excess to such remarks (see the Incal v. Turkey judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1567, \u00a7\u00a054). Finally, where such remarks incite to violence against an individual or a public official or a sector of the population, the State authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation when examining the need for an interference with freedom of expression.",

Admittedly, the text states that \u201cit is time to settle accounts\u201d. However, in the Court\u2019s view this reference must be seen in the context of the overall literary and metaphorical tone of the article and not as an appeal to violence. It is true also that the impugned interview (see paragraph 13 above) contained hard-hitting criticism of the Turkish authorities such as the statement that \u201cthe real terrorist is the Republic of Turkey\u201d. For the Court, however, this is more a reflection of the hardened attitude of one side to the conflict, rather than a call to violence. In fact, the declaration in the same paragraph that the ERNK (see paragraph 12 above) was \u201copen to any humanitarian, political solution, including the calls for an armistice\u201d can even be considered conciliatory in tone. On the whole, the content of the articles cannot be construed as being capable of inciting to further violence. The Court is of course mindful of the concern of the authorities about words or deeds which have the potential to exacerbate the security situation in the region, where since approximately 1985 serious disturbances have raged between the security forces and the members of the \nPKK involving a very heavy loss of life and the imposition of emergency rule in much of the region (see the above-mentioned Zana judgment, p.\u00a02539, \u00a7 10). However, it would appear to the Court that the domestic authorities in the instant case failed to have sufficient regard to the public\u2019s right to be informed of a different perspective on the situation in south-east Turkey, irrespective of how unpalatable that perspective may be for them. As noted previously, the views expressed in the articles cannot be read as an incitement to violence; nor could they be construed as liable to incite to violence. In the Court\u2019s view the reasons given by the Istanbul National Security Court for convicting and sentencing the applicant (see paragraph\u00a018 above), although relevant, cannot be considered sufficient to justify the interference with his right to freedom of expression.",

On the other hand, the Court found that certain aspects of these judges\u2019 status made their independence and impartiality questionable (ibid., \u00a7 68): for example, the fact that they are servicemen who still belong to the army, which in turn takes its orders from the executive; the fact that they remain subject to military discipline; and the fact that decisions pertaining to their appointment are to a great extent taken by the administrative authorities and the army (see paragraphs 32 to 34 above).",

In other words, the applicant\u2019s fears as to that court\u2019s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified. The proceedings in the Court of Cassation were not able to dispel these fears since that court did not have full jurisdiction (see the above-mentioned Incal judgment, p. 1573, \u00a7 72 in fine).",

I therefore find that there has been no violation of Article 10 in the present case. The article entitled \u201cKawa and Dehak once again\u201d contained, inter alia, passages such as \u201c[t]he tradition of rebellion is awakened\u201d and \u201c[i]s is time to settle accounts\u201d. In addition, the article noted that a year earlier allegations had been published that \u201c[b]ombs are raining on Kurdish villages and mountains\u201d, \u201c[t]he Chief of the General Staff has inspected the preparations for the offensive\u201d and [th]e Head of [the] intelligence agency talks of the prospect of much blood being shed\u201d. Further, the article intimated that it was possible that in 1993, \u201c[u]nlike previous years, the PKK-leaning Kurdistan National Assembly (KUM) [wa]s also expected to take on a role during Newroz...\u201d (see paragraphs 11 and 13 of the judgment). In my view, the quoted passages can objectively be construed as an incitement to hatred and violence.
