The case originated in an application (no. 27307/04) against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Risto Goreski (“the first applicant”), Ms Gordana Adži-Spirkoska (“the second applicant”), Mr Strašo Gorgieski (“the third applicant”) and Ms Ilinka Ivanoska (“the fourth applicant”). The application was lodged on 12 July 2004. All applicants are Macedonian nationals. The first and fourth applicants died on 23 August 2010 and 22 April 2006 respectively. Ms Pandora Trenkovska and Ms Verka Petkovska, the daughters of the first applicant, and Ms Vera Ivanoska, the daughter of the fourth applicant, have applied to continue the application in the name of their late predecessors and designated the same counsel to represent them.
The second applicant, a qualified lawyer from Prilep, was granted leave to represent the first, third and fourth applicants. The Macedonian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their former Agent, Mrs R. Lazareska Gerovska, succeeded subsequently by their present Agent, Mr K. Bogdanov.
On 10 November 2010 the application was communicated to the respondent Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
On 1 February 2011 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) and this case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1). In accordance with Protocol No. 14, the application was allocated to a Committee of three Judges.
The applicants were born in 1929, 1952, 1956 and 1949 respectively. The second and third applicants live in Prilep.
On 12 September 2000 the applicants initiated restitution proceedings. On 20 July 2001 they lodged a “silence of administration” appeal. After one remittal, on 5 October 2005 the Restitution Commission dismissed their claim to have the property restored into their possession and awarded them compensation instead. The type of compensation (видот на надоместокот) was to be decided with a separate decision (дополнително решение). On 12 December 2008 the Administrative Court finally upheld the restitution order. On 23 February 2008 the applicants were requested to specify the type of compensation, which on 3 March 2009 they refused to do until, according to them, the Court would decide their case.
