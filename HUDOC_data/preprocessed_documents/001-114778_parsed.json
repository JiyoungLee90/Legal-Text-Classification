In this respect the Court would reiterate that an applicant cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the remedies afforded by national law in the defence of his interests (see Nankov v. \u201cthe \u201d, no. 26541/02, \u00a7\u00a047, 29 November 2007).",

As to the applicant\u2019s withdrawal of the paternity petition, the Court considers that it has to be viewed in the light of all the circumstances of the present case, and in particular of the fact that the applicant had wanted to have the proceedings before the Z. Municipal Court concluded as soon as possible, because he had an interest in obtaining a divorce on account of his marriage plans. In any event the Court considers that it cannot justify the overall length of the proceedings as the Government suggested, since Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of the requirements of that provision, including the obligation to hear cases brought by the applicants within a reasonable time (see S\u00fcrmeli v.

The Court also notes that the Croatian legal system adheres to the principle of monogamy, and does not allow individuals who are already married to conclude another marriage. Therefore, a failure on the part of the domestic authorities to conduct divorce proceedings with the required urgency may impair the right to marry of an individual who has, for example, sought to have his previous marriage dissolved in order to marry again, or who has acquired a serious and genuine opportunity to remarry after he had instituted divorce proceedings.",

At a hearing held on 10 July 2006 the applicant asked that the divorce proceedings be joined to those where he contested his paternity of K, which was granted. However, he subsequently requested the domestic courts on more than one occasion that a partial judgment be adopted in these proceedings on divorce (see paragraphs 13, 19, 27, 32, 35, 38 and 51 above), and that other issues related to the divorce proceedings be decided on separately. In this connection the Court notes that the domestic system provides for a partial judgment in cases when there is an agreement between the parties concerning a separate issue in the proceedings. The Court also notes that there is nothing in the domestic law that would suggest that this provision could not have been applied in the applicant\u2019s case. However, the domestic courts either dismissed without giving any reasons or ignored the applicant\u2019s request for a partial judgment for more than five years, during which the proceedings were pending before the first-instance court.",
