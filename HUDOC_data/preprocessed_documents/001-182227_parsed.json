The City Court held that the two-hour adjournment granted by the District Court had been sufficient for studying the prosecution file consisting of 153\u00a0pages. Most of the file consisted of procedural documents concerning issues relating to the institution of the criminal proceedings, the extension of the time-limit for the investigation, the joinder of criminal cases, and documents which had been previously handed to the applicant. Besides, all these documents had been examined in the hearing on 24 August 2010. As regards the applicant\u2019s complaint as to his inability to have a confidential exchange with his lawyer before the hearing of 24 August 2010, the City Court held that the applicant and his lawyer had been given the opportunity to communicate in the courtroom. However, they had refused to communicate in such conditions. This did not amount to a breach of the applicant\u2019s right to defence, because the applicant\u2019s lawyer could have had a confidential meeting with the applicant in the remand prison without any restrictions, and they could have developed their defence position beforehand. In any event, the hearing could not have been adjourned until 25\u00a0August 2010, since the time-limit for the applicant\u2019s detention had been due to expire on 24 August 2010, and therefore the decision on the preventive measure had had to be taken before then.

As regards the alleged violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention on account of the detention hearing of 24 August 2010, they submitted that on 20 and 23 August the hearings had been adjourned at the request of the applicant\u2019s lawyer until the last day of the applicant\u2019s detention, 24 August 2010. Besides, taking into account the number of documents submitted to the District Court by the prosecution and the fact that the defence had already been familiar with most of them, a two-hour adjournment of the hearing had been sufficient for the applicant\u2019s lawyer to prepare her submissions. Furthermore, the prosecution\u2019s arguments for extending the applicant\u2019s detention had been substantially the same in the course of the proceedings, and had not required lengthy preparatory work on the part of the defence. In so far as the applicant complained that he had had no opportunity to have a confidential exchange with his lawyer prior to the hearing of 24\u00a0August 2010, the Government submitted that, since there had been no room designed for private communication between an accused and his lawyer at the courthouse, the only opportunity which the applicant had had to communicate with his lawyer had been in the courtroom, which the applicant had refused. Taking into account the fact that the hearing of 24\u00a0August 2010 had not come as a surprise for the defence, it was not clear why the applicant\u2019s lawyer had not communicated with the applicant at an earlier stage at the remand prison. Furthermore, since no pivotal questions in the proceedings against the applicant had been decided during the hearing of 24\u00a0August 2010, the applicant\u2019s limited opportunity to communicate with his lawyer was unlikely to have affected its outcome. There had therefore been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention on that account.",

The applicant\u2019s lawyer should have been aware of the provisions of Article 108 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provided that detention proceedings could be conducted in the absence of a party (except for an accused) who had been properly notified of a hearing but who failed to inform the court of any reasonable excuse for their failure to appear.

Therefore, the two-hour adjournment granted by the District Court so that the applicant\u2019s newly appointed lawyer could study the prosecution file, which was not particularly large or complex (see paragraphs 14 and 57 above), was prompted by the urgency of the situation, and in the Court\u2019s view this did not by itself amount to a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",

However, the applicant waived his right to do so by refusing to communicate with his lawyer in such conditions. In the absence of any specific allegations to the effect that there were reasonable grounds to believe that their conversation might be overheard, the Court considers that this situation did not give rise to a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention either (compare to Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no. 5829/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0230-32, 31\u00a0May 2011).",
