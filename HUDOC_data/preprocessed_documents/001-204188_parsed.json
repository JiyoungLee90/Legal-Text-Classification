As a basis for the calculation of his pension (in respect of his average remuneration over the final five years of his working life), the INPS employed a theoretical level of remuneration (\u201cretribuzione teorica\u201d) instead of the actual remuneration (\u201cretribuzione effettiva\u201d). The former resulted in a readjustment on the basis of the existing ratio between the social security contributions paid in, respectively, Switzerland (8%) and in Italy (32.7%), which meant that the calculation had as its basis a notional salary, which, according to S.B., led him to receive a pension equal to one fourth of the pension he should have received.",

Proceedings before the Court of Cassation are in fact uniquely aimed at the solution of legal questions to which only the lawyer of the party in question, and not the party, can make his or her technical contribution (contributo tecnico) (Court of Cassation judgment no. 20004 of 2005).
