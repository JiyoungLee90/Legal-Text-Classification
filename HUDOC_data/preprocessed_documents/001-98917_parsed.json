Moreover, the gendarmes had failed to resort to alternative methods to catch her.

This conclusion makes it unnecessary for the Court to establish whether the force used by the gendarmes had been absolutely necessary and justified under Article 2 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. The Court's examination of the applicants' complaint will therefore be limited to ascertaining whether or not the national authorities have afforded appropriate and sufficient redress for the violation.
