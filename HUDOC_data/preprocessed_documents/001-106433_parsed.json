Furthermore, the domestic courts failed to examine the option of an investigation by the domestic authorities on their own motion of such an unlawful act allegedly committed by D.C. against his son, as provided for by Article 180 \u00a7 3 of the Romanian Criminal Code. Lastly, while the authorities relied in their arguments in dismissing the criminal proceedings against D.C. also on the results of the lie-detector test administered to the first applicant, a test which indicated dissimulated behaviour on her behalf in respect of key questions (see paragraph 34) which raised some suspicion in respect of her potential involvement in the abuse committed against her son, they failed to consider such a hypothesis and examine whether a criminal investigation could have been opened against the first applicant.",

Therefore, regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole, and the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in regard to both elements (see Hokkanen v.\u00a0Finland, 23\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A 299-A). In this sphere, the Court\u2019s review is not limited to ascertaining whether a respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith. In addition, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court cannot confine itself to considering the impugned decisions in isolation, but must look at them in the light of the case as a whole: it must determine whether the reasons adduced to justify the interferences at issue are relevant and sufficient (see\u00a0Olsson (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7 68).",

As the Court has previously observed, taking a child into care should normally be regarded as a temporary measure to be discontinued as soon as circumstances permit and any measures of implementation of temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the biological parent(s) and the child. In this regard, a fair balance has to be struck between the interests of the child in remaining in public care and those of a parent in being reunited with the child. In carrying out this balancing exercise, the Court will attach particular importance to the best interests of the child, which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parent. In particular, a parent cannot be entitled under Article 8 of the Convention to have such measures taken as would harm the child\u2019s health and development (see Johansen v. , 7 August 1996, \u00a7 78, Reports 1996-III).",

It also notes that the available testimonial and expert evidence showed that the meetings between D.C. and his son had been normal and that the child was happy every time he saw his father. Moreover, D.C. had not been sentenced by final court judgments for any violent or otherwise unlawful acts committed against his son and it appears that because of Ms M.\u2019s conduct he had had restricted access to his child and had found it difficult to preserve personal ties with his son, even without having his contact rights further limited by the domestic courts. Finally, the Court takes into consideration the policy which was pursued in the present case to preserve the right of the divorced parent who had not been entrusted custody of the child to maintain personal ties with the child (see paragraph 79 above).",
