In an ex nunc decision of 11 February 2009 the court declared that provision unconstitutional, finding that although the State had a certain margin of appreciation in defining the public interest, it could not exercise it in a manifestly unreasonable way. In this connection it considered it insufficient that the Act simply enumerated the objects whose construction was regarded as being in the public interest. It further stated that the construction of objects in the interest of private persons, as defined in urban plans, could not always be construed as being in the public interest. Relying on Articles 8 \u00a7 1 (6) and 30 of the Constitution, it concluded that the State could expropriate a property only after other less restrictive measures, such as a long-term lease or concession (\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0458\u0430), had been exhausted.

Despite the margin of appreciation given to the State the Court must, in the exercise of its power of review, determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant\u2019s right to property (see Rosinski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 17373/02, \u00a7 78, 17 July 2007). The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as a whole, including therefore the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v.

In this connection, their main objection was that section 6 of the Act (see paragraph 26 above) had provided for a lease in cases of research into and exploitation of mineral resources, as was their case. The domestic authorities failed to address this complaint, which was central to the application before the Court. They did not explain whether, and if so, how, the seizure of the applicants\u2019 land, as the most drastic measure, had been proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved. Neither the domestic authorities nor the Government in the proceedings before the Court gave any reason why a lease, as less restrictive for the applicants\u2019 property rights, was inappropriate in their case, although domestic legislation provided for such a possibility and which through subsequent jurisprudence became a requirement (see, mutatis mutandis, Visti\u0146\u0161 and Perepjolkins v.

The Court is aware that under national law the mineral water to be exploited from the applicants\u2019 property is a State-owned public commodity. Nevertheless, when exploited for commercial purposes the present case shows that this may bring a profit to the owner of the plot concerned.
