She submitted that between 2002 and 2007 she had regularly visited her father and talked to him on the telephone and that, at a later stage, her health had prevented her from visiting him. Telephone calls had been impossible with regard to her father\u2019s health. The retirement home where her father had lived had been in possession of her address and telephone number and it had telephoned her on several occasions (see paragraph 7 above). In her appeal to the Munich Court of Appeal the applicant argued that the application of the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) Act would discriminate against her and breach her inheritance rights and was therefore not in conformity with the Basic Law (see paragraph 11 above). Thus, even though it is true that the applicant did not explicitly refer to Article 8 of the Convention in her initial application of 14\u00a0January 2009 to the Memmingen District Court, she named facts establishing not only biological parentage, but also personal ties with her father.

The Court notes in this connection that it has previously considered, in the particular circumstances of several cases, that domestic remedies had been exhausted for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention despite the fact that the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint had been dismissed as inadmissible, as the substance of the complaint had been sufficiently raised before the Federal Constitutional Court (see, inter alia, Uhl v.

Furthermore, she visited him and his wife between 1954 and 1959 once a year (compare Brauer, cited above, \u00a7 44). After she had left the GDR and moved to Bavaria, those visits continued on a regular basis until the applicant\u2019s health prevented them. Thus the applicant was not a descendant whose existence was unknown to her father\u2019s wife (compare Fabris, cited above, \u00a7 68).",

It takes note of the Government\u2019s argument on that point (see paragraph 40 above) according to which that decision had to be respected. Nevertheless, it would appear that even in the eyes of the national authorities the expectations of a sole heir are not protected in all circumstances, as a will such as the one in question does not exclude the right of children born inside marriage and of children born outside marriage after the cut-off date of 1 July 1949 to a statutory share of a deceased\u2019s estate. That fact must have had a bearing on the expectations of the father\u2019s wife about succeeding to establish undisputed rights to the estate.",

The Court notes that the applicant brought inheritance-related claims before the domestic courts in 2009, directly after her father\u2019s death. The proceedings the applicant brought were still pending before the Federal Constitutional Court at the time of the delivery of the judgment in Brauer (cited above), in which this Court found that inequality of inheritance rights on the grounds of birth outside marriage was incompatible with the Convention in a case comparable to that of the applicant. That was sufficient to arouse justified doubts as to whether the applicant would be excluded from any claims to her father\u2019s estate (compare Fabris, cited above, \u00a7 69).",
