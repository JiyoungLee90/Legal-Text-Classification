Ka\u010dapor (cited above), which are applicable in the context of enterprises predominantly consisting of socially-owned capital, and finds that in this particular context it is irrelevant whether the insolvency proceedings were initiated before or after the entry into force of the Convention, since the insolvency proceedings continued after the ratification, and are yet to be completed (see also Mar\u010di\u0107, cited above). In addition, the Court notes that throughout the insolvency proceedings, until the company was sold, it had been registered as fully socially owned.

The fact that the judgment of 18 November 2002 failed to emphasise the obligation of payment of the applicant\u2019s claim is of no consequence to the existence of the claim itself \u2013 this very judgment confirms that the company owes to the applicant a precisely established amount of money, together with interest to be calculated from a precise date, as well as any applicable social contributions.
