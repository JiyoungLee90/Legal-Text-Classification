The cases originated in three separate applications (nos. 44184/05, 22250/06 and 37182/07) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Bulgarian nationals, Mr Aleksandar Lyubomirov Nikolov (application no. 44184/05), Mr Vasil Milutinov Vasilev (application no. 22250/06) and Mr Emil Stanoev Rekarski (application no. 37182/07) (“the applicants”), on 18 November 2005, 20 May 2006 and 15 August 2007 respectively. Mr Rekarski was represented before the Court by Mr N. Teoharov, a lawyer practising in .
The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs N. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 9 February 2010 the applications were joined and communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 § 1 of the Convention).
The applicants, Mr Aleksandar Nikolov, born in 1957, Mr Vasil Vasilev, born in 1960, and Mr Emil Rekarski, born in 1941, are Bulgarian nationals.
On 7 February 2001 Mr Nikolov initiated proceedings for unlawful dismissal before the Pernik District Court. The court held hearings on 27 February, 15 March and 3 April 2001. In a judgment of 2 May 2001 it found in favour of Mr Nikolov and reinstated him.

In a judgment of 27 March 2003 the  quashed the lower court’s judgment in respect of the damages awarded and upheld the remainder.
On 20 May 2003 the applicant’s former employer filed a cassation appeal. In a decision of 18 November 2005 the SCC discontinued the cassation proceedings as the employer had not paid the relevant court fee. This decision was not appealed against and on 23 December 2005 the judgment of 3 April 2002 became final.
Mr Vasilev was reinstated on 8 February 2006. However, he could not take up his duties as while the proceedings were pending his contract had expired and had not been prolonged.
On 8 January 2003 Mr Rekarski instituted proceedings for unlawful dismissal before the Sofia District Court. In a judgment of 14 July 2003 the court found in favour of Mr Rekarski and reinstated him. On appeal by the employer, in a judgment of 23 April 2004 the Sofia City Court upheld the previous court’s judgment.
The employer instituted cassation proceedings. The SCC upheld the lower courts’ judgments in a final judgment of 27 April 2007.
The relevant provisions in respect of remedies for delays in civil proceedings have been summarised in paragraphs 35-55 in the Court’s judgment in the case of Finger v. Bulgaria (no. 37346/05, 10 May 2011).
Unlike the Code of Civil Procedure of 1952, the Code of Civil Procedure of 2008 does not provide for an automatic cassation appeal in employment disputes over dismissal from office. Under the latter Code the lower-instance courts’ judgments are subject to cassation appeal only in cases which raise issues that have been adjudicated contrary to the settled practice of the SCC, in respect of which there was divergence in the practice of the lower courts, or which are of particular importance for the application of the legislation or the evolution of the legal doctrine and practice (Article 280). The employment disputes initiated before the entry into force of the new Code and pending before the SCC at that time were transferred to the Courts of Appeal, which would examine them as final instance courts.
All applicants complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the proceedings connected to their dismissal were excessively lengthy.
