The question was whether the decision not to award the allowance for disabled adults to the applicant, a member of the family (adopted son) of a European Community national resident in the country of which the head of household (the adoptive parent) had the nationality (in accordance with French legislation) was compatible with the European provisions contained in the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (\u201cthe EEC Treaty\u201d). In a judgment of 16\u00a0December 1992 the ECJ replied to the question with a ruling that the refusal to award the benefit to the applicant was not incompatible with the relevant Articles of the EEC Treaty. It pointed out that the applicant's adoptive father could not claim to be a \u201cmigrant worker\u201d, which was the category to which the European provisions in question applied. It based that finding on the fact that the applicant's adoptive father, being French, had always lived and worked in . The ECJ accordingly concluded that the applicant could not \u201crely on Community law in support of his application for a social security benefit awarded to migrant workers and members of the family\u201d. In doing so, it did not examine the question whether the refusal to award the applicant the allowance was, in general, compatible with Community law or not.",

The Government submitted that Gaygusuz v. Austria (judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV) supported their contention since, in their view, the Court had expressly pointed out that entitlement to a social benefit was linked to the payment of contributions. In the Government's submission, the decisions given in Michael Matthews, in which they agreed with the British Government's submissions, did not enable it to be determined whether or not the benefit in question was a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Michael Matthews v. the United Kingdom, no. 40302/98, decision of 28 November 2000 and judgment of 15 July 2002).

The applicant, referring to further examples of administrative case-law, inferred from this that the distinction as to whether the benefit was contributory or not was invalid. He also referred to the example of the minimum welfare benefit (that he had received for a time), which varied according to any income from a professional activity and which could potentially be claimed by anyone aged 25 who had never worked and which was not subject to any nationality condition. Accordingly, he considered himself entitled to a right that had been unlawfully denied him for discriminatory reasons regarding his nationality.",

Moreover the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see, inter alia, Gaygusuz, cited above, p. 1142, \u00a7 42; Larkos v. Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a029515/95, \u00a7 29, ECHR 1999-I; and Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no.\u00a034369/97, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2000-IV).

He was therefore in a like situation to that of French nationals or nationals of a country that had signed a reciprocity agreement as regards his right to receive the benefit.

He referred to a judgment of the Court of Cassation of 17 October 1996 upholding an award of the AAH to an Algerian on the ground that there was an agreement between Algeria and the EEC, and to a judgment of the Haute-Savoie Social Security Tribunal of 15 May 1997 basing its decision to award the benefit on the Lom\u00e9 Convention.

It is necessary but it is also sufficient for the facts of the case to fall \u201cwithin the ambit\u201d of one or more of the provisions in question (see, among many other authorities, Karlheinz Schmidt v. Germany, judgment of 18 July 1994, Series A no. 291-B, p. 32, \u00a7 22, and Petrovic v. Austria, judgment of 27 March 1998, Reports 1998-II, p. 585, \u00a7\u00a022). Secondly, Article 14 covers not only the enjoyment of the rights that States are obliged to safeguard under the Convention but also those rights and freedoms that fall within the ambit of a substantive provision of the Convention and that a State has chosen to guarantee, even if in so doing it goes beyond the requirements of the Convention. This principle was expressed for the first time by the Court in the Case \u201crelating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in \u201d (cited above, pp. 33-34).

The domestic authorities' refusal to grant him the allowance for disabled adults was based exclusively on the fact that he did not have the requisite nationality, which was a precondition for obtaining the allowance under Article L. 821-1 of the Social Security Code as applicable at the material time. Moreover, it has not been established, or even alleged, that the applicant did not satisfy the other statutory conditions entitling him to the social benefit in question. Like the majority (see paragraph 49 of the judgment), I find that the difference in treatment regarding entitlement to social benefits between French nationals or nationals of a country having signed a reciprocity agreement and other foreign nationals was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d, especially as the applicant had been adopted by a French citizen. Even though, at the material time,  was not bound by reciprocity agreements with the , it undertook, when ratifying the Convention, to secure \u201cto everyone within [its] jurisdiction\u201d the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of the Convention.",
