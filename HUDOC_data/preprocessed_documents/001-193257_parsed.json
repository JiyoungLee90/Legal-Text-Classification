Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7 202, ECHR 2006\u2011V). The Court further notes that factors such as the conduct of the applicant and what is at stake for him or her in the dispute together with other relevant aspects may affect in various degrees the award in respect of non-pecuniary damage (see Apicella v.\u00a0Italy, no. 64890/01, \u00a7 26, 10 November 2004) and, exceptionally, lead to no\u00a0award at all (see Scordino (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7 204).

The Court disagrees. While it is true that the nominal value of the impugned shares was only slightly higher than 200 euros, the parties agreed that their market value had been much higher at the relevant time. Furthermore, the applicant could not have prevented that the length of the civil proceedings concerning those shares become excessive by lodging a constitutional appeal earlier. The constitutional appeal is simply not a preventive remedy. Indeed, like this Court, the Constitutional Court cannot order that proceedings be speeded up until their length have already become excessive and it has found a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time in that regard. The constitutional appeal is thus different from, for example, an appeal against the silence of administration which may be used to speed up administrative proceedings and to prevent their excessive length (see Vukovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Montenegro (dec.), no. 18626/11, \u00a7\u00a7 30\u201331, 27 November 2012). Accordingly, the applicant did not contribute to the length of the civil proceedings. In these circumstances, the finding of a violation by the Constitutional Court did not constitute sufficient just satisfaction (contrast Milosavljevi\u0107 v. Serbia (dec.), no. 21603/07, 5 November 2013). The applicant can therefore still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention and the Government\u2019s objection must be dismissed.",
