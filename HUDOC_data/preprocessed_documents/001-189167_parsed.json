Nevertheless, the court noted that during the hearing the prosecutor had indicated that the other co-accused had stated that the money could have been stolen by the applicant because she had taken bags from the stack of bags in which the unsealed bag had been found and she had had a suspicious behaviour. Moreover, the security camera in the room was turned away from the place where the applicant was sit. The court concluded that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed an offence. The court noted that some thirteen days had elapsed since the day of the theft. The applicant had a permanent abode, a job, family and no criminal record. There were no reasons to believe that she would hinder the investigation in circumstances in which her involvement in the offence was unclear. The court considered that the risk of reoffending had also not been proven by the prosecutor which would warrant placing the applicant in detention.

The Court notes that the reasons for remanding the applicant in custody were the same as those considered unconvincing by the Buiucani District Court in its decision of 5 October 2015. The Court of Appeal gave no explanation as to why it considered those reasons relevant and sufficient and why it disagreed with the lower instance court. In ordering the applicant\u2019s remand in custody, the Court of Appeal made no assessment of the applicant\u2019s character, her morals, her assets and links with the country and her behaviour during the criminal investigation.
