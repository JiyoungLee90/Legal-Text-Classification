The courts\u2019 decisions, therefore, gave a strong indication to the applicant that the authorities were displeased with the publications and that, unless he modified his behaviour in future, he would run the risk of being prosecuted again for abuse of office, which, unlike two other offences imputed to the applicant, remained punishable by the new Code (paragraph 22 above).",

Although it must not overstep certain bounds, regarding in particular protection of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart \u2013 in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest, including those relating to justice (see De\u00a0Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, pp.\u00a0233-34, \u00a7 37 and, mutatis mutandis, Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, \u00a7\u00a7 92-110, ECHR 2004...). Not only does it have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d (see Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 27, \u00a7 63). Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed (see Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 25, \u00a7 57). Journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, judgment of 26\u00a0April\u00a01995, Series\u00a0A no. 313, p. 19, \u00a7 38, and Thoma v. Luxembourg, no.\u00a038432/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045 and 46, ECHR 2001-III).",

More generally, freedom of political debate is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society which prevails throughout the Convention. The limits of acceptable criticism are accordingly wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual. Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays her- or himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see Lingens v.
