They argued that the authorities could not enforce the judgment in question, since the applicant had failed to cooperate and she had not taken minimally required steps to initiate enforcement of the judicial award. Furthermore, the applicant was in any event receiving the old-age pension in a higher amount than that determined by the judgment of 18\u00a0July 2003. Therefore, the execution of the initial judicial decision would be to the detriment of the applicant\u2019s pecuniary interests.

Although an exact sum to be paid under this head was not specified in the relevant part of the judgment, the Court considers that the judgment contained all information necessary to calculate the amount due to the applicant, and it has not been shown that the respondent authority had any discretion in this respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Bulgakova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a069524/01, \u00a7\u00a029, 18\u00a0January 2007). In fact, the judgment contained a clear reference to the applicable legal provisions governing calculation of the pension, as well as specified a period in respect of which the arrears were to be calculated. The Court concludes that the judgment was sufficiently clear and specific to be enforceable (see Bulgakova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a029-31). Accordingly, from the date of the judgment of 6\u00a0August 2001 the applicant had an established \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d to acquire a pecuniary asset. The Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant\u2019s claim was sufficiently established to constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d falling within the ambit of Article\u00a01 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 (see, in so far as relevant, Malinovskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a041302/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045-46, ECHR 2005 VII (extracts)).

It has been the Court\u2019s constant position that a person who has obtained a judgment against the State may not be expected to bring separate enforcement proceedings (see Metaxas v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7\u00a019, 27\u00a0May 2004). In such cases, the  authority must be duly noti\ufb01ed of the judgment and is thus well placed to take all necessary initiatives to comply with it or to transmit it to another competent State authority responsible for execution. This is particularly relevant in a situation where, in view of the complexities and possible overlapping of the execution and enforcement procedures, an applicant may have reasonable doubts about which authority is responsible for the execution or enforcement of the judgment (see Akashev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a030616/05, \u00a7\u00a021, 12\u00a0June 2008, and Burdov (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7\u00a068). Consequently, the Court held that the burden to ensure compliance with a judgment against the State lies primarily with the State authorities starting from the date on which the judgment becomes binding and enforceable (Burdov\u00a0(no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a069).",

The Court found that if the applicant for any reason obtains him- or herself the writ of execution from the trial court, it would appear logical to require that he or she submits it to the competent authority with a view to enforcement of the judgment. The Court concluded that the authorities could not have been held responsible for the applicants\u2019 unexplained failure to follow the domestic enforcement procedure and, notably, for their deliberate and persistent refusal to provide the writs of enforcement (see Gadzhikhanov and Saukov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027-31).",

However, the applicant did not submit to the Court any comments or objections to the Government\u2019s argument as to her failure to cooperate. Indeed, she confined her position to a confirmation of her intention to maintain the case before the Court. She has never contested her persistent failure to take any action in order to recover the judgment debt, and she did not claim to be unaware of the procedure to follow.",

She never argued before the Court or before the domestic courts in the proceedings concerning the duplicate of the writs of 2008-2009 that she had had any difficulties with understanding the procedure. Finally, she neither pointed to any valid circumstance preventing or dispensing her from complying with the enforcement procedure. Therefore, there is nothing to suggest that the requirement to forward a writ of execution to the authorities imposed a disproportionate burden on her or was otherwise unreasonable or unnecessary.",

In the absence of any explanation from the applicant, the Government\u2019s assumption that she had deliberately withheld the writs of execution for several years does not appear unfounded. In these circumstances, the Court does not find any reason to depart from its findings in the Gadzhikhanov and Saukov case (cited above) and concludes that the applicant\u2019s behaviour was an obstacle to enforcement of the judgment. Consequently, the authorities cannot be held responsible under the Convention for the nonenforcement of the judicial award in her favour.",
