The case originated in an application (no. 38999/05) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Petr Pavlovich Matviyets (“the applicant”), on 20 October 2003.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mrs V. Milinchuk, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 9 March 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1926 and lives in Voronezh.
The applicant is a veteran of World War II. Under domestic law the State must subsidise his car’s running costs. Not having received the subsidy in 1996–99, the applicant applied to a court.
On 29 May 2001 the Tsentralnyi District Court of Voronezh awarded the applicant 3,666.67 Russian roubles against a regional authority. On 8 June 2001 the judgment became binding, and on 8 May 2007 it was enforced.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a judgment must be enforced within two months.
