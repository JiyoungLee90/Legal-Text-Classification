The Minister further found that the first applicant had directly facilitated the crimes committed by KhAD by performing his tasks in the Afghan army, inter alia the attributed task of arresting and persuading deserters trying to flee across the border to continue military service, failure of which led to the handing over of these deserters to the office of the Military Public Prosecutor.",

The Minister found that the first applicant had not furnished sufficient specific grounds to establish that he would run a real risk of treatment contrary to this provision if returned to Afghanistan. Thus, he had failed to indicate which specific persons or groups would be looking for him, and had only stated in generally phrased terms that he feared persecution by the mujahideen. In respect of the first applicant\u2019s alleged fear of returning to Afghanistan as a (former) member of the PDPA, the Minister held that the first applicant was in a position not dissimilar to that of many other Afghan nationals. Furthermore, the Minister, with reference to the most recent general official report on Afghanistan issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 12 November 2003, held that the sole fact that an asylum seeker had been a member of the PDPA did not in itself suffice to render Article 3 applicable in the eventuality of an expulsion.",

It points out that the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan is largely defined by historical underlying mechanisms: local rivalries, power play and tribal feuds. It further notes regional differences in this campaign of intimidation and targeted violence, which vary for the range of targeted profiles studied in the report, which include government officials and employees; Afghan National Security Forces, government supporters, collaborators and contractors, Afghans working for international military forces; Afghans working for international organisations, companies and non-governmental organisations, civilians accused by the Taliban of spying, journalists, media and human rights activists, educational staff or students, medical staff, construction workers, truck drivers, and those judged as violating the Taliban\u2019s moral code (for instance, prohibitions on shaving, women working outdoors, selling music and sweets, or girls\u2019 education). This report does not mention persons having worked for the former communist armed forces of Afghanistan or intelligence service as a targeted profile.",

The Court further notes that the first applicant was not dismissed from his job, but resigned in March 1994, and that he and his family did not flee the country but moved to Kunduz, where they lived quietly for about four years without encountering any problems from the authorities, groups or individuals on account of his past activities for the KhAD. The first applicant also did not flee Afghanistan when the Taliban seized power in Kunduz on 26 June 1997. It was only in April or May 1998, after being denounced by relatives, that the first applicant was arrested and detained by the Taliban. After he had managed to abscond on an unspecified date, he fled to Mazar-e-Sharif, where he was joined by his family on 7 November 1999 and with whom he fled Afghanistan on 12 November 1999.",

The Court further notes that the UNHCR does not include members of the armed forces during the former communist regime in their potential risk profiles in respect of Afghanistan (see paragraphs 45-46 above) and that there is no indication in the two EASO reports on Afghanistan that members of the military or intelligence services under the former communist regime are specifically targeted by the Taliban or other insurgent groups in Afghanistan (see paragraphs 47 and 49 above).",
