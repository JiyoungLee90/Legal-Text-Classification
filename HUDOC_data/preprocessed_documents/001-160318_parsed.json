The intentions or reasons underlying the acts or omissions in question are of little relevance when assessing whether Article 34 of the Convention was complied with; what matters is whether the situation created as a result of the authorities\u2019 act or omission conforms to Article 34 (see Paladi v. Moldova [GC], no.\u00a039806/05, \u00a7 87, 10 March 2009). Moreover, the Court must assess the vulnerability of the complainant and the risk of his being influenced by the authorities.

The Court considers that, when deciding the present case, it should avoid prejudging any issues which might be raised in that application, and should therefore leave unaddressed the applicant\u2019s argument in the present case that the suspension of Mr Bagirov\u2019s licence was part of a general crackdown campaign against human-rights lawyers and activists. Instead, the Court will focus on the narrower issue specific to the present case \u2013 whether the applicant\u2019s inability to meet his representative, as such, amounted to a breach of his rights under Article 34 of the Convention.",

In this connection, the Court observes at the outset that, although the Government argued that Mr\u00a0Bagirov had failed to present a valid authority form to the Court and the domestic authorities, it is apparent from the documents in the case file that the applicant submitted to the Court two valid authority forms (dated 17\u00a0November 2012 and 30 January 2013, and signed by the applicant and Mr Bagirov), a copy of which were transmitted to the Government by the Court when the present application was communicated. As regards Mr\u00a0Bagirov\u2019s alleged failure to submit a valid power of attorney to the domestic authorities, the Court observes that the Government themselves submitted to the Court in their observations a copy of mandate (order) no.\u00a0017422 from the ABA, according to which Mr Bagirov represented the applicant in the domestic criminal proceedings. In any event, when the domestic authorities refused Mr Bagirov permission to meet with the applicant, they relied not on the absence of his power of attorney, but on the suspension of his licence to practise law of 10 December 2014 (see\u00a0paragraph 57 above).",

In particular, the Court considered that Article 34 of the Convention had been breached where the applicant had been unable to discuss with his representative issues concerning the application before the Court without their being separated by a glass partition (see Cebotari v. Moldova, no.\u00a035615/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a058-68, 13\u00a0November 2007); where the applicant had been \u00a0unable to communicate with his representative before the Court during his treatment in hospital (see Shtukaturov v. Russia, no. 44009/05, \u00a7\u00a0140, ECHR 2008); and where the applicant\u2019s contacts with his representative before the Court had been restricted on the grounds that the representative was not a professional advocate and did not belong to any Bar association (see Zakharkin v. Russia, no. 1555/04, \u00a7\u00a7 157-60, 10 June 2010). The Court has, however, accepted that compliance by a representative with certain formal requirements might be necessary before obtaining access to a detainee, for instance for security reasons or in order to prevent collusion or perversion of the course of the investigation or justice (see Melnikov v. Russia, no.\u00a023610/03, \u00a7 96, 14\u00a0January 2010). At the same time, excessive formalities in such matters, such as those that could de facto prevent a prospective applicant from effectively enjoying his right of individual petition, have been found to be unacceptable. By contrast, where the domestic formalities were easy to comply with, no issue arose under Article 34 (see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 119, 25\u00a0October 2007).",

The only reason for refusing to allow the applicant\u2019s representative to meet him was that his licence to practise law had been suspended on 10 December 2014 (see\u00a0paragraph 57 above). However, the Court notes that the suspension of Mr Bagirov\u2019s licence, which prevented him under domestic law from representing applicants in domestic criminal proceedings, could not be interpreted as a measure limiting his rights in the representation of applicants before the Court. Given that under Rule 36 \u00a7 4 (a) of the Rules of Court, permission to represent an applicant may be granted to a nonadvocate, the Contracting States must ensure that non-advocate representatives are allowed to visit detainees who have lodged or intend to lodge an application with the Court under the same conditions as advocates (see Zakharkin, cited above, \u00a7 157).",

The Contracting Party\u2019s procedural obligations under Articles 34 and 38 of the Convention must be enforced irrespective of the eventual outcome of the proceedings and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or potential chilling effect on the applicants or their representatives (see Janowiec and Others v.
