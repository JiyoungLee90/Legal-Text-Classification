The magistrate ordered his pre-trial detention on the same grounds as those cited in the case of the other applicants. Like the public prosecutor, the magistrate considered that Ak\u0131n Atalay\u2019s placement in pre-trial detention was justified by the existence of strong suspicions that he had committed the offences alleged by the public prosecutor. Reiterating the considerations outlined in the order he had issued for the detention of the applicants \u00d6nder \u00c7elik, Mustafa Kemal G\u00fcng\u00f6r, Hakan Karasinir, Hac\u0131\u00a0Musa Kart, G\u00fcray Tekin \u00d6z, B\u00fclent Utku, Ahmet Kadri G\u00fcrsel, Turhan G\u00fcnay and Mehmet Murat Sabuncu (see paragraphs\u00a021\u00a0and\u00a025 above), the magistrate found that, following the changes to the composition of the board of management of the Cumhuriyet Foundation, including Ak\u0131n Atalay\u2019s appointment as chairman of the executive committee, the newspaper Cumhuriyet had begun targeting State institutions and had published a large number of articles that could be regarded as propaganda in favour of terrorist organisations and were liable to give the public a favourable impression of those organisations. In the magistrate\u2019s view, even if the investigation did not relate to any articles written by Ak\u0131n Atalay himself, there was a strong suspicion of guilt on the part of the senior members of the foundation\u2019s board of management, including the applicant, on account of their influence over the impugned material. The magistrate referred in that connection to the articles published in Cumhuriyet which had likewise been mentioned in his order for the detention of the applicants \u00d6nder \u00c7elik, Mustafa Kemal G\u00fcng\u00f6r, Hakan Karasinir, Hac\u0131 Musa Kart, G\u00fcray Tekin \u00d6z, B\u00fclent Utku, Ahmet Kadri G\u00fcrsel and Turhan G\u00fcnay (see paragraph\u00a023 above).",

A body known as the executive committee, which did not feature in the foundation\u2019s constitutive instrument, had been created by the new board of management. [The applicant] Ak\u0131n Atalay had been appointed as chairman of the committee. The publication director was the only person authorised to intervene in an article due to be published in the newspaper and was responsible for choosing the article headings. As a rule, the journalists were not responsible for the headings. The heading \u201cIncomplete democracy\u201d had been added by the then publication director. A.K. explained that the publication of the statements of leaders of the PKK\u2019s armed terrorist organisations had reflected the preferences of the publication director. A.K. himself had not been in favour. He considered it possible that the articles on the \u201cM\u0130T lorries\u201d and the \u201cformer prosecutor C.K.\u201d, published under the name of the previous publication director, C.D., may have demonstrated that the \u201ccemaat\u201d (the G\u00fclenist community) regarded Cumhuriyet under its publication director, C.D., as the most appropriate newspaper in which to air their views following the closure, or loss of credibility, of their own media outlets.",

(a journalist with the newspaper Cumhuriyet): This witness stated that he had joined the newspaper in 2006 and had been working as a journalist in its social and political affairs department for about ten years. He explained that even if the text of an article had been written by a journalist, the heading could be changed by the editors. In his article published by the newspaper under the heading \u201cIncomplete democracy\u201d he had emphasised the fact that the main political forces had been present at the pro-democracy gathering held in Yenikap\u0131, and that during the gathering there had been a call to join forces against the military coup. The editorial team had given the article the heading \u201cIncomplete democracy\u201d because the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (\u201cthe HDP\u201d, a pro-Kurdish party) had not been invited to take part. He had thought that the heading might offend people and might give rise to legal liability, and had said this to the publication director. A.A. added that he had occasionally received criticism from readers regarding, for instance, the increase in the number of news items relating to the political party the HDP, which upset some readers. As a Kemalist, he too had felt uncomfortable with the news items published by the newspaper concerning the PKK. He explained that the publishing policy was determined by the board of management of the foundation and the newspaper\u2019s editorial board. In particular, the foundation\u2019s board of management had the authority to determine the \u201coppositional\u201d nature of the newspaper\u2019s editorial stance.",

In their view, the suspicions advanced by the public prosecutor\u2019s office and cited by the competent authorities as grounds for the applicants\u2019 initial and continued detention, to the effect that the applicants, in their capacity as members of the board of management of the Cumhuriyet Foundation, had influenced the content of the articles referred to in the judgment, had not been supported by any specific evidence. The dissenting judges considered that there was likewise no indication that the applicants had acted with the intention of assisting the criminal organisations referred to in the judgment. In the judges\u2019 view, the prosecution of the members of the board of management on account of articles written by other journalists and published under the responsibility of the newspaper\u2019s publication director had been contrary to the principle of the individual nature of criminal responsibility. Furthermore, no evidence had been adduced casting doubt on the applicants\u2019 defence in reply to those accusations, as it had been consistent with the normal course of life. Noting that the suspicions against the applicants had been based on newspaper articles that were covered by freedom of expression and freedom of the press, the dissenting judges considered that the authorities in question should have taken particular care in applying measures entailing a deprivation of liberty. The change in the newspaper\u2019s editorial stance could not by itself constitute the subject of a criminal offence. The judges pointed out that the senior management of the newspaper could not be prosecuted unless the newspaper\u2019s editorial stance systematically promoted the use of violence and terrorist methods and sought to legitimise terrorist organisations. As a general rule, accusations could not be made against journalists in a sweeping manner by listing the headings, articles and opinions published by the newspaper over a particular period. A blanket approach of this kind, omitting to specify how each article had infringed the Criminal Code, would narrow the sphere of journalistic activity and have a chilling effect on freedom of the press. The dissenting judges considered that even if some articles apt to support the activities of a terrorist organisation were published from time to time in a newspaper, they could merely engage the criminal responsibility of their authors but did not suffice to demonstrate a shift in the editorial stance of the newspaper as a whole.",

It noted in that connection that the applicant had not been charged on account of an article that he himself had written, but that the allegations had been based on his membership of the board of management of the foundation, which allegedly rendered him responsible, together with his fellow board members, for the change in editorial stance and the manipulative articles published in the newspaper championing the cause of terrorist organisations. However, the court noted that the applicant had ceased to be a member of the newspaper\u2019s senior management in 2013 and that his name did not feature among the members of the board of management, and that the alleged acts had taken place after 2013. It therefore considered it unnecessary to examine the complaints of a breach of freedom of expression, since no facts had been disclosed concerning possible influence by the applicant over the material published in the newspaper. The Constitutional Court also made an award to the applicant for costs and expenses.

The Constitutional Court further considered that the fact that the applicant had met with persons who had been investigated in connection with an offence linked to a terrorist organisation could not in itself constitute a ground for bringing charges. In that connection it pointed out that it would have had to be proven that the meetings had taken place in the context of an organisational activity.

It carried out a detailed examination, from a constitutional perspective, of the facts leading to the declaration of the state of emergency. As a result of this examination, it found that the attempted military coup of 15 July 2016 had been a clear and serious attack both on the constitutional principles that sovereignty was unconditionally and unreservedly vested in the people, who exercised it through authorised organs, and that no individual or body could exercise any State authority not emanating from the Constitution, and also on the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. According to the Constitutional Court, the attempted military coup had been a practical illustration of the severity of the threats posed to the democratic constitutional order and human rights. After summarising the attacks carried out during the night of 15 to 16 July 2016, it emphasised that in order to assess the severity of the threat posed by a military coup, it was also necessary to consider the risks that might have arisen had the coup attempt not been thwarted. It found that the fact that the attempted coup had taken place at a time when Turkey had been under violent attack from numerous terrorist organisations had made the country even more vulnerable and considerably increased the severity of the threat to the life and existence of the nation. The Constitutional Court noted that in some cases, it might not be possible for a State to eliminate threats to its democratic constitutional order, fundamental rights and national security through ordinary administrative procedures. It might therefore be necessary to impose extraordinary administrative procedures, such as a state of emergency, until such threats were eliminated. Bearing in mind the threats resulting from the attempted military coup of 15 July 2016, the Constitutional Court accepted the power of the Council of Ministers, chaired by the President, to issue legislative decrees on matters necessitating the state of emergency. In that context, it also emphasised that the state of emergency was a temporary legal regime, in which any interference with fundamental rights had to be foreseeable and the aim of which was to restore the normal regime in order to safeguard fundamental rights.",

Secondly, the suspicions against them had not been individualised, in breach of the CCP. Although a separate detention order had been drawn up in the name of each individual applicant, they had all been accused in blanket fashion of responsibility for the newspaper\u2019s editorial stance on account of their managerial positions. Thirdly, according to the Press Act, the proprietors and editors-in-chief of newspapers were not liable for articles constituting a criminal offence unless the authors of the articles had not been identified.

The KCK was a political model for reconstructing Kurdish society through administrative and judicial structures, in accordance with the PKK\u2019s ultimate goal.

In that connection he noted that 210 journalists had been placed in pre-trial detention during the state of emergency, not including those who had been arrested and released after being questioned. One of the underlying reasons for the high numbers of journalists being detained was the practice of judges, who often tended to disregard the exceptional nature of detention as a measure of last resort that should only be applied when all other options were deemed insufficient. In the majority of cases where journalists had been placed in pre-trial detention, they had been charged with terrorismrelated offences without any evidence corroborating their involvement in terrorist activities. The Commissioner for Human Rights was struck by the weakness of the accusations and the political nature of the decisions ordering and extending pre-trial detention in such cases.",

It must therefore consider, in assessing the factual aspect, whether the arrest and detention were based on sufficient objective elements to justify a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that the facts at issue had actually occurred and were attributable to the persons under suspicion (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 32-34, and Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 50-63).

Nonetheless, in the present case, it was under Article 100 of the CCP that the applicants\u00a0were\u00a0placed in pre-trial detention on charges relating to the offence set out in Article 220 of the Criminal Code. It should be noted in particular that Article 100 of the CCP, which requires the presence of factual evidence giving rise to strong suspicion that the person has committed an offence, was not amended during the state of emergency. Instead, the measures complained of in the present case were taken on the basis of legislation which was in force prior to and after the declaration of the state of emergency. Consequently, the measures complained of in the present case cannot be said to have complied with the conditions laid down by Article 15 of the Convention, since, ultimately, no derogating measure was applicable to the situation. To conclude otherwise would negate the minimum requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention.",

While the guarantee of speediness is no longer relevant for the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 4 after the person\u2019s release, the guarantee of efficiency of the review should continue to apply even thereafter, since a former detainee may well have a legitimate interest in the determination of his or her detention even after being released (see \u017d\u00fabor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a083).",

Turkey ((dec.), no.\u00a019699/18, \u00a7\u00a7 35-44, 2 April 2019). In those cases it noted that in the Turkish legal system, anyone in pre-trial detention could apply for release at any stage of the proceedings and could lodge an objection if the application was rejected. It also observed that the question of detainees\u2019 continued detention was automatically reviewed at regular intervals of no more than thirty days. Accordingly, it held that it could tolerate longer periods of review by the Constitutional Court.\u00a0However, in the case of Mehmet Hasan Altan, cited above, the period before the Constitutional Court to be taken into consideration was fourteen months and three days; in the case of \u015eahin Alpay, cited above, it was sixteen months and three days; and in the case of Akg\u00fcn, cited above, it was twelve months and sixteen days. Bearing in mind the complexity of the applications and the Constitutional Court\u2019s caseload following the declaration of a state of emergency, the Court considered that this was an exceptional situation. Consequently, although periods of twelve months and sixteen days, fourteen months and three days and sixteen months and three days before the Constitutional Court could not be described as \u201cspeedy\u201d in an ordinary context, in the specific circumstances of those cases the Court held that there had been no violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention.",

It considers that the fact that the Constitutional Court did not deliver its judgment dismissing the applicants\u2019 applications until 2 May 2019, some two years and four months later, is not relevant in calculating the period of time to be taken into consideration from the standpoint of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, since all the applicants had been released by that date.",

The Court emphasises in that connection that the applicants\u2019 applications to the Constitutional Court were complex, as this was one of the first cases raising complicated issues concerning the pre-trial detention of journalists on account of their newspaper\u2019s editorial stance, and because the applicants had pleaded their case extensively before the Constitutional Court, arguing not only that their detention had not been based on any valid grounds, but also that the accusations against them were unconstitutional. Moreover, the Court considers that account must also be taken of the exceptional caseload of the Constitutional Court during the state of emergency in force from July 2016 to July 2018, and of the measures taken by the national authorities to tackle the problem of that court\u2019s backlog (see Mehmet Hasan Altan, cited above, \u00a7 165; \u015eahin Alpay, cited above, \u00a7 137; and Akg\u00fcn, cited above, \u00a7 41). In that connection the Court stresses the distinction to be made between the present case and the case of Kavala v. Turkey in which the applicant had remained in pre-trial detention for the eleven months elapsing between the lifting of the state of emergency on 18 July 2018 and the delivery of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment on 28 June 2019 (see Kavala v. Turkey, no. 28749/18, \u00a7\u00a0195, 10\u00a0December 2019).",

Some of the criminal-law provisions concerning State security and terrorism were open to arbitrary application owing to their vague wording and the overly broad interpretation of the concepts of terrorist propaganda and support for a terrorist organisation, with those concepts encompassing statements and articles that clearly did not incite violence. In the aftermath of the attempted coup many journalists had faced unsubstantiated terrorism-related charges under such provisions, in connection with the legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of expression. The detention and prosecution of journalists under such grave charges resulted in a strong chilling effect on wholly legitimate journalistic activities and contributed to self-censorship among those who wished to participate in public debate. In the Commissioner\u2019s view, numerous instances of judicial actions targeting not only journalists but also human rights defenders, academics and members of parliament exercising their right to freedom of expression indicated that criminal laws and procedures were currently being used by the judiciary to silence dissenting voices.",

Indeed, as the Court pointed out in Merabishvili (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0291), the mere fact that a restriction of a Convention right or freedom does not meet all the requirements of the clause that permits it does not necessarily raise an issue under Article 18. Separate examination of a complaint under that Article is only warranted if the claim that a restriction has been applied for a purpose not prescribed by the Convention appears to be a fundamental aspect of the case. There is still a need to examine the question whether \u2013 in the absence of a legitimate purpose \u2013 there was an identifiable ulterior one (see\u00a0Navalnyy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0166).",

Given the serious disruption and the considerable loss of life resulting from these events, it is perfectly legitimate to carry out investigations into these incidents.

The acts of which the applicants were accused in the investigation which was opened at the end of 2016 had occurred, for the most part, prior to or after the attempted coup of 15 July 2016. Those acts, most of which had occurred during 2015 and 2016, allegedly formed part of the preparations for the planned coup or of opposition to the measures taken against the alleged instigators of the coup attempt. The items reporting on the viewpoints of members of separatist or leftist organisations were published in 2015 and are thus no exception to this rule. It cannot therefore be said that an excessive length of time elapsed between the impugned acts and the opening of the criminal investigation in the course of which the applicants were placed in pre-trial detention.",

However, the Court notes in the present case that the statements by the President of the Republic referred to above related to a specific affair concerning the destination of lorries belonging to the intelligence services and used to transport weapons, and were not directed against the applicants themselves but rather against the newspaper Cumhuriyet as a whole under the editorial direction of C.D., its publication director at the time. Moreover, it should be noted that the Constitutional Court ruled in favour of C.D. and another of Cumhuriyet\u2019s managers at the time, finding that the suspicions against them were unconstitutional. It is true that the statement by the President of the Republic to the effect that he would not abide by the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling, was not bound by it and would not comply with it, was clearly in contradiction with the basic tenets of the rule of law. However, such an expression of dissatisfaction does not in itself amount to evidence that the applicants\u2019 detention was ultimately motivated by reasons incompatible with the Convention.",

Accordingly, in the reasoning leading to the finding of a violation of that provision, it would have been sufficient, in my view, for the Court to confine its examination to the question of the attributability of the acts to the applicants, assessed in the light of the criteria relating to the reasonableness of the suspicion for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention. Thus, I am not sure about the approach consisting in examining a number of the articles, messages and interview in issue in the light of the criteria laid down in Article 10 of the Convention. In particular, I have serious reservations about the necessity of the reasoning set forth in paragraph 173 of the judgment. In addition, I respectfully disagree with the content and the conclusion of that paragraph.

In this context, and referring to my concurring opinion in the case of Rag\u0131p Zarakolu v.

These euphemisms, as a rule, refer to political motives. Even when violations of more than one legal provision are found with regard not to one but to a larger number of litigants and, moreover, there is a correlation between them, the courts sometimes conclude that this is nevertheless not indicative of the alleged improper ulterior purpose, notwithstanding that an objective observer (or virtually everyone except the court itself) would be persuaded by the abundant proof to the contrary and would therefore regard the court\u2019s finding as erroneous. When the courts\u2019 findings so markedly diverge from common knowledge, which more often than not means that they are divorced from reality, and especially when the court in question is the highest court, whose word on the matter is final, very little can be done to alleviate the feeling of the aggrieved party and that of society at large that justice has not been served. That feeling is even more persistent where the outcome exonerating the authorities is repeated from case to case, that is to say, the alleged ulterior purpose is not discerned by that court in a series of cases, notwithstanding the fact that the juxtaposition of their facts would allow for the conclusion that the violations of the various victims\u2019 rights comprise a system, the constituent parts of which are united by precisely that purpose, so obvious to many.",

It was rooted in the general assumption that the public authorities in the member States act in good faith \u2013 an assumption on which the whole structure of the Convention rests (see Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a05829/04, \u00a7\u00a0255, 31 May 2011). A violation of Article 18 would mean that the presumed good faith gave way to a \u201chidden agenda\u201d, and law to force. For decades the Court required that, for a violation of Article 18 to be found, it had to be furnished with \u201cincontrovertible and direct proof\u201d (see Khodorkovskiy, cited above, \u00a7 260, and OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v.\u00a0Russia, no. 14902/04, \u00a7 663, 20 September 2011). That proof could not be adduced by anyone other than the applicant: if an applicant alleged that his or her rights and freedoms had been limited for an improper reason, he or she had to \u201cconvincingly show\u201d (a mere suspicion would not do) that the real aim of the authorities was not the same as that proclaimed. In brackets it was added: \u201cor as can be reasonably inferred from the context\u201d (see Khodorkovskiy, cited above, \u00a7 255, emphasis added; see also \u00a7 256), thus conceding that there remained a possibility that some contextual evidence corroborating the applicants\u2019 allegations of an improper ulterior purpose could be \u201creasonably\u201d accepted. But that possibility was as slim as could be and purely hypothetical, as demonstrated by the Court\u2019s practice of avoiding any contextual analysis in Article 18 cases. To wit, such an analysis was not undertaken either in Khodorkovskiy or in the subsequent cases, until a breakthrough was achieved in two cases against Azerbaijan (see paragraphs\u00a01517 below). The standard of proof effectively applied by the Court in Article 18 cases was that the contextual evidence was in fact not to be taken into consideration, no matter how strongly it corroborated the allegations of a \u201chidden agenda\u201d. It became known as the \u201cvery exacting standard of proof\u201d (see Tchankotadze v. Georgia, no. 15256/05, \u00a7\u00a0113, 21\u00a0June 2016, with further references).",

                        "content": "7.\u00a0\u00a0In some cases the applicants provided the Court with copious contextual evidence in support of their claims that there was indeed an ulterior purpose behind the violations of their rights, and maintained that that evidence rendered their claims arguable, such that the burden of proof had to shift onto the Government. The Court was not moved by these considerations. It steadily steered a course whereby, even where the \u201cappearances\u201d spoke in favour of the applicants\u2019 claims of improper motives, the onus still rested with them (see, for example, Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, \u00a7\u00a7 899903, 25\u00a0July 2013). In some cases the Court even conceded the link between the applicants\u2019 predicaments and politics, for instance that the violations committed by the authorities against the victims were beneficial to some political players, but those \u201cappearances\u201d, no matter how plentiful or consistent (in Khodorkovskiy they were present in abundance in the \u201cresolutions of political institutions, NGOs [non-governmental organisations], statements of various public figures, etc.\u201d and \u201cthe findings of several European courts\u201d; \u00a7\u00a7 259 and 260), were not sufficient for the hand of politics to be discerned behind those violations, as \u201cthe political process and adjudicative process [were] fundamentally different\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a025859). For convenience, the latter adage can be labelled the \u201cKhodorkovskiy formula\u201d. Whatever the \u201cappearances\u201d, the Court was resolute that it (\u201cthe judge\u201d) had to base its decision on \u201cevidence in the legal sense\u201d (ibid.), which \u201cappearances\u201d were not. The proof adduced by the applicants was accepted by the Court as \u201cevidence in the legal sense\u201d only if it constituted \u201cincontrovertible and direct proof\u201d. The Court\u2019s \u201cvery exacting standard of proof\u201d thus amounted to the requirement that the applicants present it with palpable, physical, preferably documented evidence of a \u201chidden agenda\u201d. That was possible only when (i)\u00a0\u00a0the authorities had themselves recognised or otherwise revealed that they knew (or should have known) that their actions were guided by a purpose which was not among those permitted under the Convention; and (ii)\u00a0\u00a0the proof of that recognition had somehow fallen into the hands of the applicants. Normally, perpetrators try not to leave traces, let alone make the footprints of their unlawful motives accessible to their victims. The few exceptions where the States did not succeed in hiding the impropriety and unlawfulness of their agenda were Gusinskiy v. Russia (no. 70276/01, ECHR 2004IV); Cebotari v. Moldova (no. 35615/06, 13 November 2007); Lutsenko v.\u00a0Ukraine (no. 6492/11, 3 July 2012); and Tymoshenko v.\u00a0Ukraine (no.\u00a049872/11, 30 April 2013). And even if there were traces of ulterior motives behind the persecution of the victims, they were neutralised \u2013 in the sense that a violation of Article 18 was not found \u2013 by a \u201chealthy core\u201d present in the overall set of purposes of the applicants\u2019 persecution, which allowed for, say, the raising of serious criminal accusations against them (see, for example, Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0908).",

No wonder that for a long time they, one after another (with a few exceptions that could be counted on the fingers of one hand), had their Article 18 complaints rejected by the Court, regardless of what the whole world knew about the political causes of their persecution. The Court\u2019s overly restrictive approach to \u201cevidence in the legal sense\u201d and the findings of no violation of Article 18 based on it could not fail to contribute to a heightened feeling of impunity within the regimes concerned and a growing apprehension that the Convention was in retreat when confronted with political \u201cbigshots\u201d who persecuted their opponents with all the force of the State machinery.

At times this evasiveness took on unaccountable forms, as in Mudayevy v. Russia (no. 33105/05, 8\u00a0April 2010), where the Court, having found violations of Articles 2, 3, 5 and\u00a013 and having stated that it had \u201calready found ... that the applicants\u2019 relatives were deprived of their liberty without any of the safeguards contained in Article\u00a05, and not \u2018for the purpose of bringing [a person] before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence\u2019 as stipulated in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c)\u201d, decided that \u201csince that issue [had] already been addressed by the Court, there [was] no need to examine these facts again under Article 18 in conjunction with Article 5\u201d (\u00a7 128). In Kasparov and Others v. Russia (no. 2) (no. 51988/07, 13 December 2016), where the Court stated that \u201cthe applicants\u2019 arrest and administrative detention had the effect of preventing and discouraging them and others from participating in protest rallies and actively engaging in opposition politics\u201d (in violation of Articles 5 \u00a7 1, 6 \u00a7 1 and 11), it nonetheless held that \u201c[i]n view of this\u201d (this?!), the examination of the alleged violation of Article\u00a018 was \u201cnot necessary\u201d (\u00a7 55; emphasis added). Similarly, in Nemtsov v. Russia (no. 1774/11, 31 July 2014) the Court found it established that \u201cthe applicant had been arrested, detained and convicted of an administrative offence arbitrarily and unlawfully\u201d and that \u201cthis had had an effect of preventing or discouraging him and others from participating in protest rallies and engaging actively in opposition politics\u201d (in violation of Articles\u00a03, 5 \u00a7 1, 6 \u00a7 1, 11 and 13), yet it held that Mr Nemtsov\u2019s Article\u00a018 complaint \u201craised no separate issue and it [was] not necessary to examine whether ... there [had] been a violation of that provision\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 129 and 130; emphasis added). A similar approach was taken in the inter-State case of Georgia v. Russia (I) ([GC] no. 13255/07, ECHR 2014 (extracts)), in which the Court found violations of Articles 3, 5 \u00a7 1, 5 \u00a7 4, 13, 38, and Article 4 of Protocol No. 4. The Court held that \u201cin the autumn of 2006 a coordinated policy of arresting, detaining and expelling Georgian nationals was put in place in the Russian Federation which amounted to an administrative practice for the purposes of Convention case-law\u201d (point 2 of the operative part; emphasis added), but still considered it not necessary to examine \u201cthe same issues under Article 18\u201d, because it \u201c[had] already observed the existence of [that] administrative practice in breach of [the provisions of the Convention]\u201d (\u00a7 224). As we see, where the violations already found directly and insistently pointed to only one possible conclusion, that there was a \u201chidden agenda\u201d behind them, the Court stopped at the point where the only thing which was left to do (and of which it was seised) was to state that there had been a violation of Article\u00a018.",

It happens in the real world \u2013 not in some \u201clibrary law\u201d \u2013 that the political and adjudicative processes coincide, go together hand in hand and form a unit. The very possibility of a breach of Article 18 signifies that the legal process can be \u2013 and, alas, in an increasing number of polities often is \u2013 subordinated to and subjugated by politics and made its servant. Otherwise such words as \u201cdictatorship\u201d, \u201cautocracy\u201d or \u201cpolitical persecution\u201d would belong not to the vocabulary of political science, but to that of dystopian fiction. The whole idea of a \u201chidden agenda\u201d rests on the unattractive possibility for the legal process to be an extension or even part of its political counterpart. When the Court is seised of allegations of a \u201chidden agenda\u201d behind the violations of the applicants\u2019 rights, its task and mission is to most thoroughly examine and rule on whether that possibility has not been made a reality.

The Court stated that its prior conclusion that \u201cthe charges against the applicant were not based on a \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c)\u201d was \u201cin itself ... not sufficient to assume that Article\u00a018 was breached\u201d and that \u201cit remain[ed] to be seen whether there [was] proof that the authorities\u2019 actions were actually driven by improper reasons\u201d (\u00a7 141). It then proceeded to analyse whether such proof followed from \u201cthe combination of the relevant case-specific facts\u201d, and in particular from \u201call the material circumstances which it ha[d] had regard to in connection with its assessment of the complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c)\u201d, and considered it \u201cestablished to a sufficient degree\u201d that it did. In the Court\u2019s view, these circumstances indicated that \u201cthe actual purpose of the impugned measures was to silence or punish the applicant for criticising the Government and attempting to disseminate what he believed was the true information that the Government were trying to hide\u201d. The measures had thus been applied for purposes \u201cother than bringing him before a competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence, as prescribed by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c)\u201d. On that basis the Court found a violation of Article\u00a018 read in conjunction with Article 5 (\u00a7\u00a7 141-44). Thus, the notion of \u201cevidence in the legal sense\u201d, formally left intact, was impregnated with new, broader content: it now included more than \u201cincontrovertible and direct proof\u201d, to which its previous overly restrictive interpretation had been confined. It was demonstrated that the Court was itself able and ready to draw logical inferences from the combination of relevant facts, that is to say, the contextual, or circumstantial, evidence.",

As the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe charges against the applicant were not based on a \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01\u201d was (again, using identical wording to Ilgar Mammadov) \u201c in itself ... not sufficient to assume that Article 18 was breached\u201d, it held that, \u201cdepending on the circumstances of the case, improper reasons [could not] always be proven by pointing to a particularly inculpatory piece of evidence which clearly reveal[ed] an actual reason ... or a specific isolated incident\u201d, but it could be \u201cestablished to a sufficient degree that proof of improper reasons follow[ed] the combination of relevant case-specific facts\u201d, and that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s situation [could not] be viewed in isolation\u201d. The facts examined by the Court included \u201cthe general context of the increasingly harsh and restrictive legislative regulation of NGO activity and funding [which could not] be simply ignored\u201d, \u201cthe numerous statements by highranking officials and articles published in the pro-government media, where local NGOs and their leaders, including the applicant, were consistently accused of being a \u2018fifth column\u2019 for foreign interests, national traitors, foreign agents, and so on\u201d, and the fact that \u201c[s]everal notable human rights activists who [had] cooperated with international organisations for the protection of human rights, ... [had been] similarly arrested and charged with serious criminal offences entailing heavy imprisonment sentences\u201d. Those facts were analysed in the context of the submissions of the third-party interveners, who (as in the present case) included the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights. The latter testified that the case under examination \u201cwas an illustration of a serious and systemic human rights problem in Azerbaijan, which, in spite of numerous efforts by the Commissioner and other international stakeholders, to date remained unaddressed\u201d. The Court considered that the contextual facts \u201csupport[ed] the applicant\u2019s and the third parties\u2019 argument that his arrest and detention were part of a larger campaign to \u2018crack down on human rights defenders in Azerbaijan\u2019\u201d, and that \u201c[t]he totality of the above circumstances indicate[d] that the actual purpose of the impugned measures was to silence and punish the applicant for his activities in the area of human rights\u201d. On that basis it found a violation of Article 18 read in conjunction with Article 5 (\u00a7\u00a7 156-63). Thus it was demonstrated not only that the Court was itself able and ready to draw logical inferences from the contextual evidence, but also that that evidence could include proof presented not by the applicants themselves, but by other persons, in particular the third-party interveners.",

Contrary to what this judgment suggests, Khodorkovskiy, while ostensibly conceding the possibility of the \u201creasonable\u201d admission of contextual evidence of a \u201chidden agenda\u201d, effectively did not allow for its admission and examination, in particular (and even more so) of evidence not adduced by the applicants (see paragraphs\u00a06 and 7 above). If one judges not by mere words but by whether they are ever made reality, Khodorkovskiy in fact did not allow such admission and examination, not one jot, because the \u201creasonable inference from the context\u201d clause (see paragraph 6 above) was never applied, not even in circumstances where its application was the only way to lead the case to its logical end, and thus remained only theoretical and hypothetical \u2013 until Ilgar Mammadov broke the mould. In Khodorkovskiy itself the Court refused to make its \u201cown assessment of the specific facts\u201d. It simply stated that it \u201ctook note\u201d of the fact that \u201cthe combination of ... factors ... [had] caused many people to believe that the applicant\u2019s prosecution was driven by the desire to remove him from the political scene and, at the same time, to appropriate his wealth\u201d (\u00a7 259). Among these factors was \u201c[t]he fact that the suspect\u2019s political opponents or business competitors might directly or indirectly benefit from him being put in jail\u201d (\u00a7 258). The Court admitted that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s case [might] raise a certain suspicion as to the real intent of the authorities, and that this state of suspicion might be sufficient for the domestic courts [elsewhere referred to as \u201cseveral European courts\u201d] to refuse extradition, deny legal assistance, issue injunctions against the Russian Government, make pecuniary awards, etc.\u201d (\u00a7 260; emphasis added). It even assumed that \u201call courts had the same evidence and arguments before them\u201d. All that notwithstanding, the Court declared that \u201cits own standard of proof applied in Article\u00a018 cases [was] very high and [might] be different from those applied domestically\u201d. It coined (for the first time in its case-law) the \u201cKhodorkovskiy formula\u201d, which posited the \u201cfundamental difference\u201d between the \u201cpolitical process and adjudicative process\u201d (as if those other courts examined the facts not from a legal but from a political standpoint), and added that \u201c[i]t [was] often much easier for a politician to take a stand than for a judge, since the judge [had to] base his decision only on evidence in the legal sense\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 259 and 260).

Since the adoption of that judgment, there have been cases in which the Court took a principled stance on Article\u00a018 complaints. Among those one might mention, for instance, Kavala v. Turkey (no.\u00a028749/18, 10 December 2019). By the way, Kavala (\u00a7 217) also makes reference to the \u201cKhodorkovskiy formula\u201d alongside the paragraphs of Ilgar Mammadov and Rasul Jafarov mentioned in paragraph 23 above (all cited above; however, in Kavala there are more very pertinent citations from the last two cases). But in Kavala the Court\u2019s treatment of the contextual evidence, including that presented by the third-party interveners, differed substantially from the treatment undertaken in the present case and (despite the succinct reference to that evidence in the relevant part of the judgment) led to a different finding.",
