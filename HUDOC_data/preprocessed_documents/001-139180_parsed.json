He risked persecution in Iraq because he had worked as a professional soldier during the regime of Saddam Hussein and because he was involved in a blood feud after he had accidentally shot and killed a relative. He claimed to have served as a private in Fedayeen, a paramilitary group loyal to Saddam Hussein and the Ba\u2019athist government, from January 2002 to March 2003. He had at the same time held a medium-level position in the Ba\u2019ath party. Following the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, former members of Fedayeen had tried to recruit him to a new militia. When he had refused to join, he had been called a traitor and had received threatening letters. From January 2004 he had also been sought after frequently by the Iraqi authorities, the American troops and the Badr militia on account of his former membership in Fedayeen. He had left the family home to escape capture and had lived in different places in Baghdad, until August 2004 with an aunt and then until November 2005 with an uncle. Many members of Fedayeen had been killed after the regime change. When an acquaintance of his brother\u2019s had been killed, the applicant had realised that he also risked the same fate. Then a cousin had been killed in the applicant\u2019s family\u2019s home after the applicant had received a threatening letter containing a bullet. The applicant had therefore left Baghdad in November 2005 and had fled to Mandali in the Diyala governorate to live with another uncle. In February 2006 American troops and the Badr militia had raided the uncle\u2019s home, asking for the applicant. In Mandali he got into a fight with a distant relative in November 2006 and accidentally shot him when a warning shot had ricocheted. The man had later died from his injuries, and the dead man\u2019s family had sworn to kill the applicant in revenge. The applicant had immediately left for Syria together with his younger brother. In January 2008, they had been joined there by his wife, whom he had married in Mandali in May 2006. Soon thereafter she, as well as the brother, had returned to Iraq and he no longer had any contact with her. He knew, however, that she was pregnant. The applicant had remained in Syria until he travelled to Sweden. In addition to the wife and younger brother, who had returned from Syria, his mother, another brother and a sister were also living in Iraq. The applicant had heard that his mother and sister were moving around in the country. He did not know the whereabouts of the two brothers, nor did he know anything about his father, who had left the family following his parents\u2019 divorce in 1991 and who had held a high position in the Ba\u2019ath party at least until that year.",

The Board did not question that the applicant had been a member of Fedayeen and the Ba\u2019ath party. However, it had regard to country information, which indicated that former party members were no longer persecuted but were offered to get their old jobs back. The Board noted that, except for the alleged threatening letters, which had not been submitted to the Board, the applicant had lived for many years in Baghdad and Mandali without anything having happened to him. It also noted that the situation in Iraq had improved since the applicant had left the country. In regard to his claim that he was sought after by the Iraqi authorities and the American troops, the Board stated that the competent authorities were free to investigate whether he had committed any crimes during his time in Fedayeen or whether he held important information. Finally, the Board, noting that it had not been shown that the applicant had reported to Iraqi authorities that he had received threats on account of the alleged blood feud, considered that this was a local conflict with relatives in Mandali and held therefore that he should be able to return safely to, for instance, Baghdad.",

At the hearing the applicant made, inter alia, the following additional submissions. Fedayeen had fought against the American invasion of Iraq and many Americans had died during the fighting. Fedayeen was therefore generally hated by the Americans but also by the Iraqi population who saw it as an oppressor organisation. He had served as bodyguard for a colonel and had in that capacity accompanied him at visits to Saddam Hussein. After the fall of the regime of Saddam Hussein, the applicant and his colleagues had been attacked in their homes by American troops and the Badr militia. He could not seek protection from the Iraqi authorities, as he was wanted by the present government due to his former membership of Fedayeen and the Ba\u2019ath party. Furthermore, an uncle of the applicant\u2019s, who lived in Sweden, had made a visit to Iraq in November 2009 and had then been brutally assaulted by relatives of the man that the applicant had accidentally killed. These relatives had even threatened to kill the applicant\u2019s son, who was with the applicant\u2019s wife in Syria. The applicant had heard that he was wanted by the Iraqi police in relation to the relative\u2019s death. He could not move to another part of Iraq, because the authorities there would soon find out about his background and arrest him. Moreover, as a Sunni Arab, there was no possibility for him to move to the Kurdistan Region.",

The court considered the applicant\u2019s story to be coherent and detailed and did not find any reason to question it. As regards the threats emanating from Iraqi authorities, the American troops and the Badr militia, the court took into account that he had not held a prominent position in either the Ba\u2019ath party or Fedayeen and that a long time had passed since his departure from Iraq. Referring to country information, according to which former Ba\u2019ath party members were no longer persecuted or systematically attacked, the court concluded that it was not plausible that there was a remaining personal threat against the applicant on account of his previous political activities or work. Similarly, it noted that the threatening letter from the group established by former Fedayeen members had been received more than four years earlier and that there was no indication that this group had a remaining interest in him. With respect to the blood feud, the court noted that the relatives of the killed man had threatened to kill the applicant and his son, had approached the applicant\u2019s family and written a threatening message on the wall of the family\u2019s previous home and had assaulted his uncle. According to the court, this indicated that the applicant risked treatment upon return of a kind that placed him in the category of \u201can alien otherwise in need of protection\u201d under Chapter 4, section 2 of the Swedish Aliens Act (see further below, at \u00a7 13). As the shooting had occurred in the Diyala governorate, where the relatives of the killed man lived, and the subsequent events had taken place in Baghdad, the court found that the applicant was at risk in both the Diyala governorate and Baghdad. Nevertheless, in assessing whether there was an internal relocation alternative for him, the court had regard to country information and found that he would be able to safely relocate to the Sunni-dominated Anbar governorate where many internally displaced Sunni Arabs had settled. It noted that the applicant had not made it plausible that the threat posed by the relatives extended to that province or that he was at risk there for any other reason. It also took into account that the applicant was a young and healthy man who was fit to work.",

Armed groups are also thought to be responsible for targeted attacks on government and security officials, politicians, tribal and religious leaders, and members of religious and ethnic minorities, among others. Occasionally, local cells manage to coordinate attacks across the country. The number of civilian casualties, though less than at the peak of violence in 2006 and 2007, remains nonetheless significant with around 4,000 civilians killed in both 2010 and 2011, respectively. At least 464 civilians were killed in January 2012, in what appeared to be a surge in mass casualty attacks. Shi\u2019ite civilians have been the most affected.

The number of civilian deaths from suicide attacks and car bombs decreased in 2011 compared to previous years, to an average of 6.6 per day. While these attacks still account for the highest number of civilian deaths each month, the number of civilians killed from gunfire/executions rose to an average of 4.6 per day in 2011. This suggests that an increasing number of Iraqis, especially government and security officials, are being individually targeted. Violence is mostly concentrated in the predominantly Sunni or mixed central governorates of Al-Anbar, Baghdad, Diyala, Ninewa, Kirkuk, and Salah Al-Din, but occasionally moves into the mainly Shi\u2019ite governorates further south. Armed Sunni groups such as Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq and Ansar Al-Islam are thought to be responsible for most of the violence. Shi\u2019ite armed groups have to a large extent been integrated into the ISF [Iraqi security forces] and the political process, though they reportedly maintain their independent military capabilities and at times threaten to use it to further their political agendas. Armed groups target civilians on the basis of their (imputed) political views, religion, ethnicity, social status or a combination of reasons. As a result of the weak law enforcement and justice system, persons at risk of persecution are reportedly unable to find protection or judicial redress. Observers mention undue political influence, the lack of trained legal professionals and corruption as further obstacles to the administration of justice, including in the Kurdistan Region. Legal professionals continue to work in a very difficult security environment, and remain a target of armed groups. Crime is widespread and some armed groups reportedly engage in extortion, kidnappings and armed robberies to fund their other, politically \u2013 or religiously, or ideologically \u2013 motivated activities, conflating acts of persecution and criminality. Consequently, the line between persecution and criminality appears to be increasingly blurred.\u201d",

Furthermore, following the withdrawal of the American troops, a potential threat from the Americans was no longer relevant.

However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a046827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2005-I). These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v. France, judgment of 29 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, \u00a7 40).",

While persons with such affiliations were systematically attacked and killed by armed groups in the years following the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, international sources indicate that this is no longer the case (see \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 22 above). Individuals with such profiles may still be at risk today, but it appears that this is so only in certain parts of Iraq and only if some other factors are at hand, such as the individual having held a prominent position in either organisation. The applicant has himself stated that he served as a private in Fedayeen and held a medium-level position in the Ba\u2019ath party. Having regard to this, the long time that has passed since he left these organisations and the fact that neither he nor his family has received any threats because of this involvement for many years, the Court finds that it has not been shown that he risks ill-treatment in Iraq at the hands of former members of the organisations in question. Furthermore, there is no indication that the American military or the Badr militia should have a remaining interest in him. Nor is there any such indication in relation to the authorities of the present Iraqi government. In the latter respect, the Court additionally notes that the applicant applied for a passport to those authorities and had one issued in July 2010. Notwithstanding the possibility that the passport was obtained via a friend and the applicant\u2019s speculation that it was not issued by the proper authorities, the Court agrees with the Government that the fact that the applicant actually applied for it to the Iraqi authorities indicates that he did not perceive them as a great threat.",

However, the Court has held that reliance on such an alternative does not affect the responsibility of the expelling Contracting State to ensure that the applicant is not, as a result of its decision to expel, exposed to treatment contrary to Article 3. Therefore, as a precondition of relying on an internal flight or relocation alternative, certain guarantees have to be in place: the person to be expelled must be able to travel to the area concerned, gain admittance and settle there, failing which an issue under Article 3 may arise, the more so if in the absence of such guarantees there is a possibility of his or her ending up in a part of the country of origin where there is a real risk of illtreatment (Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom, nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07, \u00a7 266, 28 June 2011, with further references).",

The Court\u2019s case-law on internal flight relocation is clear. The relevant principles are articulated in Salah Sheek v. the Netherlands and have been confirmed, more recently, in Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom. The Court considers that, as a precondition for relying on an internal flight alternative, certain guarantees have to be in place. These include: (i) that the person to be expelled must be able to travel safely to the area concerned; (ii) that the person concerned must be able to gain admittance to the area concerned; and (iii) that the person concerned must be able to settle in the area concerned. Furthermore, such guarantees must be in place at the point when the assessment of risk under Article 3 is being made by the Court.",

A consideration of the transit risks is all the more important having regard to the recent escalation in violence in Iraq. As in M.Y.H. and Others v.\u00a0Sweden, this case raises a serious question concerning the application of the Convention and, in particular, the quality of the guarantees that must exist as a precondition for a state\u2019s reliance upon internal flight relocation as a means of circumventing the absolute nature of the prohibition contained in Article 3 of the Convention.",
