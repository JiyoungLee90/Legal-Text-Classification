It found that the restitution order had been based on the confiscation order of August 1948, according to which the total surface area of the land formerly owned by the applicants\u2019 predecessor had been six shinik. However, the confiscation decision dated 17 December 1948, on the basis of which the plot had been confiscated, had specified that the surface area of the confiscated land had been 3,349 sq. m. The Restitution Commission also referred to evidence submitted on 23 August 2001 by the Land Registry Office, according to which the area of the plot had been six shinik and had represented a part of a larger plot of land, the total surface area of which was 8,309 sq. m. A further extract from a \u201cGeodetic Review of the Association of Land Experts of Macedonia\u201d and \u201cReview of old units of land area and their conversion into hectares, areas and sq. m\u201d, issued on the basis of a letter dated 25\u00a0March 1952, specified that one shinik corresponded to 650 sq. m.

In such circumstances, the Commission found that the applicants had unlawfully obtained possession of 4,546 sq. m of land, on the basis of the restitution order. For those reasons, the Commission held that the restitution order had been contrary to sections 1 and 2 of the Restitution Act and was legally unenforceable pursuant to section 267(1)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act.

In the same way as material goods, certain other rights and interests constituting assets can also be regarded as \u201cproperty rights\u201d, and thus as \u201cpossessions\u201d for the purposes of this provision. In each case the issue that needs to be examined is whether the circumstances of the case, considered as a whole, conferred on the applicant title to a substantive interest protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for instance, Broniowski v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, \u00a7 129, ECHR 2004V, with further references).",

Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicants had a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 even if their title was later rendered null and void by the effect of the impugned nullity decision. In this connection, it should be stressed that it would be unreasonable to accept that a State may enact legislation which allows nullification of titles to property and thus escape responsibility for an interference with property rights under the Convention (compare Gashi v. Croatia, no. 32457/05, \u00a7\u00a022, 13\u00a0December 2007). It follows that the Government\u2019s second objection must likewise be rejected.",

The very fact that a bigger plot of land had been restored to the applicants signified that the restitution had been in breach of the Restitution Act. Moreover, under the relevant legislation at the time of confiscation, a confiscation act had had to precede a confiscation decision, the latter being more specific. The Solicitor General, in the interests of the State, had sought an annulment of the incorrect restitution order. The decision of 14 January 2009 had been lawful and aimed at protecting the public interest and the rights of third parties. In the fresh restitution proceedings following the quashing of the restitution order, the plot of land confiscated from the applicants\u2019 predecessor had been identified as covering an area of 3,349 sq. m. Furthermore, at a certain point in the proceedings there had been an interim measure imposed by one of the applicants and the State had continued to process their application for restitution.

In this sense the Court notes that when deciding the Supreme Court had several pieces of evidence which had not been made available to the Restitution Commission when it had initially decided and which confirmed the surface area of the land in question as being 3,349 sq. m (see paragraph\u00a031 above). From the above, it is clear that the Supreme Court exercised its power of review in order to correct the fundamental defect made by the Restitution Commission, which had made a restitution order that had not been possible to legally enforce as it had been contrary to the provisions of the Restitution Act as well as the interests of third parties which had not been party to the proceedings. In so doing the Supreme Court advanced reasons of a substantial and compelling character that justified the extraordinary quashing of the final restitution order (compare Vikentijevik, cited above, \u00a7 72, and contrast, Bo\u010dvarska v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 27865/02, \u00a7\u00a7 82, 83, 17 September 2009).",

In this connection it notes that on the basis of the errors specified above, the case was returned to the Restitution Commission for a fresh examination and the applicants were granted restitution of a plot of land as well as monetary compensation for a plot of 3,349 sq. m (see paragraph 35 above). Lastly, in the event that third parties obtain possession of the plot of land which the applicants had erroneously obtained before, the applicants will still have the legal possibility to claim their property rights under section 63 of the Restitution Act (see paragraph 37 above).",
