Indeed, under sections 7 and 8 of the Act Regulating Records of Pensions and Disability Insurance Beneficiaries (see paragraph 33 above), it was incumbent on the employer, and not the employee, to supply the Fund with all the relevant information regarding the period of employment in question. Furthermore, under section 19 of the same Act, it is the responsibility of the Fund and its branch offices to create and maintain individual records of employment (see paragraph 34 above).",

Such a conclusion also follows from the findings of the Second-Instance Commission, which  although it established the existence of erroneous data with regard to the period of the applicant\u2019s employment \u2013 failed to establish any liability on the part of the applicant for providing such data. It rather held that the applicant had endorsed the use of the incorrect data on which the Fund had relied when granting her request. However, the Court notes that it failed to explain the manner in which the applicant had allegedly endorsed the incorrect provision of data (see paragraph 17 above). In this connection, it should be noted that the Fund itself established the relevant facts when granting the applicant\u2019s request for a pension, without any involvement on the part of the applicant through which she could have consented to the provision of incorrect information.",
