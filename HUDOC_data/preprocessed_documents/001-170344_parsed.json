It is only in the light of these findings that a thorough assessment can be made whether a refusal is consonant with universally accepted morality rules (regu\u0142y moralno\u015bci) and whether or not it is detrimental to other interests worthy of legal protection (Supreme Court decision no. I CKN 871/00 of 4 October 2001). The factors to be taken into account include, inter alia, the spouses\u2019 health, age and ability to earn a living and the length of the marriage (Supreme Court decision nos.

The right to marry originated essentially in the individuals\u2019 wish to found a family and should, as such, be protected. European law did not recognise the right to divorce. The legal prohibition of divorce was not contrary to either Article 8 or Article 12 of the Convention. In any event, there was no European consensus as to the possibility of obtaining a divorce when an innocent party opposed it, even in situations where there had been a definitive breakdown of marital relations.

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Mikuli\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 53176/99, \u00a7\u00a057, ECHR 2002-I). However, the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under this provision do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests (see S.H. and Others v.\u00a0Austria [GC], no.\u00a057813/00, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2011-V); and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see, among other authorities, Mizzi v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a026111/02, \u00a7 106, ECHR 2006I (extracts) and Jeunesse v.\u00a0the Netherlands [GC], no. 12738/10, \u00a7\u00a0106, ECHR 2014). In the area of framing their divorce laws and implementing them in concrete cases, the Contracting Parties enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention and to reconcile the competing personal interests at stake (compare and contrast, Johnston and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055).",

The Government have certainly not proved as much. As a matter of fact, the Government did not even substantiate how the interference (which, after eleven years, amounts to an impossibility to remarry) serves the cause of morals.

But this is not the end of the matter. As will be demonstrated below, the problem lies not in the legislative purpose, but in the vague legal framework adopted to implement the Convention obligations and the disproportionate judgment delivered by the domestic courts in the light of it. Since the State interference with the applicant\u2019s right to protection of de facto family life finds no justification under Article 8 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention, it may be assumed prima facie that such interference also violates Article 12 of the Convention, namely the applicant\u2019s right to remarry.

In a society adhering to the principle of monogamy, the right to remarry presupposes the right to divorce. In addition to the lack of clarity and legal certainty in national law, the legal requirements for divorce were interpreted and applied by the domestic courts in the present case in such a disproportionate way that the very essence (the minimum core) of the applicant\u2019s right to remarry was impaired. As in the cases of prohibition on prisoners\u2019 right to marry, the discretion theoretically available in Polish divorce law may be very wide, indeed excessively wide, in assessing the compatibility of a refusal to consent to divorce with the principles of social coexistence, but the decisive element is how it is applied in practice.",

In other words, the wide discretion left by law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, was used by the domestic courts to concede to the innocent spouse a one-sided, unconstrained de facto veto on divorce.",

The Convention obligation to protect marriage-based family life requires such punishment. When disrespect for the obligations of marriage, including the obligations of fidelity and assistance, results in a complete and irretrievable breakdown of marriage, the guilty spouse should be punished adequately by civil law.

In Poland, the law provides for the right to divorce, but the legal requirements are so vague that they transform the right to remarry into a legal fiction. In fact, the very essence of the applicant\u2019s right to remarry was impaired, due to a restrictive interpretation and strict application of the law in his case.
