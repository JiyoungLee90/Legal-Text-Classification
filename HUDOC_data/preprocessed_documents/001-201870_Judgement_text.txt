The case originated in an application (no. 24917/15) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by nineteen Afghan nationals on 17 May 2015. A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix.
The applicants were represented by Ms Z. Števulová, a lawyer from the Slovak branch of the Human Rights League, an international non-governmental organisation (NGO). The Government of the Slovak Republic (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Pirošíková.
The applicants alleged that their expulsion to Ukraine had been collective in nature and that they had not had an effective remedy in respect of it. In particular, they alleged that the State authorities had not carried out an individual assessment and examination of their cases and had denied them access to the asylum procedure.
On 26 September 2016 the complaints concerning Article 4 of Protocol No. 4, taken alone and in conjunction with Article 13 of the Convention, were communicated to the Government, and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible, pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
On 17 November 2014 at 1.30 a.m. the Slovak Border and Foreigners Police (“the police”) apprehended, near the Ukrainian border, the nineteen applicants, together with other Afghan nationals. The applicants were found hidden in a truck whose driver fled after the police patrol had followed the vehicle which had not reacted to warning signs; none of them were carrying identity documents.
According to the Government, thirty-two persons, including the applicants, were subsequently taken to the border police station in Petrovce (“the police station”) for the purposes of an identity check. Ten police officers were assigned to record their statements and document their cases; other officers were involved in undertaking certain actions around the site where the applicants had been apprehended and in providing transfers to the police station. A Persian-language translator was present from 9 a.m. for twenty-four hours and assisted the police in their dealings with the applicants. As to the other thirteen persons (the persons other than the nineteen applicants) brought to the police station, one of them was taken for a medical examination; the remaining twelve (five men, five women and two children) – who had asked for asylum – were transferred to a reception centre for asylum seekers on 18 November 2014 at 2 a.m. The Government provided a copy of the note on that transfer, which contained the names of the persons concerned.
The Government submitted, in respect of the applicants, the following documents, dated 17 November 2014, most of which were signed by the applicants and the interpreter:
- official notes, according to which the applicants had been brought to the police station for the purposes of establishing their identity;
- transcripts of oral explanations provided by the applicants concerning their irregular border-crossing; according to those transcripts, all the applicants had answered in the negative when asked by the police whether they had suffered persecution in their country of origin and whether they wished to seek asylum in Slovakia, stating that they had left Afghanistan for economic reasons and wanted to go to Germany;
- documents whereby the applicants had been informed of the commencement of the proceedings on their administrative expulsion and of their right to legal aid;
- transcripts of the interviews conducted with the applicants in their capacity as parties to the expulsion proceedings, whereby they had declared that they had not suffered any kind of persecution in Afghanistan nor been sentenced to death there;
- documents whereby each applicant had been informed of the possibility to comment on the contents of his respective case file and to adduce evidence, neither of which possibilities the applicants had used;
- police decisions, rendered individually in respect of each applicant but with the same wording, on the applicants’ administrative expulsion to Ukraine on the basis of sections 77 § 1 and 82 § 1 (a) of the Aliens Act (Law no. 404/2011 Coll., as amended), including a three-year ban on re-entering Slovak territory under Article 82 § 3 (b); pursuant to Article 83 § 2 (a) of the Aliens Act, the applicants had not been given any time-limit in respect of their voluntary departure, and the suspensive effect of any possible appeal had been excluded on the grounds of urgent public interest, pursuant to section 55(2) of the Administrative Proceedings Act (Law no. 71/1967 Coll., as amended); according to the instruction at the end of each decision regarding available remedies, an appeal against a decision could be lodged within fifteen days of the respective applicant being notified of that decision, and any subsequent decision was reviewable by a court; according to the note on the last page of that instruction, the decisions in question had been handed over to the applicants, as affirmed by the applicants’ and the interpreter’s signatures;
- documents whereby the applicants had been informed that their personal data would be registered in the information systems of the Slovak Ministry of Interior, in the EURODAC system, and in the Schengen information system;
- documents whereby the applicants had been informed of the possibility for them to ask the International Organization for Migration to be voluntarily returned to their home country;
- requests for the readmission of the applicants to Ukraine, issued by the police in a simplified procedure; documents certifying that the applicants had been returned to the Ukrainian authorities at 10.30 p.m. on 17 November 2014; and official notes on the execution of the expulsion decisions.
According to the above documents, all the interviews lasted exactly ten minutes and were conducted by two police officers in the presence of the interpreter. The times of some interviews, as given in the documents, overlapped – for example, between 9.20 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. two police officers and the same interpreter were recorded as being present at three different interviews. The questions were standardised, and most of the applicants’ recorded answers were identical; the only difference was in the respective amounts of money the applicants were recorded as having in their possession.
Before the Court, the applicants submitted that the police had not properly identified all of them, that only a few of them had been interviewed, and that they had been made to sign documents of unknown content in the Slovak language, having been told that those documents related to their asylum requests and that they would be transferred to a reception centre for asylum seekers. They also maintained that they had been given no information regarding the asylum procedure in Slovakia; they had nevertheless approached police officers with requests for asylum and for legal assistance, but the police had ignored them – even though they had transferred the remaining twelve persons to an establishment for asylum seekers. Moreover, the interpreter was present for a few hours only, as affirmed by the transcripts of the interviews, according to which all those interviews had taken place between 9.10 a.m. and 12.30 p.m.
It appears from the expulsion decisions of 17 November 2014 that the police took into account the economic situation of the applicants and the absence of any family ties in Slovakia, and that they examined the existence of any obstacles to the administrative expulsion, within the meaning of section 81 of the Aliens Act and with regard to Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention. In that the police also based their standpoint on the statements made by the applicants, who had not alleged any interference with their private and family life in Ukraine or any risk of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if they were returned there. The police furthermore emphasised that the applicants were not at risk of any forced return to their country of origin (which had been confirmed at a bilateral meeting at the Slovak/Ukraine border of persons with the relevant authority), and that Ukraine had ratified the Convention.
On the basis of the above decisions on their administrative expulsion, the applicants were expelled to Ukraine on the same day (17 November 2014) at 10.30 p.m. They maintained that they had not been given copies of the decisions while they had still been on Slovak territory and that they had obtained copies only later by authorising their current legal representative to inspect their respective case files.
In Ukraine, the applicants were placed in the temporary detention centre in the town of Chop.
The file contains a copy of an email string between employees of an NGO in Ukraine who from 18 November 2014 onwards were allowed to talk to the applicants and lawyers from the Slovak branch of the Human Rights League, which resulted in the lodging of the appeals detailed. It appears from the email string that the applicants had been stating, since 18 November 2014, that they had asked for asylum in Slovakia and did not understand why they had been removed from Slovakia (unlike the other twelve migrants who had been arrested with the applicants); they also expressed the view that the interpreter had provided an inaccurate translation.
On 25 November 2014, the first four applicants (Zabi Asady, Farid Ahmad Ahmadi, Ali Ahmadi, Sher Badov Shinwari) instructed a lawyer and lodged an appeal against the administrative expulsion decisions against them, alleging a violation of their procedural rights and a violation of Article 13 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 3 and Article 4 of Protocol No. 4. They maintained that only one person from their group had been questioned by the police and that the others had merely been handed documents in Slovak for them to sign, having been told that they would be taken to a reception centre for asylum seekers; thus, the obstacles to their expulsion and the risk of their indirect refoulement to Afghanistan where they feared prosecution had not been examined. Furthermore, their requests for asylum had been ignored by the Slovak police, they had not had access to any legal aid, and they had been expelled without having been first served with the relevant decision and without having had an effective remedy at their disposal. In their view, the situation complained of had thus amounted to collective expulsion, which was prohibited by Article 4 of Protocol No. 4.
On 10 and 25 December 2014, the applicants were transferred to another detention centre (in the municipality of Zhuravychi).
On 7 January 2015, the Slovak border police directorate dismissed their appeals and confirmed the impugned decisions of 17 November 2014. Referring to the contents of the file, the border police directorate pointed out that interpretation into Persian had been provided throughout the entire proceedings on expulsion; moreover, the applicants had been duly informed of their rights, had signed the relevant documents and had expressly stated that they did not want to ask for asylum. Furthermore, individual decisions had been delivered in respect of all the applicants and there had been no obstacles to their expulsion to Ukraine.
According to their legal representative, some applicants returned to Afghanistan, where they live under unstable conditions due to the deteriorating security situation in the country, which does not always allow them access to means of communication. Others are asylum seekers in Europe, with only occasional access to the Internet or telephone. In the light of those specific circumstances, their legal representative has created a Facebook group with a view to staying in contact with the applicants.

Section 17(1) authorises the police to seek explanations, where required, from anyone who can contribute to the clarification of facts that are of importance in uncovering a misdemeanour or administrative offence and the perpetrator thereof, or facts of importance in tracking down missing or wanted persons or items.
Under sections 18(3) and (4), the police can take a person to a police station for the purposes of verifying his or her identity if that person is unable to credibly prove his or her name and surname, date of birth and place of residence.
Under section 3(1), asylum proceedings are launched by means of a declaration by the individual concerned to the relevant police department that he or she is applying for asylum or subsidiary protection on the territory of the Slovak Republic. Section 3(2)(b) provides that if a foreigner requests asylum after entering the territory of the Slovak Republic, the authority authorised to receive the asylum request is the police office established within the asylum facility. Under section 3(8), if a foreigner applies for asylum at a police office that does not have authority to receive an asylum request, that police office is obliged to inform the applicant of the relevant police office and provide him or her with a travel document valid for twenty-four hours; alternatively, it may decide that he or she should be detained.
Under section 77 § 2, the collective expulsion of foreigners on the basis of one single decision is inadmissible.
Section 81 enumerates the obstacles to administrative expulsion. Under section 81(1), it is not possible to expel an alien to a country where his life would be at risk on the grounds of race, nationality, religion, or association with a social group or political conviction, or where he would be at risk of torture or of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is also not possible to expel an alien to a country that has imposed on him the death penalty or where he can be expected to receive such a sentence in pending criminal proceedings.
Under section 81(2), an alien cannot be expelled to a country where his liberty would be at risk on the grounds of race, nationality, religion, or association with a social group or political conviction; this does not apply if, by his behaviour, the alien puts national security at risk or if he has been convicted of a criminal offence and represents a danger to Slovakia.
Under section 81(4), an alien cannot be expelled to a country where he would be at risk of a forced return to [his or her country of origin], as described in section 81(1) and (2).
Section 82(1)(a) provides that the border police can authorise the administrative expulsion of a third-country national if he or she has irregularly crossed the external border, or if he or she intentionally avoids or refuses to undergo border control checks when crossing the external border.
Under section 83(1) and (2), a third-country national in respect of whom an administrative expulsion decision has been rendered is obliged to leave the territory within the period allowed for voluntary departure set out in the expulsion decision (which should fall between seven and thirty days of that decision gaining force). If it is deemed likely that the person in question might escape or otherwise obstruct or hinder the exercise of the administrative expulsion – and in particular if the person’s identity cannot be verified, or if the third-country national threatens the State’s security, public order, public health or the rights and freedoms of others – the police need not stipulate any deadline in respect of voluntary departure.
An appeal can be lodged against an administrative expulsion decision within fifteen days of the person concerned being notified thereof (sections 53 and 54(2)).
Under section 55(2), an appeal lodged against an administrative decision before the expiry of the relevant time-limit has suspensive effect, unless provided otherwise. The administrative authority may exclude the suspensive effect only if the urgent public interest so requires, or if there is a risk that by suspending the enforcement of a decision a party to the proceedings or a third person might suffer irreparable damage.
The relevant international documents are listed in Sharifi and Others v. Italy and Greece (no. 16643/09, §§ 51-82, 21 October 2014) and in N.D. and N.T. v. Spain ([GC], nos. 8675/15 and 8697/15, §§ 41-67).
In a 124-page report published in December 2010 entitled “Buffeted in the Borderland. The Treatment of Asylum Seekers and Migrants in Ukraine”, the NGO Human Rights Watch described the findings of its research into the experience of migrants and asylum seekers who had been returned to Ukraine from Hungary and Slovakia. The report states that “according to the bilateral agreements, migrants caught entering Poland, Slovakia and Hungary without permission can be summarily returned if caught within 48 hours of a crossing. The launching of an appeal in Slovakia and Hungary does not suspend the return and returnees do not have access to minimal information on arrest and return. In practice, Human Rights Watch found that migrants were often tricked into believing they would not be returned, were asked to sign papers they did not understand, and were not always given an opportunity to contact a lawyer, NGOs or UNHCR.” Specifically with regard to Slovakia, Human Rights Watch stated that “the most common complaint heard from migrants who had been returned from Slovakia was that their asylum claims were ignored and that they were treated in summary fashion [and] quickly sent back within hours of apprehension in Slovakia, with little opportunity to make any claim to remain.
