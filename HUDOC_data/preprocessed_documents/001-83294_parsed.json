It has already been accepted in the Convention organs' case-law that a person's right to protection of his or her reputation is encompassed by Article 8 as being part of the right to respect for private life. In Chauvy and Others v. France (no. 64915/01, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2004VI), concerning a case brought under Article 10, the Court found that a person's reputation, which was affected by the publication of a book, was protected by Article 8 as part of the right to respect for private life and had to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression (this approach was followed in Abeberry v. France (dec.), no. 58729/00, 21 September 2004, and Leempoel & S.A. ED. Cin\u00e9 Revue v. Belgium, no. 64772/01, \u00a7 67, 9\u00a0November 2006). In White v. Sweden (no. 42435/02, \u00a7\u00a7 19 and 30, 19\u00a0September 2006), relating to a complaint under Article 8, the right to protection of one's reputation against allegedly defamatory statements in newspaper articles was considered to fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d (see also, mutatis mutandis, Minelli v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 14991/02, 14\u00a0June 2005, in which a complaint about the alleged failure to protect a person against a critical newspaper article was considered to fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d as protected by Article 8, while the question whether that Article embodied a right to protection of reputation and honour as such was left open in Gunnarsson v. Iceland (dec.), no. 4591/04, 20 October 2005). Finally, in Fayed and the House of Fraser Holdings plc v. the United Kingdom (no. 17101/90, Commission decision of 15 May 1992), the European Commission of Human Rights had found that the publication of certain findings in a report drawn up by the State authorities constituted an interference with the applicants' right to respect for their private life within the meaning of Article 8. The Court considers that a person's reputation, even if that person is criticised in the context of a public debate, forms part of his or her personal identity and psychological integrity and therefore also falls within the scope of his or her \u201cprivate life\u201d. Article 8 therefore applies. This is not disputed by the parties.",

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private and family life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves. The boundary between the State's positive and negative obligations under this provision does not lend itself to precise definition. The applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Von Hannover, cited above, \u00a7 57, with further references).",

In this context, the Court reiterates its established case-law to the effect that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. Where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (see, for instance, Feldek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 75-76; Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2001II; De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 236, \u00a7 47; and Oberschlick v.  (no. 2), judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997IV, p. 1276, \u00a7 33).

This was explicitly accepted by the domestic courts in the present proceedings (see paragraph 20 above). Whether or not an act has a causal link with another is not a matter of speculation, but is a fact susceptible of proof. Although it is undisputed that the applicant had written a critical commentary on P.'s article in 1995 and that, years later, in 2000, P. had been charged under the Prohibition Act in relation to this article and had committed suicide, the defendant had not offered any proof for the alleged causal link between the applicant's article and P.'s death. It is true that statements that shock or offend the public or a particular person are also protected by the right to freedom of expression under Article 10. However, the statement here at issue went beyond that, claiming that the applicant had caused Professor P.'s death by ultimately driving him to commit suicide. By writing this, Mr M.'s letter to the subscribers to Zur Zeit overstepped acceptable limits, because it in fact accused the applicant of acts tantamount to criminal behaviour.",

To my mind this is a value judgment in the form of an opinion based on the sequence of events, and this opinion may be held to express a possibility which cannot be considered unreasonable. It is important to note that the impugned statement did not contain an accusation that the applicant, through his article, had planned to cause P. to commit suicide. And no intelligent person could possibly understand the statement as implying such an accusation. In so far as the impugned statement can reasonably be interpreted as meaning that the applicant's article and other similar criticisms or judicial proceedings by other persons against P. had led him to commit suicide without this having been the intention of any of these persons, I do not find any defamation of the applicant that could justify a finding of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. As to the use of the term \u201chunting society\u201d, I agree with the Vienna Court of Appeal that this term does not necessarily mean a group of persons who coordinated their activities with the aim of destroying P.'s existence. In the context of the above facts it may reasonably be understood to mean several persons who through their acts \u2013 such as articles \u2013 had hurt P.'s feelings, and therefore could be grouped together in one category (that of the \u201chunting society\u201d). The term \u201chunting\u201d, if taken literally, is excessive, but, in my opinion, it was used more as a figure of speech, in order to designate the unfriendly attitude of these persons towards P.",

The statement that a person had driven somebody else to commit suicide is indeed a severe reproach \u2013 which nevertheless should be possible in an open society; social pressure which induces somebody to commit suicide is blameworthy, but by no means a basis for a criminal charge or penalty.
