The courts\u2019 belief had been based, in addition to other evidence, on statements by the victim, Ms T., and by the applicant\u2019s co-accused, Mr P. The Government further submitted that the applicant\u2019s continued detention was the result of the courts\u2019 assessment of his liability to abscond, obstruct justice and tamper with witnesses, given the gravity of the charges against him, and his personality. The case-file materials demonstrated that the victim, Ms T., had initially made incorrect statements, which the Russian courts had interpreted as evidence of the applicant\u2019s ability to manipulate witnesses. In particular, on a number of occasions the applicant had threatened Ms T. and her daughter with a weapon in order to force them into signing the ownership documents. Furthermore, the applicant had the opportunity to leave , as he had a travel passport and had relatives living abroad whom he had visited on a number of occasions. Furthermore, the Government stressed that the Russian courts had attributed particular weight to information provided by police officials. The information concerned the applicant\u2019s involvement in a large criminal group organised and headed for more than ten years by a mob leader, \u201cVasya Bryanskiy\u201d. In the Government\u2019s opinion, the investigating authorities\u2019 inability to identify all members of the criminal group, the fact that certain of its members had been on the run and that the group had strong ties with corrupt officials in various State bodies, had made the applicant prone to obstruct justice by way of bribing or threatening witnesses. The Government concluded by noting that the authorities had taken effective action in dealing with the case and that there had not been any delays for which they could be held liable. The Government observed that the criminal case was extremely complex, that the case file comprised eighty-three volumes, and that a large number of defendants was involved in the case.",

While authorising or extending his detention neither the investigating authorities nor the courts had been able to point to any instance when he had failed to comply with the investigators\u2019 or courts\u2019 summons or orders. They had also been unable to identify any witness who had been threatened or bribed by the applicant. The courts had never truly considered the application of any other, more lenient, measure of restraint, such as bail or house arrest. The applicant submitted that his detention for more than a year had been primarily based on the gravity of the charges against him, despite the fact that there had not yet been a finding on his guilt or innocence. Having concluded that the applicant was liable to abscond, the courts had in fact imposed on him the burden of proving the absence of such a risk. The applicant pointed out that the domestic courts had linked the risk that he would abscond to the fact that he had a travel passport and relatives abroad. However, the travel passport seized by the investigators during the applicant\u2019s arrest had never been returned to him. Furthermore, he had had extremely strong ties to , in the form of his family (his wife, three daughters, two sisters, two granddaughters and his wife\u2019s elderly parents), work and household. His age and poor health were additional factors making it unlikely that he would escape. The fact that his daughter lived in  should not have been taken on its own as primary evidence of his intention to evade justice.",

The credibility of that information had surprisingly never been questioned by the courts, and he had been denied an effective opportunity to challenge the veracity of that information, as it had no references to sources, was not based on witness statements, and so on. In the applicant\u2019s opinion, it was more important that, having extended his detention on a number of occasions, the domestic courts had not once cited a specific episode of his behaviour directed at manipulating witnesses, except for the alleged threatening behaviour with the gun towards Ms T. and her daughter in 2005 to force them to sign the papers. The applicant stated that even if the courts\u2019 findings of his behaviour in 2005 had been correct, there was no evidence that he had ever taken steps to contact Ms T. or her daughter or any other witness of the alleged crimes after 2005. He stressed that in all those years he had accidentally met Ms T. once in a street in , in 2006.",

Until conviction the accused must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continued detention ceases to be reasonable. A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons to justify his or her continued detention (see, among other authorities, Castravet v.

Having said that, the Court would emphasise that there is a general rule that the domestic courts, in particular the trial court, are better placed to examine all the circumstances of the case and take all the necessary decisions, including those in respect of pre-trial detention. The Court may intervene only in situations where the rights and liberties guaranteed under the Convention have been infringed (see B\u0105k v. Poland, no. 7870/04, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2007II (extracts)). In the present case the national courts also relied on other circumstances, including the fact that the applicant had a travel passport and relatives permanently residing outside , that he had frequently travelled abroad and that he had substantial financial resources. While the Court doubts whether those circumstances, taken on their own, could have justified the domestic courts\u2019 finding about the necessity of the applicant\u2019s continued detention, it is satisfied that the totality of those factors combined with other relevant grounds could have provided the domestic courts with an understanding of the pattern of the applicant\u2019s behaviour and the persistence of a risk of his absconding.",

The Court reiterates that, as regards the risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses, the judicial authorities cited statements by the victims who had complained to the investigating authorities about the threats mounted against them. The authorities also considered that the applicant\u2019s substantial financial resources and his ties to the criminal underworld and to \u201ccorrupt\u201d officials in various law-enforcement agencies gave him an opportunity to influence witnesses and to destroy evidence if released (see paragraph 7 above). In these circumstances the Court is prepared to accept that at the initial stage of the proceedings the courts could have validly presumed the existence of a risk that, if released, the applicant might abscond, reoffend or interfere with the proceedings given the nature of his criminal activities (see, for similar reasoning, B\u0105k, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

While not being convinced that the applicant\u2019s medical condition entirely mitigated the risk of his absconding, so that it was no longer sufficient to outweigh his right to a trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, the Court is of the opinion that the risk of collusion was so high that it could not be negated by the applicant\u2019s state of health to the extent that his detention could no longer be warranted. The decisions to extend the detention underlined the fact that the fears of collusion were founded on the specific instances of threats being made against the victims, on the applicant\u2019s particular status in the criminal underworld and the fact that the applicant stood accused of an organised criminal act, with several members of the criminal group being on the run. The authorities considered the risk of pressure being brought to bear on the parties to the proceedings to be real. The Court readily understands that in such circumstances the authorities considered it necessary to keep the applicant detained in order to prevent him from disrupting the criminal proceedings. It reiterates that the fear of reprisal, justifiable in the present case, can often be enough for intimidated witnesses to withdraw from the criminal justice process altogether. The Court observes that the domestic courts carefully balanced the safety of the witnesses who had already given statements against the applicant, together with the prospect of other witnesses\u2019 willingness to testify, against the applicant\u2019s right to liberty.",

The Court does not underestimate the fact that the domestic authorities have to take statements from witnesses in a manner which will exclude any doubt as to their veracity. The Court thus concludes that, in the circumstances of the case, the risk of the applicant interfering with the course of justice actually existed and justified holding him in custody for the entire relevant period (see, for similar reasoning, Celejewski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 17584/04, 4 May 2006, and \u0141aszkiewicz v.

The remoteness of the criminal acts in time from the institution of the criminal proceedings was another factor in complicating the investigators\u2019 task. The Court also does not lose sight of the fact that the authorities needed to balance the necessity to proceed with the investigation against an obligation to ensure that the applicant was fully fit to take part in it. The national authorities displayed diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court reiterates that while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the efforts of the authorities to clarify fully the facts in issue, to provide the defence with all the necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case and to give judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence to be imposed (see, for similar reasoning, B\u0105k, cited above, \u00a7 64) .",
