First of all, the applicants did not undergo forensic medical examinations until 6 July 2005, that is, over three years after the institution of the investigation. In cases concerning allegations of ill-treatment a medical examination to establish the gravity of the injuries, as well as when and how they were inflicted, is the most elemental step. It is crucial for the subsequent conduct of the investigation that it is carried out with utmost expedition, since any delay hinders the accuracy of its findings on account of healing of the injuries, thus affecting the evidentiary base available to the investigation. In the present case the failure to conduct the forensic medical examination for over three years, for which no explanation has been provided to the Court, is in itself liable to render the investigation inefficient.",

Furthermore, according to the applicants, they were not notified of the UGA Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s decision of 8\u00a0August 2003 not to institute criminal proceedings, and the Government submitted no evidence to the contrary. Having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, the applicants could not have effectively challenged actions or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the investigation has been resumed by the prosecuting authorities themselves on a number of occasions due to the need to take additional investigative measures. However, they still failed to investigate the applicants\u2019 allegations properly. Owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative steps that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted.

According to the applicants, during their transportation and several days of detention in Khankala, officers of the Interior Ministry and servicemen ill-treated them, forcing them to confess to having connections with paramilitary groups. In particular, they were held in a pit and were subjected to the following forms of ill-treatment: they were kicked with boots and beaten with rifle butts on different parts of their bodies, including the soles of their feet; they were burned with cigarettes and forced to sit in a bucket while being beaten. The second applicant was forced to stand for hours with his forehead against the wall, with his hands tightly tied behind his back and legs spread widely apart. The servicemen also threatened them with execution and put guns to their heads. According to the applicants, five days later they were transferred to the Sixth Department of the Organized Crime Unit of the Staropromyslovskiy District of Grozny, where they were held until their release on 12 October 2001.

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. The Court has previously had before it cases in which it has found that there has been treatment which could only be described as torture (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18\u00a0December 1996, \u00a7\u00a064, Reports 1996-VI; Ayd\u0131n v. Turkey, 25\u00a0September 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84 and 86, Reports 1997-VI; Selmouni v.

In any event, the Court reiterates that, in respect of persons deprived of their liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by their own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099).",

[GC], no.\u00a028114/95, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 1999VI). The Court notes, in the first place, that the Government has failed to produce any documents to corroborate that the disciplinary measures described above were actually taken. However, even assuming they were, and particularly in view of the domestic investigating authorities\u2019 failure to establish the circumstances of the applicants\u2019 detention after 24\u00a0September 2001, the Court is not satisfied that the disciplinary measures imposed on the ROVD officers on account of the applicants\u2019 unlawful transfer to officers of the Interior on 24\u00a0September\u00a02001 may be considered to constitute an appropriate acknowledgement of the violation of their rights under Article 5 in respect of the whole period of their detention from 23 September to 12\u00a0October\u00a02001. Furthermore, the Government provided no information as to how, if at all, having regard to those measures the applicants would be able to obtain any compensation for the violation of their rights. Accordingly, the Court considers that those measures also failed to provide adequate redress as required by the Court\u2019s case-law and concludes that the applicants may claim to be \u201cvictims\u201d for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention.",

It is inherent in the proceedings relating to cases of this nature, where individual applicants accuse State agents of violating their rights under the Convention, that in certain instances it is only the respondent State that has access to information capable of corroborating or refuting those allegations. A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their possession without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention. In a case where the application raises issues as to the effectiveness of the investigation, the documents of the criminal investigation are fundamental to the establishment of the facts and their absence may prejudice the Court\u2019s proper examination of the complaint both at the admissibility and at the merits stage (see Tanr\u0131kulu v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7 71, ECHR 1999-IV).",
