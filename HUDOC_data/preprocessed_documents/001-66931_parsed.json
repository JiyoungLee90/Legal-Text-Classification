In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court agrees with the Government as regards the amount to be reimbursed for the applications under Section\u00a091 of the Austrian Courts Act. It accordingly awards the sum of EUR\u00a02,906.91. However, the Court does not consider it necessary to determine whether the applicant\u2019s costs related to her requests for the resumption of the proceedings meet this requirement as she has failed to specify them. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that the excessive duration of the proceedings increased the overall costs incurred (see Bouilly v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a038952/97, \u00a7\u00a033, 7\u00a0December 1999).
