It noted that judicial control of interference by the executive with an individual\u2019s right to liberty was an essential feature of the guarantees embodied in Article 5 \u00a7 3, the purpose being to minimise the risk of arbitrariness in the pre-trial detention of accused persons. Certain procedural and substantive guarantees ensure that judicial control: the judge (or other officer) before whom the accused is \u201cbrought promptly\u201d must be seen to be independent of the executive and of the parties to the proceedings; that judge, having heard the accused himself, must examine all the facts arguing for and against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for the accused\u2019s liberty, and that judge must have the power to order an accused\u2019s release. It not being disputed that Mr\u00a0Caballero fell within the scope of section 25 of the 1994 Act, the Commission found that the possibility of any consideration by a Magistrate of his pre-trial release on bail had been excluded in advance by the legislature by section 25 of the 1994 Act. This removal of the judicial control of pre-trial detention required by Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention was found by the Commission to amount to a violation of that Article.",

In addition, no further work was required of the applicant\u2019s legal representatives after the submission of his Article 41 submissions.
