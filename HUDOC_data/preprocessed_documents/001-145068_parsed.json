In that connection the Court stated in the same judgment, referring to one of the factors which distinguished the relationship between religious-education teachers and the Church from the relationship within an organisation pursuing ideological aims, and allowed teachers\u2019 rights to be modified in line with the educational ethos of private educational establishments, that the requirement imposed by the ecclesiastical declaration of suitability \u2018does not merely consist in a duty to refrain from actions contrary to the religious ethos but extends in a more profound manner to a determination of the individual\u2019s capacity to impart Catholic doctrine, understood as a set of faith-based religious convictions. Since the object of religious instruction is the transmission not only of specific knowledge but of the religious faith of the person who teaches it, this will in all probability imply a series of requirements that transcend the limits of an organisation pursuing ideological aims, beginning with the implicit requirement that persons who seek to transmit a religious faith must likewise profess that faith\u2019 ...\u201d",

Nor is it for the Court, in more general terms, to pass judgment on the suitability or compatibility of the actions, opinions and conduct of persons appointed to teach a particular religion vis-\u00e0-vis the orthodoxy of the religious faith in question.

As a general rule, in addition to pedagogical qualifications, the teachers must have the authorisation of the religious community in question (the missio canonica, the Vokation of the Protestant Church, the Orthodox canonical mandate, the Jewish teaching certificate, the certificate delivered by the Islamic community, etc.). The withdrawal of such authorisation by the competent religious authority, for reasons pertaining to religious matters, leads to the loss of the religious education teaching post.

Article 9 is relevant in so far as it protects the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of thought and religion. Article\u00a010 is relevant in so far as it protects the applicant\u2019s right to express his opinions about official Church doctrines, and Article\u00a011 in so far as it guarantees his right to be a member of an organisation holding specific views on issues concerning religion. In the Court\u2019s view, however, the main issue in the present application lies in the non-renewal of the applicant\u2019s contract. The applicant did not complain about being prevented from holding and disseminating certain views or from being a member of MOCEOP, or about having to endure interference with his family life. The gist of his complaint is that he was not able to remain a teacher of the Catholic religion as a direct consequence of the publicity given to his family situation and of the fact that he was a member of MOCEOP. For that reason the Grand Chamber takes the view, like the Chamber, that the application should be examined under Article\u00a08 of the Convention.",

It thus reiterates that \u201cprivate life\u201d is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition (see, among other authorities, Sch\u00fcth, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053). It would be too restrictive to limit the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d to an \u201cinner circle\u201d in which the individual may live his own personal life as he chooses and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle (see Niemietz v.\u00a0Germany, 16\u00a0December 1992, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 251B).",

Restrictions on an individual\u2019s professional life may fall within Article 8 where they have repercussions on the manner in which he or she constructs his or her social identity by developing relationships with others. In addition, professional life is often intricately linked to private life, especially if factors relating to private life, in the strict sense of the term, are regarded as qualifying criteria for a given profession (see \u00d6zp\u0131nar v. Turkey, no.\u00a020999/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-48, 19 October 2010). Professional life is therefore part of the zone of interaction between a person and others which, even in a public context, may fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d (see M\u00f3\u0142ka v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 56550/00, ECHR 2006IV).",

Thus, whilst it is true that the applicant had never had a permanent contract, a presumption of renewal had given him good reason to believe that his contract would be renewed for as long as he fulfilled those conditions and there were no circumstances that might justify its non-renewal under canon law. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the facts of the case bear some resemblance, mutatis mutandis, to those of Lombardi Vallauri v. Italy (no. 39128/05, \u00a7\u00a038, 20\u00a0October\u00a02009).

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves. The boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In particular, in both instances regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the general interest and the interests of the individual; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, \u00a7\u00a7 75-76, ECHR 2007I; Rommelfanger, cited above; and Fuentes Bobo v.\u00a0Spain, no. 39293/98, \u00a7 38, 29 February 2000).",

The Court thus accepts the position of the Constitutional Court, which, in its judgment of 4 June 2007, took the view that, even though it was not a public authority which had actually taken the non-renewal decision, it sufficed, as in the present case, for such an authority to intervene at a later stage for the decision to be regarded as an act of a public authority. The Court is thus of the opinion that the crux of the issue lies in the action of the State authority which, as the applicant\u2019s employer, and being directly involved in the decision-making process, enforced the Bishop\u2019s non-renewal decision. Whilst the Court recognises that the State had limited possibilities of action in the present case, it is noteworthy that if the Bishop\u2019s decision had not been enforced by the Ministry of Education, the applicant\u2019s contract would certainly have been renewed.",

The decisive question is the extent to which he could have anticipated that his personal conduct was likely to entail the consequence that the Bishop would no longer consider him a suitable candidate and that his contract would therefore not be renewed. In this context the Court notes that the Diocese of Cartagena relied in particular on the notion of \u201cscandal\u201d to refuse the extension of the applicant\u2019s contract (see paragraph\u00a019 above). Even though the notion of scandal is not expressly provided for in Canons 804 and 805 of the Code of Canon Law (see paragraph\u00a058 above), concerning religious-education teachers, it may be considered to refer to \u2013 and is thus clarified by \u2013 notions that are themselves in those canons such as \u201ctrue doctrine\u201d, \u201cwitness of Christian life\u201d or \u201creligious or moral considerations\u201d. In this connection, the Court is of the view that the applicable provisions in the present case fulfilled the requirements concerning the foreseeability of their effects. In particular, since the applicant had been the director of a seminary, it is reasonable to presume that he was aware of the heightened duty of loyalty imposed on him by ecclesiastical law and could thus have foreseen that, despite the fact that his situation had been tolerated for many years, the public display of his militant stance on certain precepts of the Church would be at odds with the applicable provisions of canon law and would not be without consequence. On the basis of the clear wording of the Agreement between Spain and the Holy See, he could also have reasonably foreseen that in the absence of a certificate of suitability from the Church his contract would not be renewed (see, mutatis mutandis, Sindicatul \u201cP\u0103storul cel Bun\u201d v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no.\u00a02330/09, \u00a7\u00a0155, ECHR 2013).",

Seen in that perspective, the right of believers to freedom of religion encompasses the expectation that they will be allowed to associate freely, without arbitrary State intervention. The autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is thus an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 of the Convention affords. It has a direct interest, not only for the actual organisation of those communities but also for the effective enjoyment by all their active members of the right to freedom of religion. Were the organisational life of the community not protected by Article 9 of the Convention, all other aspects of the individual\u2019s freedom of religion would become vulnerable (see Hasan and Chaush, cited above, \u00a7 62; Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others v.

Moreover, in this context, the Court has frequently emphasised the State\u2019s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and has stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society, particularly between opposing groups (see, among other authorities, Hasan and Chaush, cited above, \u00a7 78, and Leyla \u015eahin v.

Such contractual limitations are permissible under the Convention where they are freely accepted (see Rommelfanger, cited above). Indeed, from the point of view of the Church\u2019s interest in upholding the coherence of its precepts, teaching Catholic religion to adolescents can be considered a crucial function requiring special allegiance. The Court is not convinced that at the time of the publication of the article in La Verdad, this contractual duty of loyalty had ceased to exist.

It is relevant, however, that, unlike the applicant, most of the other participants at the meeting avoided contact with the press. As to the question whether the applicant deliberately posed for the impugned photograph, a point also disputed by the parties, the Court considers the answer not to be essential. Even assuming that the photograph was taken without his consent, it can be noted that there is no evidence in the file to show that the applicant complained of his appearance in the press by means of the mechanisms available to him under domestic law. The Court finds that in choosing to accept a publication about his family circumstances and his association with what the Bishop considered to be a protest-oriented meeting, he severed the special bond of trust that was necessary for the fulfilment of the tasks entrusted to him. Having regard to the importance of religious -education teachers for all faith groups, it was hardly surprising that this severance would entail certain consequences.

In this context, in the Court\u2019s view, it is necessary to take into account the specific content of the applicant\u2019s teaching. A teacher of religious education who belongs to and publicly promotes an organisation advocating ideas that run counter to the teaching of that religion has to be distinguished from, for example, a language teacher who is at the same time a member of the Communist Party (see Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, Series A no.\u00a0323). In the former case, the heightened duty of loyalty is justified by the fact that, in order to remain credible, religion must be taught by a person whose way of life and public statements are not flagrantly at odds with the religion in question, especially where the religion is supposed to govern the private life and personal beliefs of its followers (see Directive 2000/78/EC; Sch\u00fcth, cited above, \u00a7 40; Obst, cited above, \u00a7\u00a027; and Lombardi Vallauri, cited above, \u00a7 41). For this reason, the sole fact that there is no evidence to suggest that the applicant, in his class, taught anything incompatible with the Catholic Church\u2019s doctrine does not suffice for it to be concluded that he fulfilled his heightened duty of loyalty (see Vogt, cited above).",

In this connection, the Court observes that in assessing the seriousness of the conduct of an individual employed by the Church it is necessary to take into account the proximity between the person\u2019s activity and the Church\u2019s proclamatory mission (see Sch\u00fcth, cited above, \u00a7 69).

That aspect, however, is not such as to affect the extent of the duty of loyalty imposed on the applicant vis-\u00e0-vis the Catholic Church or the measures that the latter is entitled to adopt if that duty is breached. This analysis is confirmed by the fact that, in the majority of Council of Europe member States, the Churches and religious communities concerned have a power of co-decision or even an exclusive role in the appointment and dismissal of religious-education teachers, regardless of which institution finances such teaching, directly or indirectly (see paragraph\u00a067 above).",

He should therefore have expected that the voluntary publicity of his membership of MOCEOP would not be devoid of consequences for his contract. The Court notes that, even though the applicant had not received any prior warning before the decision not to renew his contract, he knew that his contract was subject to annual renewal if approved by the Bishop, thus involving the possibility for the latter to assess, on a regular basis, the applicant\u2019s fulfilment of his heightened duty of loyalty. Lastly, the applicant knew that, in this connection, the Church had already shown tolerance in allowing him to teach Catholic religion for six years, that is, for as long as his personal situation which was incompatible with the precepts of that religion was not promoted publicly. Moreover, it should be noted that, for the purposes of the present case, a less restrictive measure for the applicant would certainly not have had the same effectiveness in terms of preserving the credibility of the Church. It thus does not appear that the consequences of the decision not to renew his contract were excessive in the circumstances of the case, having regard in particular to the fact that the applicant had knowingly placed himself in a situation that was completely in opposition to the Church\u2019s precepts.",

This principle precludes the national authorities from ruling on the substance of religious notions such as \u201cscandal\u201d or the celibacy of priests. Admittedly, the duty of neutrality is not unlimited, as the Constitutional Court itself has indicated in finding that the issue in such cases is to reconcile the requirements of religious freedom and the State\u2019s religious neutrality with the judicial protection of teachers\u2019 fundamental rights and employment relationships. Thus, in a case concerning a decision not to renew the contract of a religious-education teacher on account of her civil marriage to a divorced man, the Constitutional Court found that there had been a violation of the complainant\u2019s right not to suffer discrimination and of her right to respect for her freedom of opinion concerning marriage and for her personal and family privacy (see paragraph\u00a062 above).",

In particular, after carefully examining the facts, the Constitutional Court took the view that the State\u2019s duty of neutrality precluded it from ruling on the notion of \u201cscandal\u201d used by the Bishop to refuse the renewal of the applicant\u2019s contract, or on the merits of the optional celibacy of priests advocated by the applicant. However, it examined the extent of the interference with the applicant\u2019s rights and took the view that it was neither disproportionate nor unconstitutional, but that it could be justified in terms of respect for the lawful exercise by the Catholic Church of its religious freedom in its collective or community dimension, in conjunction with the right of parents to choose their children\u2019s religious education (see paragraph\u00a043 above). Even though the parents of children who attended the applicant\u2019s classes showed their support after the publicity given to his situation, the Court is of the view that the Diocese\u2019s argument was not unreasonable, since it sought to protect the integrity of the teaching.",

The conclusions thus reached do not appear unreasonable to the Court, particularly in the light of the fact that the applicant, as he had been a priest and the director of a seminary, was or must have been aware, in accepting the task of teaching Catholic religion, of the potential consequences of the heightened duty of loyalty vis-\u00e0-vis the Catholic Church by which he thus became bound, for the purpose, in particular, of preserving the credibility of his teaching (see, mutatis mutandis, Obst, cited above, \u00a7 50). The fact that the Constitutional Court carried out a thorough analysis is all the more evident as two dissenting opinions were appended to its judgment, thus showing that the court examined the issue from various perspectives, whilst refraining from ruling on the substance of the principles to which the Church adhered. As to the Church\u2019s autonomy, it does not appear, in the light of the review exercised by the national courts, that it was improperly invoked in the present case, that is to say that the Bishop\u2019s decision not to propose the renewal of the applicant\u2019s contract cannot be said to have contained insufficient reasoning, to have been arbitrary, or to have been taken for a purpose that was unrelated to the exercise of the Catholic Church\u2019s autonomy.",

We have a slightly different understanding of the applicant\u2019s argument. In our view, he argued that the termination of his employment was due, firstly, to the fact of having made public his position as a member of MOCEOP, and secondly, to his public appearance as a married priest. The Constitutional Court, for its part, noted that the lower courts had linked the termination of the applicant\u2019s employment to the newspaper article that disclosed the fact that he was married and had five children, on the one hand, and his membership of and participation in a movement that challenged certain precepts of the Catholic Church, on the other, and it based its findings on those two points (see paragraph 41 of the present judgment).",

This is the case, for instance, where the State delegates some of its powers to a body whose activities are regulated by private law (see Wo\u015b, cited above, \u00a7 72; Storck, cited above, \u00a7 103; Kotov v.

According to that treaty provision, teachers are appointed by the competent State authority. However, this authority has a limited choice, as it can appoint a candidate only from among those who have been proposed by the Ordinary of the diocese. Moreover, it follows from the same provision that the appointment of a teacher cannot be renewed if he or she is no longer proposed by the Church authority. The State has thus agreed to delegate part of its powers with respect to the appointment of teachers in State schools to a body that is not a public authority. It should be noted that this is an option freely chosen by the Spanish State. While there are many member States of the Council of Europe that have chosen the same option, it is by no means an option that reflects a consensus in Europe (see paragraph 67 of the judgment). In any event, the delegation of part of the State\u2019s powers does not take away the fact that the act about which the applicant complains, the non-renewal of his appointment, is a decision made by the Ministry of Education, not by the Bishop of Cartagena. The alleged violation of the Convention is fully attributable to Spain, notwithstanding the fact that the Spanish Ministry was bound by the Bishop\u2019s decision not to propose the applicant for reappointment (see, mutatis mutandis, Bosphorus Hava Yollar\u0131 Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v.

In this context we first note, like the majority, that the Bishop relied in particular on the notion of \u201cscandal\u201d to refuse the renewal of the applicant\u2019s appointment. However, it was only in the rescript of 20 August 1997, that is, after the publication of the article rendering public the applicant\u2019s situation, that the absence of a scandal was explicitly mentioned as a condition for his ability to continue to teach Catholic religion. Should the applicant have anticipated the rescript? We further note that Canon\u00a0804\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Code of Canon Law provides, as a general rule, that the local Ordinary must ensure that those who teach Catholic religion are \u201coutstanding in true doctrine, in the witness of their Christian life, and in their teaching ability\u201d.

From a more substantive point of view, while it is not for the courts to examine the religious grounds of a decision taken by a religious community (see, mutatis mutandis, ibid., \u00a7 50), they must verify that such a decision does not produce effects that constitute a disproportionate interference with the fundamental rights of those affected by the decision (see paragraph 18 above).",

The Ministry thus applied the 1979 Agreement between Spain and the Holy See, which made the appointment of teachers of Catholic religion dependent upon a proposal by the Ordinary of the diocese. In so far as the Bishop\u2019s decision indicated that, according to the Catholic Church, the applicant was no longer deemed suitable to teach Catholic religion, this was a matter that could legitimately be left to the exclusive discretion of the Bishop. Indeed, by recognising the binding force of the Bishop\u2019s decision, the Ministry gave full effect to the principle of the State\u2019s religious neutrality, as recognised in Article 16\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Spanish Constitution, a principle that also flows from freedom of religion as guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention (see paragraph\u00a0128 of the judgment). The decision not to renew the applicant\u2019s contract, as a teacher of Catholic religion and ethics, is therefore not per se incompatible with the Convention. In other words, the State\u2019s interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private and family life is, in our opinion, based on relevant reasons. We would like to add that, for that reason, we do not need to examine whether the applicant can legitimately be considered to have breached his duty of loyalty to the Church, an element that plays a central role in the majority\u2019s reasoning. In our opinion, this is a matter that could be debated before an ecclesiastical court. For us it is sufficient to note that the Bishop considered that the applicant was no longer suitable to teach Catholic religion and ethics, on whatever ground he reached that conclusion: that assessment was not one to be reviewed by the domestic authorities, and should likewise not be scrutinised by our Court.",

The applicant lodged a further amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court, and that court explicitly weighed up the competing rights and interests of the applicant and of the Catholic Church. The applicant was thus able to obtain a review of the Ministry\u2019s decision and thereby, indirectly, also of the Bishop\u2019s decision (see, mutatis mutandis, Obst, cited above, \u00a7\u00a045; Sch\u00fcth, cited above, \u00a7\u00a059; and Siebenhaar, cited above, \u00a7 42).

It appears that, from that moment on, he lost his clerical status, as was stipulated in the rescript. This would mean that from the point of view of canon law he was still a cleric at the time of the \u201cscandal\u201d, albeit a suspended cleric. Whatever the applicant\u2019s situation might have been under canon law, from an outside perspective he was in any event to be regarded as mandated by the Catholic Church to teach Catholic religion. As far as his secular position was concerned, he was a teacher appointed by the Ministry and had entered into a contract with it. He was therefore an employee of the public education authority (see the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 14 April 2011, no. 51/2011, quoted in paragraph\u00a062 of the judgment). The fact that his salary was paid by the Catholic Church, as noted by the Government, would not seem to change that status. Besides, the State provided the Catholic Church with the necessary funds, in the form of grants. The applicant thus had a double status: he was an employee of the public education authority, and at the same time owed a specific loyalty to the Catholic Church.",

We consider that the same might be said in the case of the applicant, even though he was employed by the State, not by the Catholic Church. While his appointment was not renewed for reasons that were relevant in the context of his teaching of Catholic religion and ethics, there was no assessment at all of whether it would have been possible to renew his employment in another position, not involving any teaching of Catholic religion and ethics (compare United Nations Human Rights Committee, Ross v. Canada, Communication No. 736/1997, \u00a7\u00a011.6, views of 18 October 2000).

It may well be that under canon law this publicity amounted to a \u201cscandal\u201d, which made it necessary for the Bishop of Cartagena to withdraw his certificate attesting to the applicant\u2019s suitability to teach Catholic religion and ethics. However, whatever the consequences under canon law, it was for the Ministry, and later for the domestic courts, to make sure that the secular reaction to the Bishop\u2019s decision was adapted to the applicant\u2019s situation and in particular that it did not interfere disproportionately with his right to respect for his private and family life. In this connection we have noted a number of factors which are of relevance in assessing the proportionality of the measure complained of. Following this analysis, we can now say that some of these factors appear to be particularly relevant. Firstly, it was not the applicant\u2019s situation as such \u2013which had been tolerated for many years by the Church \u2013 but the publicity given to it, that led to the non-renewal of his contract. While such publicity could be problematic for the Church, it is difficult to conceive how it could be so for the State. Secondly, as far as the applicant\u2019s teaching ability was concerned, there is no evidence that he had taught religion in a manner that contradicted the doctrine of the Church, or that the publicity given to his situation had resulted in disapproval by his pupils\u2019 parents or by his school. Thirdly, and most importantly, the State\u2019s reaction was a drastic one: the applicant was not reappointed and no other measure was taken, with the result that he was in fact dismissed.",

The State, accepting the Bishop\u2019s perspective, sanctioned an individual on the grounds of his private and family life (and his right to marriage, as confirmed by the Vatican\u2019s dispensation) and for beliefs that he manifested publicly and as part of a movement, notwithstanding that \u201cthe protection of Article 10 of the Convention extends ... to the professional sphere of teachers\u201d.

The State as employer, in collaboration with and on behalf of a particular private entity, namely the Church, interfered in the private and family life of the applicant by imposing certain duties affecting his Article 8, 10 and 11 rights, under the potential threat of loss of employment (compare Sch\u00fcth v. Germany, no.\u00a01620/03, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2010, as regards the positive obligations of the State). Moreover, he ultimately lost his job and this per se affected his private and professional social relations. However, I do not believe that our jurisprudence requires us to construe employment as such as a Convention right within the meaning of private life. Loss of employment as a matter of social private life is not the key issue here and the impact of the loss of employment on the applicant\u2019s social private life is secondary.",

The formal explanation was that the Bishop informed the State authority that the applicant\u2019s contract should not be renewed. The official Memorandum of the Bishop of Cartagena (11 November 1997) that was submitted to the public authority after the dismissal refers to the fact that the earlier proposal had been based on the Bishop\u2019s obligation to disqualify the teacher once his \u201csituation\u201d had become public knowledge in order to avoid causing further \u201cscandal\u201d in view of \u201chis personal and employment situation\u201d. According to the Memorandum, the power of the Bishop originated in the Pope\u2019s rescript of 20 August 1997 (dispensation of celibacy). The applicant was notified of the rescript on 15 September 1997. The applicant\u2019s \u201csituation\u201d had become \u201cpublicly known\u201d through the publication of an article in November 1996. The Murcia court expressly referred to the publication as being the origin of the public knowledge of the \u201csituation\u201d: \u201chis appearance in the press having been the cause of his dismissal\u201d (Murcia Employment Tribunal no. 3, judgment of 28 September 2000).

This was intended to provide adequate Church control over the teaching of religion, and consequently those who taught religion on behalf of the Church. It is uncontested that the teaching of religion has to be in conformity with principles as understood by the Church (in the context of the Catholic religion), and that the teacher must be credible, as determined by the Church. The religion teacher has specific obligations of loyalty to the Church. The bishop supervises the professional aptitude of such teachers, which goes beyond formal qualification and faithful presentation of the religious position, that is to say, the teachings of the Church. This does not mean that, just because the bishop finds a teacher\u2019s lessons appropriate, the public authorities cannot object to the teachings if they contravene public policy (or the national curriculum), or if the public employee\u2019s behaviour is contrary to pedagogical or other professional expectations.",

The priest teaches religion to children on the premises of a State school, as permitted by school management or as enabled by law. It is up to the Church to conclude that the teachings of that teacher are not acceptable.

It is hard to accept a dismissal that is applied as a result of the exercise of Convention-protected rights where it has not been proved that the decision was not arbitrary, given that for a long time the same issue had not been a problem and was tolerated even after a report in the press. The undeniable right of the Church to determine who qualifies to teach religion under various religion-based criteria is duly taken into consideration by the Court; however, here the domestic judicial process was deprived of proper consideration of the genuine grounds for the dismissal and their weight in terms of the impact on the applicant\u2019s rights.",
