In the Government\u2019s view, no expectation of any benefit could have arisen from such flawed judgments. They provided detailed information on the material law that had allegedly been ignored by the lower courts. The Government specified, in addition, that the first instance court violated the statute of limitations in the case of Osipov (no. 42059/04) and acted beyond its jurisdiction in the case of Afanasyev (no.\u00a043505/04). They pointed out that some of the judgments at issue were nonetheless enforced until their quashing. Finally, the Government referred to the Committee of Ministers\u2019 Resolution ResDH (2006)1 of 8 February 2006, which acknowledged positive developments in the supervisory review procedure.

Nor can the Court discern any fundamental defect in the cases of Osipov and Afanasyev arising from the specific grounds put forward by the Government. In both cases, like in all others, the supervisory review was prompted by higher courts\u2019 disagreement about the applicants\u2019 entitlement to social benefits, which was determined in fair adversarial proceedings at the fist-instance (compare Protsenko v. Russia, no. 13151/04, \u00a7\u00a7 30-34, 31\u00a0July 2008, and Tishkevich v. Russia, no. 2202/05, \u00a7\u00a7 25-26, 4 December 2008).
