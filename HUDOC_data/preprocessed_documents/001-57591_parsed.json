In , as in many other Contracting States, there exists a long tradition that the Bar should provide legal representation, if need be on a free basis, for indigent persons.  At the time of the relevant facts, the Council of the Ordre des avocats was under a duty to make provision for \"the assistance of persons of insufficient means\" by setting up a \"Legal Advice and Defence Office\" in such manner as it should determine (Article 455, first paragraph, of the Judicial Code).  \"Obviously ill-founded cases [were not to] be allocated\" (second paragraph of the same Article), but in criminal matters the Legal Advice and Defence Office had to make an officially appointed - or \"pro Deo\" - avocat available to any indigent accused who so requested at least three days before the hearing (Article 184 bis of the Code of Criminal Procedure).",

And here the drawbacks were \"perfectly foreseeable\" by the future avocat since he was not unaware either of the existence or of the scope of the obligations he would have to bear as regards defending clients free of charge, obligations that were \"limited\" both in quantity (about fourteen cases each year) and in time (the period of pupillage). He also had knowledge of the corresponding advantages: the freedom he would enjoy in carrying out his duties and the opportunity he would have of familiarising himself with life in the courts and of \"establishing for himself a paying clientele\".

This could be so in the case of a service required in order to gain access to a given profession, if the service imposed a burden which was so excessive or disproportionate to the advantages attached to the future exercise of that profession, that the service could not be treated as having been voluntarily accepted beforehand; this could apply, for example, in the case of a service unconnected with the profession in question.",

On the other hand, it has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to \"the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms\" safeguarded by the other substantive provisions (see, inter alia, the Marckx judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, pp. 15-16, \u00a7 32). As the Court has found that there was no forced or compulsory labour for the purposes of Article 4 (art. 4), the question arises whether the facts in issue fall completely outside the ambit of that Article (art. 4) and, hence, of Article 14 (art. 14).
