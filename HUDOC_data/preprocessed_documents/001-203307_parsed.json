The Minister also rejected as unconvincing the applicant\u2019s argument that the blog was only read by his friends and was thus insignificant, since it was publicly available and the Ministry could access it without any difficulties. Moreover, it rejected the argument that the fact that the applicant had a knighthood proved that he was a person with high ethical and moral standards, noting that a truly moral and ethical attitude was primarily shown through one\u2019s conduct. In the Minister\u2019s opinion, writing an offensive blog and denigrating State institutions and individuals who were in the public eye was not showing such an attitude. A different decision by the Minister on the applicant\u2019s application would be contrary to the interpretation of the legal standard on personal qualities.",

After it had summarised the Minister\u2019s decision (see paragraphs 14-16 above) and the applicant\u2019s submissions (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above), the court noted that the question in dispute was whether the applicant fulfilled the requirement regarding personal qualities as defined in section 87 of the Courts Act (see paragraph 23 below). In this connection, it held that personal qualities were determined on the basis of facts related to the candidate\u2019s personality and work. The court considered that the Minister had correctly established the facts of the case and applied substantive legal provisions. It emphasised that the title of court expert was conferred at the moment a candidate took an oath before the Minister. Therefore, the Minister\u2019s decision that the applicant did not have the required personal qualities was not belated. Relying on the reasoning of the contested decision by the Minister, the court concluded that the applicant did not in fact have the requisite personal qualities, and that it was thus unnecessary to examine his remaining arguments, which were irrelevant for a lawful and correct decision. Lastly, it refused to hold a hearing, finding that new facts and evidence were not relevant for the decision as set out in the second indent of section 59(2) of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 26 below).",

Moreover, the applicant challenged the causal link between his writing on the blog and the quality of his work as a court expert. The applicant\u2019s request for a hearing was thus related to concrete evidence which he asked the court to take into consideration, namely the evidence of certain witnesses in respect of facts which were relevant for the assessment of his personal aptitude.",

In this connection, the Court finds it appropriate to draw parallels with its case-law on applying the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d to employment-related scenarios under Article 8, including restrictions on access to employment in the public service. Under Article 8, complaints concerning the exercise of professional functions have been found to fall within the ambit of \u201cprivate life\u201d when factors relating to private life were regarded as qualifying criteria for the function in question, and when the impugned measure was based on reasons encroaching upon the individual\u2019s freedom of choice in the sphere of private life (see Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7 71, ECHR 1999VI; \u00d6zp\u0131nar v.

It follows that the essential elements of the decision related to the exercise of freedom of expression (see Kudeshkina, cited above, \u00a7 79, and Hajibeyli and Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, nos. 6477/08 and 10414/08, \u00a7 53, 19 April 2018, as regards a refusal to admit somebody to a Bar association; compare and contrast Harabin, cited above), even if that exercise was qualified by the Minister as proof of the applicant not being a suitable candidate for the position of court expert (see Kayasu v. Turkey, nos. 64119/00 and 76292/01, \u00a7 80, 13\u00a0November 2008). The Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that, in dismissing the application, the Minister took account of what the applicant had expressed merely in order to establish whether he fulfilled the requirements for the title of court expert (compare and contrast Harabin, cited above), since the disadvantage which the applicant suffered was directly related to his exercise of core elements of this right (see the similar reasoning employed by the Court under Article 8 of the Convention, paragraph 57 above). The dismissal also had a potentially chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of expression of those wishing to perform the function of court experts. Whether such a measure and the related chilling effect were in fact justified is a question to be answered in relation to the merits of the case. Accordingly, the measure complained of essentially related to freedom of expression, and not access to public service.",

In this regard, the Court observes that the Minister did not rely on any particular blog post or email passage, nor did he in any other way specify the language used by the applicant in the blog and emails which he considered to be offensive. The absence of such reasoning in the Minister\u2019s decision is particularly noteworthy, given that only days prior to that decision the Minister had considered that there was no obstacle to the applicant\u2019s appointment as a court expert (see paragraph 9 above). As regards the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression, the Minister considered that the dismissal of the applicant\u2019s application did not limit that right (see paragraph 16 above).",

In particular, it in no way balanced the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention against the public interest allegedly pursued by the impugned decision (compare and contrast Simi\u0107 v.\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 75255/10, 15 November 2016). Relying exclusively on the reasoning of the Minister\u2019s contested decision, the court upheld the conclusion that the applicant did not have the requisite personal qualities and that it was thus unnecessary to examine his remaining arguments. Having regard to the above and the considerations that led it to find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraphs 42-46 above), the Court considers that the impugned interference with the applicant\u2019s exercise of his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention was not accompanied by an effective and adequate judicial review (see, mutatis mutandis, Lombardi Vallauri, cited above, \u00a7 54).",
