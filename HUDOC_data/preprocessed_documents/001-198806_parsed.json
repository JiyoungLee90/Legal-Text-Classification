Nor did the domestic courts consider that the \u201cdignity\u201d of an institution cannot be equated to that of human beings (see, mutatis mutandis, Kharlamov, cited above, \u00a7 29). On this point, the Court considers that, where an association provides a public service, the public interest in receiving information about alleged shortcomings in such an association\u2019s management of hunting and fishing is important in a democratic society, and thus outweighs the interest in protecting that association\u2019s business reputation and interests (see, mutatis mutandis, Heinisch, cited above, \u00a7 90).
