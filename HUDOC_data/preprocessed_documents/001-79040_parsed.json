In 17 pages of written reasons the court analysed the course of the proceedings from 27\u00a0March 2003 to 16 February 2005 and found that although the length of the proceedings had indeed been considerable, there had been no undue delays on the part of the court. The  had conducted the proceedings scrupulously, the hearings had been held regularly, four or even five times per month. The length of the proceedings had resulted from the complexity of the case and other objective factors and not from any negligence on the part of the court. The hearings were usually scheduled one month in advance to allow the accused time to prepare their defence. The court also noted that the case file had often been transferred to the Court of Appeal as a result of numerous motions and appeals filed by all the accused. The court acknowledged that the accused could not be blamed for availing themselves of their procedural rights; however, the number of filed motions had contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings, as had the conduct of some of the defendants. The Court of Appeal observed that special diligence was required when an accused was detained on remand, but in its view the first-instance court had been aware of that requirement and had fully observed it. The Court of Appeal was of the opinion that detention, even if lengthy, could be justified in the circumstances of a given case as long as it was supervised by a court and was found necessary.",

Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty laid down in Article 5 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a0152 et seq., ECHR 2000IV; Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a0110, ECHR 2000XI).",

Where such grounds were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also be satisfied that the national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (Tomasi v.

In this respect, the Court reiterates that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending (G\u00f3rski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a057, 4 October 2005). The Court also acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider in an initial stage that such a risk was present. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001).",

In this regard, the Court reiterates that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the alleged criminal activities of the applicant may be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings (see G\u00f3rski v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058) and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention (see, Celejewski v Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7 37, 4 May 2006; Dudek v Poland, no.\u00a0633/03, \u00a7 36, 4 May 2006). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the co-defendants, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention during the period necessary to terminate the investigation, to draw up the bill of indictment and to hear evidence from the accused. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised criminal gangs, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high.",
