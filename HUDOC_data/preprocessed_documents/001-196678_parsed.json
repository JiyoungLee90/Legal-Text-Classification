The Court observes that during this period the applicant\u2019s several objections were examined by the courts without holding a hearing. Thus, the Court finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned judgments and considers that the applicant\u2019s inability to appear before courts dealing with his requests of release for more than ten months is not compatible with the requirement to hold a hearing at regular intervals, as required by Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention.",
