The Court observes that the investigation was completed by the prosecution authorities within a short period of time. The Court notes that i the trial court took eleven months to prepare the case for the first hearing. However, the court expedited the examination of the case. From 14 November 2003 the court held numerous hearings at regular intervals (see paragraphs 9, 14 and 20 above). Lastly, the Court notes that the criminal case at issue was a relatively complex one on account of the number of co-accused and the charges against them.

It suffices, in the absence of a formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official in question regards the accused as guilty, while a premature expression of such an opinion by the tribunal itself will inevitably run foul of the said presumption (see,\u00a0among other authorities, Minelli v.
