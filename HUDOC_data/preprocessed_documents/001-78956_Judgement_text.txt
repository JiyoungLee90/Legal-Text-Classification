Following this order the applicant's employer, the State-owned Joint-Stock Company “Galeshchinske khlibopryimalne pidpryemstvo” suspended the applicant from his duties of the Head of the Board of the company. On 14 April 2003 the Kobylaky District Court dismissed the applicant's complaint against this prosecution's order.

On 12 December 2001 the hearing was adjourned in order to provide the applicant with an opportunity to prepare his defence with respect to new charges brought against him, namely, falsification of official documents.
On 7 February 2002 the court sentenced the applicant to three years' imprisonment, suspended on probation, for theft.
On 16 June 2002 the Poltava Regional Court of Appeal quashed this decision due to the insufficiency of the pre-trial investigation which could not be remedied during the trial. The Court of Appeal specified, inter alia, the lack of documentary evidence, namely, accounting records, and the failure to question the audit inspectors who had monitored the Cooperative during the period under investigation.
The case-file was received by the District Prosecutor's Office on 30 July 2002, and on 7 August 2002 an investigator was assigned to deal with the case. However, the investigation was delayed until September 2002 due to the illness of the investigator.
During the additional investigation, a number of witnesses were questioned and several audit inspections were ordered.

On 11 December 2003 the District Court sentenced the applicant to three years' imprisonment, suspended on probation, for theft and discharged him both from the criminal liability and from the sentence due to the expiry of the statutory time-limit. On the same day the court issued a separate ruling, indicating that the pre-trial investigation had lasted unreasonably long and had included periods when the proceedings had been suspended for no convincing reason. The court stated that the length of the investigation had also hampered the progress of the trial as the witnesses had had significant problems recalling their testimonies given to the investigators some five years before. The court notified the Poltava Regional Prosecutor of these matters and requested to take the appropriate measures.
On 27 February 2004 the Poltava Regional Court of Appeal, following the prosecution's appeal, quashed the applicant's discharge from the criminal liability, upheld his conviction, three-year probationary sentence and the exemption from serving the sentence.
On 27 January 2005 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's appeal in cassation.
