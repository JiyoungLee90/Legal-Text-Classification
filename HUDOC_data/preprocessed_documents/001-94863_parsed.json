Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 67). To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention should be appropriate; and the length of the detention should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 164, and, mutatis mutandis, Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 74).",

Indeed, the Russian authorities had made their position clear in both respects by as early as June 2004. Thereafter, although the Estonian authorities took repeated steps to solve the situation, there were also considerable periods of inactivity. In particular, the Court has been provided with no information on whether any steps with a view to the applicant\u2019s deportation were taken from August 2004 to March 2006 (see paragraphs 18 to 33 above).",

But my point of view is that this case does not belong to the family of ordinary expulsion cases and should be assessed differently. It has to be noted also that this case is only about length of detention pending expulsion and not about the substantive question of expulsion. The latter complaint was declared inadmissible on 5\u00a0January\u00a02006.",

Under the terms of that treaty, the applicant was obliged to leave the country (pacta sunt servanda!). Furthermore, it was established through free and fair court proceedings that he did not have any legal grounds to stay in  (see paragraphs\u00a07 and 8 of the judgment). No humanitarian ground was established for military servicemen of approximately 50 years of age to stay in the country. It should be noted that sections 23 and 25 of the Obligation to Leave and Prohibition of Entry Act, relied on by the domestic authorities, provided a legal basis for the applicant\u2019s detention.",

It has been shown by the Estonian authorities that he had been issued a valid Russian passport. Even assuming that he had lost it, it could easily have been replaced by a new passport or other travel document immediately if he had agreed to sign an application form. At the same time it has also to be noted that in spite of their treaty obligation and the commitments concerning readmission signed with the EU on 25\u00a0May 2006, the relevant authorities of the applicant\u2019s country of origin showed clear unwillingness to cooperate and put a stop to the applicant\u2019s sufferings. Under that agreement between the EU and  the Russian authorities were required to issue travel documents to persons to be readmitted, irrespective of their will.",

Denmark, (dec.) no. 39964/98, 4 October 2001). States have a recognised sovereign right to control entry and stay on their territory and should have the power to expel those who do not have the right to stay. In sum, the lengthy stay in the detention centre was to a large extent caused by the applicant himself and by his country of origin.",
