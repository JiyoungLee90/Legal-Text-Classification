[GC], no. 21272/03, \u00a7\u00a0100, 2 November 2010; Sidorova (Adukevich) v. Russia, no.\u00a04537/04, \u00a7\u00a025, 14 February 2008, and Shulepov v. , no. 15435/03, \u00a7 34, 26\u00a0June 2008) and that the Supreme Court had the power to fully review the case and consider additional arguments which had not been examined at the trial. In his appeal statement the applicant contested his conviction on both\u00a0factual and legal grounds, his account of events differing from those of his co-accused in important aspects (see paragraph 14 above and compare with Metelitsa v. , no. 33132/02, \u00a7 31, 22 June 2006 and Sinichkin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038). The appeal court was thus called upon to make a full assessment of the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence regarding the charges against him. In the Court\u2019s view, the issues raised by the applicant in his appeal statement can reasonably be considered to have presented a certain degree of factual and legal complexity. It also cannot disregard that the prosecutor was present at the appeal hearing and made submissions to the appeal court. Taking further into account what was at stake for the applicant, who had been sentenced to four-and-a-half years of imprisonment, the Court does not consider that the Supreme Court could have properly determined the issues before it without a direct assessment of the evidence given by the applicant \u2013 either in person or through some form of legal representation. Neither could it have ensured the equality of arms between the parties without giving the applicant the opportunity to reply to the observations made by the prosecutor at the appeal hearing.",

If analysed in terms of an implicit waiver, the Court reiterates its recent finding in another case against  raising a similar issue of a defendant appearing before an appeal court in the criminal case against him (see Kononov v. Russia, no. 41938/04, 27 January 2011). In that case, having been confronted with a possible waiver by the applicant of his right to participate in the appeal hearing, the Court held that, even assuming that it was a part of the lawyer\u2019s duty to inform the applicant about the peculiarities of appeal procedure, the presiding judge, being the ultimate guardian of the fairness of the proceedings, cannot be absolved of his or her responsibility to explain to a defendant his procedural rights and obligations and secure their effective exercise. In the absence of clear and comprehensible instructions from the trial judge as to the manner in which a defendant\u2019s appearance before the appeal court could be secured, that defendant cannot have been expected to appreciate that the failure to make a special request to ensure his participation in the appeal hearing would result in his appeal being examined in his absence (see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040-44). Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court has serious doubts that the applicant, in fact, received such clear and comprehensible instructions from the trial court (see paragraph 13 above) and that, accordingly, the necessary safeguards were in place to make the proceedings satisfy the Convention requirements (see, among other authorities, Talat Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 60). Nonetheless, the Court need not resolve that issue, because it considers that the proceedings before the Supreme Court, in any event, fell short of the requirements of fairness for the following reasons.",

There is no indication that the applicant waived, explicitly or implicitly and in accordance with the above-mentioned requirements (see paragraph 40 above), his right to be represented by counsel on appeal. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the Supreme Court had accepted counsel\u2019s appeal statement and allegedly sent summonses to his Bar Association to inform him of the appeal hearing.",

In so far as the Government argued that it had been for the applicant to seek leave for his counsel to appear before the appeal court, the Court notes that, apart from the fact that the Government did not point to any legal provision which supported their reading of the applicant\u2019s obligation, it has already held on a number of occasions that the effectiveness of the guarantee of legal representation by default contained in Article 51 of the CCP would be undermined without a corresponding obligation on the part of the courts to verify in each individual case whether it is lawful to proceed with a hearing in the absence of legal counsel for the accused (see Grigoryevskikh v.\u00a0, no. 22/03, \u00a7 90, 9 April 2009).

There is no indication that the appeal court verified that the summonses had indeed been served on the applicant\u2019s lawyer and, if they had not, adjourned the examination of the appeal. The Court also entertains doubts that the Supreme Court could rely on the applicant to inform his lawyer about the appeal hearing. While having sent a telegram to the applicant\u2019s detention facility on 18 June 2004 with notification of the appeal hearing, the Supreme Court did not receive any confirmation that the notification had, in fact, been delivered. The Government has also failed to produce any evidence showing that that notification was given to the applicant or that the applicant had maintained contact with his lawyer in the course of the appeal proceedings.",
