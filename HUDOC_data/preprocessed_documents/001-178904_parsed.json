In particular, the Council held that the reasons for the introduction of video surveillance provided for by section 36 had not been met, given that there was no evidence that there was any danger to the safety of people and property in the auditoriums, still less to confidential data, and that the surveillance of teaching was not among the legitimate grounds for video surveillance.

The court found that the notion of private life certainly included activities in the business and professional spheres. It also held, however, that the university was a public institution performing activities of public interest, teaching being one of them (poziv redovnog profesora [je] tako\u0111e javan), and that it was thus not possible for video surveillance of the auditoriums as public places to violate the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their private life. It was a working area, just like a courtroom or parliament, where professors were never alone, and therefore they could not invoke any right to privacy that could be violated. The data that had been collected could thereby also not be considered as personal data. The university\u2019s failure to remove the cameras immediately had been unauthorised, but it could not be classed as an interference with the applicants\u2019 private life and was therefore irrelevant. The court further held that such a conclusion was in accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law given that the monitoring of actions taking place in public was not an interference with a person\u2019s private life when those means just recorded (bilje\u017ei) what others could see if they happened to be in the same place at the same time. The court also held that the monitoring of the actions of an individual in a public place by the use of photographic equipment which just instantaneously recorded visual data did not give rise to an interference with that individual\u2019s private life, which could arise once any footage of such material became publicly available. It concluded that the installation and use of video surveillance and the collection of data thereby had not violated the applicants\u2019 right to privacy (pravo na privatnost) and had therefore not caused them any mental anguish. During the proceedings one of the witnesses stated that there had been cases of theft and of damage to the interior of the building and that on one occasion five laptops had disappeared from a laboratory. Those events had led to the hiring of a private security agency two or three years earlier. According to the witness, the police had suggested installing video surveillance equipment on the School\u2019s premises. The court, for its part, did not deal with those issues.",

Article 8 thus guarantees a right to \u201cprivate life\u201d in the broad sense, including the right to lead a \u201cprivate social life\u201d, that is, the possibility for the individual to develop his or her social identity.

There is therefore a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d (see Peck, cited above, \u00a7 57), professional life being part of it (see Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez, cited above, \u00a7 110 in fine).",

It is where they not only teach students, but also interact with them, thus developing mutual relations and constructing their social identity. It has already been held that covert video surveillance of an employee at his or her workplace must be considered, as such, as a considerable intrusion into the employee\u2019s private life. It entails the recorded and reproducible documentation of a person\u2019s conduct at his or her workplace, which the employee, being obliged under the employment contract to perform the work in that place, cannot evade (see K\u00f6pke v.\u00a0Germany (dec.), no. 420/07, 5 October 2010). There is no reason for the Court to depart from that finding even where it concerns cases of noncovert video surveillance of an employee at his or her workplace. Furthermore, the Court has also held that even where the employer\u2019s regulations in respect of the employees\u2019 private social life in the workplace are restrictive they cannot reduce it to zero. Respect for private life continues to exist, even if it might be restricted in so far as necessary (see B\u0103rbulescu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a080).",

The Court reiterates in this regard that, while it can be subject to exceptions which might be justified by the specific circumstances of each case, the issue of whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is normally determined by reference to the date when the application was lodged with the Court (see Baumann v. France, no.\u00a033592/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001V (extracts)). Given that the applicants lodged their application in October\u00a02013, which was long before the constitutional appeal became an effective domestic remedy in the respondent State, the Court considers that they were not required to avail themselves of that particular remedy (see Sini\u0161taj and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0124-125). The Government\u2019s objection must therefore be dismissed.",

It is noted that one of those aims, notably the surveillance of teaching, is not provided for by the law at all as a ground for video surveillance. Furthermore, the Agency explicitly held that there was no evidence that either property or people had been in jeopardy, one of the reasons to justify the introduction of video surveillance (see paragraph 11 above), and the domestic courts did not deal with that issue at all (see paragraph 14 in fine above).

We find it conclusive that the video monitoring took place at the university auditoriums, that the applicants had been notified of the video surveillance, that what was monitored was the applicants\u2019 professional activity, that the surveillance was remote, that there was no audio recording and thus no recording of the teaching or discussions, that the pictures were blurred and the persons could not easily be recognised, that the video recordings were only accessible to the dean and were automatically deleted after 30 days, and that the data or information was not subsequently used.",

Be that as it may, we would like to add that in our view the storing of the video surveillance did not in itself raise an issue under \u201cprivate life\u201d. Even though it may be argued that a video filmed concerns data about identified or identifiable persons (see Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no.\u00a027798/95, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2000-II, and Satakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi Oy and\u00a0Satamedia Oy v. Finland [GC], no. 931/13, \u00a7 133, ECHR 2017 (extracts)), the applicants have not argued in this case that the quality of the video was such that it would lead to their identification, thus raising an issue under the applicants\u2019 private life as protected by Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, nor that any data was or could be used in such a way that the \u201cprivate life\u201d aspect of Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention came into play (see a contrario S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and\u00a030566/04, \u00a7\u00a7 60-61 and 67, ECHR 2008).",

                        "content": "12.\u00a0\u00a0In sum, we respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s findings that the video monitoring, as such, brought the applicant\u2019s complaint within the scope of Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and constituted an interference with their privacy rights. We emphasise that the applicants are university teachers who were giving lectures in a university amphitheater, thus fully engaged in a professional activity in a quasi-public setting, and not, for example, in their offices. Having been notified of the video surveillance in the amphitheatres, their reasonable expectation of privacy in that particular context, if any, was very limited. In conclusion, the mere fact of the amphitheaters being monitored cannot in our view engage Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention without further elements being demonstrated, as we have explained above. By expanding the scope of Article 8 \u00a7 1 to include the facts of the present case, the majority have overly broadened the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d under that provision, to an extent which lacks a basis in the Court\u2019s case-law and is not sufficiently supported by cogent legal arguments.",
