A convoy of three white Gazels and one Niva had passed from Nazran to Malgobek at about 12.40 a.m. Both inspectors stated that they had clearly seen the driver and passengers of the Gazel vehicles through the windscreen, and that they had been armed and were wearing camouflage uniforms. The drivers, without stopping, produced papers resembling \u201cspecial passes\u201d. Both police officers had perceived the group as FSB servicemen, as only they could have moved around in Gazel, Niva and UAZ vehicles without registration plates. The traffic police informed the officer on duty that the drivers of the four vehicles had refused to stop at the roadblock. About an hour later the same four vehicles had passed through the roadblock again, towards Nazran, but the convoy had ignored the order to stop. This incident was communicated to the officer on duty, and at the next roadblock, \u201cVolga-14\u201d, the traffic police closed the road and thus forced the vehicles to stop. The driver showed a special pass, after which the vehicles were allowed to continue towards Nazran. At the end of their shift all the traffic police officers involved had submitted written reports about the events of that night, complete with the number of the special pass.",

Traffic police there confirmed that two white vehicles VAZ-2106 and Niva with registration plates covered with mud had passed by fifteen to twenty minutes previously. They had not stopped them because they had papers on their windscreens authorising unhindered passage. It was usually FSB officers who had such badges.

The two vehicles passed several police roadblocks; at the \u201cVolga-20\u201d roadblock situated at the administrative border with Ingushetia the drivers of the vehicles had presented papers which exempted them from inspection by the police, and had entered Chechnya. The police officers manning the roadblock noted the details of the \u201cpasses\u201d, presumably issued by the security services in the region, although subsequent enquiries about their provenance appear inconclusive (see paragraphs 10, 15, 23 and 34 above).",

It appears too that this line of inquiry was pursued by the domestic criminal investigation. As could be seen from many previous judgments involving allegations of disappearances, such security operations in the region had taken place without prior or subsequent acknowledgment, and were routinely denied by the authorities (see for example, Alikhadzhiyeva v. Russia, no. 68007/01, \u00a7\u00a059, 5 July 2007; Vakhayeva and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a01758/04, \u00a7\u00a0134, 29\u00a0October 2009; Mutsolgova and Others v.

Bearing this in mind, the Court finds that the possibility that the crime could have been committed by members of illegal armed groups is at variance with the established facts in this case. Consequently, the Court rejects it. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s arguments are insufficient to discharge their burden of proof in a case where there is prima facie evidence that missing persons had been last seen in State hands.",

They also noted the details of the special pass issued, in all probability, to a vehicle used by the FSB (see paragraphs 41-46, 59-62, 75 and 76 above). The officer of the Ingushetia Ministry of the Interior on duty at the time testified, and confirmed during a confrontation, that on the night in question he had contacted his counterpart at the Ingushetia FSB, who had told him that a special operation had been carried out by them (see paragraphs 65 and 78 above). Bersanov\u2019s arrest in relation to the investigation of the terrorist act in Beslan has been reported by the media, with reference to the prosecutor\u2019s office (see paragraphs 54-55 above).",

In the cases at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigations have been pending for many years without bringing about any significant developments as to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of the applicants\u2019 missing relatives. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that the proceedings in each of the criminal files have been plagued by a combination of the same defects as enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 123-25).",

This information could have led to the establishment of the identities of the perpetrators and the discovery of the fate of the missing men. It reiterates that what is at stake here is nothing less than public confidence in the State\u2019s monopoly on the use of force (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a052391/99, \u00a7 325, ECHR 2007VI, and Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, \u00a7\u00a0300, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). The State must therefore ensure, by all means at its disposal, an adequate response, judicial or otherwise, so that the legislative and administrative framework set up to protect the right to life is properly implemented, and any breaches of that right are halted and punished (see Zavoloka v. Latvia, no.\u00a058447/00, \u00a7 34, 7 July 2009). It appears that in the present case the respondent State has failed to ensure such an adequate response.",
