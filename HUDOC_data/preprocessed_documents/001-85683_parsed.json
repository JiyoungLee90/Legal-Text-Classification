A moratorium on the enforcement of judgment debts has been introduced until such time as the mechanism for the forced sale of the property of such undertakings has been improved. No time-limit has been set. Section 2 of that Act provides that the prohibition on the forced sale of property includes the execution of writs by the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service on property belonging to such companies. The Act therefore stays the execution of all writs by the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service against the assets of undertakings in which the State holds at least 25% of the share capital.",

The Court notes that the legal systems of many member States provide for a possibility to extend procedural time-limits if there are valid reasons to do so. At the same time, if the time-limit for ordinary appeal procedure is renewed after a considerable lapse of time and for reasons which do not appear to be particularly persuasive, like in the present case an allegedly difficult economic situation preventing the defendant from paying the court fees (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above), such a decision can infringe the principle of legal certainty, in a similar way to the extraordinary review proceedings. The Court acknowledges that it is primarily within the domestic courts\u2019 discretion to decide on the renewal of the time-limit for an appeal, but such discretion is not unlimited. The courts shall be required to indicate the reasons. One of such reasons could be, for instance, a failure by the State authorities to inform parties of decisions taken with respect to their cases. Even then, however, the possibility of renewal would not be unlimited, since the parties should take steps within reasonable intervals to learn about the state of judicial proceedings of which they are aware (see, mutatis mutandis, Aleksandr Shevchenko v. Ukraine, no. 8371/02, \u00a7\u00a027, 26 April 2007 and Trukh v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 50966/99, 14 October 2003) ). In every case, the domestic courts should verify whether the reasons for renewal of a time-limit for appeal could justify the interference with the principle of res judicata, especially, as in the present case, when the domestic legislation does not limit the courts\u2019 discretion either on the time or on the grounds for the renewal of the time-limits.",

It had lodged a first appeal in November 2001, but it was not considered for a number of reasons, a failure to pay a court fee being only one of them (see paragraph 11 above). Two years later, the Company lodged a new appeal, maintaining that it could not afford the court fees at the time the decision of the first-instance court was open to appeal under the law. The Court notes that the Company did not refer to lack of funds, but to lack of free funds to pay the court fees. Furthermore, there is no indication that the Company ever asked for delay of payment of the court fees or for payment by instalments, which it could have done under domestic law (see Relevant domestic law above). In such a situation, allowing the Company to lodge a repeated appeal after a considerable lapse of time and after execution of judgment had started for reasons which, in the Court\u2019s opinion, are not exercised for correction of serious judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but merely for the purpose of a rehearing and a fresh decision of the case, the domestic courts infringed the principle of legal certainty and the applicant\u2019s \u201cright to a court\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.
