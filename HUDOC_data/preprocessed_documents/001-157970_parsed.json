Ukraine has endorsed national laws, policies and programmes related to health, many of which reflect international human rights instruments, including the National AIDS Law (2010) and the National AIDS Programme 2009-2013 - the strategy to achieve universal access. Despite positive steps towards strengthening legislative provisions for equal access to HIV treatment and care, serious discrepancies prevail in implementation. These are most evident in the lack of access to ARV medicines and associated laboratory monitoring for those who need it, which contravenes the fundamental human right to health, the constitutional right of all Ukrainians to health care free of charge (Constitution of Ukraine 1996, Art 49) and the right to free access to ART and treatment of opportunistic infections (National AIDS Law Art 15). Limited coverage of adequate testing, counselling and referral services, and periodic shortages of ARV medicines and commodities, result in lack of guaranteed access to and retention in ART for all those who are eligible. In addition, the lack of access to CD4 and VL tests presents barriers to timely enrolment for people who have been diagnosed with HIV. Consequently, many people initiate ART late in the course of the disease and are thus deprived of the optimal clinical benefits of ART. Continuing poor integration of services for key populations at risk of HIV and opportunistic infections, particularly PWID\u2014who not only constitute the population most at risk of HIV in Ukraine, but are also at increased risk of active TB and hepatitis B and C\u2014contributes to unequal access to life-saving services for those who need them most.\u201d",

The authorities must also ensure that a comprehensive record is kept concerning the detainee\u2019s state of health and the treatment he underwent while in detention (see Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, \u00a7\u00a083, ECHR 2006XII (extracts)), that diagnosis and care are delivered promptly and accurately (see Melnik v.

In Salakhov and Islyamova the first applicant\u2019s treatment for an HIV-related infection was sporadic and irregular. Moreover, the failure of the Ukrainian health care system to adequately address the HIV epidemic was noted in the recent reports cited above (see paragraphs 50-53 above), with prisoners mentioned as one of the most severely affected groups.",

In this connection the Court emphasises that it is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role, and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see McKerr v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 28883/95, 4 April 2000). The Court further reiterates that it is not its task to rule on matters lying exclusively within the field of expertise of medical specialists and to establish whether the applicant in fact required such treatment during the relevant period (see E.A., cited above, \u00a7 57) and whether the choice of treatment methods appropriately reflected the applicant\u2019s needs (see Ukhan, cited above, \u00a7 76, and Okhrimenko v. Ukraine, no. 53896/07, \u00a7 71, 15 October 2009). In view of the above and paying particular attention to the vulnerability of applicants in view of their detention, the Court considers that it is for the Government to provide credible and convincing evidence showing that the applicant concerned had received comprehensive and adequate medical care in detention.",
