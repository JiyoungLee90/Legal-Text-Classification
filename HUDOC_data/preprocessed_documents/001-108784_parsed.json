He also informed the court of the fact that he had only read the prosecutor\u2019s request at the hearing of 6 October 2008 and had not had time to properly prepare for that hearing. Besides the prosecutor\u2019s request, no other document had been submitted to the court or shown to the defence to substantiate the need for the applicant\u2019s detention. Nor had the prosecutor referred to any additional documents or other evidence during the hearing. The applicant had asked the first-instance court to hear a witness, who could have confirmed that the applicant had had a contract with B. I. and that B. I.\u2019s relatives in the police had threatened the applicant if he refused to return the money for the ongoing work, but the court had refused to hear the witness without giving any reasons. Moreover, the judge had relied on grounds which had not been mentioned by the prosecutor, thus showing bias towards the prosecution. The lawyer relied on Article 5 of the Convention and referred to the absence of any evidence to support the prosecutor\u2019s request for the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial, including the absence of any judgment or other evidence concerning the other similar offences allegedly committed by his client. In the lawyer\u2019s opinion, there had been no reason to believe that the applicant would abscond or interfere with the investigation. Relying on Article 3 of the Convention, the lawyer also complained of the inhuman conditions of his client\u2019s detention.",

Resolute steps should be taken to stamp out this abusive practice, which amounts to circumventing the legal provisions concerning the length of police custody in respect of criminal suspects. The CPT reiterates its previous recommendation that firm instructions be issued to law enforcement officials that persons suspected of criminal offences are to be held and questioned strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

In the report on the 2007 visit, the CPT called upon the Moldovan authorities to give the highest priority to the implementation of the decision to transfer the responsibility for persons remanded in custody to the Ministry of Justice. In response, the Ministry of Internal Affairs indicated that it was in favour of a temporary transfer of responsibility for IDPs to the Ministry of Justice, pending the building of pre-trial establishments under the latter Ministry\u2019s authority. However, at the end of the 2009 visit, the Minister of Justice indicated that the responsibility for the IDPs could not be taken over by his Ministry because conditions of detention in these facilities were substandard.",

The CPT recommends that, pending the building of new pre-trial establishments, the Moldovan authorities take steps to transfer the responsibility for IDPs to the Ministry of Justice.

The delegation\u2019s findings from the 2009 visit suggest that such abusive practices were widespread in the context of the April events. The CPT is therefore pleased to note that the new Contravention Code restricts the powers of the police to hold persons, on their own authority, for more than three hours. However, the delegation heard some recent allegations from detained persons that proceedings under the Contravention Code (for insulting law enforcement officials, for instance) had been initiated against them after they had refused to confess to a criminal offence, despite their correct behaviour vis-\u00e0-vis the police, and that their objections had little weight before prosecutors and judges. The lack of access to a lawyer in practice, at this stage of the procedure, had exacerbated this situation. The CPT recommends that prosecutors and judges be encouraged to be particularly vigilant as to the possible exploitation by the police of the provisions of the Contravention Code to circumvent the length of police custody in respect of criminal suspects.

Moreover, the toilet in the cells consists normally of a bucket or an open toilet without flush, at best separated by one meter high walls.
