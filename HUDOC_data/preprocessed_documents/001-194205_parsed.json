Most of the crew died within minutes of the explosions. However, twentythree crew members (of the 118 aboard) survived the explosions and gathered in a stern compartment. They wrote a note to report the events. All of these twenty-three men died on board the Kursk before the arrival of a rescue team.

However, by 19 July 2005, when the City Court examined the defamation case on appeal, Resolution no. 3 (see paragraph 31 above) had already entered into force, enabling the courts, in principle, to distinguish between statements of fact and value judgments. Yet the City Court did not refer to that legal instrument; it endorsed the District Court\u2019s reasoning based on Resolution no. 11 and emphasised that the applicants had not proved the truthfulness of the impugned statements (see paragraph 24 above). The Court has repeatedly pointed to the deficiency in Russian law on defamation whereby it refers uniformly to \u201cstatements\u201d and posits the assumption \u2013 as the present case illustrates \u2013 that any such \u201cstatement\u201d is amenable to proof in civil proceedings (see, with further references, OOO Izdatelskiy Tsentr Kvartirnyy Ryad, cited above, \u00a7 44).",

Such reasoning appears to be based on the assumption that interests relating to the protection of \u201cthe honour, dignity and business reputation\u201d of others prevail over freedom of expression in all circumstances. By failing to weigh the two competing interests against each other, the domestic courts failed to perform the requisite balancing exercise.",

The Court is mindful of the fundamentally subsidiary role of the Convention system (see Dubsk\u00e1 and Krejzov\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic [GC], nos. 28859/11 and 28473/12, \u00a7\u00a0175, ECHR 2016). Indeed, if the balancing exercise had been carried out by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for theirs (see Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0198). However, in the absence of such a balancing exercise at national level, it is not incumbent on the Court to perform a full proportionality analysis. Faced with the domestic courts\u2019 failure to provide relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the interference in question, the Court finds that they cannot be said to have \u201capplied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 of the Convention\u201d or to have \u201cbased themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts\u201d (see, with further references, Terentyev, cited above, \u00a7 24). The Court concludes that the interference with the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression was not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
