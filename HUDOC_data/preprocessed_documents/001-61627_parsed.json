He noted that many other people have been convicted of the offence for which he was prosecuted and have served prison sentences. The applicant recalled that the matter only came to the attention of the police because he reported being attacked by the complainant and he observes that, instead of being protected by the State, he was prosecuted in violation of the Convention. He also criticised the conduct of the proceedings. For instance, he suspected that the CPS deliberately told him that he was not required to attend a hearing at the Magistrates' Court so that they could request the court to proceed with his committal for trial and he further claims that the CPS deliberately delayed in informing him that the complainant had decided not to testify.",

Austria (nos. 39392/98 and 39829/98, judgment of 9 January 2003) in which the applicants were convicted since the only reason his prosecution did not result in a conviction was because he ignored advice to plead guilty and wrote to the complainant asking him to withdraw his complaint.

The Government noted that several of the cases cited by the applicant were considerably more serious than his own. In the cases of L. and V. v. Austria and A.D.T. v. the  (cited above), the applicants were subject to criminal proceedings and had been convicted and sentenced. In S.L. v.  the applicant was hampered in his sexual development and suffered feelings of distress and humiliation throughout his adolescence. The comparison with the cases of discharged military personnel was, according to the Government, misplaced: in those cases, the applicants had been deprived of their careers in which they excelled, in which they were destined for further promotion and from which they derived considerable job satisfaction. The remaining cases cited by the applicant were materially different from his case, involving the rape of the applicant by a State official while in police custody (Ayd\u03b9n v. Turkey, cited above) and the failure of the State to register the applicant transsexual as a woman thereby preventing her from marrying (B v. France, cited above). The Government further submitted that the Court has no jurisdiction to make consequential orders in the form of directions or recommendations to Contracting States and that therefore, the applicant's remaining claims should not be allowed.",

Ireland judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, pp. 21-22, \u00a7 50; and the Modinos v. Cyprus judgment of 22 April 1993, Series A no. 259, p.\u00a012, \u00a7\u00a030). However, the Court notes that in the more recent case of S.L. v. Austria, the Court awarded EUR 5000 where the existence of the discriminatory legislation meant that the applicant was prevented from entering into sexual relations with men until the age of eighteen. Awards for non-pecuniary damage were also made in cases where discriminatory legislation resulted in the prosecution of the applicants. However, the Court notes that the two cases cited by the applicant in which the Court made awards of EUR 15,000 and GBP 10,000 involved not only the prosecution, but also the conviction of the applicants and the imposition of a sentence, in the former case a suspended sentence of imprisonment and in the latter a conditional discharge, following a trial in which details of the applicants' most intimate private life were laid open in public (respectively L. and V.\u00a0v.\u00a0Austria and A.D.T. v. the United Kingdom, both cited above). The Court further notes that in the cases involving the discharge of military personal on account of their homosexuality, the investigations carried out were of an exceptionally intrusive character, the discharge had a profound effect on the careers and prospects of the applicants and the policy was of an absolute and general nature so that the applicants were discharged due to an innate personal characteristic irrespective of their conduct or service records (Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom (just satisfaction), Lustig-Prean and Beckett (just satisfaction), Perkins and R. v. the United Kingdom and Beck, Copp and Bazely v. the United Kingdom, all cited above). Finally the Court considers that the facts and violations in the cases of Ayd\u03b9n v. Turkey and B v. France are sufficiently different as not to be of any real relevance.",

As to the costs of the domestic proceedings, the Court notes that the applicant was invited to make a claim for costs following his acquittal but decided not to pursue his claim. In these circumstances, the Court does not find it appropriate to make any award in respect of these costs. However, it is clear that the applicant did incur costs in obtaining documents for his case before this Court and various other expenses including photocopying, facsimile transmissions and postage. Taking into account all of these circumstances, the Court awards the applicant EUR 600 in respect of his costs and expenses to be converted into pounds sterling at the date of settlement.",
