In particular, the tax inspectorate established that the LLC had failed to submit in good time the documents justifying the application of zero rate VAT to its transactions. The LLC\u2019s allegations that the relevant documents had been stolen were dismissed as unsubstantiated. The inspectorate recalculated the taxes owed by the LLC and ordered that the latter pay the tax arrears, the interest on that amount and a penalty totalling 14,948,778.61 Russian roubles (RUB). The case was referred to the commercial courts for consideration. The commercial courts confirmed the lawfulness of the inspectorate\u2019s claims.

It further reiterates that there are two aspects of the protection afforded by Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention. Firstly, Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 protects the right of any person to be \u201cpresumed innocent until proved guilty according to law\u201d. Regarded as a procedural safeguard in the context of the criminal trial itself, the presumption of innocence also has another aspect. Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuance decision in any other proceedings, the fair-trial guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person\u2019s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a093-94, and G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others v. Italy [GC], nos. 1828/06 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a031415, 28 June 2018, with further references).",

The Court answers this question in the affirmative. It accepts that the applicant\u2019s situation was \u201csubstantially affected\u201d by the inquiry conducted by the investigative authorities into his alleged tax evasion, during which he was repeatedly questioned as a de facto suspect (see paragraph 11 above).

The Court further notes that the civil courts based their decision to grant the claims against the applicant exclusively on the findings as to his criminal liability as set out in the investigator\u2019s decision of 2 June 2014. They did not evaluate any evidence or assess the facts or conclusions made by the investigator or the tax inspectorate. Instead, they simply referred to a mere existence of the investigator\u2019s decision and the audit report confirming the LLC\u2019s obligations to pay taxes.

In the present case, no such judgment was delivered against the applicant. The investigator refused to institute criminal proceedings against him. Nevertheless, the national courts granted the tax authorities\u2019 claims and considered it sufficient to conclude that the applicant was liable for the damage resulting from the LLC\u2019s failure to pay taxes merely by referring to the investigator\u2019s finding that the applicant had evaded payment of VAT, without examining any evidence or making independent findings of their own under the applicable provisions of civil law that the applicant was in fact responsible for non-payment of taxes. Furthermore, none of the facts cited by the investigator in the relevant decision and relied upon by the civil courts was scrutinised or validated in any adversarial manner either in the criminal or civil proceedings.",

Belgium (Article 50), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85; Tchitchinadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a018156/05, \u00a7 69, 27\u00a0May 2010; Fener Rum Patrikli\u011fi (Ecumenical Patriarchy) v.

Consequently, having due regard to its findings in the instant case, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be the repayment of the amount recovered by the bailiff\u2019s service to the applicant. Thus, the applicant would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which he would have been had there not been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Accordingly, the Court decides to award the applicant 688\u00a0euros (EUR) in respect of the pecuniary damage corresponding to the amount recovered by the bailiff\u2019s service from him as repayment of the judgment debt. As for the remainder of the amount which the applicant has been ordered to pay, the Court notes that a finding of a violation of the Convention or its Protocols by the Court is a ground for reopening civil proceedings under Article 392 of the Code of Civil Procedure and for the review of domestic judgments in the light of the Convention principles established by the Court.",
