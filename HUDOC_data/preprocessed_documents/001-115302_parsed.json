Another issue in dispute was also related to the fact that the Government failed to find some of the applicants\u2019 complaints stated to have been lodged with the relevant prosecution authorities. In the Court\u2019s opinion there is no need for it to resolve these disputed matters, for the following reason: the Government has never contested that the incident of 7 December 2002 as such was more than adequately brought to its attention, thus triggering the relevant authorities\u2019 duty to act promptly to verify the information and to institute a prosecution in the event of evidence of an offence being identified\u00a0(Articles\u00a024 \u00a7\u00a04, 261 and 265 \u00a7\u00a04 of the CCP). Even if the Government\u2019s version of events is accepted, the prosecution authorities learned about the second applicant\u2019s grievances concerning the police actions at the latest in February 2003 and, with respect to the first applicant\u2019s complaint, at the latest in November 2003. The Court is, therefore, satisfied that the applicants raised their complaints about the police actions before the appropriate domestic bodies; the prosecution authorities were accordingly obliged under relevant domestic provisions to carry out a preliminary inquiry with a view to opening criminal proceedings.",

Its progress is dubious, as the Government failed to submit any relevant documents from the case file (see paragraph 17 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the belated commencement of the inquiry and the apparent delay in the progress imputable to the relevant domestic authorities renders the investigation on the whole ineffective. Hence, the Court does not consider that the applicants should have waited for completion of the investigation.

Since the competent authorities remained passive in the face of the applicants\u2019 allegations of misconduct and abuse of power by State agents, the applicants could justifiably have regarded any further requests to the same authorities as a futile exercise (see Giorgi Nikolaishvili, cited above, \u00a7 114).

Consequently, the applicants cannot be criticised for not appealing against it (see, a contrario, Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v.

It is true that with the passage of time the applicants must have become aware of unwillingness on the part of the prosecution authorities to initiate an investigation. That being said, the relatively short period involved is not sufficient for the Court to conclude that the applicants should already have been aware, more than six months before they lodged their application on 26 August 2004, of the ineffectiveness of the measures applied (see Stanimirovi\u0107 v.

In proclaiming the \u201cright to liberty\u201d, paragraph 1 of Article 5 contemplates the physical liberty of the person; its aim is to ensure that no one should be deprived of that liberty in an arbitrary fashion. It is not concerned with mere restrictions on the liberty of movement; such restrictions are governed by Article\u00a02 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a04. In order to determine whether there has been a deprivation of liberty, the starting point must be the specific situation of the individual concerned, and account must be taken of a whole range of factors arising in a particular case, such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question. The distinction between a deprivation of, and a restriction upon, liberty is merely one of degree or intensity and not one of nature or substance (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6\u00a0November 1980, Series A no. 39, \u00a7 92, and H.L. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a045508/99, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2004-IX; see also Austin and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05260, ECHR\u00a02012). Article 5 of the Convention may apply to deprivations of liberty of even a very short length (see Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, no. 4158/05, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2010... (extracts), where the applicants were stopped for a search which did not exceed thirty minutes; see also Iliya Stefanov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a065755/01, \u00a7\u00a071, 22 May 2008, and Foka v.

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness.

The fact that the applicants were not provided with a single written document concerning the grounds for their detention either throughout the detention itself or subsequently after their release supports the applicants\u2019 allegation that they were left in a state of uncertainty and confusion as to why they had been deprived of their liberty on 7\u00a0December 2002. It should be further stressed that according to the applicants, they were subjected to several investigative actions during their stay at the police department. The available extracts from the relevant international reports confirm the applicants\u2019 allegations at least as far as they concern their questioning (see paragraph\u00a025 above). Under the particular circumstances of this case (see paragraphs\u00a025-27 above; see also Shamayev and Others, cited above), the Court considers that the applicants\u2019 questioning would have driven them even more into uncertainty as regards the reasons for their detention (see, a contrario, Foka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a088).",
