The case had been very complex: it had concerned eight persons accused of offences relating to complex financial operations. The case file had ran to twenty binders. At the trial the prosecution had relied on approximately sixty witnesses and the defence had called more. The difficulties in summoning so many persons had inevitably led to adjournments. The applicant and some of his coaccused had been responsible for a number of adjournments because they had sought to adduce additional evidence and because of illness. Furthermore, the case file had been transmitted to the higher court eight times for the examination of appeals against detention. The District Court had taken all necessary measures to reduce the delay: it had listed hearings in three-months intervals and had sought police assistance for summoning witnesses.",
