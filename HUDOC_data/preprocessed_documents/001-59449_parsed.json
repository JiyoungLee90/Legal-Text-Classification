In such proceedings, both a person\u2019s taxes and any tax evasion were examined in one and the same, mixed procedure. To the extent that the proceedings concerned the determination of a\u00a0supplementary tax, they involved no criminal element. On the other hand, to the extent that a fine could be imposed for tax evasion, the proceedings were of a criminal nature within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

When the applicant failed to do so, he was requested on three further occasions to declare the source of the income invested. The applicant not having reacted to these requests, a disciplinary fine of CHF 1,000 was imposed on him on 28 February 1989. After four additional admonitions, a second disciplinary fine, of CHF 2,000, was imposed on the applicant. The latter fine he eventually contested unsuccessfully before the Federal Court. Subsequently he received two further disciplinary fines.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, however, the present case does not involve material of this nature which, like that considered in Saunders, has an existence independent of the person concerned and is not, therefore, obtained by means of coercion and in defiance of the will of that person (see Saunders, cited above, pp. 2064-65, \u00a7 69).",
