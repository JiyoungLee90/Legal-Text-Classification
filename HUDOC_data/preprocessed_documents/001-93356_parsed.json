The unpartitioned lavatories - where persons were obliged to relieve themselves in the direct presence of their cellmates - exacerbated the effects of the very poor ventilation, rendering the already dank air nauseating. In many cases, persons were provided with no mattresses and blankets, and lacked basic personal hygiene products. The cumulative effect of the execrable material conditions and the impoverished regime could well be described as inhuman and degrading. This state of affairs was exacerbated by the fact that persons were being held under such conditions for prolonged periods (i.e. for up to three months and, on occasion, even longer).",

However, illtreatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Vala\u0161inas v. Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a0101, ECHR 2001VIII).",

Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. Yet it cannot be said that detention on remand in itself raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention. Nor can that Article be interpreted as laying down a general obligation to release a detainee on health grounds or to place him in a civil hospital to enable him to obtain a particular kind of medical treatment. Nevertheless, the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7 92-94, ECHR 2000XI). When assessing conditions of detention, account has to be taken of the cumulative effects of these conditions, as well as of specific allegations made by the applicant (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2001II). The length of the period during which a person is detained in the particular conditions also has to be considered (see Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2002VI, and Kehayov v. Bulgaria, no. 41035/98, \u00a7 64, 18 January 2005).",

The parties agreed that he was detained in two different cells measuring 12.5 sq. m and 12 sq. m and that these rooms had been designed for six and four persons respectively, whereas up to eight persons had been placed in the cells at the material time. Thus, the Court notes that at times the available floor area per person was limited to 1.5 sq. m. Moreover, part of the cells\u2019 floor surface, apart from the bunks, was taken up by the toilet corner and the sink; in the applicant\u2019s submission there were also a table and benches. The Court considers that such accommodation cannot be regarded as attaining acceptable standards. Severe overpopulation is something which in itself raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Kalashnikov, cited above, \u00a7 97). Moreover, unlike in the Vala\u0161inas case, in the present case the scarce amount of space was not compensated for by the detainees\u2019 enjoyment of a wide freedom of movement outside the cell (see Vala\u0161inas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0107). Indeed, according to the CPT report, the detainees were locked up 24 hours a day with no outdoor exercise (see paragraph 24 above).",

The domestic courts established that the conditions at the arrest house had not been in compliance with the requirements under the applicable legislation. However, they found that the State Liability Act allowed monetary compensation for non-pecuniary damage only if it was established that certain officials had been at fault for consciously placing a person in degrading conditions or for taking actions aimed at torturing or degrading him.",

In substance, they found that no redress could be afforded to the applicant in the absence of any fault or intention to degrade him on the part of specific officials. The Court considers such an approach too restrictive. It reiterates in this context that although the question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a factor to be taken into account, the absence of any such purpose cannot exclude a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see Peers, cited above, \u00a7 74; and Kalashnikov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0101).",
