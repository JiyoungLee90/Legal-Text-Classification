A person is considered innocent of a crime until his or her guilt has been proved in accordance with a procedure established by law and he or she has been found guilty by a court judgment that has come into effect. The presumption of innocence is inseparably linked with respect for and the protection of other constitutional human rights and freedoms, as well as acquired rights. It is especially important that State institutions and officials respect the presumption of innocence. It should be noted that public figures should in general refrain from referring to a person as a criminal until that person\u2019s guilt in respect of the crime has been proved in accordance with the procedure established by law and he or she has been found guilty by a court judgment that has come into effect.

In this connection the Court has emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041; B\u00f6hmer v. Germany, no. 37568/97, \u00a7 56, 3 October 2002; and Khuzhin and Others v. Russia, no. 13470/02, \u00a7 94, 23 October 2008). While the use of language is of critical importance in this respect, the Court has further pointed out that whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7 43; A.L. v.\u00a0Germany, no. 72758/01, \u00a7 31, 28 April 2005; and Paulikas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 57435/09, \u00a7 55, 24\u00a0January 2017). When regard is had to the nature and context of the particular proceedings, even the use of some unfortunate language may not be decisive. The Court\u2019s case-law provides some examples of instances where no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 has been found even though the language used by domestic authorities and courts was criticised (see Allen v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], no. 25424/09, \u00a7 126, ECHR 2013, and the cases cited therein).",

The Court therefore has no reason to doubt that the facts established in the proceedings against D.A. and the legal findings made therein were directly relevant to the applicant\u2019s case, which was pending at that time (see, mutatis mutandis, Navalnyy and Ofitserov v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 46632/13 and 28671/14, \u00a7\u00a0103, 23\u00a0February\u00a02016). It further observes that one of the key pieces of evidence against D.A. was his letter in which he had confessed to the murder and accused the applicant of ordering him to commit that murder (see paragraph\u00a016 above). In such circumstances, the courts examining the case against D.A. could hardly avoid mentioning the applicant\u2019s alleged involvement in the murder (see, mutatis mutandis, Karaman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066). Accordingly, the Court has to assess whether safeguards were in place to ensure that the decisions taken in the proceedings against D.A. would not undermine the fairness of the subsequent proceedings against the applicant (see Navalnyy and Ofitserov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103-04).",

As to the court judgments delivered in the proceedings against D.A., the Court observes that some statements in the Vilnius Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 20 June 2011 were worded in a way which may have raised doubts as to a potential prejudgment about the applicant\u2019s guilt. In particular, that court stated \u201cthe statement in [D.A.\u2019s] letter that [D.A.] \u2013 upon the orders of the individual in respect of whom a separate pre-trial investigation was opened \u2013 killed [R.\u017d.] so that all the profit would go to that individual alone ... must be considered true\u201d (see paragraph 18 above). However, the Court reiterates that whether a statement is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which that statement was made (see, among other authorities, Paulikas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055). In the present case, assessing the impugned statements in their context, the Court considers that, in the proceedings against D.A., the courts made it clear that they were not determining the applicant\u2019s guilt. The Vilnius Regional Court referred to the applicant as \u201cthe individual in respect of whom a separate pre-trial investigation [had been] opened\u201d (see paragraph 18 above), and the Court of Appeal explicitly stated that only the investigation which had been opened against the applicant could determine his guilt (see paragraph 24 above). The Court is thus satisfied that the domestic courts avoided, as far as possible, giving the impression that they were prejudging the applicant\u2019s guilt (see Karaman, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a069-70; compare and contrast Navalnyy and Ofitserov, \u00a7\u00a0106, both cited above).",

It underlines that the courts which examined the case against the applicant carried out a new assessment of all the evidence, including D.A.\u2019s letter, and the applicant had the opportunity to contest the truthfulness of its contents (see paragraph 28 above). Furthermore, the Court of Appeal explicitly rejected the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the findings of the courts in the proceedings against D.A. had to be followed in the proceedings against the applicant (see paragraphs\u00a031-32 above). The Court therefore has no reason to doubt that the state of the evidence admitted in the case against D.A. remained purely relative and that its effect was strictly limited to that particular set of proceedings, as further demonstrated by the applicant\u2019s acquittal (see Navalnyy and Ofitserov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0105).",
