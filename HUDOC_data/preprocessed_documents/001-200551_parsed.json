Where a respondent Government have convincingly demonstrated the existence of an urgent need to avert serious adverse consequences for life, liberty or physical integrity in a given case, this can amount to compelling reasons to restrict access to legal advice for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention.

As such, the Court finds it useful to reiterate the applicant\u2019s statements in respect of those offences and his position vis-\u00e0-vis those statements in the course of the criminal proceedings against him. In that respect, the Court notes that according to the applicant\u2019s statement form drawn up by the police, the applicant admitted to six incidents of extortion and gave factual information concerning the killing of M.Y. in his police interview, which took place in the absence of a lawyer (see paragraphs 8-10). Before the public prosecutor and again without a lawyer, the applicant accepted the three incidents of extortion, but claimed that he had learned of the killing from newspapers as he had no knowledge of who had killed M.Y. or how he had been killed (see paragraph\u00a015). Before the investigating judge and once again without a lawyer, the applicant accepted the three incidents of extortion but denied any involvement in the killing of M.Y., asserting that he had not acted as a lookout (see paragraph 16). However, the applicant denied the content of all those statements during the trial, specifically at the hearing held on 22\u00a0November 1999 (see paragraph 18). Then, in sharp contrast with that stance, the applicant decided to confirm all his previous statements at a hearing held on 6 April 2004 during which he asked to benefit from Law no.\u00a04959, which provided for a reduction in his sentence under certain conditions (see paragraph 23). Subsequently, he sent a letter dated 12\u00a0May 2004 wherein he reduced the number of extortion incidents admitted to two and essentially reiterated the factual information he had given to the police regarding the killing of M.Y., while denying any criminal responsibility in it (see paragraph 24). He maintained this position for five years until the pronouncement of the trial court\u2019s judgment on 13 February 2009. In view of the above, the Court cannot but note the applicant\u2019s inconsistent stance vis-\u00e0-vis his statements.",

As such, the applicant cannot be criticised for having made full use of the remedies available under domestic law, specifically Law no. 4959, in the defence of his interests (see Pishchalnikov v. Russia, no. 7025/04, \u00a7\u00a050, 24\u00a0September 2009, and Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v. Turkey, 8 June 1995, \u00a7\u00a066, Series\u00a0A no. 319A). However, the applicant, yet again, qualified his police statements in his letter dated 12 May 2004, stating that he had not accepted them in full, meaning that thenceforth he did not fulfil one of the essential conditions to benefit from Law no. 4959 (see para 35 above). Therefore, the present case does not concern the question whether the applicant\u2019s acceptance of his previous statements with the hope that he would receive a reduction in his sentence, and maintenance of that position until the end of the trial, was sufficient in itself to remedy the prejudice caused by the statutory restriction of his right to a lawyer to the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings against him (see Bandaletov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a023180/06, \u00a7\u00a069, 31 October 2013). The Court attaches importance to the fact that the applicant did not complain before it that this situation had been the result of undue pressure, duress or any other type of inappropriate conduct by State agents in respect of which he was able to lay the basis of an arguable claim. Neither did he posit any argument to that effect before the national courts.",

This is another factor reinforcing the view that the application of procedural safeguards \u2013 and not their mere existence in the form of legislation \u2013 is an essential prerequisite for the Court to examine whether a procedural shortcoming is effectively compensated to an extent that renders the proceedings fair as a whole. Importantly, the applicant in Beuze, like the applicant in the present case, also changed his statements throughout the criminal proceedings, which was not sufficient to absolve the national authorities from their duty to effectively operate the relevant procedural safeguards.",
