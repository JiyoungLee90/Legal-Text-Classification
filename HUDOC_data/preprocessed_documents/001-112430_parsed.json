In the absence of any explanations from the Government, the Court considers that the Forensic Medicine Institute\u2019s failure to identify some of the bruises later observed on the applicant\u2019s body may be due to the proximity in time of the alleged ill-treatment and the initial medical check, at which time not all bruises had developed and become visible.

In other words, they were not called upon to react without prior preparation (see Rehbock v. Slovenia, no.\u00a029462/95, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2000-XII). They should therefore have been expected to show a degree of patience and tolerance before attempting to disperse a crowd which did not present a danger to public order and was not engaging in acts of violence, as noted by the Beyo\u011flu Criminal Court in its judgment. The Government, similarly, did not claim that the applicant, or the demonstrators in general, had attacked the police officers, nor did they submit incident reports or other evidence that could suggest such disorderly behaviour. It thus appears that the police acted hastily and used disproportionate force, which resulted in injuries to some of the demonstrators, including the applicant.",

The minimum standards of effectiveness defined by the Court\u2019s case-law include the requirements that the investigation be independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny.

In addition, the Court reiterates that the rights enshrined in the Convention are practical and effective, and not theoretical or illusory. Therefore, in such cases, an effective investigation must be able to lead to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Orhan Kur v.

There were, similarly, no other attempts on the part of the public prosecutor, such as examining photographs or video footage from the demonstration, to elucidate the identities of the relevant police officers or to collect any other evidence in connection with the applicant\u2019s complaints. The Court notes that the public prosecutor instead incorporated the applicant\u2019s complaints in the ongoing proceedings against the six police officers (case no. 2001/1035 E.), who had been charged with offences against other demonstrators, without consulting the applicant as to their identities or carrying out any further research into his complaints.",

He had also stated that he did not know if the remaining two police officers, who were not present at the hearing on that day, had been involved in his ill-treatment, as he had not been confronted with them, or with any other police officers for that matter. Despite these clear statements by the applicant, which demonstrated the utter inadequacy of the investigation, the Court notes that the Beyo\u011flu Criminal Court did not request the public prosecutor to conduct an additional investigation of the applicant\u2019s complaints, with the aim of identifying and punishing the real perpetrators of the crimes committed against the applicant. Instead, the first-instance court acquitted the six police officers in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints, on the ground that the applicant had failed to identify them as perpetrators, without acknowledging that the charges had been brought against the wrong officers to start with. The mistaken indictment of A.C., who had apparently been on leave on the day of the demonstration, similarly demonstrates the haphazard way in which the investigation was conducted from the beginning.",
