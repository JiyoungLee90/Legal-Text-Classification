Instead, the only argument under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was confined to alleging that she had been placed under administrative arrest while no arrest record had been compiled. The Court notes that under Article 27.2 of the CAO the statutory purpose of the escort procedure is to facilitate the compiling of an offence record when it could not be done on the spot where the offence was discovered (in the present case at the entrance to Gorkiy Park). It appears that under the CAO the escort procedure comprises the initial stage of taking a person to a police station as well as the ensuing period taken for compiling the offence record. The police did compile a written record for the escort procedure. It is also noted that the applicant\u2019s presence at the police station was formalised and acknowledged in a police station logbook. The available material before the Court does not lead to the conclusion that either of these two periods was otherwise in breach of Russian law, for instance, on account of any need for further records to be compiled.",

Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention requires that the prosecution authorities disclose to the defence all material evidence in their possession for or against the accused (ibid., \u00a7 44, and Natunen v. Finland, no. 21022/04, \u00a7 39, 31\u00a0March 2009). The entitlement to disclosure of relevant evidence is not an absolute right. In any criminal proceedings there may be competing interests, such as national security or the need to protect witnesses at risk of reprisals or keep secret police methods of investigation of crime, which must be weighed against the rights of the accused. In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 \u00a7 1. Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see Natunen, cited above, \u00a7 40). Failure to disclose to the defence material evidence which contains such particulars as could enable the accused to\u00a0exonerate himself\u00a0or have his sentence reduced would constitute a refusal of facilities necessary for the preparation of the defence, and therefore a violation of the right guaranteed in Article 6 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 43).",

The appellate court did examine the video-recording submitted by the applicant\u2019s representative, which showed a number of people and the applicant standing with a banner (see paragraph 24 above). It gave a proper assessment to that piece of evidence and considered that it did not refute the findings of the trial court that the applicant had participated in a group event.

It is indeed unclear why the city police department replied that no photographs had been taken at the venue of the public event on that date, given police officer A.\u2019s testimony. However, the Court is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s allegations that those photographs could have been the crucial piece of evidence in her trial. It observes that the trial court had already watched a video-recording, allegedly made by the police on 15 September 2012, which showed the applicant standing with a banner, then the applicant reading a piece of paper and Z. holding a banner above his head. Despite the fact that the court declared that recording inadmissible evidence, the events shown on it were also described by the witnesses O. and Z. in their testimony at the trial and appeal hearings.

The Court cannot speculate as to whether the impugned photographs could show different events than those depicted on the video-recording.

Thus, solo demonstrators, such as the applicants asserted to be, could not rely in the exercise of their freedom of expression on a foreseeable legislative framework which, at the same time, had the potential of interfering with that freedom by way of classifying certain conduct or omissions as an offence on account of a breach of the notification requirement under the PEA.",
