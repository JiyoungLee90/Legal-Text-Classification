The applicants were suspected of selling Yukos oil through a network of trading companies registered in low-tax zones, in particular in the town of Lesnoy, Sverdlovsk region. According to the GPO, tax cuts were obtained by those companies by deceit, since the companies existed only on paper and never conducted any real business in the low-tax zones which would have granted eligibility for a preferential tax regime. The GPO suspected that the applicants registered and controlled those companies through their friends and partners, in particular Mr Moiseyev, senior manager and shareholder of Group Menatep Limited, Mr Pereverzin, director of two Yukos companies registered in Cyprus (see paragraph 116 below), and Mr Malakhovskiy, director of Ratibor (see paragraph 108 below).",

The off-shore trading companies transferred money to \u201ccushion companies\u201d under different agreements. Thus, South Petroleum transferred USD 60,293,115 to Wellington Interests under an agreement, dated 1997, which described that amount as a \u201cloan\u201d from South Petroleum to Wellington Interests. South Petroleum subsequently signed an agreement with Corden, stipulating that the former ceded to the latter the right to reclaim from Wellington Interests money due under the 1997 loan agreement, in exchange for a payment of USD\u00a06,008,200. Thus, South Petroleum sold Wellington Interests\u2019 debt to Corden for about 10% of its price. The remaining 90% was henceforth in new hands and was better protected from possible lawsuits. South Petroleum also transferred USD 15,940,000 to Arley. That money transfer was presented as a payment for promissory notes issued by Arley. However, those promissory notes were not supported by the debtor\u2019s assets and their real economic value was close to zero. As a result, the accounts of the trading companies were drained and the money was concentrated in the \u201ccushion companies\u201d. South Petroleum and Baltic Petroleum Trading also transferred considerable sums of money to their corporate owners in the guise of payment of dividends.

Flander and Alebra paid RUB\u00a07,257,663,538.11 for those notes, an amount which already included the interest accrued.

It raised the capitalisation of Yukos and inflated the price of its shares. Thus, in 1999 under the Russian accounting rules, Yukos\u2019s profits amounted to USD 228 million, whereas, according to the consolidated report which included trading companies and was prepared under the international rules (US GAAP), Yukos\u2019s profits amounted to USD\u00a01,152 million. In 2000-2002 the applicants, through Yukos Capital, concluded a number of very profitable deals with small blocks of Yukos shares. By attracting foreign investors on the open market and selling them a small part of Yukos\u2019s capital, the applicants tried to legalise their own status as lawful owners of the shares.

On the same date the court granted the motion. However, Mr Rieger, who lived in Germany, decided that it was not safe for him to travel to Russia, in view of: (i)\u00a0problems he had previously experienced at passport control while leaving Russia, which he perceived as being linked to the case against the applicants; and (ii)\u00a0lack of assurances on the part of the Russian Ambassador in Germany, who had been contacted twice by Mr Rieger\u2019s lawyers, that he would be allowed to give evidence at the applicants\u2019 trial without any hindrance and then freely return to Germany. In a letter of 23\u00a0July 2010 the International Criminal Law Department of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs advised Mr\u00a0Rieger\u2019s lawyers that it would be preferable for him to give evidence via video-conference. In a letter of 29\u00a0July 2010 to the trial court, Mr\u00a0Rieger suggested that arrangements be made through his and the applicants\u2019 lawyers for a video-conference. He pointed out that the Khamovnicheskiy District Court had the necessary technical equipment and had previously conducted proceedings through video-conference. The court neither replied to that letter nor contacted the German authorities in order to organise a video-conference.",

Those internal documents described the responsibilities of the leading executives in various fields, the legal issues and risks related to particular modes of operation by the trading companies within the group and the structure of oil sales, and summarised the ownership structure within the group, tax issues, etc. Some of those documents specified the roles of the first and second applicants in the group\u2019s management. The court examined e-mail correspondence between key employees who administered the system of sales; that correspondence described their functions, the projects they were in charge of, their bonuses, their subordination to a particular Yukos senior executive, etc. The court also had at its disposal correspondence by the lawyers who prepared Yukos for listing on the American stock exchange and described the plans for the sale and the risks related to affiliation. The lawyers also evaluated the potential growth of the tax burden in the event of the disclosure of affiliations, with a view to the company\u2019s possible listing in the US. Some of the memorandums of the lawyers working for Yukos concerned the \u201cpromissory notes scheme\u201d and indicated that the transactions with the promissory notes were likely to be declared \u201csham\u201d and that those responsible for such transactions risked criminal liability under Articles\u00a0160, 174 and 201 of the Criminal Code (page 471 of the judgment). Some of those documents were available in paper form and had been countersigned by one of the applicants. A large proportion of those documents, plans, memos and internal correspondence existed only in electronic format and had been obtained from the hard drives of a server seized in the Yukos headquarters (88a, Zhukovka village) by the investigative team during the searches. Some of the servers, according to the judgment, were located in the premises of the law firm ALM Feldmans (pages 550 and 595 of the judgment).",

The court heard the Yukos auditors, who explained that they had not been given full information about the affiliation links between Yukos and certain of the trading companies. Mr Rebgun, the receiver of the company\u2019s assets in the bankruptcy proceedings, described the situation with the Yukos-affiliated companies from 2004.

The court decided that previous judgments by the commercial courts concerned only tax matters and did not define the legal title to the oil. The commercial courts in the tax proceedings (which ended with the judgment by the Moscow City Commercial Court of 26 May 2004) took as their starting point the assumption that Yukos was the de facto owner of the oil at issue. In its judgment of 21-28 April 2005 the Moscow City Commercial Court defined the owner of an asset as a person who de facto exercised all powers of the legal owner in respect of that asset (page 659 of the judgment). In accordance with the position of the Constitutional Court of Russia as expressed in Ruling no. 139-O of 25 July 2001, the tax authorities were entitled to establish the real owner of property which was the object of a transaction on the basis of the de facto relations between the parties and irrespective of what was written in the contracts between them (page 660 of the judgment). While the commercial courts had established that Yukos was a de facto owner of the oil and benefited from its sales through the trading companies, the commercial courts did not find that Yukos was a de jure owner of that oil. Thus, the commercial courts\u2019 conclusions in the previous proceedings did not contradict the court\u2019s conclusions in the current proceedings as to the applicants\u2019 guilt with regard to \u201cmisappropriation\u201d of the oil which belonged to the production entities.",

In 2005 the applicants were convicted for tax evasion related to the operation of trading companies in the low-tax zones in 1999-2000. In the second trial the applicants stood accused of misappropriation of the oil belonging to the production entities in the period 1998-2003. The objects of the crime of \u201ctax evasion\u201d and of the crime of \u201cmisappropriation\u201d were distinct, as were the periods concerned. The court noted that Article 174.1 of the Criminal Code provided that the crime of money laundering could not be committed in respect of money acquired as a result of tax evasion \u2013 a crime punishable under Articles 198, 199.1 and 199.2 of the Criminal Code. However, in the applicants\u2019 case the \u201cmoney laundering\u201d concerned not the sums of unpaid taxes but the \u201cmisappropriated\u201d assets. Thus, the applicants first \u201cmisappropriated\u201d the oil by concentrating profits from its sale on the trading companies\u2019 accounts, and then committed the crime of \u201ctax evasion\u201d, since the trading companies located in Lesnoy ZATO (the low-tax zone) claimed and obtained tax cuts unlawfully. \u201cTax evasion\u201d was therefore a form of maximising the profits from \u201cmisappropriation\u201d. Consequently, the \u201claundering\u201d of money accumulated on the accounts of the trading companies concerned not the proceeds of the crime of \u201ctax evasion\u201d but the proceeds of \u201cmisappropriation\u201d.",

The applicants decided what to do with the profits and where to invest them at their own will, without taking into account the opinions and interests of other shareholders in the production entities. Similarly, the buyback of the shares in the production entities and in Yukos itself was decided by the applicants themselves, without any involvement by the minority shareholders. Those deals served the applicants\u2019 interests alone. The reinvestment of USD 2.6 billion in the production entities in 2003, in the form of loans by Yukos Capital, served only the purpose of securing control over the production entities in the capacity of their largest creditor. Although certain sums were reinvested in the production entities, this was not done on a gratuitous basis but on a reciprocal basis in the form of buying promissory notes or providing loans.",

The court of appeal also stated that the indication in the first-instance judgment that the applicants had acted \u201cthrough their lawyers\u201d was to be excluded, since the judgment was supposed to deal only with the applicants\u2019 crimes and not those of anyone else. The court of appeal also applied the new law amending sentencing principles to the benefit of the accused, changed the legal classification of the crimes imputed to the applicants and reduced the overall sentence to 13 years of imprisonment in respect of each applicant.",

The Presidium stated, inter alia, that the applicants\u2019 allegations that they had been tried twice for the same offences were unfounded. In particular, not only were the offences of tax evasion (for which the applicants were convicted as a result of the first trial) and the offences of misappropriation and money laundering (for which they were convicted in the second trial) substantially different, but the factual basis for their conviction in each set of proceedings was also different. In the first trial the courts examined the fact that the applicants had submitted tax declarations containing false information indicating that the companies Business Oil, Mitra, Vald Oil and Forest Oil were entitled to preferential taxation. In the second trial the applicants were convicted of misappropriating oil from Yukos production entities and the subsequent laundering of the profits thus gained. Whereas the applicants had used the companies Business Oil, Mitra, Vald Oil and Forest Oil for the purposes of money laundering, the source of their income was not under examination in the first criminal proceedings, as it had no bearing on the charge of tax evasion. Thus, the charges against the applicants in the first and second sets of criminal proceedings were based on different acts. The Presidium consequently dismissed the applicants\u2019 allegations of double jeopardy.",

Unequal exchange does not affect the validity of a transaction. Furthermore, \u201cmarket price\u201d is a relative concept, as corroborated by the fact that section 3 of the Federal Law on Valuation Activity provides for at least eight probabilistic and variable factors for assessing the market value of an object.

Accordingly, if a tribunal does not have jurisdiction to try a defendant in accordance with the provisions applicable under domestic law, it is not \u201cestablished by law\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Jorgic v.

The Court is therefore competent to examine whether the national law has been complied with in this respect. However, having regard to the general principle according to which it is in the first place for the national courts themselves to interpret the provisions of domestic law, the Court finds that it may not question their interpretation unless there has been a flagrant violation of domestic law (see, mutatis mutandis, Co\u00ebme and Others v. Belgium, nos.\u00a032492/96 and 4 others, \u00a7 98 in fine, and Lavents, cited above, \u00a7 114). In this respect the Court also reiterates that Article 6 does not grant the defendant a right to choose the jurisdiction of a court. The Court\u2019s task is therefore limited to examining whether reasonable grounds existed for the authorities to establish jurisdiction (see Jorgic, cited above, \u00a7 65 with further references).",

In both respects the domestic courts were in a better position than this Court (see Lebedev v. Russia (no. 2) (dec.), cited above, \u00a7\u00a0229, and Khodorkovskiy v. Russia (no. 2) (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 3). The Court also notes that the Moscow City Court, acting as the court of appeal, unequivocally rejected the applicants\u2019 complaint in this respect and found that the Khamovnicheskiy District Court had jurisdiction to hear the case because the \u201cmost serious crime\u201d imputed to the applicants was alleged to have been committed on the territory under the jurisdiction of the Khamovnicheskiy District Court (see paragraph 346 above). Finally, the applicants themselves did not specify which court should have had jurisdiction to hear their case. In such circumstances the Court would defer to the national courts and consider that the Khamovnicheskiy District Court was a court \u201cestablished by law\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

Italy, judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no.\u00a0257-B, p. 20, \u00a7 27). To that end Article 6 requires a tribunal falling within its scope to be impartial. Impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways. According to the Court\u2019s constant case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 must be determined according to a subjective test where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge, that is, whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and also according to an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7 93, ECHR 2009).",

Switzerland, no. 33958/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000XII). As regards the type of proof required, the Court has, for example, sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or ill will for personal reasons (see De Cubber v.

What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Wettstein, cited above, \u00a7 44, and Ferrantelli and Santangelo v.

Greece, no. 76438/12, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 6 October 2016). However, the role of expert witnesses can be distinguished from that of an eye-witness who must give to the court his personal recollection of a particular event (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7 711). In analysing whether the personal appearance of an expert at the trial was necessary, the Court will therefore be primarily guided by the principles enshrined in the concept of a \u201cfair trial\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, and in particular by the guarantees of \u201cadversarial proceedings\u201d and \u201cequality of arms\u201d. That being said, some of the Court\u2019s approaches to the personal examination of \u201cwitnesses\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) are no doubt relevant in the context of examination of expert evidence and may be applied, mutatis mutandis, with due regard to the difference in their status and role (see B\u00f6nisch v.

The concept of \u201cequality of arms\u201d does not, however, exhaust the content of paragraph 3 (d) of Article 6, nor that of paragraph 1, of which this phrase represents one application among many others. The Court\u2019s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether witness statements were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, Vidal, cited above, \u00a7 33, and Van Mechelen and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050).",

The Court notes that the defence was unable to call any of the experts who had prepared the reports at the request of the prosecution and to question with a view to casting doubt on their credibility. That fact has given rise to a separate finding of a violation under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) (see paragraph\u00a0485 above). Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s restrictive interpretation of the CCrP, which prevented the defence from calling \u201cspecialist\u201d witnesses unless they had participated as such in the preliminary investigation, left the defence with no possibility to rebut the conclusions reached in the expert reports relied upon by the prosecution. It thus led to a disproportionate limitation of the right of the defence to present evidence.",

The presumption of innocence enshrined in paragraph 2 of Article 6 is one of the elements of the fair criminal trial that is required by paragraph 1 (see Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 308). It not only prohibits the premature expression by the tribunal itself of the opinion that the person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d is guilty before he has been so proved according to law (see Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 62), but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041, and Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43, ECHR 2000-X). The Court stresses that Article 6 \u00a7 2 cannot prevent the authorities from informing the public about criminal investigations in progress, but it requires that they do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Khuzhin and Others v. Russia, no. 13470/02, \u00a7 94, 23 October 2008, with further references). Whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Butkevi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2002-II).",

At the same time, they did not contest the account of the events and the content of the statements as presented by the applicants with reference to media reports.

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, \u00a7 92, 17\u00a0September 2009, and Huhtam\u00e4ki v.\u00a0Finland, no. 54468/09, \u00a7 41, 6\u00a0March 2012). Article 7 of the Convention is not confined to prohibiting the retroactive application of criminal law to the disadvantage of an accused. It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that criminal law must not be extensively construed to the detriment of an accused, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. When speaking of \u201claw\u201d, Article\u00a07 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, among other authorities, C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03233, Series A no. 335C; S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22\u00a0November 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-35, Series A no. 335B; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.\u00a0Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97, 44801/98, \u00a7\u00a050, ECHR 2001-II; and Kafkaris v.

Indeed, in the Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition (see Del R\u00edo Prada v.

It further noted that given that the forms of economic activity and, consequently, the methods of tax evasion were in constant development, the domestic courts might invoke legal concepts from other areas of law, in particular the tax law, so as to decide whether a particular conduct amounted to \u201ctax evasion\u201d in the criminal-law sense (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0791). The Court subsequently held that, having found the applicants\u2019 business practices to constitute tax evasion, the domestic courts had given a novel interpretation to \u201ctax evasion\u201d which, however, was consistent with the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code and \u201cconsistent with the essence of the offence\u201d (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0821).",

The Court notes that \u201cstealing\u201d is an offence long known to the criminal law and that, unlike the offence of tax evasion, a precise definition of it was given in the Criminal Code. Also unlike tax evasion, determination of this charge did not involve reassessment of the applicants\u2019 entire economic activity, but was limited to particular transactions, namely those involving sale of oil from the Yukos production entities to the Yukos trading companies.",

Russia [GC], no.\u00a014939/03, \u00a7\u00a7 81-84, ECHR 2009) the existence of several approaches to whether the offences for which an applicant was prosecuted were the same. The Court presented an overview of the existing three different approaches to this question. It found that the existence of a variety of approaches engendered legal uncertainty incompatible with the fundamental right not to be prosecuted twice for the same offence. It was against this background that the Court provided in that case a harmonised interpretation of the notion of the \u201csame offence\u201d for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. In the Zolotukhin case the Court thus found that an approach which emphasised the legal characterisation of the two offences was too restrictive on the rights of the individual. If the Court limited itself to finding that a person was prosecuted for offences having a different legal classification, it risked undermining the guarantee enshrined in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 rather than rendering it practical and effective as required by the Convention. Accordingly, the Court took the view that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 had to be understood as prohibiting the prosecution or trial of a second \u201coffence\u201d in so far as it arose from identical facts or facts which were substantially the same. It was therefore important to focus on those facts which constituted a set of concrete factual circumstances involving the same defendant and inextricably linked together in time and space, the existence of which had to be demonstrated in order to secure a conviction or institute criminal proceedings (see Glantz v.\u00a0Finland, no. 37394/11, \u00a7 52, 20 May 2014).",

Therefore, these companies were not entitled to preferential taxation. However, the applicants, through the CEOs of these companies controlled by them, arranged the filing of the 1999 and 2000 tax returns of the companies, having deliberately included in them false information to the effect that tax privileges were assessed and they had no tax arrears (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0265-66).",
