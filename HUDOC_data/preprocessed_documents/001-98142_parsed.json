The Court notes that the judgment of 22 June 2000 was res judicata, and it was only by virtue of the introduction of the new transitional remedy on 21\u00a0June 2001 that the applicant was able to challenge that decision. In such circumstances, the recourse to the Supreme Court to challenge proceedings which had been brought to an end by a final decision must be seen as akin to a request to reopen those proceedings by means of the extraordinary transitional remedy provided for by the Law of 21 June 2001 (see Prystavska v.
