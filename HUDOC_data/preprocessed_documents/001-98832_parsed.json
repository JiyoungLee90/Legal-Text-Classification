Preventive measures may be applied to a suspect or a person charged with an offence where it is probable that the person in question might abscond, continue to be engaged in criminal activities, threaten witnesses or impede the investigation (Article 97). When deciding on the necessity to apply a preventive measure, it is necessary to take into account the gravity of the charges and the various personal details of the person concerned (Article 99). Placement in custody is a preventive measure applied on the basis of a court decision to a person suspected of or charged with a crime punishable with at least two years' imprisonment where it is impossible to apply a more lenient preventive measure (Article 108 \u00a7 1). A request for placement in custody should be lodged by a prosecutor (or an investigator or inquirer with a prosecutor's prior approval) (Article 108 \u00a7 3). The request should be examined by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level (Article 108 \u00a7 4). A judge's decision on placement in custody may be challenged before an appeal court within three days (Article\u00a0108 \u00a7 11). The period of detention pending investigation of a crime cannot exceed two months (Article 109 \u00a7\u00a01) but may be extended up to six months by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level further to a request lodged by a prosecutor (or an investigator or inquirer with a prosecutor's prior approval) (Article 109 \u00a7 2). Further extensions up to twelve months may be granted on an investigator's request approved by a prosecutor of the Russian Federation only if the person is charged with serious or particularly serious criminal offences (Article 109 \u00a7 3).",

Allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Jalloh v.

The establishment of such responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of conditions in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention. Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the receiving country, whether under general international law, under the Convention or otherwise (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 91, Series A no.\u00a0161).",

Since the nature of the Contracting States' responsibility under Article 3 in cases of this kind lies in the act of exposing an individual to the risk of ill-treatment, the existence of the risk must be assessed primarily with reference to those facts which were known or ought to have been known to the Contracting State at the time of the extradition (see Cruz Varas and Others v.

Human Rights Watch observed that granting impunity to State officials for acts of rampant torture was a common practice (see paragraph\u00a087 above). The US Department of State also reported frequent use of torture by security officials and pointed out that the Tajik authorities denied independent observers, including employees of the International Committee for the Red Cross, unhindered access to detention facilities (see paragraph 88 above).",

The Supreme Court, in its turn, limited its analysis of the risk of the applicant's being subjected to illtreatment to a reference to the assurances by the Tajik Prosecutor General's Office (see paragraph 38 above). The Court is struck by the fact that both the City Court and the Supreme Court claimed that the letters from the Tajik Prosecutor General's Office of 10 April and 26 May 2009 had provided assurances that the applicant would not be ill-treated in , whereas it is clear from those documents that no such assurances were given. It concludes therefore that the domestic courts failed to study carefully the documents produced in the applicant's extradition case. It is also noteworthy that the domestic courts made no attempt to examine the fact that the charges against the applicant concerned events that had occurred in the context of the aftermath of the civil war and that the Tajik authorities might have brought them with a view to retaliating against their former political opponents.",

Poland, no. 14348/02, \u00a7 66, 6 February 2007). A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see B\u00f6hmer v. Germany, no.\u00a037568/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054 and 56, 3 October 2002, and Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v. Slovakia, no.\u00a065559/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088 and 89, 27\u00a0February 2007). Whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Daktaras v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a042095/98, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-X, and A.L. v.

In the Court's view, the sentence in question refers first and foremost to the classification of the acts with which the applicant was charged in  under Russian law. Although the wording employed by the Russian Prosecutor General's Office was rather unfortunate since there was no clear indication of the fact that the applicant had been merely suspected of having committed \u201cactions punishable under the Russian criminal law\u201d, the Court considers that the Russian Prosecutor General's Office was referring not to the question whether the applicant's guilt had been established by the evidence \u2013 which was clearly not for the determination of the prosecutor issuing an extradition order \u2013 but to the question whether there were legal grounds for the applicant's extradition (see, mutatis mutandis, Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7 44).",
