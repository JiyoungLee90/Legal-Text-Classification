Details of the applicants and representatives are set out in Appendix No. 1 attached to the judgment.
.  On 27 March 2013 the heir of Ms Gurie Dvorani, who was one of the initial applicants in application no. 4036/10, Ms Lejla Ago née Belli, expressed her wish to pursue the proceedings on her behalf.

For practical reasons, the applicants Ms Gurie Dvorani, Ms Tefta Agolli and Ms Naide (Nahide) Shkodra née Frashëri will continue to be referred to in this judgment as the applicants, although their heirs are now to be regarded as such (see Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, § 1, ECHR 1999VI and Janowiec and Others v. Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, §§ 97-101, ECHR 2013).
.  The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms A. Hicka of the State Advocate’s Office.
.  On 25 January 2010 and 20 December 2013 the applications were communicated to the Government.

.  The relevant domestic law and practice has been described in detail in, inter alia, the judgment of Manushaqe Puto and Others v. Albania (nos. 604/07, 43628/07, 46684/07 and 34770/09, §§ 23-53, 31 July 2012) and Ramadhi v. Albania (no. 38222/02, 13 November 2007). Additional relevant domestic legislation includes the following:
.  The relevant part of the Constitution read as follows:
Article 41
“...
The law may provide for expropriations or limitations in the exercise of a property right only in the public interest.”
Expropriations or limitations of a property right that amount to expropriation are permitted only against fair/just compensation (përkundrejt një shpërblimi të drejtë).”
.  Under Article 13, as amended by Act no. 55/2012 of 10 May 2012, compensation should be determined on the basis of the market price, the type of property and its intended use.
.  The decision sets out the methodology and rules to be used for the valuation of the immovable property. The decision states that the proposed methodology is based on international standards for the valuation of immovable property, according to which the property’s value equals the price of the sales contract.
.  According to the decision, the price of the sales contract indicates the market value related to the type of property and its intended use. The Immovable Property Registration Office (“IPRO”) is responsible for extracting the market value on the basis of official data contained in the sales contracts registered during a calendar year. Every month the IPRO updates the data on the basis of the sales contracts. During the last quarter of a calendar year, the IPRO groups the data on the basis of the type of property in respect of each cadastral area (zonë kadastrale) and district (qarku). It forwards the information to the Agency by mid-November.
.  By the end of December, the Agency processes all the data and submits the valuations to the Minister of Justice, who, in turns, seeks the final approval of the Council of Ministers. The data are processed as follows: a) extraction of the minimal and maximal prices of sales contracts for each type of property and cadastral area; b) calculation of the average price of sales contracts for each type of property and cadastral area; c) exclusion of the lowest and highest values (starting from 5% difference) of the sales contracts; d) calculation of the widely tradable value (moda) – the one most often referred to in the sales contracts – for each type of property and cadastral area drawn from the aggregate number of sales contracts; e) calculation of the average price drawn from the aggregate number of sales contracts. This process leads to the final calculation of the immovable property’s value.
.  The minimal number of sales contracts for a cadastral area has been capped to three. In that case, the value of the property would be the resultant average price of the three contracts. In the event that there are no transactions for a certain type of land in a cadastral area, an indirect method of calculation would be applied, according to which the value for that type of land would be calculated by grouping the sales contracts registered for that type of land in the closest administrative level in accordance with the following ascending order: village (komunë), municipality (bashki) and district (rreth).
.  On 29 April 2015 the Government submitted records of a parliamentary meeting of 7 May 2012 of the Legal Affairs Commission, which within the framework of a debate on the new draft law on property restitution and compensation, discussed, amongst other things, the methodology to be adopted for the valuation of immovable property.
.  The Minister of Justice affirmed the Government’s intention to provide compensation at the market value, whose calculation would be based on the international standards for valuation of immovable property. Three components would be used for the calculation of the market value, namely the prices actually negotiated, the type of property and its intended use. Property valuation would be updated on a yearly basis in order to reflect market fluctuations.
.  Property valuation maps would be adopted by way of a Government decision. Experts from the Ministry of Justice stated that contrary to the existing methodology, which calculated the property values on the basis of between 20 and 30 factors and which contained various inaccuracies, the proposed methodology would extract the data from the contractual transactions concluded between private parties as registered with the IPRO. Given the adequate number of data that had been collected, this would secure a low margin of error in property valuation and would exclude interference by the Government in setting property values.
.  Concerns were expressed as to whether the methodology should be adopted by way of a Government decision or by Parliament itself. Scepticism arose as regards the existence of a sufficient number of transactions that would enable correct property valuation. Reservations were also made as to whether the transactions necessarily represented the real market value, regard being had to the fact that parties generally did not declare the real purchase/sales price in order to avoid payment of high taxes. The proposed methodology might be at the expense of former owners as regards their entitlement to compensation.
.  Relying on the decision on the methodology for the valuation of immovable property, on 6 March 2013 and 30 July 2014 the Government approved and issued new property valuation maps, which included the reference price per square metre throughout the country (Council of Ministers’ decisions nos. 187 of 6 March 2013 and 514 of 30 July 2014).
.  Relevant materials were referred to in this Court’s judgments of Metalla and Others v. Albania [Committee] (nos. 30264/08, 42120/08, 54403/08 and 54411/08, §§ 15-17, 16 July 2015); Siliqi and Others v. Albania [Committee] (nos. 37295/05 and 42228/05, §§ 12-13, 10 March 2015); and Karagjozi and Others v. Albania [Committee] (nos. 25408/06, 37419/06, 49121/06, 1504/07, 19772/07, 46685/07, 49411/07, 27242/08, 61912/08 and 15075/09, §§ 36-38, 8 April 2014).
