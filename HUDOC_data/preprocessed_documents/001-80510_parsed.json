The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and health of the victim. In considering whether particular treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3. However, it may be noted that the absence of such a purpose does not conclusively rule out a finding of a violation (Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68, 74). Furthermore, the suffering and humiliation must in any event go beyond that inevitably connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment, as in, for example, measures depriving persons of their liberty (see Kud\u0142a v.

Only searches carried out in an appropriate manner with due respect for human dignity and for a legitimate purpose may be compatible with Article\u00a03 (see as a recent authority Wainwright v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a012350/04, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2006....).",

Poland, no.\u00a025196/94, \u00a7\u00a059, 15 November 2001). Similarly, where the search has no established connection with the preservation of prison security and the prevention of crime or disorder, issues may arise (see, for example, Iwa\u0144czuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59, where the applicant, a model remand prisoner, was subjected to a search when he wished to exercise his right to vote; and Van der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62, ECHR 2003II, where strip-searches were carried out systematically and in the long term without convincing security needs). Finally, in a case concerning the strip search of visitors to a prisoner which had a legitimate aim but had been carried out in breach of the relevant regulations, the Court found that this treatment did not reach the minimum level of severity prohibited by Article\u00a03 but was in breach of the requirements under Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Wainwright, cited above).",
