Nevertheless, the Court considers that in the\u00a0interests of the administration of justice a litigant should be summoned to a\u00a0court hearing in such a way as not only to have knowledge of the date and the\u00a0place of the hearing, but also to have enough time to prepare his case and to attend the court hearing. A formal dispatch of a notification letter without any confidence that it will reach the applicant in good time cannot be considered by the Court as proper notification. Moreover, there is nothing in the text of the\u00a0appeal judgment to suggest that the appeal court examined the question of whether the applicant had been duly summoned, and, if he had not, whether the\u00a0examination of the appeal should have been adjourned. Furthermore, the\u00a0Court also does not lose sight of the fact that the summons to the hearing of 22\u00a0August 2007 was sent to the applicant on 10\u00a0August 2007, i.e. twelve days in advance. The\u00a0applicant resided 1,600\u00a0km away from the court. In such circumstances, even if the applicant had received the letter earlier, it is questionable whether he would have had time to prepare for the case, attend the hearing in person or find a\u00a0lawyer. In these circumstances, the Court accepts the applicant's allegation that the domestic courts failed to duly notify him of the appeal hearing, contrary to the provisions of the Russian\u00a0CCP.",
