The prosecutor asked the court to dismiss those challenges, arguing that there was no contradiction between the decisions taken on the impartiality of the judges determining the case. The appeal panel, presided by M.A.M., decided to reject the challenges, holding that they raised the same facts and reasons which had already been extensively examined in the judgment adopted in respect of M.A.M.\u2019s withdrawal request. As regards judge T.G., it was held that the new Code of Criminal Procedure provided that an application for the recusal of a judge who has been called to decide a challenge for bias or a withdrawal was inadmissible (see paragraph 38 below).",

As to the objective test of impartiality, relying on the cases of Margu\u0161 v. Croatia ([GC], no. 4455/10, ECHR\u00a02014 (extracts)) and Craxi III v. Italy ((dec.), no. 63226/00, 14 June 2001), the Government contended that the mere participation of a judge in previous proceedings concerning the applicant could not in and of itself raise any doubts as to his impartiality. Judge M.A.M. had found himself in a different situation to that of judge C.B. The recusal of the latter had been ordered for several reasons and not only because she had rendered the judgment of 14\u00a0October 2014. The Government pointed out that the challenge against judge C.B. for bias had been submitted only after the hearing of 11\u00a0May 2015 having therefore been triggered by the measures adopted during that hearing. In addition, judge M.A.M.\u2019s participation in previous proceedings concerning the applicant had been thoroughly examined in an extensively reasoned decision which had concluded that it did not constitute a relevant reason capable of raising suspicions concerning that judge\u2019s impartiality.",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law, there are two tests for assessing whether a tribunal is impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. The first test (subjective) consists in seeking to determine the personal conviction of a particular judge in a given case. The personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary. As to the second test (objective), it means determining whether, quite apart from the personal conduct of a judge, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality (see Dragojevi\u0107 v.

Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Otegi Mondragon v.
