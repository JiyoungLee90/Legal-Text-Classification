Nevertheless, the applicant has failed to sufficiently substantiate his allegation that the demonstrations in which he participated were spontaneous ones. In particular, given that, as submitted by the applicant, the death of soldiers in the army had already been a widespread problem in the country, it is not clear why it was urgent to hold a demonstration on a specific date, 12 January 2013, without giving five days\u2019 written notice. In such circumstances the Court is ready to accept that the dispersal of the demonstrations of 12 and 26 January 2013 was lawful (compare Ibrahimov and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 69234/11, 69252/11 and\u00a069335/11, \u00a7\u00a7 74-75, 11 February 2016).",

Therefore, for the same reasons as those outlined in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment, the Court concludes that the authorities in the present cases have not adduced relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstrations (see Gafgaz Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061). The authorities also failed to acknowledge that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration was by itself protected by Article\u00a011 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64).",

This deters other opposition supporters and the public at large from attending demonstrations, and, more generally, from participating in open political debate (see Gafgaz Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 67).",

The Court notes that the issues raised by the applicant are essentially the same as those examined in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment (cited above). The facts of the present case closely resemble those of the Gafgaz Mammadov case. The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment also apply to the applicant\u2019s second case. In particular, the Court noted a lack of necessary safeguards and guarantees in the administrative-offence proceedings, namely, a lack of adequate time and facilities to prepare the defence (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 78-81); the strong reliance by the domestic courts on the administrativeoffence report prepared by the police and the statement given by a police officer (ibid., \u00a7 85); the utter disregard by the domestic courts of important factual circumstances and legal issues of the case, inter alia, the peaceful nature of the unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7 86); the failure to provide an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of the applicant\u2019s own choice (ibid., \u00a7\u00a092); and the formalistic nature of the representation by a State-funded lawyer (ibid., \u00a7 93).

It observes that, after being held in police custody for a few hours and being questioned at the police station without the participation of a lawyer, the applicant was released on 12 January 2013 pending trial. The trial took place on 14 January 2013. However, the applicant has failed to explain before the Court whether, during the days preceding the trial, there were any circumstances rendering the time or facilities available to him inadequate; or any factors, such as shortage of time or of financial means, precluding him from contacting and hiring a lawyer of his own choosing to assist him at the trial.
