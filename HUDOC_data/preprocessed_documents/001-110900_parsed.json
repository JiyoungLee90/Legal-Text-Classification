The applicant, being handcuffed, was suspended from a metal bar between two tables, and Y., together with D., delivered numerous blows with a rubber truncheon to various parts of his body. Subsequently a mask was put on the applicant\u2019s face, and other police officers continued to beat him until about 7 p.m. The applicant signed numerous confessions. In the evening D. and Y. checked on him. As they considered that he had not been sufficiently cooperative, the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment continued until 4 March 2002. During that period he was detained in the police station, where he had no contact with his relatives or a lawyer.",

The Odessa Regional Court of Appeal, which had acted as a first-instance trial court in his own criminal case, had already considered the ill-treatment allegation and assigned its investigation to the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office on account of the deficiencies in the investigation undertaken by the local prosecution authorities (at the city and the regional level).

Thus, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, the admission of statements obtained as a result of torture as evidence to establish the relevant facts in criminal proceedings renders the proceedings as a whole unfair, irrespective of their probative value and of whether their use was decisive in securing the defendant\u2019s conviction (see G\u00e4fgen v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 166, ECHR 2010, with further references).",

It also notes that the domestic courts admitted those confessions as evidence in his trial (see paragraph\u00a040 above). In the light of the principles of its case-law as outlined above, the Court considers that this extinguished the very essence of the first applicant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, irrespective of the weight of the impugned confessions in the evidential basis for his conviction, and regardless of the fact that he confessed again several times during the investigation.",

Although his detention from 1 to 4\u00a0March 2002 was documented by the police as being based on a suspicion that he had committed an administrative offence, the Court notes that during that period the applicant was treated as a suspect in criminal investigations into such serious crimes as banditry, murder, robbery and theft. It was during that period that he confessed to these crimes and showed weapons storage places to the police. Looking beyond the appearances and the language used and concentrating on the realities of the situation, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s administrative detention in reality formed part of his detention as a criminal suspect, but without the requisite safeguards for his procedural rights, notably the right to defence (see Kafkaris v.  [GC], no. 21906/04, \u00a7\u00a0116, ECHR 2008, and, mutatis, mutandis, Doronin v.\u00a0, no.\u00a016505/02, \u00a7 55-56, 19\u00a0February 2009). The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 55, ECHR\u00a02008). The Court observes that, in the course of the applicant\u2019s trial, the courts failed to give an adequate response to his complaints about the early restrictions on his right to defence. Moreover, they relied on the applicant\u2019s self-incriminating statements made in the absence of legal assistance.",

Any such trial must observe, strictly, the substantive and procedural safeguards enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention (see Nechiporuk and Yonkalo, cited above, \u00a7 297).",
