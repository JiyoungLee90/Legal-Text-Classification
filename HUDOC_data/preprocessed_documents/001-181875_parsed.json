However, the application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention, and to this extent it is autonomous. A measure which in itself is in conformity with the requirements of the Article enshrining the right or freedom in question may, however, infringe it when read in conjunction with Article\u00a014, for the reason that it is of a discriminatory nature. Accordingly, for Article 14 to become applicable, it suffices that the facts of the case fall \u201cwithin the ambit\u201d of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols (see Khamtokhu and Aksenchik v.

It held, however, that two elements extinguished the applicant\u2019s entitlement to a more lenient sentence, the first being \u201cthe particular circumstances in which the offence had been committed\u201d, and the second being his lack of a permanent place of residence within the Moscow Region (see paragraph 5 above).",

However, where a sentencing policy or decision affects individuals in a discriminatory manner \u2013 for example, where the custodial sentence determined pursuant to domestic legal provisions differentiates between offenders on account of their age or gender \u2013 the Court has accepted that an arguable claim of a violation of Article 14 of the Convention, taken together with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), may arise (see Khamtokhu and Aksenchik, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 55-59; Gerger v. Turkey [GC], no. 24919/94, \u00a7 69, 8 July 1999; and Nelson v. the United Kingdom, no. 11077/84, Commission decision of 13\u00a0October 1986). The Court has no evidence of an established sentencing policy. Accordingly, the present case must be taken to concern an individual decision which, according to the applicant, introduced a difference in treatment based on his place of residence. The Court must therefore examine whether the respondent State put forward an objective and reasonable justification for the alleged difference in treatment (see Paraskeva Todorova v. Bulgaria, no. 37193/07, \u00a7\u00a037, 25\u00a0March 2010, and Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais v. Portugal, no. 17484/15, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2017).",

The Court has previously recognised that the \u201cplace of residence constitutes an aspect of personal status for the purposes of Article 14\u201d (see Carson and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-71) and can trigger the protection of that Article. In so far as the applicant\u2019s place of residence was explicitly mentioned as a factor in the sentencing decision, it introduced a difference of treatment based on this ground between the applicant and other offenders convicted of similar offences and eligible for a sentence of probation or a fine (see Paraskeva Todorova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-44, and Moldovan and Others v. Romania (no. 2), nos. 41138/98 and 64320/01, \u00a7 139, ECHR 2005VII (extracts)). The Court also notes that the difference in treatment introduced by the Chertanovskiy District Court and upheld on appeal by the Moscow City Court does not seem to follow from domestic law (see paragraph 10 above) and that the Criminal Code provides for the possibility for a person serving a suspended sentence to change his place of residence under certain conditions (see paragraph 9 above).",

Consequently, the illegitimacy of one of the grounds has the effect of contaminating the entire decision (see E.B. v. France [GC], no.\u00a043546/02, \u00a7\u00a080, 22 January 2008).

It did not explain in any form the relevance of this fact to the decision to impose a custodial sentence. While acknowledging the existence of strong social links in the applicant\u2019s home town of Cheboksary, where he had good references from his neighbours and work colleagues, the district court did not justify why the benefit of a non-custodial sentence should have been conditional on the applicant\u2019s ability to have a permanent residence outside his home region and near the place where he had been tried and sentenced. The appellate court, for its part, did not address the discrimination argument made by the applicant\u2019s lawyer and offered no justification for the difference in treatment (see paragraph 7 above).",
