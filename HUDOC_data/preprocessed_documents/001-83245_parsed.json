The Court is of the opinion that the practice of the Albanian Supreme Court at the time was incompatible with the \u201csubjective impartiality\u201d of a judge hearing a particular case, since no one can be both plaintiff and judge in his own case (see Svetlana Naumenko v.

It arose from shortcomings in the Albanian legal order as a consequence of which an entire category of individuals have been and are still being deprived of their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their property as a result of the non-enforcement of court judgments awarding compensation under the Property Act. Indeed, there are already dozens of identical applications before the Court. The escalating number of applications is an aggravating factor as regards the State\u2019s responsibility under the Convention and is also a threat to the future effectiveness of the system put in place by the Convention, given that in the Court\u2019s view, the legal vacuums detected in the applicant\u2019s particular case may subsequently give rise to other numerous well-founded applications.",

It reiterates that, under Article 46, the High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they are parties, with execution being supervised by the Committee of Ministers. One of the effects of this is that where the Court finds a violation, the respondent State has a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction under Article 41, but also to select, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in their domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress so far as possible the effects.
