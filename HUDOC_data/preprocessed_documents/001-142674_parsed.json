Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article 10 \u00a7 2 which must, however, be strictly construed. The need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, for example, Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 41, Series A no. 103; and Nilsen and Johnsen v.

In the text of the article this allegation was alleviated by stating that the victim of the homicide might have had such connections. The domestic courts noted that, for the reader, however, this information only appeared in the text of the article. Moreover, it was also of importance for the domestic courts that in the title K.U. was alleged to have connections with the victim of the crime. Even though it was specifically stated in the text of the article that the homicide suspect had no connections with K.U., this information only appeared towards the end of the article.",

By upholding the District Court\u2019s judgment, the Court of Appeal also accepted this reasoning.
