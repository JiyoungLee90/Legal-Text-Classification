The applicant stated that at about 3 a.m. on 12 April 2002 she had been woken by the sound of steps on the staircase. She had looked out of the window and seen that the house had been surrounded by armed men in camouflage uniforms. Then a group of seven to eight men in camouflage uniforms, armed with machine guns, had broken down the door, entered the flat and proceeded to her son\u2019s bedroom. The applicant had not been able to see the insignia on the intruders\u2019 uniform. One of them requested and took away Ibragim Uruskhanov\u2019s passport. The men had ordered the applicant\u2019s son to get dressed and follow them. When the applicant had asked why he was being taken away, one of them had told her that they were taking him to find something out and that in the morning the applicant would find him in the VOVD. The men had taken Ibragim Uruskhanov with them. They had ordered the applicant to stay inside and threatened to shoot her if she disobeyed, as the curfew was in force. The applicant had waited until the men had left the flat and had followed them, keeping some distance. The group, which consisted of about forty armed men, had walked through the local hospital\u2019s yard and then proceeded towards . When the witness reached the street she saw an APC without registration numbers driving towards the Russian military checkpoint. The applicant returned home. Early in the morning of 12 April 2002 she had gone to the VOVD, the military commander\u2019s office and the prosecutor\u2019s office. All these law enforcement agencies had denied any involvement in the abduction of Ibragim Uruskhanov. The applicant further stated that on the night of the abduction her son had been wearing a black sheepskin coat, a black T-shirt, a brown pullover, dark trousers, dark blue underpants, blue socks and black leather slippers. In May 2002 the applicant had found out that in the Chernorechenskiy forest human remains had been found. Residents of the nearby  had collected remains of two bodies, while pieces of clothing and a slipper had remained on the site. According to the applicant, she immediately had gone to the place of the discovery. There she had found pieces of clothing and a slipper that her son had been wearing on the night of the abduction. On the following day the applicant had gone to the site again, this time with representatives of the VOVD and the prosecutor\u2019s office. They had found the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s second slipper at the top of a tree. After that the applicant and the officers had gone to Goyty and asked local residents to show them the remains of the two bodies. Local residents had informed the applicant that they had identified these remains as belonging to their children. Then the officers had told the applicant that after abductions detainees were usually forced to exchange their clothing with other detainees, therefore it was possible that Ibragim Uruskhanov\u2019s clothing had been worn by other men.",

Checkpoints, manned by military servicemen, were located on the roads leading to and from the settlement. The area was under curfew. Ibragim Uruskhanov\u2019s abduction was carried out by a large group of armed men in camouflage uniform, which was similar to the one used by Russian military. The men spoke unaccented Russian, had Slavic appearance, were armed with machine guns and moved freely around Urus-Martan at night, during the curfew. On the night of the abduction an APC and a URAL military vehicle had been seen in , not far from the applicant\u2019s house, and after the abduction of the applicant\u2019s son these vehicles drove in the direction of the Russian military checkpoint. On 1 April 2008 the local court declared Ibragim Uruskhanov as a deceased person.",

The Government further contended that the witnesses had been unable to recognise insignia on the perpetrators\u2019 uniform; that the military APC and the URAL vehicle had had nothing to do with the abduction of Ibragim Uruskhanov and none of the witnesses had seen the perpetrators putting the applicant\u2019s son into the vehicles. Finally, the Government contended that the decision of the domestic court recognising Ibragim Uruskhanov as a deceased person was irrelevant to establishment of the death of the applicant\u2019s son and that there was no proof that the human remains discovered near the village of Goyty in April 2002 belonged to the applicant\u2019s son.",

In her application to the authorities the applicant consistently maintained that Ibragim Uruskhanov had been abducted by unknown servicemen and requested the investigation to look into that possibility (see paragraphs 29, 34, 35, 39, 40, 59, 61, 75 above).

Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were delayed and were eventually taken only several years after the abduction. Furthermore, the Court notes that, as can be seen from the decision of the local court of 5 August 2005, for almost three and half years of the investigation the investigators had not identified or questioned any servicemen, they had not established the owners of the APCs and URAL vehicles that had moved around Urus-Martan on the night of 12 April 2002, and that they had failed to establish and question witnesses of the abduction (see paragraph 48 above).\u00a0In addition, only in November 2006 the investigators collected the pieces of clothing and the footwear found on the site of the discovery of human remains in April 2002 (see paragraph 96 above) and it is unclear whether any measures were taken to establish to whom they belonged. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",
