The case originated in two applications (nos. 61432/11 and 64318/11) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Bulgarian nationals, Ms Violeta Aleksandrova Yordanova (“the first applicant”), Ms Timka Aleksandrova Rusamanova (“the second applicant”) and Ms Rumyana Strashimirova Telyatinova (“the third applicant”), on 15 September 2011. The second applicant passed away in 2013 and her daughter, Ms Svetla Velichkova Gogova, expressed a wish to continue the application in her stead.
The first and third applicants and Ms Gogova were represented by Ms S. Margaritova-Vuchkova, a lawyer practising in Sofia. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms M. Dimova and Ms I. Sotirova, of the Ministry of Justice.
In a judgment delivered on 19 July 2018 (“the principal judgment”, see Yordanova and Others v. Bulgaria [Committee], nos. 61432/11 and 64318/11, 19 July 2018), the Court found a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, on the grounds that the national authorities had failed, for many years, to complete a procedure initiated by the applicants under legislation adopted in 1997, aiming at providing compensation for properties expropriated in the 1940s. Administrative decisions awarding the applicants compensation through shares in a State-owned company named Obrazovanie i nauka EAD (“ON EAD”) – a printing house engaged in, among other things, the printing of school textbooks – had been given in 1998 and 1999, and further decisions setting the amount of shares had been adopted in 2003. However, none of the decisions at issue were executed, in particular because a legislative provision adopted in 2002 prohibited the award of compensation through shares in a number of companies, including ON EAD. No valid alternative method of compensation was proposed to the applicants.
Under Article 41 of the Convention the applicants sought just satisfaction.
Since the question of the application of Article 41 of the Convention was not ready for decision as regards damage, the Court reserved it and invited the Government and the applicants to submit, within four months, their written observations on that issue and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., §§ 50-52, and point 7 of the operative provisions).
The applicants and the Government each filed observations. They informed the Court that they have failed to reach an agreement.
