Turkey, no. 49548/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a058, 59, 24 June 2008) by awarding compensation with statutory interest running from the date on which the debt arose. The compensation was paid on 11 May 2005. The Court reiterates that it has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in a number of applications in which the applicants complained about the insufficiency of the statutory interest rates vis-a-vis the high monetary inflation rates at a given period in Turkey (see Ok\u00e7u v. , no. 39515/03, \u00a7 55, 21 July 2009, Aka v. Turkey, 23 September 1998, \u00a7 48, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI). Having regard to the economic data for the period between the years 1990 and 2005, in particular the fact that the statutory interest rate applied between the years 1990 and 1997 was 30% whereas the actual inflation rate varied between 60% and 96%, the Court finds in the present case that the difference between the statutory interest rates applied to the compensation amount and the actual inflation rate must have caused the applicant to sustain financial loss. Consequently the applicant had to bear an individual burden that has upset the fair balance which must be maintained between the demands of the general interest and protection of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",
