He was, however, unable to affirm that if the strangulation had ceased after the thyroid cartilage had been broken Michael Tekin would have been able to breathe again normally and survive, since the outcome would have depended on the injuries sustained previously. Furthermore, Dr B. took the view that the compression of the thorax and the fact that Tekin had been carried to the isolation cell were not, in themselves, sufficient to have caused his death.

The court held that R.\u2019s intervention had indisputably been a matter of self-defence, which ruled out any responsibility on his part. Having regard to Michael Tekin\u2019s personality and his nervous, agitated state, R. could reasonably have feared an imminent serious attack against L. and himself. The accused\u2019s reaction had therefore been absolutely necessary. The court accordingly considered that R. had react proportionately to the attack by applying a hold which he had learnt during training in the management of that kind of incident, and in respect of which nothing in the case file suggested that it had been wrongly executed. Subsequently, the continuation of the armlock had been equally justified and proportional in view of the fact that Michael Tekin had continued to struggle. According to the court, there was no objective evidence to suggest that the accused\u2019s actions had been dangerous, or that R. had used force not strictly necessary for the execution of the restraint technique. There was no indication that R. had known, or should have known, about the risk of fracture of the thyroid cartilage since that risk was not mentioned in the training programmes included in the case file; nor could he have been aware that in maintaining the hold he had been exacerbating the decrease in the oxygenation of Michael Tekin\u2019s blood, particularly since R. had not known what his colleagues were doing. Moreover, the court considered that R. must not have been alarmed by the detainee\u2019s reactions since he had continued to struggle and R. had regularly relaxed his grip to let him breathe. There was no evidence that the accused had noticed any change in the detainee\u2019s voice resulting from the fracture of the thyroid cartilage, nor, in any event, that they could have connected that putative change with any risk to Michael Tekin\u2019s physical integrity.",

Firstly, that negligence stemmed from the fact that the prison officers had not verified Michael Tekin\u2019s state of health once he had been forced to the floor and restrained and before transporting him to the isolation cell.

Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see the McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, \u00a7\u00a7 146-47).",

The text of Article 2, read as a whole, demonstrates that it covers not only intentional killing but also the situations where it is permitted to \u201cuse force\u201d which may result, as an unintended outcome, in the deprivation of life. The deliberate or intended use of lethal force is only one factor, however, to be taken into account in assessing its necessity. Any use of force must be no more than \u2018absolutely necessary\u2019 for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed from that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u2018necessary in a democratic society\u2019 under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims (see the McCann and Others judgment cited above, p. 46, \u00a7\u00a7 148-49).\u201d",

Persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (Salman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099). Consequently, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see, among other authorities, Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999-V).

It should be remembered that the scope of the positive obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities. In other words, only the fact that the authorities did not do all that could be reasonably expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life can constitute a possible violation of a positive obligation on the part of those authorities (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 116, Case-Law Reports 1998-VIII, and ScavuzzoHager and Others, cited above, \u00a7 66).",

The Court can therefore only note that, first and foremost, the applicant should never have been placed in a cell in an ordinary wing of Jamioulx Prison. Short of being detained in an institution tailored to his mental condition (see, on the structural problem identified by the Court concerning this matter, W.D.\u00a0v.\u00a0Belgium, no.\u00a073548/13, 6 September 2016), he should at the very least have been placed in a cell in the psychiatric wing of the prison which comprised, or should have comprised, the staff best trained in interacting with persons with psychiatric disorders.",

Under those circumstances, the Court can only conclude that the Criminal Court took no account of that fundamental aspect of the case in analysing the necessity and proportionality of the force used by the prison officers. Quite the contrary: the prison officers, the Deputy Director of the Prison and the Criminal Court would all appear to have treated Michael Tekin as an ordinary detainee in full possession of his mental faculties.",

The unforeseeability of human nature notwithstanding, the present case did not concern an operation conducted at random which could have led to unexpected developments to which the officers might have been called upon to react impromptu (see, to\u00a0converse effect, Soare and Others v. Romania, no. 24329/02, \u00a7 134, 22 February 2011).
