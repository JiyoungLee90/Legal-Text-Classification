Given the circumstances of the case at hand, the court decided that ordering mandatory contact arrangements between the applicant and R.S. would pose a threat to the child\u2019s mental health and development. It was not necessary to limit communication by means of letters, emails, phone calls or text messages, as this left the child with the choice of whether to respond or not.

Noting that it had been justified to end the joint right of custody over R.S., the Tallinn Court of Appeal found that the applicant had mainly challenged the lower-instance court\u2019s decision in so far as it concerned his contact rights with the child. The court underlined that the child\u2019s unwillingness to meet with his father \u2013 which he had expressed on several occasions  was decisive in this regard. The court considered that a nine-year-old was capable of expressing his will and noted that it did not have grounds to consider that the child had been influenced when making his statements. It was not uncommon that the child was not ready to communicate with the parent who had been absent from his life for several years. The fact that forced communication would damage the child had been proven by the opinion provided by A.T., the reliability of which the court did not have grounds to question. The court did not consider it necessary to ask for further opinions from \u00dc.P., the school psychologist or a psychiatrist whom the child had allegedly been seeing. The applicant still had the possibility to meet R.S. with the consent of K.T. but this required cooperation and understanding from both parents. The applicant was free to suggest means and ways of communication which would be acceptable to the child and which would not entail the latter being forced. As the main reason for not fixing contact arrangements at the time in question was the child\u2019s unwillingness to communicate with the applicant, it was irrelevant to address the applicant\u2019s claim that R.S. had been estranged from his father as a result of the actions of K.T. and that the latter had influenced the child\u2019s feelings about his father. The applicant\u2019s request to extend the counselling sessions with \u00dc.P. was dismissed, as it had been proven that continuing the meetings was not in the child\u2019s best interests.",

Addressing the termination of the joint right of custody over R.S., the Supreme Court stressed that despite the full right of custody being granted to one parent, under section 143 of the Family Law Act (perekonnaseadus), the other parent retained the right and the obligation to communicate with the child. The Supreme Court went on to modify the reasoning of the Tallinn Court of Appeal concerning the contact arrangements between the applicant and R.S. The Supreme Court found that, contrary to what the Tallinn Court of Appeal had stressed, it was not the will of the child but rather the interests of the child that were conclusive when deciding on the contact arrangements between the child and his father. In the case at hand, the courts had in substance found that, under the circumstances and at that point in time, it was indeed not in the interests of R.S. to have to communicate with the applicant. The child had to be afforded time to adapt to the new situation. Forcing him to have contact with his father might lead to the opposite outcome where the child might refuse any contact altogether, which would make restoration of the relationship in the future even more difficult. The applicant\u2019s claim that he had been estranged from his child owing to the actions of K.T. did not alter that finding. The Supreme Court refused to admit the additional evidence referred to in paragraph 31 above, stating that it was not for it to examine evidence.",

He noted that neither the child\u2019s guardian ad litem nor the involved local authorities had requested such measures. Moreover, the P\u00e4rnu County Court had restricted contact more extensively than the same court had done in its first decision on the matter, which the Tallinn Court of Appeal had quashed. In a situation where the parents were arguing over custody and contact rights, contact between the child and the parent who did not have custody could not be left to be decided by the parent with whom the child lived. In his opinion, the courts had not fulfilled their task to facilitate the restoration and continuation of the child-parent relationship. The lower-instance courts had essentially justified the need to restrict contact by referring to the child\u2019s wishes and had based their conclusions on the claims made by K.T., not on the evidence. The judge furthermore considered that the statements R.S. had made at a hearing had not been based on his personal experience but rather on what he had heard from his mother and stepfather. He also pointed out that the opinion given by A.T. had been based on the claims made by K.T. and by the school psychologist, who had not been examined by the court. It would have been pertinent to examine \u00dc.P., the other family therapist, who had offered counselling in the case and who had considered it possible to restore communication between the applicant and his son.",

The child, who had been unaware of the existence of her biological father, was approximately nine years old at the time. The Supreme Court reasoned that it was presumably in the interests of the child to know who his or her parents were and to have contact with the parent who did not have custody. Against that background, the parent with whom the child lived was obliged to allow and to encourage the child to have contact with the parent who did not have custody. The parent with custody could prevent the parent who did not have custody from having contact with the child only if such contact with the parent who did not have custody was not in the child\u2019s interests and would have a negative effect on him or her. In the case in question the Supreme Court found that it would have been premature to order contact arrangements between the parent who did not have custody and the child in a situation where the child, who was capable of understanding, was unaware of the existence of her biological parent. By ordering contact arrangements in such a situation the court would respect the child\u2019s right and presumed interest to know her parent and to have contact with him, as well as the right of the parent who did not have custody to have contact with his child, but would fail to take into account the child\u2019s actual interest and readiness to have contact with a parent of whose existence the child had been unaware. It was not known how finding out the truth affected the child, whether and how fast the child adapted to the situation, what kind of contact the child developed with the parent who did not have custody, and what frequency of contact served the child\u2019s interests the best.",

The Court reiterates in this connection that the cooperation and understanding of all concerned will always be an important ingredient in such proceedings. While national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such cooperation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited, since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see Hokkanen, cited above, \u00a7 58).",

The right of a child to express his or her own views should not be interpreted as effectively giving an unconditional veto power to children without any other factors being considered and an examination being carried out to determine their best interests; such interests normally dictate that the child\u2019s ties with its family must be maintained, except in cases where this would harm the child\u2019s health and development (see K.B. and Others v.

It appears that the applicant and K.T. attended counselling sessions prior to the suspension of the proceedings (see paragraph 18 above) as well as during the period that the court proceedings were stayed precisely for the purpose (see paragraph 20 above). It was in this context that the applicant was able to meet his son. The Court observes that such meetings took place only on a limited number of occasions, but points out that the decision to stop any further meetings of that kind was taken on the advice of the psychologist-family therapist A.T. The latter had noted that the child had been reluctant to meet his father and that the meetings had caused him great stress. A.T. had thus concluded that their continuing would not be in the child\u2019s interests. Moreover, forcing R.S. to meet his father could, in the opinion of A.T., be counterproductive (see paragraphs 20,21 and 28 above). No arguments have been put forward that would make the Court question the reliability of the opinion provided by A.T.",

Noting also that coercive measures against children are not desirable and must be limited in this sensitive area (see for example Hokkanen, cited above, \u00a7 58) the Court considers that the domestic courts\u2019 decision not to oblige R.S. to attend any more counselling sessions with his father, conducted either by A.T. or \u00dc.P., was justified. Accordingly, as the positive obligation of the State to restore and facilitate the contact between the applicant and his son was not one as to results, but one as to means, the Court accepts that, in the circumstances of the case at hand, domestic authorities took all necessary steps that could have been reasonably expected from them.",

The Court observes that in reaching such a decision the domestic courts took into account the views of R.S., who had expressed his reluctance to meet with the applicant both to the child-protection specialist of P\u00e4rnu City Government and to a judge of Harju County Court (see paragraphs 12 and 17 above). However, the domestic courts did not base their decision exclusively on the child\u2019s opinion. They took into account the factual circumstances as a whole (including the fact that R.S. had been estranged from his father for many years), analysed the arguments put forward by both of the parents (including the applicant\u2019s arguments that K.T. was influencing the child), took into account the opinion provided by A.T. (who was also examined in court) and assessed the opinions provided by the involved local municipalities as well as the child\u2019s guardian ad litem. As a result, the domestic courts found that it had been sufficiently established that (forced) contact between the applicant and his son would hinder the mental health and development of R.S.",

They did not, however, exclude that such meetings could take place, should the child overcome his reluctance, and subjected the meetings to the knowledge and consent of K.T., the child\u2019s legal guardian. Moreover, the domestic courts did not restrict other forms of contact between the applicant and his son.\u00a0The Court notes that, as the circumstances may change over time, the domestic law does not exclude the possibility for the applicant to lodge another application in the future for the revision of the contact arrangements, including the arrangements for physical meetings, between him and his son (see paragraphs 44 and 50 above).",
