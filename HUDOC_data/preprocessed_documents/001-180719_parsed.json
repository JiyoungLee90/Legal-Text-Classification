It observes that the proceedings in question, which were provided for by Royal Decree no. 1404 of 20 July 1934, were not capable of affording redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning the failure of the social services to act and the delay in implementing protective measures. The Court also notes that the criminal proceedings for sexual exploitation and rape, which ended in 2016 and 2015 respectively, are not the subject of the present application. Accordingly, the Court considers that the application should not be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies, despite the fact that the proceedings provided for by Royal Decree no. 1404 of 20 July 1934 were pending when the application was lodged.

I note in this context that the application lodged in the applicant\u2019s name was duly signed by both parents. The application is therefore admissible.

Furthermore, it must be stressed that the measure that was advocated considerably restricted the applicant\u2019s freedom, and that she opposed it until January 2014. The application effectively criticises the Italian authorities for not acting against the applicant\u2019s wishes as a minor and not restricting her personal freedom. In other words, the applicant complains of the fact that the authorities failed to protect her not just from other people, but from herself. It is undeniable that the parents and, where applicable, the authorities, can and must protect minors against themselves if the latter\u2019s interests so require. Nevertheless, it is difficult if not impossible to treat drug addiction effectively without the cooperation of the patient, even if he or she is an adolescent, and especially without winning his or her trust. Thus, the Italian authorities were faced with a particularly difficult situation.",

It emerges from the case file that the competent departments did not attempt to lend the parents the appropriate psychological support and the necessary assistance before seeking to restrict their parental authority. Moreover, it has not been established that the various departments undertook the necessary efforts to persuade the applicant of the necessity of seeking treatment for her drug addiction, or to win her trust. These considerations provide sufficient basis for finding a violation of the Convention in the circumstances of the present case.",
