In this connection, it referred to a 2010 European Union study showing that only ten of the then European Union member States defined domestic violence as a specific criminal offence. Of those, only four defined the offence with reference to an intimate partner relationship, while the others referred to any person with whom there was a family or household relationship. It also explained that different measures for an effective criminalisation of the particular acts of domestic violence may be required (pages 14-17).",

In particular, it considered that the Moldovan authorities had put in place a legislative framework allowing them to take measures against persons accused of domestic violence by providing for specific offences for acts of violence against members of one\u2019s own family (see\u00a0Eremia, cited above, \u00a757, and Mudric v. the Republic of Moldova, no.\u00a074839/10, \u00a7 48, 16 July 2013). However, with respect to Romania and Lithuania, it also considered that by criminalising domestic violence as an aggravating form of other offences of a violent nature, the domestic legal framework offered adequate protection against domestic violence (see E.M. v. Romania, no. 43994/05, \u00a7 62, 30\u00a0October 2012, and Valiulien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 78).",

Accordingly, in view of the above considerations, the Court finds that the 2011 Criminal Code, complemented by other comprehensive measures of protection from domestic violence (see paragraphs 54-55 above), provided for an adequate legislative framework in Croatian law securing effective criminal-law mechanisms for protection from domestic violence at the relevant time.",

Slovakia, no. 2660/03, \u00a7 47, 30 November 2010, and Rumor v.\u00a0Italy, no. 72964/10, \u00a7 59, 27 May 2014). The Court will thus now examine whether the manner in which the criminal-law mechanisms were implemented in the instant case were defective to the point of constituting a violation of the respondent State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 49 above; see also Valiulien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7\u00a079).",

The Court therefore rejects the Government\u2019s objection it has previously joined to the merits (see paragraph 43 above). It consequently confines itself to noting that the competent State Attorney\u2019s Office failed to consider reclassifying the charges against B.B. as offences of making serious threats and causing bodily harm to a family member under Articles 117 and 139 of the 2011 Criminal Code (see paragraphs 22 and 29 above). It also notes that the competent criminal court discontinued the proceedings against him on charges of domestic violence under Article 215a of the 1997 Criminal Code without examining the possibility of continuing the proceedings under the 2011 Code of Criminal Procedure by establishing the continuity of incrimination under the new provisions of criminal law as required under the relevant domestic law (see paragraphs 26 and 29 above) and taking into account the requirements of Article 7 of the Convention (see Rohlena v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 59552/08, \u00a7\u00a7 62, 70-72, ECHR 2015).",
