When finding a violation of the procedural part of Article 2, the majority of the Court has taken into account delays in handling the case and the reason for such delays, namely that the national court had considered it necessary to obtain further expert opinions. At issue in the case is the alleged neglect that occurred during the applicants\u2019 daughter\u2019s medical care in early childhood, and its causal link with her untimely death at 23 years of age.",

In my opinion, there are sufficient grounds to believe that investigating the existence of such causal link requires recourse to wide-ranging and profound medical expertise. In my view, the obtaining of several expert opinions was justified and compatible with the obligation to conduct a thorough investigation. In addition, the decision to obtain further opinions was justified by the fact that the first applicant contested the evidential value of the earlier opinions. In my view for the Court to state, without knowing their contents, that the new opinions were superfluous amounts to substituting itself for the national decision-maker.",

As stated above, the delay caused by the need to obtain expert opinions can be explained by the need to examine thoroughly the existence of a causal link. As to the other reasons for delay this same justification has, however, been presented to the Court as a length of proceedings issue under Article 6. In the present case, it is beyond doubt that the length of the proceedings as a whole, which began back in 1987 when the applicants\u2019 civil action was lodged and are still pending, is unreasonable. In this sense the alleged excessive length has, however, come to be seen as a violation under Article 6 paragraph 1. In my opinion, this same delay should not be used as a reason for finding a violation under Article 2 as well. This would lead to a finding of a double violation, using the same justification, of both Articles 2 and 6. In the \u0160ilih case the Court, when finding a violation of the procedural aspect of Article 2, considered that it was unnecessary to examine separately whether the length of the proceedings was compatible with the reasonable time requirement under Article 6. In the circumstances of the present case I would have preferred the Court to have found a violation under Article 6 alone.",
