The Government further stated that the domestic law applicable at the material time had not prevented the applicant from addressing private organisations, such as the media. All in all, the domestic law applicable at the material time had properly protected the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence.",

He stated that he had not been protected by the domestic law from an arbitrary interference by the prison administration with the exercise of his right to correspondence. The impugned domestic provisions had allowed indiscriminate censorship of convicted prisoners\u2019 correspondence. As a result, he had been afraid that his complaint about the detention conditions would have been censored if it had been sent through the prison administration.",

The reason for that punishment, as confirmed by the Supreme Administrative Court, was the fact that the applicant had sent a written complaint about prison conditions, dated 9 July 1999, through an unauthorised channel and not the statutorily required channel of the prison administration, in breach of Article 50 \u00a7 6 of the Prison Code as then in force (paragraphs 16 and 18 above). The Court finds that this punishment constituted an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence, within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Whilst it did not directly affect the posting or arrival of the impugned letter itself, it was intended to influence the manner in which the applicant sent future correspondence of that nature.",

Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, Commission Report of 1 October 1980, \u00a7 301). With that aim in mind, some measure of control over prisoners\u2019 correspondence, such as sporadic screening (other than letters involving domestic or Convention judicial business), may be called for and may not of itself be incompatible with the Convention (Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, Series A no. 61, judgment of 25 March 1983, \u00a7 98; a contrario, Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no.\u00a059304/00, judgment of 24 February 2005, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22). Such considerations do not imply, however, that correspondence may either be stopped for raising complaints about prison matters or delayed until such complaints have first been examined by the prison administration.",

Lithuania, no. 4902/02, judgment of 14 November 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 24-26, not final). However, the present case is distinctly not of that breed. The Court notes, first, that the applicant\u2019s complaints received an adequate judicial review by the  (paragraphs 16 and 30 above). Secondly, the applicant has failed to present any argument calling into question the proportionality of the measure imposed. Thirdly, the applicant has not shown that his possible fear of censorship was a valid excuse for circumventing an apparently legitimate prison rule regarding the channels of complaint. Fourthly, the penalty imposed on the applicant was of a minor nature. In the specific circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that the authorities did not overstep their margin of appreciation in the present case, and that the interference was proportionate and necessary in a democratic society.",
