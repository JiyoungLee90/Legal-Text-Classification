It noted that the proceedings have been pending for four years (between the lodging of the applicant\u2019s civil claim and the filing of her second length remedy). However, since the period of one year and five months had already been subject of examination in the first set of proceedings upon the applicant\u2019s length remedy (see paragraph 40 above), the Supreme Court limited the period under its consideration to two years and five months, which was not considered as excessive. It further found that the competent courts had acted expeditiously, the applicant had not contributed to the prolongation and that the proceedings had been complex. On 24 September 2012 the second-instance panel of the Supreme Court upheld this decision.",

It was then that a \u201cdispute\u201d within the meaning of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 arose (see Mitkova v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 48386/09, \u00a7 49, 15 October 2015). In the absence of any evidence about the exact date on which the applicant lodged her appeal, the Court, on the basis of the material in its possession, will proceed on the assumption that the date marking the beginning of the impugned proceedings was at the latest 23 July 2003, when the Appeal Commission allowed her appeal and remitted the case for reconsideration (see paragraph\u00a020 above). Thus the period to be taken into consideration started to run, at the latest, on 23 July 2003 and ended on 26 June 2008, when the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s administrative action.

In these circumstances, the Court is required to verify whether the way in which the Supreme Court applied the relevant provisions of the domestic law produces consequences that are consistent with the principles of the Convention as interpreted in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law (see Nogolica v. Croatia (no. 3), no. 9204/04, \u00a7 23, 7\u00a0December 2006). In doing so, the Court has to examine the period between the date the applicant lodged her civil claim and the date of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upon her second length remedy. If the Supreme Court\u2019s decision is consistent with Convention principles, the Court will, when examining the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies, refrain from dealing with the length of the proceedings subsequent to that decision. Otherwise, a genuine examination of the total length is warranted (ibid.).",

The case was still pending on 15 May 2012, when the Supreme Court gave its decision on the second length remedy used by the applicant. On that date the proceedings had lasted some four years and three months and were still pending. During this period there was one substantial period of inactivity amounting to one year and eleven months (from 10 July 2009 until 14\u00a0June 2011, see paragraph 38 above) when the applicant\u2019s appeal was pending for examination before the Court of Appeal which affected the overall length of the proceedings. The Court finds that this delay is solely attributable to the authorities and that the applicant did not contribute to the length of the proceedings. It further notes that although the case was of some level of complexity, all of the procedural actions were already completed before the first-instance court. Furthermore, at the time of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the applicant\u2019s second length remedy her appeal on points of law was already pending for review for about seven months.

In assessing this interest, any material or non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant as a result of the alleged violation must be taken into account (see Schlader v.\u00a0Austria (dec.), no. 30193/96, 7 March 2000, and Auerbach v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands (dec.), no. 45600/99, 29 January 2002).",

The awarded amount was not disputed by the applicant and does not seem unreasonable or insufficient. The Court notes that S.B.\u2019s building was legalised and incorporated into the newly adopted urban plan. It further notes that the civil proceedings in respect of the applicant\u2019s counter-claim seeking restitutio in integrum and pecuniary damages with respect to S.B.\u2019s building are pending (see paragraph 28 above). In view of these circumstances the Court is satisfied that the compensation awarded by the domestic courts was sufficient to remove the applicant\u2019s victim status in respect of her complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No.1 regarding S.B.\u2019s building. It follows that the applicant\u2019s complaint must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

The Court further observes that I.F. had a right to maintain a temporary building at the location until the implementation of the urban plan for the area and that, as established in the domestic proceedings, the demolition of I.F.\u2019s building would not necessarily have provided unfettered access to the applicant\u2019s property from the street. The Court also notes that the proceedings for legalisation of I.F.\u2019s building are pending (see paragraph 34 above) and that pursuant to section 31 of the Legalisation of Unlawfully Constructed Buildings Act of 2011 (see paragraph 44 above) all administrative and court proceedings in relation to unlawful construction of buildings that began before the entry into force of this Act must be stayed.",
