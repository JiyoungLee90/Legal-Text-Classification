The allegations of lack of impartiality and the alleged failure to respect standards of professional conduct contained in the pleadings could clearly lower Judge J.S. in the estimation of the public or undermine public confidence in his capacity to hold his judicial position. The applicant\u2019s document had a public character as it was formulated in official pleadings to a court, the files of judicial proceedings being accessible to all the parties to these proceedings. Moreover, there was a risk that its content could become known to the members of the public in the courtroom if it was read out during the proceedings. The allegations thus placed in the public domain were untrue and capable of undermining J.S.\u2019s good reputation.
