Therefore the Court concludes that in the present case and indeed as regards, at the very least, all applications lodged before 24 November 2007, there are no special circumstances which would justify a departure from the general rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see, mutatis mutandis, Piki\u0107 v. , no.\u00a016552/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030-33, 18 January 2005).",
