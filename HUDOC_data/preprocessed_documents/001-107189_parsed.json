In particular, it appears that the applicant was in any event precluded from lodging a civil claim within the criminal-proceedings framework, since without an official indictment there was no defendant to lodge such a claim against (see Kositsina v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 35157/02, 15 January 2008). As regards a possibility to institute separate civil proceedings based on negligence or strict liability rules, without awaiting the outcome of the official investigation, the Court notes that the Government themselves have pleaded that these remedies would have been ineffective in the applicant\u2019s case. In these particular circumstances the Court can neither hold against the applicant that he did not avail himself of such remedies, nor is it called upon to assess their potential effectiveness in abstracto (see Dodov v. Bulgaria, no. 59548/00, \u00a7\u00a086, ECHR 2008, and Dobrev v. Bulgaria, no. 55389/00, \u00a7\u00a7 112-114, 10\u00a0August 2006). It will therefore confine itself to examining whether the criminal investigation into Igor Antonov\u2019s death met the minimum criteria of effectiveness required by Article 2 of the Convention.",

Further, the investigation has lasted over twelve years and has been characterised by more than ten remittals of the case for re-examination and collection of additional materials. On various occasions the domestic authorities themselves acknowledged that the investigating officers had acted without due diligence when collecting evidence and ignored instructions given by their hierarchical superiors and domestic courts.",
