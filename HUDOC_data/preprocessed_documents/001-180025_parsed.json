More specifically, the Federal Court acknowledged that the law governing measures for offenders other than sentences (Articles 56-65 of the Criminal Code) applied retrospectively to criminal acts committed before the entry into force of the relevant law on 1 January 2007 (paragraph\u00a02, sub-paragraph 1, of the transitional provisions of the 13\u00a0December 2002 amendment to the Criminal Code). The Federal Court left open the question of the application of the principle of non-retrospective application to institutional therapeutic measures ordered subsequently, pointing out that although such measures were to be regarded as a penalty within the meaning of Article 7 of the Convention, the fact that such a measure had been ordered subsequently in the applicant\u2019s case had not resulted in a heavier penalty being imposed on him than the one applicable under the law in force when the criminal acts had been committed, seeing that the measures provided for under the former law (Article 43 of the Criminal Code, in force until 31\u00a0December 2006) had been at least as strict as those applicable under the new law; that being so, there had been no breach of the principle of non-retrospective application in the present case. Regarding Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention, the Federal Court noted that although a subsequent order for an institutional therapeutic measure was inherently at variance with the binding nature of the principal judgment, there had to be a sufficient causal link between the judgment and the measure for the subsequent detention ordered in the context of review proceedings to comply with that Convention provision. Such a link had been present in his case. With regard to the ne bis in idem principle, after noting that Article\u00a04\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention provided for a number of exceptions to that principle, the Federal Court observed that the review conducted in the present case for the purposes of ordering a subsequent institutional therapeutic measure on the basis of the applicant\u2019s serious mental illness, which had already been present but had not been detected at the time of the initial judgment, did not constitute a second penalty in respect of him.",

They inferred from this that paragraph 2, sub-paragraph (1), of the transitional provisions of the 13\u00a0December 2002 amendment to the Criminal Code, in conjunction with Article 65 \u00a7 2 of the same Code, \u201cthus provided for the retrospective application of a specific ground for reopening proceedings\u201d. The case of a review to the convicted person\u2019s detriment was governed by Article 189 \u00a7 1\u00a0(e) of the former Code of Criminal Procedure of the Canton of Basle Urban. In accordance with that provision, criminal proceedings that had been concluded by means of an \u201cenforceable\u201d judgment were to be reopened where, among other situations, circumstances or evidence unknown to the trial court appeared likely to result in an acquitted person\u2019s conviction or to give rise to a more severe punishment for a convicted person. The Government further submitted that the substantive law in force at the time had provided for institutional therapeutic measures, in particular under Article 43 \u00a7 1, second sub-paragraph, of the former Criminal Code, and noted that that provision allowed the indefinite detention of a convicted person who, \u201con account of his mental state\u201d, \u201cpose[d] a severe threat to public safety\u201d, on condition that \u201csuch a measure [was] necessary to prevent a danger to others\u201d. Accordingly, by deciding to impose an institutional therapeutic measure, the Court of Appeal had not ordered a heavier penalty than the one that would already have been possible and acceptable at the time of the criminal courts\u2019 decisions. In conclusion, there had been no violation of Article\u00a07 of the Convention, regardless of whether such a measure, like the indefinite detention provided for in Article 65 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, constituted a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of Article 7 of the Convention.",

To render the protection afforded by this Article effective, the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9\u00a0February 1995, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 307-A; Jamil v. France, 8\u00a0June 1995, \u00a7\u00a030, Series A no. 317-B; and Uttley, cited above). The wording of the second sentence of Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the Convention indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 28; Jamil, cited above, \u00a7 31; Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a042293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v.\u00a0the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006-XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0142). The severity of the measure is not, however, in itself decisive, since, for instance, many non-penal measures of a preventive nature may have a substantial impact on the person concerned (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 32; Van der Velden, cited above; and M. v.

Consequently, where the nature and purpose of a measure relates to the remission of a sentence or a change in a regime for early release, the measure does not form an integral part of the \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of Article 7 of the Convention (see, inter alia, Hogben v. the United Kingdom, no. 11653/85, Commission decision of 3 March 1986, Decisions and Reports 46, p.\u00a0231; Grava v.
