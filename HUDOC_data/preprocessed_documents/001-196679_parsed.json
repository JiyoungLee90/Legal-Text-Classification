He claimed that he had been placed in an orphanage at the age of four when his mother got married a second time, to a military officer who did not wish to have him as his son. He grew up as an orphan believing, because his mother had told him so, that his biological father had been killed in a road accident. He maintained that he had left the country, at the age of eighteen, to work in the United States, where he had lived for about twenty-five years and had a real estate business. He further maintained that it was not until October 2003 that he had learnt from his relatives, when he had travelled to Turkey, that the person whom he had presumed to be his father was not his biological father but was in fact his mother\u2019s first husband, N. \u00c7ap\u0131n, who had indeed been killed in a road accident. His relatives also told him that he had been born out of wedlock from his mother\u2019s extramarital relationship with \u201c\u0130smail\u201d. He further submitted that the particular point in time when he had found out that the \u201c\u0130smail\u201d referred to in his national identity card could be \u0130smail S., an engineer working at a public utility company in Ankara, was 3 October 2003.

Lastly, he asked the court to collect all evidence necessary to establish whether \u0130smail S. was his biological father, including identity register records, witness statements and DNA tests.",

In the present case, the Court notes that the decision in the applicant\u2019s case had become final with the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision. In such circumstances, an application for reopening of the proceedings was an extraordinary remedy, which the applicant was not required to exhaust (see Merter and Others v.\u00a0\u00a0Turkey, no. 2249/03, \u00a7 33, 23\u00a0March 2010).",

Furthermore, unlike in the Court of Cassation\u2019s decisions referred to by the Government, in the applicant\u2019s case the Court of Cassation upheld the first-instance court\u2019s decision and therefore excluded the possibility of an examination on the merits.

There may additionally be positive obligations inherent in ensuring effective \u201crespect\u201d for private or family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Mikuli\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 57, and S.H. and Others v. Austria [GC], no.\u00a057813/00, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2011). However, the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under this provision do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In both cases consideration must be given to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. A balancing exercise is also required with regard to competing private interests. In this connection it should be observed that the expression \u201ceveryone\u201d in Article 8 of the Convention applies to both the child and the putative father. While, as stated earlier, on the one hand, people have a right to know their identity, on the other hand, a putative father\u2019s interest in being protected from allegations concerning circumstances that date back many years cannot be denied. Lastly, in addition to that conflict of interests, other interests may come into play, such as those of third parties \u2012 principally those of the putative father\u2019s family \u2012 and the general interests of legal certainty (see Backlund, cited above, \u00a7 46).",

In contrast to situations where proceedings were instituted by fathers to establish or deny paternity, a significant number of States did not set a limitation period for children to bring an action aimed at having paternity established. Indeed, a tendency could be observed towards increasing protection of the child\u2019s right to have its paternal parentage established (see Phinikaridou, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058).",

Only a small number of legal systems seemed to have devised solutions to the problem which arose when the relevant circumstances became known only after expiry of the time-limit, for instance by providing for the possibility of bringing an action after the time-limit had expired in cases where material or moral factors rendered it impossible to lodge it within that period, or if there was good reason for the delay (ibid., \u00a7 59).",

The Court will therefore examine whether the circumstances substantiating a particular paternity claim existed before or after the expiry of the applicable time-limit. Furthermore, the Court will examine whether an alternative form of redress exists in the event that the proceedings in question are time-barred. This would include, for example, the availability of effective domestic remedies to obtain an extension of the time-limit or exceptions to the application of a time-limit in situations where a person becomes aware of the biological reality after the time-limit has expired (see Phinikaridou, cited above, \u00a7\u00a054). The yardstick against which the above factors are measured is whether a legal presumption has been allowed to prevail over the biological and social reality and if so whether, in the circumstances, this is compatible with the obligation to secure \u201ceffective\u201d respect for private and family life, taking into account the margin of appreciation left to the State and the established facts and the wishes of those concerned (ibid., \u00a7\u00a055; see also Silva and Mondim Correia, cited above, \u00a7 58).",
