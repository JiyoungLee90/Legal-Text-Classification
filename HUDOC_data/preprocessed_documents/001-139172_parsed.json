In the opinion given by the experts on 14 June 2007 it was noted that V. did not wish to talk about the events and it could be seen from the video-recorded interview (see paragraph 9 above) that V. had been promised that if he told what had happened he would never be asked questions about it again. The psychological experts considered that V.\u2019s intellectual development was slightly behind the norm for his age. They noted that it was characteristic of a child\u2019s memory that after some time (one or two years) a child was no longer able to distinguish whether he remembered a real fact or something heard from others. Repeated questioning would not necessarily yield a more reliable outcome or statements matching his earlier statements. V. became anxious when communicating with adult strangers and he avoided both listening and responding. The experts considered that for the sake of V.\u2019s emotional development it was not safe for him for the matter to be raised again. The experts considered that V. would definitely not be able to make an adequate statement if questioned directly in the courtroom and that the problems would, to a large extent, persist if remote questioning devices were used. The experts did not think that repeated questioning of V. could further clarify the circumstances of the case, while it could be harmful to the child.",

Statements made by [V.] during the pre-trial proceedings were disclosed at the court hearing on the basis of Article 291 (5) of the [Code of Criminal Procedure]. During the pre-trial proceedings [V.] was interviewed in the presence of a psychologist. In the expert opinion ... concerning ... the victim given by forensic psychological experts, those experts have, inter alia, assessed the circumstances of the interview with the victim and the victim\u2019s behaviour during the interview. The experts\u2019 opinion is that the manner of questioning used in the victim\u2019s interview on 16 December 2005 was generally appropriate from the standpoint of child psychology. The experts stated that it was wholly natural for a child of that age to start crying in such a situation. During the interview the victim had been generally anxious and stressed, but there was a certain difference between his answers to neutral [questions] and questions related to the unpleasant event: in response to the difficult questions the victim was usually silent ... According to the experts\u2019 assessment the level of the victim\u2019s mental development does not correspond to [his] age. However, he is capable of correctly perceiving and describing in accordance with his level of development his experience of events which have taken place in his vicinity ... In the opinion of the experts it can be concluded from the victim\u2019s behaviour during the interview that what had happened had a negative sense for him ... The court, in assessing the statements of the victim, relying on the opinion of the experts and [its own] conviction developed when watching the video recording of the interview, considers that the statements of the victim are sincere and there is no reason to doubt the truthfulness of [his] statements. The court is convinced that [V.] has replied to the questions put to him in accordance with [his] level of mental development described by the experts and his understanding of what happened. Descriptions of events which would be appropriate for an adult cannot be expected of a victim of such an age. It can be seen from the video recording that it was difficult for the victim to explain what had happened. The court finds that the version of the accused, namely that the victims made up the event to get him charged, is clearly self-justificatory, since in such a case also victim [V.] would also have to give his statements in a more fluent and coherent manner. The truthfulness of [V.\u2019s] statements is indirectly confirmed by the fact that [he] has described the events similarly to [K.] and also to [his older brother and mother]. The latter have given statements to the effect that it was unpleasant for the victim to talk about the events and that they had no reason to doubt what they had been told. [V.\u2019s older brother and his mother] are members of [his] family and they have known [him] for a long time. Therefore their opinion about the truthfulness of the victim\u2019s statements also confirms the court\u2019s conviction that [V.] gave truthful statements during the interview.",

The accused justified changing his statements and the earlier admission of guilt by the influence of his cellmates as well as the later classification of the act as rape under Article 141 \u00a7 2 (1) of the [Penal Code] instead of the earlier classification as satisfaction of sexual desire by violence under Article 142 \u00a7 2 (1) of the [Penal Code]. The accused has also argued that the charges against him were fabricated and were driven by the victims\u2019 desire to take revenge on him. The court is of the opinion that the accused has not convincingly explained the victims\u2019 alleged enmity towards him. The accused has not indicated any factors that could have triggered such enmity. Nor is the allegation by the accused of a frame-up by the victims supported by other evidence examined in the case. The court also finds that the explanations of the accused of the reasons for changing his statements are not convincing. [The applicant] has confirmed that when [he was] interviewed as a suspect on 29 December 200[5] [and] confessed to the crime he was guaranteed representation by counsel. The accused has also confirmed that defence counsel had not told him to plead guilty. Therefore the court considers the statements of the accused self-justificatory and unreliable in so far as he denies undressing the victims, the criminal act itself and the disappearance of the victims\u2019 underpants. On the basis of the above the court is of the opinion that the charges against [the applicant] are well-founded and that [he] has committed the acts of which he is accused.\u201d",

Even where such a statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission in evidence will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1. At the same time, where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. The Court will examine whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures permitting a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0118 and 147; Aigner, cited above, \u00a7 35; and Gani, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

While K. was examined at the court hearing but had no recollection of the offence, V. was not examined in court, but the court rather relied on the video recording of an interview with him carried out by a police investigator the day after the offence. A psychological expert opinion indicated that it was not considered safe for V. for the matter to be raised again; the experts considered that he was unable to testify adequately in the courtroom and that the problems would also persist if remote examination was used (see paragraph 22 above). Considering the need to take specific measures for the purpose of protecting victims in criminal proceedings concerning sexual offences, particularly in cases involving minors, it can be concluded that in the present case there was a good reason for the non-attendance of V. and for his pre-trial statements to be admitted in evidence (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 120, and Vronchenko, cited above, \u00a7 58; compare Aigner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39).",

The interview was carried out on 16\u00a0December 2005 and concerned events that had taken place the day before. V. was promised during the interview that if he told about what had happened, he would never be asked questions about it again. Indeed, although V. was summoned to the County Court hearing in the first round of the proceedings, the court granted the prosecutor\u2019s request to dismiss him from the hearing, owing to his young age and the nature of the matter. Subsequently, following the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment, V. was examined by psychologists on 14 June 2007, in whose expert opinion attending a court hearing could be harmful to the child. In these circumstances, the Court finds that there is some indication that the investigating authorities had already taken the view that V. was not expected to be examined at a court hearing at the outset of the proceedings (compare Vronchenko, cited above, \u00a7 60).",

The Supreme Court held that the examination at a court hearing of a victim of a sexual offence who was a minor was not, as such, indispensable, but his ability or otherwise to give statements was to be established on the basis of an expert assessment (see paragraph 20 above). In the second round of the proceedings, basing its view on the psychological expert opinion, the County Court refused the request by the defence for V. to be called to the hearing. Instead, the video recording of V.\u2019s testimony given during the pre-trial investigation was played at the hearing.",

The Court acknowledges the Supreme Court\u2019s attempt in the present case to remedy the situation and secure the applicant\u2019s rights. Nevertheless, although the fact that the courts subsequently obtained an expert opinion on whether it was possible to examine V. at the court hearing can be seen as a safeguard against any ill-considered refusal to summon the witness, the Court considers it insufficient in the circumstances of the present case. Although the Court has no doubt that the judicial authorities made a genuine attempt to secure the applicant\u2019s defence rights, it appears that at that stage of the proceedings it was already too late to remedy the investigating authorities\u2019 failure to give the applicant an opportunity to put questions to the presumed victim, which would have been possible at an earlier stage of the proceedings.

The same applies to the experts\u2019 opinion that after the passage of some time young children were unable to distinguish whether they remembered real facts or something heard from others \u2013 this problem, too, could have been avoided by allowing the defence to put questions to the victim at an earlier stage of the proceedings.

Furthermore, playing the video recording of the victim\u2019s statements at the court hearing allowed the trial court as well as the applicant to observe the manner in which the interview had been conducted, to assess V.\u2019s demeanour, and also to assess, at least to a certain degree, the credibility of his account. However, having regard to the importance of V.\u2019s testimony, the Court considers that the above was insufficient to secure the applicant\u2019s rights of defence (compare, for example, A.S. v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66; A.L. v. Finland, no.\u00a023220/04, \u00a7 41, 27 January 2009; and F. and M. v. , no.\u00a022508/02, \u00a7 60, 17 July 2007). It remains a fact that the applicant was never given an opportunity to have questions put to the victim (compare and contrast, for example, Gani, cited above, \u00a7 44; B. v. Finland, no. 17122/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04445, 24 April 2007; and S.N. v. Sweden, cited above, \u00a7\u00a045, where the defence either did not avail itself of the opportunity to have questions put to the witnesses or consented not to be present at the interview conducted during the pre-trial investigation). The Court notes that there was no strong corroborative evidence supporting V.\u2019s statements in the present case (compare Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 165). It also considers that weighing, on the one hand, the applicant\u2019s defence rights \u2013 regard also being had to the substantial prison sentence he faced \u2013 and, on the other hand, the limited impact there would have been on V. if the applicant\u2019s questions had been put to him in addition to the questions that the investigator had put to him anyway during the preliminary investigation, the Court is unable to see that if the investigating authorities had paid due attention to the applicant\u2019s defence rights there would have been any significant additional damage to the child. The Court once more emphasises in this context that the above is not to be understood as meaning that the authorities were obliged to carry out a confrontation between the applicant and V. or to ensure V.\u2019s cross-examination at a court hearing. Rather, what is at issue in a case like the present one is whether it was possible to put questions to the witness, for example through the defendant\u2019s lawyer, police investigator or psychologist, in an environment under the control of the investigating authorities and in a manner that would not need to substantially differ from the interview which was in any event carried out by those authorities (see also Vronchenko, cited above, \u00a7 65).",

This video recording was shown during the hearings before the Tartu County Court, which enabled the court to obtain a clear impression of V.\u2019s evidence and the defence to bring up any issues regarding the credibility of his statement. The court also used in evidence the statements of V.\u2019s mother and brother, whom he had told what had happened. Equally important was the statement of K., who had been present that evening and had been involved in the events. K. was also interviewed on the same day by the police. In stating that the boys had stayed overnight at the applicant\u2019s home, \u201cbut [that] he had no recollection of what had happened that night as he had been drunk and had fallen asleep\u201d, K. confirmed an essential element of V.\u2019s statement. These witnesses were heard at the trial and the applicant was able to provide his own version of the events. In addition to all these facts, the applicant twice partly admitted his guilt and expressed regret that \u201che [had] sexually abused an 11-year-old boy\u201d. Moreover, during the investigative and pre-trial proceedings, he and his counsel did not ask permission to put questions to the 11-year-old boy.
