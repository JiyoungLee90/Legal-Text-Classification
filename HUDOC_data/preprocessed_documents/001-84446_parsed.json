Secondly, the Government asserted that only seven applicants had asked for their applications to be restored to the list and that the Court's decision to restore all the applications had thus been groundless and arbitrary. Finally, the Government claimed that the applicants were \u201cgenerally satisfied\u201d with the acknowledgment of the violation by the Russian authorities and that their only aim in the Strasbourg proceedings was to obtain a larger compensation which ran contrary to the interests of justice. The Government insisted that the case should be struck out of the list in accordance with Article 37 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Convention on account of the loss of the \u201cvictim\u201d status by the applicants.",

Thus, the Government had been afforded an ample opportunity to comment on the issue whether they considered the restoration justified. Their objections to the decision to restore the application raised at the present stage of the proceedings, after the application had been already restored to the list and declared admissible, are obviously belated.",

Neither the Convention nor the Rules of Court establish that the party's request to that effect is a condition precedent for taking such a decision. The Government's objection that not every applicant filed a request for restoration of the application, is therefore without merit. As regards the Government's disagreement with the Court's appreciation of the circumstances of the present case as \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, the Court considers that the factual and legal grounds for its findings are set out in sufficient detail in its decision of 23\u00a0March 2006 and sees nothing in the Government's submissions of the nature to warrant a new consideration of the matter.",

Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2000-V).

Although the Government acknowledged that the prolonged non-enforcement had led to a violation of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the applicants have not been afforded sufficient redress for that violation. In fact, it was the Government's failure to pay compensation for non-pecuniary damage sustained through the prolonged non-enforcement that prompted the Court to restore the application to its list of cases (see the decision of 23\u00a0March 2006). As one of the conditions which may have led to the loss of the \u201cvictim\u201d status has not been fulfilled, the Court finds that the applicants may still claim to be \u201cvictims\u201d of the alleged violations and rejects the Government's request to strike the case out of its list of cases.",

Slovakia, judgment of 2\u00a0September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI, \u00a7 75). The Court further notes that the applicants submitted receipts showing the amount of postal and other expenses. Regard being had to the information in its possession, the Court considers it reasonable to award EUR 120 to the applicant Mr Kosygin, EUR 60 to the applicant Mr\u00a0Mandrykin, and EUR 25 to each of the applicants Mr Gladkov, Mr\u00a0Olishchuk, Mr Frolov, Mr Paramonov, Mr Pakhomov, and Mr Suyev, in respect of costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable on these amounts.",
