Mr.\u00a0Askarov has alleged that he was beaten severely by police on numerous occasions immediately following his detention and throughout the course of the criminal proceedings against him, and that he was subjected to repeated violations of procedural safeguards such as prompt access to a lawyer and to an effective, independent medical examination. The Committee notes that independent forensic medical examinations appear to have substantiated Mr.\u00a0Askarov\u2019s allegations of torture in police custody, and have confirmed resulting injuries including persistent visual loss, traumatic brain injury, and spinal injury. Information before the Committee suggests that Mr.\u00a0Askarov\u2019s complaints of torture have been raised on numerous occasions with the Prosecutor\u2019s office, as well as with the Kyrgyz Ombudsman\u2019s office, and with Bazar-Korgon District Court, the Appeal Court and the Supreme Court. To date, however, the State party\u2019s authorities have declined to open a full investigation into his claims, relying on allegedly coerced statements made by Mr.\u00a0Askarov while in police custody that he had no complaints. The Committee understands that the State party is presently considering the possibility of further investigating these claims. The Committee is concerned by the State party\u2019s refusal to undertake full investigations into allegations of torture regarding other cases raised during the review, including those of Nargiza Turdieva and Dilmurat Khaidarov (arts.\u00a02, 12, 13 and 16).",

The Committee is concerned by reports that investigations, prosecutions, condemnations and sanctions imposed in relation to the June 2010 events were mostly directed against persons of Uzbek origin, as noted by sources including the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in 2013 (CERD/C/KGZ/CO/5-7, paras.\u00a06\u20137).

The Committee is further concerned at reports that judges have frequently declined to act on allegations made by criminal defendants in court, or to allow the introduction into evidence of independent medical reports that would tend to confirm the defendant\u2019s claims of torture for the purpose of obtaining a confession. The Committee regrets the lack of information provided by the State party on cases in which judges or prosecutors have initiated investigations into torture claims raised by criminal defendants in court, and is alarmed that no official has been prosecuted and punished for torture even in the single case brought to its attention in which a conviction obtained by torture was excluded from evidence by a court \u2013 that of Farrukh Gapiurov, who was acquitted by the Osh Municipal Court of involvement in the June 2010 violence (arts.\u00a02 and 15).\u201d",

In a previous case concerning extradition to Kyrgyzstan it found that in 2012 the situation in the south of the country was characterised by torture and other illtreatment of ethnic Uzbeks by law-enforcement officers. This had increased in the aftermath of the events of June 2010 and remained widespread and rampant, aggravated by the impunity of law-enforcement officers. Moreover, the Court established that the issue ought to be seen in the context of the rise of ethnonationalism in the politics of Kyrgyzstan, particularly in the south, the growing inter-ethnic tensions between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks, the continuation of discriminatory practices faced by Uzbeks at institutional level, and underrepresentation of Uzbeks in, amongst others, law-enforcement bodies and the judiciary (see Makhmudzhan Ergashev, cited above, \u00a7 72). As is clear from the reports by UN bodies and reputable NGOs (see paragraphs 37-42 above), the situation in the south of Kyrgyzstan did not improve in 2012-13. In particular, various reports state that a great number of persons, particularly Uzbeks, have been subjected to arbitrary arrests and detention, torture and other forms of ill-treatment on the basis of their ethnicity. Abuses in the south of Kyrgyzstan, particularly against ethnic Uzbeks, have not been adequately addressed. There is a growing problem of lawenforcement officers extorting money, in particular from ethnic Uzbeks, by threatening criminal prosecution. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the current overall human-rights situation in Kyrgyzstan remains highly problematic.",

Even though the majority of the reported instances of ill-treatment involve those charged with crimes related to the June 2010 violence, the Court has already observed in a previous case concerning the extradition of an ethnic Uzbek to Kyrgyzstan that the practice of torture and other illtreatment in the requesting country could be described as routine in cases involving ethnic Uzbek suspects detained on charges unrelated to the June 2010 violence (see Makhmudzhan Ergashev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a073). Accordingly, the Court is satisfied that even though the applicant has been charged with a crime not related to the June 2010 events, he belongs to a particularly vulnerable group, the members of which are routinely subjected to treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention in the requesting country. The Court is mindful of the fact that the applicant\u2019s extradition request was connected with the charge of murder of an ethnic Kyrgyz.",

In the domestic proceedings in which the applicant challenged the decision to extradite him, he argued that as an ethnic Uzbek he would face a serious risk of ill-treatment should extradition be ordered. On the one hand, he referred to the general situation in the south of Kyrgyzstan characterised by the continuing practice of persecution of and discrimination against the ethnic Uzbek community. On the other hand, he stressed that in his particular case there existed specific grounds to believe that his individual prosecution was arbitrary and he therefore ran a real risk of ill-treatment. He referred to the fact that the Kyrgyz authorities had already established that the murder of Mr\u00a0M. had been committed by Mr\u00a0U. alone, who had already been found guilty of it by the final judgment of a domestic court. Moreover, law-enforcement officers had attempted to extort money from the applicant\u2019s mother in exchange for dropping the criminal charges against him (see paragraphs 11 and 25 above). The judgment of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Chechnya of 12\u00a0November 2012 had no regard to the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning the risk of his ill-treatment in Kyrgyzstan. It relied on the assurances given by the Kyrgyz Republic Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, stating that the court \u201cha[d] no reason to doubt [them]\u201d. It also referred to the decision of the Federal Migration Service to reject the applicant\u2019s request for refugee status and its finding that he would not be persecuted on political grounds (see paragraph 26 above). The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation essentially repeated the lower court\u2019s reasoning. It did not address the applicant\u2019s statements or assess the risk of his ill-treatment on the basis of reports by reputable sources. It thereby abstained from compensating for the lower court\u2019s failure to make such an assessment (see paragraph\u00a028 above).",

While those assurances appear to be formally binding on the local authorities, the Court has serious doubts, in view of the poor human-rights record of the south of the country, whether the local authorities there can be expected to abide by them in practice (see Makhmudzhan Ergashev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-46; paragraphs 37-42 above). Furthermore, the Court notes that the Government\u2019s reference to an additional assurance to provide Russian diplomatic staff with access to the place of the applicant\u2019s detention has not been supported by any evidence (see paragraph\u00a045 above). Moreover, it has not been demonstrated before the Court that Kyrgyzstan\u2019s commitment to guaranteeing access to the applicant by Russian diplomatic staff would lead to effective protection against proscribed ill-treatment in practical terms, as it has not been shown that the aforementioned staff would be in possession of the expertise required for effective follow-up of the Kyrgyz authorities\u2019 compliance with their undertakings. Nor was there any guarantee that they would be able to speak to the applicant without witnesses. In addition, their potential involvement was not supported by any practical mechanism setting out, for instance, a procedure by which the applicant could lodge complaints with them or for their unfettered access to detention facilities (see, mutatis mutandis, Nizomkhon Dzhurayev v. Russia, no. 31890/11, \u00a7\u00a7 132-33, 3\u00a0October 2013).",
