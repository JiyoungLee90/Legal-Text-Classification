In these circumstances, and bearing also in mind that it has been stagnant since 2001, the criminal investigation in question can hardly be considered to have been capable of offering the applicant redress in relation to his particular complaints brought before the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Seyfettin Acar and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 30742/03, \u00a7 24, 6 October 2009), which must have also become apparent to the applicant long before he lodged his application with the Court on 23 March 2010 (see, mutatis mutandis, Dursun v.

It therefore had the potential to offer the applicant adequate redress in relation to his specific complaints, which the applicant does not contest. The Court, however, observes that the Van Administrative Court was precluded from examining the merits of the applicant\u2019s case owing to his failure to comply with the domestic procedural rules on two separate occasions.
