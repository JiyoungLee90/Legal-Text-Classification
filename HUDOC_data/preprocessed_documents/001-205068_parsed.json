The purpose of the police operation in the morning of 1 March 2008 had been to verify the information obtained on the previous day by the Armenian Police and National Security Service, according to which a large number of weapons, including metal rods, wooden clubs, firearms, grenades and explosives, were to be distributed to the demonstrators at Freedom Square in order to incite provocative actions and mass disorder in Yerevan on 1 March 2008.

The applicant alleged that he had arrived in that area at around 12 noon when a major concentration of people was already present, including police forces. He, like many other MPs, had gone there in order to be by his electorate\u2019s side and had addressed the crowd through a loudspeaker, calling for calm and restraint, as well as vigilance in order to avoid provoking the police troops which had by then encircled the demonstrators. Tensions had continued to rise and a number of incidents had added fuel to an already tense situation which, later that day, involved clashes between the protesters and the law enforcement officers on a number of central Yerevan streets, including Leo and Paronyan Streets and Mashtots Avenue, with police forces regularly launching attacks on the positions of the protesters who had built barricades and had used stones, Molotov cocktails and other improvised objects to defend themselves. The main demonstration at the Myasnikyan monument, however, was about a kilometre away from that area and had remained peaceful throughout the night, with about five thousand people present. The clashes had continued until the early morning of 2 March 2008, resulting in ten casualties, including eight civilians, numerous injured and a declaration of a state of emergency by the outgoing President\u00a0Kocharyan.",

As a result, the crowd had armed themselves with improvised weapons, as well as explosives, firearms and Molotov cocktails which had been brought to that area in advance. New protesters had been recruited and weapons had been distributed among the most aggressive protesters. Thus, in the period from 1 to 2 March 2008 mass disorder had taken place in the area near the Myasnikyan monument and the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office, as well as Grigor Lusavorich, Mashtots, Leo and Paronyan Streets, involving firearms and explosives, as well as armed resistance to police officers, and resulting in almost 200 police officers and around 30 civilians being injured, private businesses, public property and numerous vehicles being damaged and ten persons being killed. It had been possible to quell the mass disorder only through declaring a state of emergency and the preventive actions of the law enforcement bodies.",

It was stated that the applicant and several other opposition leaders, having realised that they were not able come to power through lawful means, had conspired to usurp State power and, according to the roles assigned among themselves, each had organised and taken premeditated actions aimed destabilising the internal political situation in the country and violently overthrowing the constitutional order. The applicant and the others, through pressure, promises and, in some cases, remuneration, had recruited a crowd of people and from 20 February 2008 onwards had organised in Yerevan unlawful demonstrations, during which they had made provocative speeches and, by inflaming passions, had pushed the crowd towards violent seizure of State power. With the aim of carrying out mass disorder in Yerevan, they had organised groups of people ready to commit mass violence and had distributed among them firearms, ammunition, explosive substances and devices, and other dangerous objects. The applicant, according to the role assigned to him, had recruited and personally led groups of people from the town of Aparan and nearby villages, organising their transfer to Yerevan and their participation in the unlawful demonstrations. Being a veteran of the Nagorno Karabakh war and using his standing among other veterans, he had incited them to seize violently power and to struggle against the authorities, including, if necessary, by fighting them. For the purpose of instigating mass disorder, on either 26 or 27 February 2008 the applicant, in his car, had transported to Freedom Square metal rods and wooden clubs together with his driver, A.S., who upon the applicant\u2019s orders had hidden them in the tent called \u201cAparan\u201d. When in the morning of 1 March 2008 the police had attempted to carry out at Freedom Square an inspection for weapons, the applicant and the other organisers of mass disorder had ordered a big group of those present at the square to resist the police officers and to assault them. Moreover, the applicant had personally directed the actions of the crowd by inciting them not to retreat and to prevent the police from entering the square. Thereafter, the applicant and his accomplices had directed the demonstrators towards the area of the Myasnikyan monument where they had incited, organised and led the mass disorder by calling on the demonstrators to arm themselves and to disobey and assault the police, recruiting new people and distributing arms, metal rods, wooden clubs, spiky, hedgehog-like objects and Molotov cocktails among the particularly aggressive group of people. The applicant had regularly addressed the crowd, inciting them to topple the government, to arm themselves and to struggle whichever way possible, including by burning public buildings. As a result, mass disorder had taken place in the area of the Myasnikyan monument, the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office and a number of adjacent streets, during which numerous police officers had been injured, ten persons had been killed and pecuniary damage of various scale had been caused to the police, the city of Yerevan and private businesses, and which had stopped only after the declaration of a state of emergency and its prevention by the actions of the police.",

He referred to the five sets of court proceedings, between 5 March and 29\u00a0October 2008, whereby his pre-trial detention had been authorised and extended, and submitted that, as of 29 October 2008, no concrete facts or evidence had been produced by the authorities, either at the domestic level or before the Court, substantiating the suspicions against him. The charges against him had been a mere formality based solely on assumptions and had been brought against him only because he was an active member of the opposition. Thus, his deprivation of liberty had been a concealed attempt to limit his freedom of expression and had been effected in bad faith. While being accused of making violent speeches during the assembly near the Myasnikyan monument, none of the materials of the criminal case had cited his speeches. The courts repeatedly used such vague expressions as \u201cthe presented materials\u201d or \u201ccertain evidence\u201d as grounds justifying the existence of a reasonable suspicion, without ever specifying the materials or evidence in question. The applicant admitted that he had made speeches at the assembly but denied any incitement to public disorder or disobedience to the authorities. He submitted that, if he had indeed made such speeches, the audio and video recordings would undoubtedly have been included in the case file since the events of 1 March 2008, especially those around the Myasnikyan monument, had been continually recorded by the authorities. The fact that his deprivation of liberty had not been based on a reasonable suspicion was also supported by the findings reached as a result of the trial monitoring project conducted in the aftermath of the events of 1-2 March 2008 by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which were based also on the monitoring of his trial. The failure of the courts to provide any grounds for a reasonable suspicion had been also incompatible with the relevant case-law of the Court of Cassation.",

The Court notes that the applicant was an opposition politician and member of parliament who took part in the rallies which gripped the Armenian capital following the allegedly unfair presidential election of 19 February 2008 and culminated in the events of 1\u00a0and 2 March 2008. The response of the authorities that followed, including the arrests and detention of scores of opposition leaders and supporters, was condemned by the PACE as a \u201cde facto crackdown on the opposition\u201d, while the charges brought against many of them, especially those under Articles 225 and 300 of the CC, were suspected to have been \u201cartificial and politically motivated\u201d. Repeated concerns were expressed by both the PACE and the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights about the nature of the charges under those Articles, as well as Article 316 of the CC, mentioning the applicant\u2019s specific case on several occasions (see paragraphs 50-55 above). While the Court is not called upon to give a judicial assessment of the general context, it nevertheless considers that this background information is extremely relevant to the present case and calls for particularly close scrutiny of the facts giving rise to the charges brought against the applicant.",

The Court itself has previously concluded that there was no convincing evidence to suggest that there had been a build-up of arms at Freedom Square for the purpose of instigating mass disorder (see Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 230 and 245). It has rejected the allegations that the police were deployed at Freedom Square in order to carry out an inspection for weapons and that armed demonstrators were first to attack, and has found that the main, if not only, purpose of the police operation in the early morning of 1 March 2008 was to disperse the assembly at Freedom Square and that any clashes that happened there must likely have been caused by the measures taken by the police to end the assembly, including the alleged excessive use of force, as opposed to being premeditated acts (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 232, 245 and 247). There are a number of credible reports which suggest that the gathering of people in the area of the Myasnikyan monument, including their later being armed, were spontaneous and unorganised developments and that the escalation of violence later that day may have similarly been a response to the earlier dispersal of demonstrators from Freedom Square, including its heavyhanded nature, as well as a number of other similar or uncontrollable events which had happened later that day (see paragraphs 49-57 above). The Court notes that the Government have failed to produce any evidence in the present case which would prompt it to doubt the above reports or the findings reached in the Mushegh Saghatelyan case.",

In this respect, having regard to the above analysis, the Court finds that the material put before it does not meet the minimum standard set by Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (c) of the Convention for the reasonableness of a suspicion required for an individual\u2019s arrest and continued detention. Accordingly, during the period the Court is considering in the present case, the applicant was deprived of his liberty in the absence of a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of his having committed a criminal offence.",

Such an approach is understandable from the viewpoint of the economy of the judgment and may contribute to a greater focus on the main issues and thus to the clarity of the judgment. In my view, however, this formula should only be used in the above circumstances \u2013 peripheral or secondary complaints or complaints which are absorbed by the main complaint \u2013 as it is otherwise in danger of being perceived by the applicant as a sort of partial \u201cdenial of justice\u201d.
