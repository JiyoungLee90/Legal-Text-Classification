In her statement to representatives of the SRJI the first applicant had submitted that the abductors had worn camouflage uniforms and masks and had been armed with sub-machine guns. However, according to the third applicant, the first applicant had come outside already after Mayrudin Khantiyev had been put into the NIVA vehicle and the abductors had left, taking him away. Hence, she could not have seen them. In fact, only the third applicant had witnessed the abduction. Other persons, including the first applicant, had gone outside later and had only seen the NIVA vehicle driving off and the first and third applicants running after it. In any event, the fact that Mayrudin Khantiyev's abductors were wearing camouflage uniforms and masks and were armed was not sufficient to conclude that they were State agents. The Government further stressed that members of illegal armed groups had often passed themselves off as servicemen or members of law-enforcement bodies by wearing camouflage uniforms, carrying arms and passing unimpeded through federal forces checkpoints.",

It is likewise undisputed that there were two permanent watch posts of servicemen of the district military commander's office on the roof of the applicants' house and that their task was to secure compliance with the curfew by surveying the adjacent premises and all moving objects, including vehicles and persons, and to provide fire support to the adjacent checkpoints in case of need (see paragraph 62 above). Besides the checkpoint of the district military commander's office there were at least two further checkpoints of the Russian military forces in the vicinity of the applicants' house, one of them being located about 500\u00a0metres away and the other \u2013 at about 1.5 km away (ibid.).

At the same time the Court cannot overlook that in their complaints to the domestic authorities and written statements the applicants, as well as some of the witnesses to whom they referred, consistently submitted that Mayrudin Khantiyev had been abducted during the curfew (see paragraphs 9, 18 and 22 above). Be that as it may, and even assuming that the abductors were not State agents, as suggested by the Government, and that they had started forcing the third applicant's entrance door at about 6.15 a.m. at the latest, it would mean that their group consisting of several armed men in camouflage uniforms moving in a vehicle without registration plates must have been able to arrive at the applicants' house despite the curfew, past the checkpoints located in the area and notwithstanding the presence on the roof of the applicants' house of soldiers from the military commander's office stationed there with the specific aim of observing the adjacent premises - a fact which the Court finds hard to accept in the absence of any convincing explanation on the part of the Government.",

In this connection the Court finds it particularly striking that the investigating authorities had not taken any steps to identify the servicemen referred to by Mr Z., notwithstanding Mr\u00a0K.'s statement that the names of the servicemen on duty on 4 December 2000 could have been easily obtained from the relevant duty log and Mr P.'s submission that servicemen from the second watch post would have noticed the Niva vehicle (see paragraphs 62 and 65 above).

Thus, although they had the necessary communication equipment (see paragraph 64 above), it transpires that they made no attempts whatsoever to alert the adjacent checkpoints to be on the lookout for the Niva vehicle (compare Osmano\u011flu v. Turkey, no.\u00a048804/99, \u00a7 80, 24 January 2008). Neither did they come downstairs to verify what had occurred. The Court considers that this blatant passivity of State agents in the face of an abduction of a person in their full view is yet another element which weighs heavily against the Government's submission that State agents were not implicated in Mayrudin Khantiyev's disappearance.",

While the town prosecutor's office received the file on 17 December 2000, it took it further ten days to institute the investigation.

Most notably, the Court has no information to indicate that any efforts were made to identify and question the servicemen from the roof unit on duty on 4 December 2000, other than Mr P. and  As the Court has emphasised above, this omission is particularly striking in view of the evident contradictions between Mr P.'s and Mr\u00a0U.'s statements and the fact that their fellow servicemen names could have been easily obtained from the relevant duty logs (see paragraph\u00a062 above). In those circumstances it appears even more striking to the Court that the investigators made no attempt to question Mr Dug., another servicemen from the roof unit, whose name Mr P. explicitly mentioned while being questioned by investigators (see paragraph 65 above). It likewise does not transpire from the Government's submissions that the investigators made any attempts to question the residents of house no.\u00a0269, except for Ms V. There is no indication that Mr S., the former head of the ROVD who might have had information of relevance to the investigation, was questioned. In the Court's opinion, the above-mentioned omissions seriously undermined the ability of the investigation to establish the circumstances of the abduction of the applicant's relative and to identify those responsible for it.",

However, it did not lead to the resumption of the investigation and, in any event, the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in its early stages by the authorities' failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures. In this connection the Court specifically emphasises that the first decision to suspend the investigation, issued in January 2001 and referring to the impossibility of identifying the perpetrators, was taken less than a month after the investigation had been launched. It transpires that by the time of that first suspension no measures other than the crime scene inspection had been taken (see paragraph 36 above).",

The third and first applicants were witnesses to the abduction of their close relative. The first to third applicants were involved in the search for Mayrudin Khantiyev. The Court considers that although the fourth applicant could not have been expected to communicate with the authorities owing to his young age, he was also adversely affected by the fact of his father's disappearance. The applicants have had no news of Mayrudin Khantiyev for over seven years. Throughout this period they applied to various bodies with enquiries about his fate. Despite those attempts, the applicants have never received any plausible explanation as to what became of him following his abduction. The Court's findings under the procedural aspect of Article 2 are also of direct relevance here.",

Having regard to its conclusions above, it finds that there is a direct causal link between the violation of Article 2 in respect of the applicants' relative and the loss to them of the financial support which he could have provided. The Court notes however that the certificate furnished by the applicants concerned Mayrudin Khantiyev's employment in June and July 2000 and that they did not furnish any other documents to certify that he had been employed after that latter date. Nonetheless, the Court finds that it is reasonable to assume that Mayrudin Khantiyev eventually would have had some earnings from which the applicants would have benefited (ibid.). Having regard to the applicants' submissions and the fact that Mayrudin Khantiyev was unemployed at the time of his abduction, the Court finds it appropriate to award the applicants jointly EUR 2,000 in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
