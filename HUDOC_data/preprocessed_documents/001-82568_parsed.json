As regards the non-pecuniary damage, the Government considered that the applicant's claim was excessive and unreasonable. They believed that the amount of the compensation should be similar to the ones awarded in the cases of Shvedov v. Russia (no. 69306/01, 20 October 2005) and Wasserman v. Russia (no. 15021/02, 18 November 2004).",

It accepts the Government's arguments in this respect and rejects this claim. On the other hand, the Court considers that the applicant must have suffered certain distress and frustration resulting from the State's authorities' failure to enforce the judgment in his favour. However, the amount claimed appears excessive. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 900 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
