This conclusion is inferred from constitutional texts, codes of civil procedure and domestic case-law. In the majority of States (Albania, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, San\u00a0Marino, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) legislation suggests that Article 6 procedural safeguards (particularly the impartiality requirement) apply to interim and injunction proceedings either because the legislation makes no distinction as to the stage or type of proceedings to which the safeguards apply (such as the Constitutions of Greece, Italy, Spain and Switzerland), or because specific provisions governing interim measures reflect in some way the main safeguards embedded in Article 6 \u2013 as, for example, legislation which specifies that provisions governing proceedings on the merits apply mutatis mutandis to injunction proceedings (such as Poland), or will do so, unless otherwise stipulated (such as Germany). The Belgian courts have explicitly dealt with the issue (see the judgments of the Court of Cassation in the cases of Greenpeace Belgium and Global Action in the Interest of Animals, of 14\u00a0January 2005) and held that Article 6 of the Convention was in principle applicable to interim proceedings (r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9).",

Both the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal had examined the merits of Mrs M.\u2019s complaint and therefore determined the dispute over \u201cthe right to be heard\u201d in the injunction proceedings. Thus, the applicant could claim on at least arguable grounds that the proceedings were covered by Article 6. Moreover, when the applicant eventually complained of the unfairness of these \u201cpost-injunction proceedings\u201d, the constitutional jurisdiction looked at the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint regarding the impartiality of the Court of Appeal and, consequently, recognised the applicability of Article 6 to these proceedings. The Chamber noted that according to the Court\u2019s judgment in Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2007-II) independently of the Court\u2019s autonomous application of Article 6, its applicability would be recognised by the Court, if the domestic system had recognised it formerly: \u201cif a domestic system bars access to a court, the Court will verify that the dispute is indeed such as to justify the application of the exception to the guarantees of Article 6. If it does not, then there is no issue and Article 6 \u00a7 1 will apply.\u201d Furthermore, the concept of a \u201ccivil right\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1 could not be construed as limiting an enforceable right in domestic law within the meaning of Article 53 of the Convention (see Okyay and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a036220/97, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2005VII). It followed that Article 6 was applicable to the present case.",

France (dec.), no.\u00a043722/98, 15 March 2001; APIS a.s. v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 39754/98, 13\u00a0January 2000; Verlagsgruppe News GmbH v.

It follows that in length-of-proceedings cases, the Court has applied Article 6 only from the initiation of the case on the merits and not from the preliminary request for such measures (see Jaffredou v. France (dec.), no. 39843/98, 15 December 1998, and Kress v. France [GC], no.\u00a039594/98, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2001VI). Nevertheless, in certain cases, the Court has applied Article 6 to interim proceedings, notably by reason of their being decisive for the civil rights of the applicant (see Aerts v. Belgium, 30 July 1998, Reports 1998V, and Boca v. Belgium, no.\u00a050615/99, ECHR 2002IX). Moreover, it has held that an exception is to be made to the principle that Article 6 will not apply when the character of the interim decision exceptionally requires otherwise because the measure requested was drastic, disposed of the main action to a considerable degree, and unless reversed on appeal would have affected the legal rights of the parties for a substantial period of time (see Markass Car Hire Ltd v. Cyprus (dec.), no. 51591/99, 23 October 2001).",

A request for an injunction was granted as a preliminary measure which was followed by the main action on the merits of the case. Meanwhile, another set of proceedings was instituted to contest the fairness of the injunction granted. The Grand Chamber, like the Government, views the latter as analogous to what in other jurisdictions would classify as an appeal against the injunction. It has not been contested that at the time of the present case, the Maltese legal system did not allow for an appeal against such an injunction. It was however possible for injunctions to be impugned in a \u201cfresh\u201d set of proceedings which allowed for two levels of jurisdiction, namely, the Civil Court (First Hall) in its ordinary jurisdiction and the Court of Appeal. Thus, the injunction proceedings and the consequent challenge to their fairness cannot be seen as distinct from each other. They were one set of proceedings connected to the merits of the cause that fell to be determined in the main action. The fact that they involved three levels of jurisdiction does not mean that they should be regarded as anything other than traditional injunction proceedings. Accordingly, the Grand Chamber will decide on the applicability of Article 6 to the present case on this basis.",

Austria, 24 February 1993, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 28 and 30, Series A no. 255-A, and Wettstein v. Switzerland, no. 33958/96, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2000-XII).",

[GC], no.\u00a073797/01, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2005XIII). The Court has held that the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see Wettstein, cited above, \u00a7 43). As regards the type of proof required, the Court has, for example, sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or ill will for personal reasons (see De Cubber v. Belgium, 26 October 1984, \u00a7 25, Series A no. 86).",

Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports 1996-III).",

What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public.

Belgium, 1 October 1982, \u00a7 30 (d), Series A no. 53). The existence of national procedures for ensuring impartiality, namely rules regulating the withdrawal of judges, is a relevant factor. Such rules manifest the national legislature\u2019s concern to remove all reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the judge or court concerned and constitute an attempt to ensure impartiality by eliminating the causes of such concerns. In addition to ensuring the absence of actual bias, they are directed at removing any appearance of partiality and so serve to promote the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public (see Me\u017enari\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 27). The Court will take such rules into account when making its own assessment as to whether a tribunal was impartial and, in particular, whether the applicant\u2019s fears can be held to be objectively justified (see, mutatis mutandis, Pescador Valero v. Spain, no.\u00a062435/00, \u00a7\u00a7 24-29, ECHR 2003-VII).",

Firstly, there was no automatic obligation for a judge to withdraw in cases where impartiality could be an issue, a matter which remains unchanged in the law in force at present. Secondly, at the time of the present case the law did not recognise as problematic \u2013 and therefore as a ground for challenge \u2013 a sibling relationship between judge and advocate, let alone that arising from relationships of a lesser degree such as those of uncles or aunts in respect of nephews or nieces.

Consequently, in the present case, Mrs M. was faced with a panel of three judges, one of whom was the uncle of the opposing party\u2019s advocate and the brother of the advocate acting for the opposing party during the first-instance proceedings whose conduct was at issue in the appeal. The Grand Chamber is of the view that the close family ties between the opposing party\u2019s advocate and the Chief Justice sufficed to objectively justify fears that the presiding judge lacked impartiality. It cannot be overlooked that  is a small country and that entire families practising law are a common phenomenon. Indeed, the Government have also acknowledged that this had become a recurring issue which necessitated action resulting in an amendment to the relevant law, which now includes sibling relationships as a ground for withdrawal (see paragraph 29 above).",

Admittedly, Protocol No. 14 (which has been signed and ratified by ) has not yet come into force. However, without waiting for the amendment to Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention that will be made once this Protocol does come into force, it is surprising that the Court \u2013 overburdened as it is with applications \u2013 did not consider this application to be inadmissible, particularly as an \u201cabuse of the right of application\u201d within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 in fine of the current text. It will suffice to recall how the case originated: it started in 1985 with an injunction being taken out to restrain Mrs M. from hanging her washing out to dry over her neighbour\u2019s yard. The Civil Court subsequently made two orders, followed by a judgment; after that, the Court of Appeal gave a judgment, and then Mrs M. lodged a constitutional appeal which her brother \u2013 the applicant \u2013 took up nine years after it had been lodged, following his sister\u2019s death. The Civil Court and the Constitutional Court ruled two and three years later respectively, and, lastly, a Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights, by a majority of four votes to three, declared the application admissible and found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The disproportion between the triviality of the facts and the extensive use \u2013 or rather over-use \u2013 of court proceedings is an affront to good sense, especially as serious human rights violations subsist in a number of States Parties. Is it really the role of our Court to determine cases such as this?",

In substance, we find that the Grand Chamber stretches the notion of a dispute over civil rights and obligations to an almost unlimited degree and places undue weight on the decision in Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, ECHR 2007-II), which was confined to extending the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to disputes involving civil servants, thus reversing the decision in Pellegrin v. France (([GC], no.\u00a028541/95, ECHR 1999-VIII \u2013 see paragraph 61 of the judgment in Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited in point 11 of the above-mentioned dissenting opinion of Judge Bratza).",

In the present Micallef case the Civil Court gave a judgment on the merits (and not in interlocutory proceedings) on 6 March 1992. In that judgment the court recognised the merits of the complaints made by the neighbour, Mr F., and awarded costs against Mrs M. The latter never appealed against that judgment, which accordingly became final. Article 6 \u00a7 1 could have been found to be applicable to those proceedings, but by preferring to continue the proceedings relating to the interlocutory application, Mrs M., and subsequently the applicant \u2013 her brother \u2013 chose to pursue proceedings which, in our view, did not concern a dispute over civil rights or obligations and, in any event, did not settle it. As our colleague, Judge Bratza, explained, proceedings relating to interim orders should only very exceptionally attract the protection of Article 6 \u00a7 1 because this provision requires the court to determine civil rights (d\u00e9cide d\u2019une contestation in French). This was not the case here. This argument supplements and supports those expressed in the excellent dissenting opinion annexed to the Chamber judgment.",
