Mr A. added that the applicant had not refunded them the money which they had paid for the cars.

In reply to the Court's questions concerning the existence of effective domestic remedies in respect of his complaints under Article 3 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Government submitted, in their post-admissibility memorial, that the applicant had been declared a victim in criminal cases nos. 12088 and 61857 opened into his allegations of ill-treatment and the alleged theft and destruction of his property and that his procedural rights had been explained to him. According to the Government, the applicant, by virtue of his victim status, could have actively participated in the investigation and rendered significant assistance to the investigating authorities by filing applications and submitting evidence, thus contributing to the establishment of the facts of the offence and the identity of those responsible. The Government also stated that, under Article 125 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicant was free to appeal in court against any decision, action or omission of the investigating authorities which he considered detrimental to his procedural rights. In support of their argument, they referred to court decisions delivered in three sets of proceedings unrelated to the present case, namely, to a decision of the Urus-Martan Town Court dated 6 August 2004 which had ordered the Urus-Martan prosecutor's office to resume the investigation into the disappearance of a claimant's son, a decision of the Shali Town Court dated 13 March 2006 and a decision of the Urus-Martan City Court dated 1 August 2005 by which the claimants had been allowed access to criminal investigation files.",

Furthermore, medical documents issued in the period after the applicant's release attested to his various bodily injuries and indicated, in particular, that the applicant's left ear was missing (see paragraphs 60, 155 and 156 above).

The investigating authorities' flagrant failure for years to take any practical measures aimed at investigating any further the possible involvement of those officers in the offences against the applicant, and, more specifically, to search for additional evidence of those officers' involvement in the offences, to organise confrontations with the participation of those officers, the applicant and Mr K., to provide a legal definition of those officers' actions and to take relevant procedural decisions in their regard, including bringing charges against them, applying a preventive measure to them, and preparing a bill of indictment, is attested by decisions of supervising prosecutors who on numerous occasions set aside decisions to suspend the investigation as unlawful and premature and indicated that the relevant orders had not been complied with (see paragraphs 131, 133, 134, 136, 140 and 142 above).

Moreover, it does not appear that any meaningful efforts were made to take investigative measures in respect of Mr N. and Mr Ab., who were also identified by the applicant and Mr K. as those involved in the incident involving the applicant's ear. The materials in the Court's possession reveal that the investigating authorities attempted to summon Mr Ab. for questioning but were unsuccessful because he was on his annual leave (see paragraphs 128 and 130 above) and that they attempted, also unsuccessfully, to interview Mr N., who had left during questioning and had not returned (see paragraph 170 above).

Indeed, in the period between 28 May 2007 and 21 February 2009 the investigation was stayed four times pending the search for, among others, Mr B. (see paragraphs 149 and 151 above), whereas, according to the Government, the criminal proceedings against him had already been discontinued on 20\u00a0March 2007, following his application for an amnesty under an Amnesty Act (see paragraph 84 above). Moreover, a decision of 19 January 2009 ordered a further investigation in order to conduct an identification by the applicant of a certain Mr M. and to interview the latter with a view to establishing whether he had inflicted bodily injuries on the applicant, despite the presence in the case file of a decision stating that Mr M. had committed suicide in 2001 and in spite of the fact that on 4 April 2003 the applicant had identified Mr M. from a photograph as an officer who had never inflicted any violence on him (see paragraphs 153 and 161 above).

Therefore, in so far as the Government's argument concerning the possibility for the applicant to appeal to a court against the actions or omission of the investigators, under Article 125 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, is concerned, the Court notes that the Government did not indicate which particular actions or omissions of the investigators the applicant should have challenged before a court. It further observes that the legal instrument referred to by the Government became operative on 1 July 2002 and that the applicant was clearly unable to have recourse to this remedy prior to that date. As regards the period thereafter, the Court considers that in a situation where the effectiveness of the investigation was undermined from a very early stage by the authorities' failure to take the necessary investigative measures, where the investigation was repeatedly suspended and reopened, where the applicant had no full access to the case file and was only informed of the conduct of the investigation occasionally, it is highly doubtful that the remedy invoked by the Government would have had any prospect of success. Moreover, the Government have not demonstrated that this remedy would have been capable of providing redress in the applicant's situation \u2013 in other words, that it would have rectified the shortcomings in the investigation and would have led to the identification and punishment of those responsible. The Court thus considers that in the circumstances of the case it has not been established with sufficient certainty that the remedy advanced by the Government would have been effective within the meaning of the Convention. It finds that the applicant was not obliged to pursue that remedy, and that the Government's preliminary objection should therefore be dismissed.",

The question arises whether, in accordance with Article 34 of the Convention, the applicant can still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d of the alleged violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In this connection, the Court reiterates that an applicant is deprived of his or her status as a victim if the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded appropriate and sufficient redress for, a breach of the Convention (see, for example, Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 178-93, ECHR 2006V). In the present case, even assuming that the payment in question could be regarded as redress for the violation alleged, there is no evidence that the authorities at any point acknowledged that violation, given that, as pointed out by the applicant, under the relevant governmental decree the authorities paid identical amounts to all permanent residents of the Chechen Republic who had lost their homes and property during the hostilities in the region, irrespective of whether State agents had been responsible for the destruction, and without taking into account its value. Moreover, no such acknowledgement was made in the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the theft and destruction of the applicant's possessions (see paragraphs 97 and 100 above) or in the civil proceedings which the applicant brought in an attempt to challenge the amount of extra-judicial compensation (see paragraph 116 above). The Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant retains his victim status, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, in so far as his complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is concerned.",

With this in mind, the Court rejects the Government's argument that the applicant was afforded an opportunity to file a civil claim for compensation, as this latter right was illusory and devoid of substance. As regards the Government's argument that the applicant was paid extrajudicial compensation for his lost property, the Court has noted above that the compensation in question was paid without regard to the particular circumstances in which the property had been lost. Moreover, the value of the lost property was not taken into account either, since the amount paid for any lost possessions other than housing could not exceed RUB 50,000 (approximately EUR 1,300). In such circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that the compensation referred to by the Government can be regarded as an effective remedy for the violation alleged.",

This obligation requires the Contracting States to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court, whether it is conducting a fact-finding investigation or performing its general duties as regards the examination of applications. Failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands, without a satisfactory explanation, may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.

In that report the applicant indicated that the value of the Oldsmobile vehicle was equal to USD 12,000 and the value of the Subaru car to USD 7,500. The Court considers these amounts to be excessive, given that at the time of the theft the cars were eleven years old and that the applicant produced no documents objectively confirming the value of the cars at the material time.
