As to the first argument, the Government stressed that the applicant had not complained to a court or any other State body of ineffective medical assistance. The procedure for making claims before a court was established in Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as clarified by the Supreme Court\u2019s Ruling no. 2 of 10 February 2009. Having relied on two cases examined by the Russian courts and the Court\u2019s findings in the case of Popov and Vorobyev v. Russia (no. 1606/02, 23 April 2009), they submitted that it had also been open to the applicant to lodge a tort action claiming compensation for damage caused by allegedly inadequate medical assistance. Relying on Resolution no. CM/ResDH(2010)35 adopted at the 1078th Meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, the Government further noted that statistics and a number of cases presented to the Committee had demonstrated the developing practice of the Russian courts in awarding compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by unsatisfactory conditions of detention. In the Government\u2019s opinion, the applicant\u2019s failure to apply to a Russian court or any \u201cother instance\u201d with a complaint had to be interpreted by the Court as his unwillingness to comply with the admissibility requirements set out by Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v.\u00a0Belgium, 6\u00a0November 1980, \u00a7\u00a035, Series A no.\u00a040).

Indeed, the special importance attached by the Convention to that provision requires, in the Court\u2019s view, that the States Parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to any such treatment rapidly. Had it been otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would have legitimised particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention (see Vladimir Romanov v.

It follows that a complaint of negligent actions by prison medical personnel would necessarily call into question the way in which the prison management had discharged its duties and complied with domestic legal requirements. Accordingly, the Court does not consider that the prison authorities would have a sufficiently independent standpoint to satisfy the requirements of Article 35 of the Convention (see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 113, Series A no. 61): in deciding on a complaint concerning an inmate\u2019s medical care for which they were responsible, they would in reality be judges in their own cause (see Goginashvili v.

The Court reiterates that the decisive question in assessing the effectiveness of raising a complaint of inhuman and degrading treatment before a prosecutor is whether the applicant could have done so in order to obtain direct and timely redress, and not merely an indirect protection of the rights guaranteed in Article 3 of the Convention. Even though the prosecutors\u2019 review undeniably plays an important part in securing appropriate conditions of detention, including the proper standard of medical care for detainees, a complaint to the supervising prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy because of the procedural shortcomings that have been previously identified in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, for instance, Pavlenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a042371/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088-89, 1 April 2010, and Aleksandr Makarov v. , no. 15217/07, \u00a7\u00a7 85-86, 12 March 2009, with further references).

Croatia, no.\u00a051585/99, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001-VIII, and Gibas v. Poland, no. 24559/94, Commission decision of 6 September 1995, Decisions and Reports 82, pp.\u00a076 and 82). The Court accepts the assertion that detainees may send their complaints to a prosecutor. However, there is no legal requirement on the prosecutor to hear the complainant or ensure his or her effective participation in the ensuing proceedings, which would entirely be a matter between the supervising prosecutor and the supervised body. The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint. The Court reiterates that, in the absence of a specific procedure, the ability to appeal to various authorities cannot be regarded as an effective remedy because such appeals aim to urge the authorities to utilise their discretion and do not give the complainant a personal right to compel the State to exercise its supervisory powers (see Dimitrov v. , no. 47829/99, \u00a7 80, 23 September 2004). Moreover, the Court has already seen cases in which an applicant complained to a prosecutor but his complaint did not elicit any response (see Antropov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a022107/03, \u00a7\u00a055, 29 January 2009).

However, in its assessment of the effectiveness of tort proceedings for cases of inadequate medical care of detainees, the Court considers the following considerations to be more important. To prove the existence of the selection and successful use of mechanisms of redress, the Government cited two cases in which claimants, former inmates, had been granted compensation for damage to health resulting from inadequate medical care in detention. Without embarking on an analysis of the relevance of the cases to the case at hand and deciding whether the two cases sufficiently demonstrate the existence of a developed, consistent and coherent practice of remedies being available for victims of Article 3 violations resulting from a lack of medical assistance or its poor quality, the Court reiterates that to be adequate, remedies for the implementation of accountability of a State should correspond to the kind and nature of the complaints addressed to it. Given the continuous nature of the violation alleged by the applicant, in particular his complaint of suffering from an extremely serious medical condition with a continuous deterioration of his health in the absence of appropriate medical treatment, the Court considers that an adequate remedy in such a situation should imply a properly functioning mechanism of monitoring the conduct of national authorities with a view to putting an end to the alleged violation of the applicant\u2019s rights and preventing the recurrence of such a violation in the future. Therefore, a purely compensatory remedial avenue would not suffice to satisfy the requirements of effectiveness and adequacy in a case of an alleged serious continuous violation of a Conventional right and should be replaced by another judicial mechanism performing both the preventive and compensatory functions.",

Being convinced that a preventive remedial measure would have had an evidently pivotal role in a case such as the applicant\u2019s, with his pleas of ongoing deterioration of his health in view of a lack of proper medical care, the Court finds that a tort claim was not able to provide the applicant with relief appropriate for his situation. The purely monetary compensation afforded by a tort action could not extinguish the consequences created by the alleged continuous situation of inadequate or insufficient medical services. A tort claim would not have entailed the ending or modification of the situation or conditions in which the applicant found himself. It would not have brought about an order to put an end to the alleged violation and to compel the detention authorities to offer the applicant the requisite level of medical care and it would not have provided for any sanction for failure to comply, thus depriving a court examining the tort claim of the opportunity to take practical steps to eliminate the applicant\u2019s further suffering or to deter wrongful behaviour on the part of the authorities. This logic has been applied in a large number of cases raising an arguable claim under Article 3, with the Court insisting that if the authorities could confine their reaction in such cases to the mere payment of compensation, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice. The State cannot escape its responsibility by purporting to erase a wrong by a mere grant of compensation in such cases (see, among many other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Krastanov v.

The Court, for its part, has not noted any examples of the successful use of this remedy in any of the conditions-of-detention or medical-assistance cases that have previously come before it. The absence of established judicial practice in this regard appears all the more clear in the light of the fact that the Code of Civil Procedure, including its Chapter 25, has been in force since 1 February 2003 and that Chapter 25 merely consolidated and reproduced the provisions concerning a substantially similar procedure that had been available under Law no. 4866-1 of 27 April 1993 on Judicial Complaints against Actions and Decisions which have Impaired Citizens\u2019 Rights and Freedoms.

Prior to his arrest the applicant had already survived two myocardial infarctions. In fact, on the day following his arrest he had a severe heart attack calling for the involvement of a medical emergency team. Throughout the years of his detention, the applicant\u2019s condition, not disputed by the Government, was characterised by severe and sharp pain in the chest, extreme headaches, occasional loss of consciousness, pain in the eyes, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, excessive sweating and anxiety. A further deterioration of the applicant\u2019s health occurred in detention, when he suffered his third infarction (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). Given the significant clinical manifestations and progress of his condition, with a high risk of development of further cardiovascular complications, the applicant required regular medical supervision by specialists, in particular a cardiologist, and complex treatment, comprising clinical tests and medication. The evidence provided to the Court by the parties confirms that neither of those requirements was fulfilled during the applicant\u2019s detention. The evidence shows that from the beginning of his detention in 2006 until his release in April 2012 the applicant was not provided with a consultation with a cardiologist.",

It is not convinced that the general physicians, tuberculosis specialist, drug addiction specialist, dermatologist, dentist and ophthalmologist who examined the applicant on various occasions and addressed his complaints related to his cardiovascular conditions could have developed and ensured a comprehensive evaluation and the medical management of the applicant\u2019s serious health problems (see paragraphs 12, 19, 20 and 22 above). The inadequacy of their response to the applicant\u2019s health complaints is demonstrated by the fact that they either maintained the drug therapy which had been developed by a previous specialist, disregarding the complaints from the applicant and the clinical signs of a further deterioration of his condition, or merely increased the dose of the prescribed drugs or introduced another painkiller without carrying out a comprehensive examination of the applicant\u2019s then-current condition. At this juncture the Court would stress that while the Russian authorities undoubtedly took charge of the applicant\u2019s therapeutic care, it is not convinced that they did not render him the individual medical assessment necessary to properly evaluate his specific needs and to adjust his treatment to them, in contrast to what the Court has on many occasions declared as one of the cornerstones of adequate medical care for detainees (see, mutatis mutandis, L.B. v. Belgium, no. 22831/08, \u00a7 97, 2 October 2012).",

The Court also notes that, having opted to treat the applicant in the medical unit of the correctional colony following further acute episodes of illness, the colony administration chose to treat him there in the knowledge that the colony did not employ a cardiologist or a resuscitation specialist and also did not employ a specialist who could understand the results of the applicant\u2019s ECG testing (see paragraph 21 above). Having provided rather symptomatic treatment for his condition to arrest the most acute temporary problems, such as pain or elevated blood pressure, they failed to send the applicant to a cardiologist for an assessment and medical management of his serious condition.",

Without going into the details of the applicant\u2019s financial situation, the Court notes that the Government did not argue that a consultation with a cardiologist was not available free of charge to the general population, that the State was unable to bear the costs of such consultations by an inmate in a situation like the applicant\u2019s, or that it was impossible to organise a cardiologic consultation of the applicant in a civilian hospital, if not on a regular basis, at least on those occasions when his treatment regimen needed to be adjusted.",

Having examined the authorities\u2019 petition for the applicant\u2019s release, the District Court concluded that his condition was particularly serious and that he was not able to receive in detention the medical care he needed (see paragraph 35 above). This supports the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Russian authorities did not comply with their responsibility to ensure the provision of adequate medical treatment to the applicant for more than six years of his detention prior to his release in April 2012.",
