Those reports concerned prisoners detained by the United States authorities outside the national territory, notably in Guant\u00e1namo Bay (Cuba), Bagram (Afghanistan) and some other third countries (see Al-Moayad v. Germany (dec.), no. , \u00a7 66, 20\u00a0February 2007). This material was in the public domain before a person\u2019s actual transfer into the custody of the United States authorities. It was therefore capable of proving that there were serious reasons to believe that, if the person concerned were transferred into United States custody under the \u201crendition\u201d programme, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. Consequently, the Court has concluded that the State authorities knew or ought to have known, at the relevant time, that there was a real risk that the person concerned would be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see El Masri v. \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7\u00a0218, ECHR 2012).",

The Court has drawn attention to the vast differences in the civil, political, economic, social and cultural conditions prevailing in countries across the globe. As a consequence of those significant differences, States have constructed their criminal justice systems around principles and approaches which are often equally varied. It is in principle for sovereign States to decide how best to tackle the problems that arise in their respective territories, provided always that the responses remain within the range of approaches considered to be acceptable by democratic States. The solutions applied in one State may not be suited to another, and it follows that a sentence cannot be deemed grossly disproportionate simply because it is more severe than the sentence which would be imposed in another State (see ibid., \u00a7 78).",

This provision does not require that the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to extradition be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent that person\u2019s committing an offence or absconding. In this connection, and as submitted by the Government, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d.

In all cases it establishes the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of the laws concerned (paragraphs 155 and 156 above). Moreover, it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see K. v.

While that legislative provision is silent on the need for the existence of a reasonable suspicion of commission of the extradition offence, the majority point to the terms of Article 7\u00a73(c) of the Extradition Treaty between Latvia and the United States of America. This treaty provision, which forms part of the legal system of Latvia, states that the extradition request should include \u201csuch information as would provide a reasonable basis to believe that the person committed the offence for which extradition is sought\u201d (paragraphs 185-186 of the present judgment \u2013 the treaty provision being quoted at paragraph 77 of the present judgment).",

That decision, firstly, repeated the terms of the prosecutor\u2019s submission according to which \u201cthe extradition request contains all the information and documents as required by Article 7\u00a7\u00a72 and 3 of the ... Treaty\u201d (emphasis supplied); it then went on to state that \u201c[the investigating judge] agrees with the prosecutor\u2019s proposal [to place the applicant in pre-extradition detention]\u201d (see paragraphs 23-24 of the present judgment).

However, such criticism, even when taken with the other criticism that the majority makes of the quality of the investigating judge\u2019s reasoning (see paragraph 188 of the present judgment), is simply not enough to warrant this Court\u2019s holding that the contested pre-extradition detention, ordered by an independent and impartial judge after an adversarial hearing and after delivery of a decision adverting to the relevant legal provisions, was neither \u201clawful\u201d nor \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d. There is no suggestion of an unfair or improper procedure or of an arbitrary deprivation of liberty issuing from an inappropriate authority (see Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a745), let alone no cause for characterising the applicant\u2019s judicial treatment as \u201ca manifest case of arbitrariness\u201d, and no suggestion of any \u201cgross or obvious irregularity\u201d in the interpretation and application of domestic procedural and material law, as required by the Court\u2019s case-law for a violation to be found on this ground. Regrettably, we feel, the present judgment on this point lays the Court open to a charge of addressing admonitions to the national courts on how they should be interpreting and applying their own domestic law and be going about the details of their judicial business, a task that is not appropriate for this international Court. Although the investigating judge\u2019s written decision may have represented a less than ideal judgment in terms of its reasoning, the pre-extradition detention it ordered cannot, on the facts and on the Convention criteria laid down in this Court\u2019s case-law, be regarded as anything other than \u201clawful\u201d and \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d.",
