The courts did not explain why the continued detention of the applicant was necessary in order to prevent public disquiet and did not examine whether the applicant presented a danger to public safety, for instance by contrast to two of her four co-defendants, who remained at liberty during the trial. Therefore, the arguments of the Government referring to the protection of public order cannot be seen as sufficient basis for ordering or extending the applicant\u2019s detention. The Court reiterates in that connection that it is not its task to take the place of the national authorities which ruled on the applicant\u2019s detention (see Ilijkov v.

The administration of justice, including trials, derives legitimacy from being conducted in public. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, publicity contributes to fulfilling the aim of Article 6 \u00a7 1, namely a fair trial (see Gautrin and Others v.\u00a0France, 20 May 1998, \u00a7 42, Reports 1998-III, and Pretto and Others v.

Thus, it may on occasion be necessary under Article 6 to limit the open and public nature of proceedings in order, for example, to protect the safety or privacy of witnesses, or to promote the free exchange of information and opinion in the pursuit of justice (see B. and P. v. the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a036337/97 and 35974/97, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2001-III, with further references).\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s task in the present case is to establish whether the exclusion of the public from the trial in the City Court was justified.",

The Court observes that it may be important for a State to preserve its secrets, but it is of infinitely greater importance to surround justice with all the requisite safeguards, of which one of the most indispensable is publicity. Before excluding the public from criminal proceedings, courts must make specific findings to the effect that closure is necessary to protect a compelling government interest and limit secrecy to the extent necessary to preserve such an interest (see, mutatis mutandis, Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, \u00a7\u00a0149, 29\u00a0November 2007, and Moser v. Austria, no.\u00a012643/02, \u00a7\u00a7 96 and 97, 21\u00a0September 2006).",

It did not even indicate what documents in the case file, if any, were considered to contain State secrets or how they were related to the nature and character of the charges against the applicant. The Court further observes that the City Court did not take any measures to counterbalance the detrimental effect that the decision to hold the trial in camera, for the sake of protecting the State\u2019s interest in keeping its secrets, must have had on public confidence in the proper administration of justice. The Government did not argue \u2013 and there is no indication to the contrary in the documents submitted by the parties \u2013 that it was not open to the City Court to hold the trial publicly and simply clear the courtroom for a single or, if need be, a number of non-public sessions to deal with classified documents or information. The Court therefore finds it striking that in such a situation the Moscow City Court preferred to close the entire trial to the public (see Belashev v.

The Court considers that it would have been preferable to expand on this element in order to explain in more detail why the City Court was worried about the vulnerability of certain persons or whether and why it was concerned that those persons might have been deterred. It was also important to explain why the concern for the safety of the persons involved in the trial outweighed the importance of ensuring the publicity of the trial (see Porubova v. , no. 8237/03, \u00a7\u00a034, 8 October 2009). Moreover, if the trial court had indeed taken into account certain information, this should have been presented to the parties, in particular the applicant, to permit open discussion of the matter (see Volkov v. Russia, no.\u00a064056/00, \u00a7\u00a031, 4\u00a0December 2007).",

It observes that the danger which defendants may present to other parties to the proceedings cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the gravity of the charges and the severity of the sentence faced. It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may confirm the existence of a danger justifying the denial of public access to a trial. In the present case the decisions of the domestic courts gave no reasons why they considered the risk to the safety of the \u201cparticipants\u201d to be decisive. Nor does any relevant information emerge from the other material before the Court, including the documents in the criminal case file produced by the parties. Consequently, the Court finds that dispensing with a public hearing was not justified in the circumstances of the present case.",

In particular, the Court is not competent to deal with an application alleging that errors of law or fact have been committed by the domestic courts, except where it considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation of any of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention (see, among other authorities, Schenk v.

The guarantees in paragraph 3 of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair trial set out in paragraph 1. In the circumstances of the case it finds it unnecessary to examine the applicant\u2019s allegations separately from the standpoint of paragraph 3 (b), since they amount to a complaint that she did not receive a fair trial. It will therefore confine its examination to the question of whether the proceedings in their entirety were fair (see Rowe and Davis v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a028901/95, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2000-II). It is a fundamental aspect of the right to a fair trial that criminal proceedings, including the elements of such proceedings which relate to procedure, should be adversarial and that there should be equality of arms between the prosecution and defence. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. In addition Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires that the prosecution authorities disclose to the defence all material evidence in their possession for or against the accused (see, among others, Natunen v. , no. 21022/04, \u00a7\u00a039, 31\u00a0March\u00a02009).",

The applicant\u2019s allegation concerning unjustified limitations on her ability to have knowledge of the material in the criminal case file lacks substantiation. The Court also considers that it has not been shown that the facilities and time afforded by the authorities to study the case file was as such insufficient and that the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 have not been breached in this respect (see paragraphs 36, 39, 41 and 44 above).",
