The case originated in an application (no. 22960/06) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Ms Anna Marton (“the applicant”), on 25 May 2006.
The applicant was represented by her son, Mr Barnabas Marton. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu.
On 15 June 2007 the President of the Third Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1923 and lives in Miercurea Ciuc.
The applicant lodged a complaint under Law 18/1991 for the recovery of 1.45 hectares of land that had belonged to her ancestor, N.L. In 2001 the Harghita County Commission for the application of Law 18/1991 rejected the applicant's complaint for restitution of the land and established her entitlement to damages.
The decision of the Commission was challenged by the applicant before the Miercurea Ciuc District Court. By a judgment of 14 October 2004, the applicant's claim was dismissed. An appeal filed by the applicant was allowed and by a decision of 22 March 2005 the Harghita County Court ordered the restitution of 1.45 ha of land situated in Szeradai Rat.
By a final decision of 30 November 2005, the Târgu-Mureş Court of Appeal allowed an appeal on points of law filed by the local commission and ordered the restitution of other land on the original site of 9,300 square meters and the payment of damages for the 5,200 sq. m of land that could not be returned.
So far the applicant has not received any title deed to the 9,300 sq. m of land and has not obtained any compensation for the remaining 5,200 sq. m.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in Sabin Popescu v. Romania (no. 48102/99, §§ 42-46, 2 March 2004).
