Russia (no.\u00a065489/12) and in Novrzukayeva and Others (no.\u00a052089/11) in respect of Mr German Abuyev\u2019s abduction, the applicants formally complained to the domestic authorities within twenty days of the respective incidents (see paragraphs 14, 21, 24, 51, 76, 103, 112, 146, 147 and 166 above). The date of the first formal complaint in respect of Mr\u00a0Idris Novrzukayev\u2019s and Mr\u00a0AbdulVab Dilayev\u2019s abductions in Novrzukayeva and Others is unknown. However, from the documents in the Court\u2019s possession it appears that it was lodged before 22\u00a0October 2002 (see paragraph 113 above). Such a delay does not seem to be excessive, particularly regard being had to the fact that immediately after the abduction the third applicant and other village residents contacted the military authorities asking them to release the arrested men (see paragraph 102 above; and compare Kukurkhoyeva and Others v. Russia [CTE], nos.\u00a050556/08 and 9 others, \u00a7 212, 22 January 2019, and Yandayeva and Others v. Russia [CTE], nos.\u00a05374/07 and 9\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a0223, 4 December 2018).",

The most significant of them, apparently exceeding five years (the exact dates of suspension and resumption of the proceedings were not always clear) took place in Novrzukayeva and Others (no. 52089/11) and Tasuyev and Others (no. 17499/12). In the first case the proceedings were formally suspended from 21 June 2003 until 8 July 2010. However, during that period the investigator questioned an important witness (see paragraph 124 above) and the applicants demonstrated their interest in the course of the investigation (see paragraphs 123, and 125-129 above). In the second case the investigation remained dormant from November 2003 to June 2009 (see paragraphs 158 and 159 above). Owing to the lack of certain documents from a copy of the case file submitted by the Government, the Court is unable to make a conclusive assessment of the applicants\u2019 conduct at the relevant time, but in any event, as the applicant was not duly informed of the decision to suspend the proceedings on 28 November 2003, he could have expected that the proceedings were still ongoing and steps were being taken to have the crime resolved. In such circumstances, the Court cannot conclude that the applicants\u2019 procedural behaviour was unjustified.",

They arrived in a UAZ minivan, and took the applicant\u2019s relative away, apparently to Gudermes police station, where he was seen by his brother, Mr Mekhidi Timerbulatov (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). The abductors of Mr\u00a0Saidal-Khadzhi Magomedov and Ms\u00a0Sovdat Timerbulatova spoke unaccented Russian. They arrived at the crime scene in a UAZ minivan (apparently accompanied by an APC and a UAZ or VAZ car) and then passed through road checkpoint showing their laisser passers to the police officers (see paragraphs 21, 23 and 24 above). In Makhauri (no. 70640/10) the service personnel used the same type of military vehicles as in the previous case \u2013 APCs and UAZ minivans (see paragraph 76 above). While before the applicant\u2019s relative\u2019s arrest the search for the illicit weapons was unsuccessful, on the following day a box of cartridges was found (see paragraphs 77 and 79 above). In Novrzukayeva and Others (no. 52089/11) the abductions took place during a \u201csweep\u201d operation (see paragraph 101 above). The applicant\u2019s relatives were taken away to an unknown destination by men in an APC (see paragraphs 102 and 104 above). Officers from the temporary military headquarters indirectly confirmed that Mr Idris Novrzukayev and Mr Abdul-Vab Dilayev were in their custody (see paragraph 103 above). In Tasuyev and Others (no.\u00a017499/12) the alleged service personnel in UAZ minivans had been equipped with a military service card which allowed them to pass unrestrictedly through a road checkpoint (see paragraphs 143 and 151 above). In Zaurayeva (no.\u00a065489/12) the abduction took place in broad\u00a0daylight and in the presence of numerous witnesses. According to the witness statements, the service personnel arrived at the local market in Grozny in two APCs, checked identity documents and detained several people, including the applicant\u2019s relative, who was then taken away in UAZ car with the inscription \u201calert force\u201d (see paragraph 166 above).",

Whether a failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee\u2019s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on specific evidence, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.

Therefore, the Government\u2019s argument concerning the applicability of Article 5 of the Convention instead of Article 2 of the Convention is inconsistent. In any event, leaving aside the contradictory nature of the Government\u2019s position in this regard, the period of time which has elapsed since each person was placed in detention, although not decisive in itself, is a relevant factor to be taken into account. It must be accepted that the more time that goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may, along with other elements of circumstantial evidence before the Court, provide grounds to conclude that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. In this connection the Court considers that such a situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere \u201cirregular detention\u201d in violation of Article\u00a05. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life, as afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 86, and Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no. , \u00a7 83, ECHR 2000VI). Accordingly, the Court finds that Article 2 of the Convention applies and that the Government\u2019s objection in this connection should be dismissed.",

The Court notes that in the case of Zaurayeva (no. 65489/12), as well as other cases under examination, the abduction took place within the said period. In the cases at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigations have been pending for many years without bringing about any significant developments as to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of the applicants\u2019 missing relatives. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means to be employed and not of results to be achieved, the Court notes that each set of criminal proceedings has been plagued by a combination of defects similar to those enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012325). Each set of proceedings included several decisions to suspend the investigation; those suspensions were followed by periods of inactivity, which further diminished the prospects of solving the crimes.
