Her concerns were not directed at the father but at the fact that a danger to the child\u2019s health still existed. It had been the child welfare authorities who had qualified these concerns as relating to sexual abuse. Sexual abuse did not always leave physical marks which could be revealed by medical examination but it was a grave procedural mistake not to interview the child during the pre-trial investigation. She considered this mistake to be so substantial that the danger to her child\u2019s health still existed despite the outcome of the investigation. She also referred to the case Juppala v.\u00a0Finland, no. 18620/03, 2 December 2008.",

Moreover, the Appeal Court had examined the case as a whole and taken into account the applicant\u2019s particular status in sentencing.

In its assessment, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Nikula v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7 44). The Court recalls that the quality of judicial review in respect of the necessity of the measure is of particular importance in the context of the proportionality assessment under Article 10 of the Convention (see Animal Defenders International v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, \u00a7 108, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). The margin of appreciation in this context is measured by reviewing the extent to which the reasoning of the national courts engages with the general principles under Article 10 and the extent to which the balance struck between the competing rights at the domestic level is satisfactory (see Erla\u00a0Hlynsd\u03ccttir v.

The first of these interests involves protection of children as actual or possible victims of crime. The Court has emphasised that children and other vulnerable individuals in particular are entitled to State protection, in the form of effective deterrence, against such serious breaches of personal integrity (see, mutatis mutandis, X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, \u00a7\u00a7 21-27, Series A no. 91; Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22\u00a0October\u00a01996, \u00a7\u00a7 62-64, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV; and also the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Articles 19 and 37).

The Court held in that case that the obligation under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention, taken together with Article 3, required States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction were not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals.",

There is a delicate and difficult line to tread between taking action too soon and not taking it soon enough. The duty toward the child in making these decisions should not be hampered by a risk of exposure to claims by a distressed parent if the suspicion of abuse proves unfounded. On the other hand, it is justified that acts motivated by a personal grievance or antagonism or an expectation of personal advantage be discouraged, including in the context of disputes relating to the custody or visiting rights concerning a child.",
