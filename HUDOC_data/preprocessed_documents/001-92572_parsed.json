It appears that this issue could not be addressed satisfactorily without a DNA test, and the second test was necessary as long as the first one was found inadmissible for formal procedural reasons. It is true that the applicant failed to request the second test, as the Government pointed out. However it follows from the wording of the Russian Code of Civil Procedure that it is at the court\u2019s discretion to order a second expert examination if the accuracy of the previous expert conclusion is doubted (see paragraph 15 above). This is of particular importance in the present case, where the breach of the rule concerning a sampling procedure, if it occurred, appears to be attributable to the Bureau of forensic medical examinations, i.e. a State institution. Against this background, the domestic courts by simply declaring the first court-ordered DNA test inadmissible without ordering a new test, did not apply Article 87 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure in the light of the principles enshrined in Article 8 of the Convention.",
