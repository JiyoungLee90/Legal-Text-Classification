He noted that, while the Code of Criminal Procedure provided for extradition detention of up to eighteen months, it did not establish any time-limits for submitting and examining the associated extradition request. Accordingly, the applicant argued that the Ukrainian authorities should abide by the 1993 Minsk Convention, which provided for a one-month time-limit for submitting an extradition request once the person was detained and a maximum two-month extension of that time-limit for supplementing the extradition request if need be (see paragraph 38 below). He emphasised that in his case a duly completed extradition request had not been submitted until 30 August 2010, whereas he had been in detention since 19 April 2010. The applicant therefore argued that he should be released immediately. Lastly, he submitted that the charges against him were ridiculous and that it was in his own interests to go to Russia so that his trial could be completed without delay.",

However, the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention under domestic law is not always the decisive element. The Court must in addition be satisfied that the detention during the period under consideration was compatible with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which is to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary fashion. The Court must, moreover, ascertain whether the domestic law itself is in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied therein. On this last point, the Court stresses that, where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski v.

The Court has already expressed its view on this issue in the Molotchko case (cited above, \u00a7 160). Specifically, it held that in those circumstances, where the new regulations could have created some uncertainty as to their application in the applicant\u2019s situation, the authorities were under an obligation to ensure, without delay and through the relevant judicial review procedure, that the applicant\u2019s continued detention was in compliance with the new regulations.

The same delay occurred in the present case: from 17 to 23 June 2010 there was no judicial review of the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention, and the applicant could hardly have initiated it given the uncertainty of the legal basis for his detention.",

It appears that the hearing, which was initially scheduled for 21 July, had to be adjourned till 30 July 2010 because of the applicant\u2019s request that a lawyer be appointed for him.

What the Court does note, however, is that no assessment was made as regards the reasonableness of the applicant\u2019s continued detention. Furthermore, the Court does not find it insignificant that the Malynivskyy Court referred to the extradition request pertaining to the applicant dated 11 May 2010, without mentioning that of 29 (30) April 2010. Given that the ruling in question appears to be the only document referring to 11 May 2010 as the date of the extradition request, it cannot be ruled out that that was an erroneous reference.
