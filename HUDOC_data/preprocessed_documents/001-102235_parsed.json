The first steps towards finding Mr Z., a key witness who had been kidnapped together with the applicant's family member, were only taken on 10 September 2003, that is, more than five months after the proceedings had been opened (see paragraph 41 above). The investigators began to search for another important witness, Mr D., who could relate important information concerning the involvement of the task force unit in the kidnapping, as late as 11 March 2009, that is, almost six years after the investigation had been commenced (see paragraph 61 above).

It is noteworthy that it was the first applicant who lodged petitions and enquiries with the domestic authorities in connection with her son's disappearance and dealt with the investigators. It is quite natural that the second applicant, who was under two years old at the time of his father's disappearance, and third applicant, who had not even been born at the material time, did not participate in any manner in the search for Ruslan Taymuskhanov (see, by contrast, Luluyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 112). In the light of these circumstances, the Court, while accepting that the fact of being raised without their father may be a source of continuing distress for the second and third applicants, cannot assume that the mental anguish they experienced on account of Ruslan Taymuskhanov's disappearance and the authorities' attitude towards that incident was distinct from the inevitable emotional distress such a situation would entail, and that it was serious enough to fall within the ambit of Article 3 of the Convention (see Musikhanova and Others v. , no. 27243/03, \u00a7 81, 4 December 2008).",
