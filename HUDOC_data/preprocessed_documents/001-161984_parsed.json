This is not an obligation of result, but of means. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, \u00a7\u00a7 9697, 4 May 2001, and Anguelova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, \u00a7 139, ECHR 2002IV). Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. The State\u2019s obligation under Article 2 of the Convention will not be satisfied if the protection afforded by domestic law exists only in theory: above all, it must also operate effectively in practice and that requires a prompt examination of the case without unnecessary delays. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see \u0160ilih v.\u00a0Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7 195, 9 April 2009; Varnava and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, \u00a7 191, ECHR 2009; and Association \u201c21 December 1989\u201d and Others, cited above, \u00a7 134).",
