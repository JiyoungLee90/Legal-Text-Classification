On the basis of information from the audit, the Tax Authority concluded that Mr Nitschke had to be considered the executive of the company, due to his influence therein, and that his taxable income for both years should be increased because he had omitted to inform the Tax Authority about certain income from the company in the form of salary payments and benefits involving free lunches and the free use of a company car.

Moreover, he only used the company car for carrying out work-related matters as he owned a car for private use. The mooring had been rented for the company to cater for islands in the archipelago, and he underlined that he did not own a boat himself. Also, as the company did not have proper office space, he kept the computer and stereo in a room of his house which he only used as an office.

Furthermore, neither Mr Nitschke's heirs nor his estate were ever held personally liable for the tax surcharges since they had already been imposed on Mr Nitschke while he was alive and paid by him. The Court finds it to be of relevance to observe that, according to Swedish law, tax surcharges cannot be imposed on a deceased person or his/her estate (see paragraph 29 above).
