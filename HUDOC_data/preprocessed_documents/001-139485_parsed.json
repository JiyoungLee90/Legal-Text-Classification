Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v.\u00a0France, 26 June 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 207; Panchenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102; Goral v.

All these factors may justify a relatively long period of detention. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v. Poland, no. 31246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14\u00a0November 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 3738, 4\u00a0May 2006). The fact that a person is charged with acting in criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention; his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account (see Sizov v. , no. 33123/08, \u00a7\u00a053, 15 March 2011).",

However, subsequently the domestic courts did not take this into account when extending the second applicant\u2019s detention. According to the Government, in March 2006 the authorities found proof that the applicants had continued putting pressure on B. However, that circumstance was referred to for the first time in the proceedings before the Court, and the domestic courts never mentioned it in their decisions. It is not the Court\u2019s task to take the place of the national authorities ruling on the applicants\u2019 detention or to substitute its own analysis of the arguments for and against detention (see Nikolov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a038884/97, \u00a7 74, 30 January 2003, and Labita, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0152).
