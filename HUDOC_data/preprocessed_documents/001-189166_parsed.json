That preliminary stage has too restricted a scope and cannot lead to the identification and punishment of the perpetrators of the alleged ill-treatment, since the opening of a criminal case and a criminal investigation are no more than prerequisites for bringing charges against alleged perpetrators, which may then be examined by a court. The Court has held that a refusal to open a criminal investigation into credible allegations of serious illtreatment is indicative of the State\u2019s failure to comply with its procedural obligation under Article 3 (see Lyapin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a046956/09, \u00a7\u00a7 134-40, 24 July 2014; Olisov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a010825/09 and 2\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a7 81-82, 2\u00a0May 2017; and Sergey Ivanov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 14416/06, \u00a7\u00a7 81-83, 15\u00a0May 2018).",

A forensic firearm examination was carried out many months after the events and was neither able to link the bullets or cartridges used to the handgun from which the shot had been fired, nor to link the handgun to the individual who had wielded it (see paragraph 18 above). An assessment of the extent of the applicant\u2019s injuries and the resulting disability was not ordered until two years after the incident, and proved to be impossible because his medical record had been misplaced in the meantime (see paragraph 20 above). Thus, in addition to the structural defects of the format of a \u201cpre-investigation inquiry\u201d, which the Court has highlighted in previous cases, the inquiry in the instant case fell short of the requirements of Article 3 because it was both belated and of insufficient scope. The investigators did not make a serious attempt to establish all the circumstances of the incident and to attribute responsibility for firing the shot that had wounded the applicant. The Court finds that the refusal to open a criminal case into the applicant\u2019s credible allegations of the failure to protect his physical integrity, of which the authorities were promptly made aware, amounted to a failure to carry out an effective investigation as required by Article 3 of the Convention.",

In particular, it was unable to establish from which handgun the shot concerned had been fired or the identity of the person who had pulled the trigger. However, while these aspects would have been of paramount importance in other cases, they are of lesser relevance in the circumstances of the present case. There is nothing to indicate that anyone took aim at the applicant or meant to harm him.

As a consequence, there was no separate cell available for the applicant and he had to ride with the guards. That arrangement was in breach of the general regulation which prohibited convoys from exceeding the design capacity of the prison van. It also violated the specific regulation relating to the placement of particularly vulnerable categories of prisoners, such as former law-enforcement officers, like the applicant, in separate cells (see paragraph 22 above).

They also seek to avoid cases of inter-prisoner violence by requiring separation of vulnerable detainees. In the instant case, the convoy officers gave no consideration to the security risks entailed by transporting more prisoners than permitted by the van\u2019s capacity. Irrespective of whether they sought to save fuel or the effort of an extra journey, they acted with disregard for the regulations which had been put in place to protect the wellbeing and physical integrity of detainees during transfers.
