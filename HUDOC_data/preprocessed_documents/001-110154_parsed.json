It has held that the practice of keeping defendants in detention without judicial authorisation or clear rules governing their situation was incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and the protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see Isayev v. Russia, no.\u00a020756/04, \u00a7\u00a7 131-33, 22 October 2009; Yudayev v. Russia, no.\u00a040258/03, \u00a7\u00a7 59-61, 15 January 2009; Belov v.

The applicant was not therefore able to initiate a judicial review of his detention during that period because the Russian law only provides for a procedure for an appeal against formal detention orders (see paragraph 23 above). In the absence of such an order the applicant did not have a clear avenue to have the lawfulness of his detention reviewed (see, mutatis mutandis, Belevitskiy, cited above, \u00a7 109). Furthermore, when the applicant did complain to the courts alleging the unlawful detention in that period, they treated this complaint as an application for release and did not make a retrospective assessment of the lawfulness of the previous detention periods. In particular, in their decisions of 8 and 16 February 2005 the courts limited themselves to stating reasons for the prospective detention. In the appeal decision of 17 March 2005 the Supreme Court of the  referred to the complaint as regards the period in question, but did not examine the question whether there had been an authorisation in respect of the period at issue. Moreover, the subsequent supervisory review quashed that decision, stating that the lawfulness of the detention in that period was outside the scope of the appeal review, because the relevant decision did not contain an order for, or an extension of, the applicant\u2019s detention. It follows that the domestic courts did not consider this part of the applicant\u2019s detention to be subject to judicial review.",
