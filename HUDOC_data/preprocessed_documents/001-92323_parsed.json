It thus finds that the fact that a large group of armed men in uniform travelling in APCs arrived in Argun at 2 a.m. and abducted three young men strongly supports the applicants\u2019 allegation that these were State servicemen. From the early stage of the proceedings the authorities were informed by the relatives of the missing men that Idris Gakiyev and the Elmarzayev brothers had been detained by unknown men in the APCs and the investigators had been asked to look into that possibility (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above).

Furthermore, the Government mentioned that the applicants had the opportunity to apply for judicial or administrative review of the decisions of the investigating authorities in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court observes in this respect that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged the actions or omissions of the investigating authorities before a court or a higher prosecutor. Besides, after a lapse of time some investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out promptly could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedies relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the criminal-law remedies relied on by the Government were ineffective in the circumstances of the case and rejects their objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust these domestic remedies.",

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see Halford v. the United Kingdom, 25 June 1997, \u00a7\u00a064, Reports 1997III).",

Germany, 6 September 1978, \u00a7\u00a033, Series A no. 28); it does not institute for individuals a kind of actio popularis for the interpretation of the Convention or permit individuals to complain against a law simply because they feel that it contravenes the Convention (see Norris v.
