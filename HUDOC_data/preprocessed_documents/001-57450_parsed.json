In particular, they drew attention to the difficulty faced by the security forces in obtaining evidence which is both admissible and usable in consequence of training in anti-interrogation techniques adopted by those involved in terrorism. Time was also needed to undertake necessary scientific examinations, to correlate information from other detainees and to liaise with other security forces. The Government claimed that the need for a power of extension of the period of detention was borne out by statistics. For instance, in 1987 extensions were granted in  in respect of 365 persons. Some 83 were detained in excess of five days and of this number 39 were charged with serious terrorist offences during the extended period.",

This would require a fundamental and undesirable change in the law and procedure of the  under which an individual who is deprived of his liberty is entitled to be represented by his legal advisers at any proceedings before a court relating to his detention. If entrusted with the power to grant extensions of detention, the judges would be seen to be exercising an executive rather than a judicial function. It would add nothing to the safeguards against abuse which the present arrangements are designed to achieve and could lead to unanswerable criticism of the judiciary. In all the circumstances, the Secretary of State was better placed to take such decisions and to ensure a consistent approach. Moreover, the merits of each request to extend detention were personally scrutinised by the Secretary of State or, if he was unavailable, by another Minister (see paragraph 37 above).",

Whereas promptness is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see the above-mentioned de Jong, Baljet and van den Brink judgment, Series A no. 77, p. 25, para. 52), the significance to be attached to those features can never be taken to the point of impairing the very essence of the right guaranteed by Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), that is to the point of effectively negativing the State\u2019s obligation to ensure a prompt release or a prompt appearance before a judicial authority.",

The Court takes full judicial notice of the factors adverted to by the Government in this connection. It is also true that in  the referral of police requests for extended detention to the Secretary of State and the individual scrutiny of each police request by a Minister do provide a form of executive control (see paragraph 37 above).  In addition, the need for the continuation of the special powers has been constantly monitored by Parliament and their operation regularly reviewed by independent personalities (see paragraphs 26-29 above). The Court accepts that, subject to the existence of adequate safeguards, the context of terrorism in  has the effect of prolonging the period during which the authorities may, without violating Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), keep a person suspected of serious terrorist offences in custody before bringing him before a judge or other judicial officer.",

In the Court\u2019s view, even the shortest of the four periods of detention, namely the four days and six hours spent in police custody by Mr McFadden (see paragraph 18 above), falls outside the strict constraints as to time permitted by the first part of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3). To attach such importance to the special features of this case as to justify so lengthy a period of detention without appearance before a judge or other judicial officer would be an unacceptably wide interpretation of the plain meaning of the word \"promptly\". An interpretation to this effect would import into Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) a serious weakening of a procedural guarantee to the detriment of the individual and would entail consequences impairing the very essence of the right protected by this provision. The Court thus has to conclude that none of the applicants was either brought \"promptly\" before a judicial authority or released \"promptly\" following his arrest. The undoubted fact that the arrest and detention of the applicants were inspired by the legitimate aim of protecting the community as a whole from terrorism is not on its own sufficient to ensure compliance with the specific requirements of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3).",

The need for the exceptional powers under section 12 to which such factors give rise is supported by the statistics quoted in the same paragraph of the judgment - that in 1987, for instance, of some 83 persons detained in excess of five days, 39 were charged with serious terrorist offences during the extended period.",

He pointed out that the decisions in question would have to be made by a judge sitting in camera without any effective representation of the detained person and that in his opinion the change would add nothing to the safeguards for civil liberties but could lead to unanswerable criticisms of the judiciary. These considerations were of course equally pertinent in 1984 when the applicants were detained (see, for instance, Lord Jellicoe\u2019s Report of 1983 on the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976, para. 70).

The majority of the Court have nevertheless felt constrained to interpret the word \"promptly\" as in effect making incompatible with Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) any period of detention under section 12 of the 1984 Act exceeding the four days previously considered, at least by the Commission, to be acceptable in normal cases. In my opinion, given that the notion of promptness in the context of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) must be applied with some degree of flexibility, this is an unduly restrictive interpretation which does not take sufficiently into account the special factors underlying the provisions of section 12. My conclusion is that the provisions in question are justified by the need to strike a fair balance in the circumstances and that they are consonant with what must also be the aim under the Convention of protecting human rights against the continuing inhumanity of terrorism in .",

As the Court rightly recalls in paragraph 48 of its judgment, terrorism is a feature of modern life, which has attained its present extent and intensity only since the Convention was drafted. Terrorism - and particularly terrorism on the scale obtaining in  - is the very negation of the principles the Convention stands for and should therefore be combated as vigorously as possible. It seems obvious that to suppress terrorism the executive needs extraordinary powers, just as it seems obvious that Governments should to a large extent be free to choose the ways and means which they think most efficacious for combating terrorism. Of course, in combating terrorism the States Parties to the Convention have to respect the rights and freedoms secured therein to everyone. I subscribe to that and I am aware of the danger of measures being taken which, as the Court has put it, may undermine or even destroy democracy on the ground of defending it (see the Klass and Others judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 23, para. 49). But I think that this danger must not be exaggerated - especially with regard to States which have a long and firm traditon of democracy - and should not lead to the wings of national authorities being excessively clipped, for that would unduly benefit those who do not hesitate to trample on the rights and freedoms of others.",

But it seems to me legitimate to ask whether he may not be detained, before being brought before a judge, for a somewhat longer period than is acceptable under ordinary criminal law. In this connection, I consider that the Court by saying, in the second section of paragraph 58 of its judgment, that Article 5 (art. 5) \"enshrines a fundamental human right\" somewhat overestimates the importance of this provision in the Convention system. Undoubtedly, the right to liberty and security of person is an important right, but it does not belong to that small nucleus of rights from which no derogation is permitted. This means that there is room for weighing the general interest in an effective combating of terrorism against the individual interests of those who are arrested on a reasonable suspicion of involvement in acts of terrorism. The search for such a fair balance between the general interest of the community and the interests of the indiviudual is, as the Court has already pointed out repeatedly and points out again in its present judgment (paragraph 48), inherent in the whole of the Convention.",

I will explain in paragraphs 6 to 13 below why I do not share this view.

The ground given for this doctrine - which is reiterated in the present judgment (paragraph 53) - is the difference in wording between Articles 24 and 25 (art. 24, art. 25), but to me it would seem that the more fundamental basis for it is judicial restraint.",

Secondly, Hulsman, in his report for the Congress on European Criminal Law, held at  in November 1968, said: \"The maximum length of provisional detention which precedes judicial control had been laid down in the law of most countries and ranges from twenty-four hours till seven days\"! These data confirm the Commission\u2019s aforementioned decision of October 1966. Since it has not been maintained, let alone established, that meanwhile a new and more severe European standard has been developed, I cannot subscribe to the criticism of this decision implied in paragraph 60 of the Court\u2019s judgment (quite apart from the question whether, from the point of view of legal certainty, such sudden criticism of a decision which has for years been the leading case on the subject is judicious).",
