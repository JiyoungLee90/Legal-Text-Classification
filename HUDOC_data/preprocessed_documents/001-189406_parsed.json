In Isayevy (no.\u00a070640/11) the date the formal complaint was made remains unknown owing to the Government\u2019s failure to submit the investigation file (see paragraph 166 above).

Thus the authorities had become aware of the incident shortly after it had taken place (see paragraph 164 above).",
