In the Court\u2019s view, it appears unlikely that a limited number of demonstrators would have needed more space at the scene than the five-metre-wide pedestrian area, or that they would have significantly impeded the traffic, especially on Christmas Eve when the town buses ceased to run soon after 4 p.m. Consequently, the Court concludes that the authorities, when issuing repetitive prohibitions on the demonstrations, mechanically relying on the same reasons and not taking into account Mr\u00a0Patyi\u2019s factual clarifications, failed to strike a fair balance between the rights of those wishing to exercise their freedom of assembly and those others whose freedom of movement may have been frustrated temporarily, if at all.",
