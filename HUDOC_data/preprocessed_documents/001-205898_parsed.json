The applicant also stated that the Prime Minister had on several occasions said that he wanted a \u201cgodly generation\u201d (dindar gen\u00e7lik) to emerge and that he had used the phrase \u201cone State, one language, one religion ...\u201d.

Article 17, paragraph 1, of the Constitution, which states that \u2018everyone has the right to live, and to protect and develop his physical and moral integrity\u2019, requires the State not to interfere arbitrarily with the individual\u2019s right to the protection of his honour and reputation, which is part of his moral integrity, and to prevent attacks by third parties.

The court found that the balance between \u2018substance and form\u2019, in the sense of an intellectual correlation between the terms used by the appellant in his criticism and the subject matter of the speech, had been upset, and therefore the use of the language in question had not been necessary in order to convey comments or criticisms to the [plaintiff at first instance].

The appellant did not submit to the Constitutional Court the information and documents in the files which had served as a basis for the award. Nor did he complain that the amount was excessive.

Where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient \u201cfactual basis\u201d for the impugned statement: if there is not, that value judgment may prove excessive (see, for example, Morice, cited above, \u00a7 126). Moreover, in the context of proceedings for defamation or insults, the Court must weigh in the balance a series of additional factors when it assesses the proportionality of the impugned measure. First, in terms of the subject matter of the offending remarks, the Court reiterates that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual. Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0117-121, Lingens v.\u00a0Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 103; see also Kapsis and Danikas v.\u00a0Greece, no. 52137/12, \u00a7 35, 19 January 2017).",

When weighing up the right to freedom of expression against the right to respect for private life the relevant criteria are as follows: first, the contribution to a debate of general interest; second, the degree of notoriety of the person affected and the subject matter of the news report; third, the prior conduct of the person affected; fourth, the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity; fifth, the content, form and consequences of the publication; and sixth, the severity of the sanction imposed (see, for example, Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83 and 89 to 95; Von Hannover v.

The domestic courts took the view that the applicant had not confined himself to political criticism but had attacked the reputation of a politician. In two judgments of 23 October 2012, the Ankara District Court thus found that some of the remarks in the two offending speeches were to be perceived as a personal attack on the plaintiff. In so finding, the court first distinguished the words that it regarded as insults from the other statements in the speeches, then focussed on those passages that it saw as a personal attack to determine whether or not they were necessary in a context of political exchange. The District Court found that the applicant had failed to strike a balance between \u201csubstance and form\u201d and, consequently, the use of the offending remarks to convey his comments or criticisms to the plaintiff had not been proven necessary. Consequently, the District Court justified the interference in question by the main consideration that the applicant\u2019s \u201cstyle\u201d had not been compliant with the law (see paragraphs\u00a010 and 16 above).",

When the impugned remarks are analysed in the light of the speeches as a whole, it must be said that those expressions were directly related to the many topical issues that were addressed by the applicant in his two speeches; those issues included the construction of a hydroelectric power station, the Deniz Feneri court case \u2013 a very significant one \u2013, the tragic event of Uludere, which had led to thirty-four deaths, a judicial procedure before the Supreme Administrative Court, etc. (see, mutatis mutandis, Nadtoka v. Russia, no. 38010/05, \u00a7 46, 31\u00a0May 2016). Accordingly, in view of the topical issues addressed in the two speeches, there was some factual basis for the impugned remarks (compare Nilsen and Johnsen v.\u00a0Norway [GC], no.\u00a023118/93, \u00a7 51, ECHR 1999VIII). In addition, the Court attaches weight to the fact that the applicant had argued before the domestic courts that these remarks had a factual basis (see paragraphs 6 and 12 above).

Even though, as the Constitutional Court pointed out (see paragraph\u00a069 of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment), the \u201ccontempt\u201d contained in certain remarks cannot be overlooked, they may rather be regarded as having a provocative tone which was intended to foster controversy about the political position allegedly adopted by the person at whom the remarks were directed. They may also be recognised as the type of political invective used by politicians in the course of their debates (see, mutatis mutandis, Jerusalem v.\u00a0Austria, no. 26958/95, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2001-II; Roseiro Bento v.\u00a0Portugal, no. 29288/02, \u00a7 44, 18 April 2006; and Athanasios Makris v.\u00a0Greece, no. 55135/10, \u00a7 36, 9 March 2017; see also Lacroix, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044).",

That being said, the vulgar nature of an expression is not decisive in itself when it is used merely for stylistic effect (see Nadtoka, cited above, \u00a7 46). Moreover, the use of certain expressions which, to all intents and purposes, were designed to attract the public\u2019s attention cannot in itself raise an issue under the Court\u2019s case-law (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0145; see also Flinkkil\u00e4 and Others v.

Nor is the use of vulgar phrases, in itself, decisive in the assessment of an offensive expression as it may well serve merely stylistic purposes. For the Court, style constitutes part of the communication as the form of expression and is as such protected together with the content of the expression (see Uj v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a023954/10, \u00a7 20, 19 July 2011; see also, mutatis mutandis, Jim\u00e9nez Losantos v.

However, according to the Court\u2019s established case-law, a distinction has to be drawn between statements of fact and value judgments. While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7\u00a046, Series\u00a0A no. 103; McVicar v. the United Kingdom, no. 46311/99, \u00a7\u00a083, ECHR 2002III; Gorelishvili v.

The Court has thus raised the lack of distinction between facts and value judgments in several cases (see OOO Izdatelskiy Tsentr Kvartirnyy Ryad v. Russia, no. 39748/05, \u00a7\u00a044, 25\u00a0April 2017; Reichman v. France, no. 50147/11, \u00a7 72, 12\u00a0July 2016; Paturel v.

Austria, 26\u00a0April 1995, \u00a7 36, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0313). In the present case, even though I agree with most of the considerations of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment, I would nevertheless point out that the domestic decisions appear to have referred particularly to the style in which the remarks were conveyed and failed to adduce sufficient reasoning in taking into consideration the distinction between facts and value judgments. In this connection, for example, I have doubts that the applicant\u2019s remarks, which related to court cases concerning allegations of embezzlement (see in particular paragraph 4), can easily be regarded as value judgments. In my view, certain remarks by the applicant could be classified as statements of fact and would require the applicant to demonstrate their existence. Having said that, I do not see any discussion on this subject in the judgments of the domestic courts, including that of the Constitutional Court.",

Political expression enjoys a high level of protection under Article 10 of the Convention, since very strong reasons are required for justifying restrictions on political speech (see\u00a0Morice\u00a0v. France\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2015) and there is little scope under Article\u00a010\u00a0\u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on speech which, like the speeches in the instant case, is political in nature (see Rashkin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a069575/10, \u00a7\u00a018, 7 July 2020, not yet final).",

If the domestic courts\u2019 decisions and the present judgment had entered into a discussion and assessed the substance of the applicant\u2019s statements after applying the distinction between facts and value judgments in their reasoning, I doubt that my conclusion would have been the same as to whether the boundaries of the protection afforded by Article 10 were exceeded.",
