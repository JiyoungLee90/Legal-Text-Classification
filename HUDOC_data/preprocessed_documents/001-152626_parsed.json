The Government adduced no evidence in support of their submission to the effect that considerable improvements in Prison No. 13 had taken place during recent years. In such circumstances, the Court considers that there are no reasons to depart from the conclusions reached in Hadji v. Moldova (nos. 32844/07 and 41378/07, \u00a7 20, 14 February 2012). The Court thus considers that the hardship endured by the applicant during her detention between July 2010 and July 2014 went beyond the unavoidable level of hardship inherent in detention and reached a threshold of severity contrary to Article\u00a03 of the Convention. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.",
