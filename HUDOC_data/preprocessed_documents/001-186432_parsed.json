Officer Ger. stated that in September 2004 he had participated in a special operation in the Elbrusskiy District together with officer K. and other UBOP officers. On one of those days he had come to the UBOP in Nalchik. There had been a lot of people outside the UBOP building. Some men in the crowd had asked him to find out whether Rasul Tsakoyev was being detained at the UBOP. He had searched for Mr\u00a0Tsakoyev in the UBOP and, not having found him, had told the men so. Doctor K., who had examined Rasul Tsakoyev upon his admittance to the emergency ward of the Republican Clinical Hospital, stated that during the examination Mr Tsakoyev had only said that he ached all over but had given no details of what had happened to him.

Mr Tsakoyev had been detained on several occasions prior to that and those arrests showed the likelihood of a new arrest. The press release issued by the KabaradinoBalkaria Ministry of the Inteior published by the local newspaper stated that some residents of Khasanya village had been arrested between 27 and 29 September 2004; however, the authorities had not submitted the list of those persons to prove that Rasul Tsakoyev had not been one of those mentioned (see paragraph 15 above). Mr M.T. had informed the investigators that Rasul Tsakoyev had told him shortly before his abduction on 27 September 2004 that he had been followed by the police, which was not disputed by the Government (see paragraphs\u00a08 and\u00a0110 above).

The police officers questioned by the investigators did not deny that he was detained on the premises of the UBOP, but rather vaguely stated that they did not recall whether he had been or not (see paragraphs 48 and 50 above).",

In response, the police investigator Kh. K. questioned Mr\u00a0Tsakoyev at the hospital on the same date and obtained the information about the possible perpetrators of his abduction and ill-treatment (see paragraph 46 above). Despite having this information, the authorities neither examined the crime scene at the UBOP building nor immediately questioned the police officers from the UBOP unit who could have been involved in the incident as alleged by the applicants and Mr Tsakoyev. Moreover, it took the investigators more than a week after this information was obtained \u2012 and only following the death of Mr Tsakoyev \u2012 to initiate the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 29 above). Furthermore, despite the applicants\u2019 and the witnesses\u2019 consistent allegations of the involvement of UBOP officers in the abduction and torture of Mr Tsakoyev at the police station (see paragraphs 30-44, 65, 67 and 95 above), the investigators never took any steps such as a crime scene examination or questioning the ambulance doctors who allegedly visited Mr Tsakoyev during his detention there, to verify this information. It is noteworthy that the investigators\u2019 refusal to initiate a criminal case against the police officers was taken in the absence of any evidence other than the statements of the very police officers who could have been implicated in the events. Their statements were not corroborated by any other evidence (see, for example, paragraphs 89 and 95-96 above), a fact which was subsequently criticised by the supervising prosecutors and, most importantly, the domestic courts, but to no avail (see paragraphs\u00a098102 above). In the light of the foregoing, the Court cannot but agree with the findings of the domestic courts concerning the shortcomings of the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Rasul Tsakoyev\u2019s death.",
