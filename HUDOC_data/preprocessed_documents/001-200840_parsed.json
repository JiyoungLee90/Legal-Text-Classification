The Court reiterates that the current two-layer review procedure under Article 30.12 of the CAO is, as a rule, not considered a remedy to be exhausted before lodging an application with the Court, and is usually not taken into account for the purpose of the six-month rule under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Smadikov, cited above). However, the Court does not need to determine whether the above consideration signifies that Article 6 of the Convention is inapplicable to such proceedings, which may, indeed, result in a redetermination of the charge against the defendant.",

It was up to the privately retained representative to arrange to be present at the hearing on time and comply with the applicable formal requirements, such as a formal adjournment request or a written authority form. In addition, the Court observes that the representative lodged a statement of appeal and that the appellate court proceeded to a full re-examination of the case against the applicant, which included hearing witnesses.
