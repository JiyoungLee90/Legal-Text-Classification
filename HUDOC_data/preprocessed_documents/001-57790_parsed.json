In fact the two courts before which the case came found the application admissible inasmuch as, in assessing whether there had been a fault attributable to the public authorities, they ruled on the merits of the case (see, mutatis mutandis, the Neves e Silva judgment, cited above, Series A no. 153-A, p. 14, para. 37).",

The present case fell within a class of activities in which the State intervened as the holder of the public authority; there was no analogy with the Baraona v.  and Neves e Silva cases (judgments of 8 July 1987 and 27 April 1989). The Commission\u2019s case-law clearly excluded taxation and the related area of tax concessions from the field of private law; the granting of preferential postal rates concerned the relationship between consumers and a public administrative service - and not an industrial and commercial one -, which was a public law matter. Finally, the State\u2019s liability in relation to private individuals for the application of rules in the spheres of taxes and postal charges fell outside the scope of civil law principles in  and could not be classified as \"civil\".
