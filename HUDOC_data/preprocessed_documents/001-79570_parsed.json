The court did not consider the applicant's detention for some four hours and his handcuffing during this period of time as excessive either.

They stressed that ex ante there was reason to assume that the applicant was a very dangerous person who was furthermore experienced in hand-to-hand combat. Moreover, the applicant had confronted the intervening police officers while holding a knife. The statement of a participating officer before the Independent Administrative Panel indicated that the applicant had been informed about the reasons of the police intervention at its very beginning. As regards the alleged blindfolding during the strip search, the Government pointed out that the applicant had alluded to his blindfolding for the first time in his complaint with the Independent Administrative Panel but had not mentioned it as a reason for his complaint. Therefore neither the Independent Administrative Panel nor the  had to dwell on this issue. In any event, the strip search had lasted only for some minutes so that an eventual blindfolding happened during a very short time. Nor could it be established that a police officer had actually pressed his knee against the applicant's neck while he was lying on the ground. Furthermore, the applicant had admitted that he could \u2013 albeit with difficulty \u2013 watch the police officers during the search of his house which indicates that no pressure had been placed on his neck. In the view of the background of the intervention and its relatively short duration it could be assumed that the police officers proceeded with utmost care until they could be sure that the applicant would not attempt an act of violence or try to escape. They made efforts not to tear the applicant's clothes during the strip search, did not cause any disorder in the applicant's flat and brought him back home after his release. As regards the applicant's complaint about the handcuffing, the Government pointed out that the handcuffs were covered when he was taken to the police car. In the light of the massive reproaches against the applicant, his interrogation lasting three hours did not appear excessive either. The Government concluded that the intervention did not reach the minimum threshold of Article 3 of the Convention.",

He argued that the fact that he was blindfolded while being strip-searched was part of his complaint before the Independent Administrative Panel which, in any event, had to establish the relevant facts ex officio. The applicant further contested that the police intervention could be regarded as proportionate. He pointed out that he had remained calm and cooperative since the very beginning of the police intervention and had not offered any resistance. Even if the intervening officers had to assume in the beginning that they had to face a dangerous and violent person, they could convince themselves swiftly of the contrary as he was overwhelmed without any difficulties. In the view of his calm behaviour, the quantitative superiority of the police officers and the fact that he was obviously unarmed his being handcuffed during four hours was excessive. This was even more humiliating for him as during all this time he had to remain in his stained clothes. Furthermore, it is not discernable why it was necessary to undress him completely: in order to search for firearms simple patting would have been sufficient. Stripping by six police officers after being laid on a table was clearly humiliating. The applicant finally complains about the fact that the Austrian authorities did not even deal with his allegations that he had been threatened to be \u201cpicked off\u201d.",

Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2000-IV). Treatment has been considered \u201cdegrading\u201d when it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their physical or moral resistance (see\u00a0Hurtado v. Switzerland, Commission's report of 8 July 1993, Series A no.\u00a0280, p. 14, \u00a7 67), or when it was such as to drive the victim to act against his will or conscience (see, for example, Denmark, Norway, Sweden\u00a0and the Netherlands v. Greece (\u201cthe Greek case\u201d), nos. 3321/67 et al., Commission's report of 5 November 1969, Yearbook 12, p. 186; Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2001-III). Furthermore, in considering whether treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, one of the factors which the Court will take into account is the question whether its object was to humiliate and debase the person concerned, although the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of violation of Article 3 (see Raninen v. Finland, judgment of 16\u00a0December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VIII, pp. 2821-22, \u00a7 55; Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a068 and 74, ECHR\u00a02001-III; Price, cited above, \u00a7 24). In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment (see Labita, cited above, \u00a7 120).",

In this context, the Court finds that the intervention of six specially equipped, masked, police officers does not in itself raise an issue under Article\u00a03 of the Convention. Furthermore, the Court does not find that in the light of these circumstances the applicant's handcuffing during all the time of his arrest \u2013 some four hours \u2013which did not entail public exposure and had not caused any physical injuries or long-term effects on the applicant's mental state attained the threshold of Article 3 (see mutatis mutandis Raninen v.

However, these facts were disputed by the police officers in the domestic proceedings and neither the domestic courts nor the Government made any conclusive statement on that issue. There being no further information before the Court, the question of whether the applicant had in fact been subjected to the described treatment remains a matter for speculation and assumption. Accordingly, the Court cannot establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that the impugned treatment allegedly contrary to Article 3 of the Convention had actually taken place (see mutatis mutandis Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, pp. 64-65, \u00a7 161). Furthermore, the Court finds that the domestic authorities by questioning the police officers in the domestic proceedings carried out sufficient investigation in this matter and, therefore, no issue arises under the procedural aspect of Article\u00a03 either (see mutatis mutandis Boicenco v. Moldova, no. 41088/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012027, 11 July 2006)",

The Court notes that it has already had occasion to apply the principles of Article 3 of the Convention set out above in the context of strip and intimate body searches. A search carried out in an appropriate manner with due respect for human dignity and for a legitimate purpose (see mutatis mutandis, Yankov v. Bulgaria, no. 39084/97, \u00a7\u00a7166-67, ECHR 2003-XII where there was no valid reason established for the shaving of the applicant prisoner's head) may be compatible with Article 3. However, where the manner in which a search is carried out has debasing elements which significantly aggravate the inevitable humiliation of the procedure, Article 3 has been engaged: for example, where a prisoner was obliged to strip in the presence of a female officer, his sexual organs and food touched with bare hands (Vala\u0161inas v. , no. 44558/98, \u00a7 117, ECHR 2001VIII) and where a search was conducted before four guards who derided and verbally abused the prisoner (Iwa\u0144czuk v. Poland, no. 25196/94, \u00a7 59, 15\u00a0November 2001). Similarly, where the search has no established connection with the preservation of prison security and prevention of crime or disorder, issues may arise (see, for example, Iwa\u0144czuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59 where the search of the applicant, a remand prisoner detained on charges of non-violent crimes, was conducted on him when he wished to exercise his right to vote; Van der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62, ECHR 2003-II, where the strip-searching was systematic and long term without convincing security needs). Finally, in a case concerning the strip search of visitors to a prisoner which had a legitimate aim but had been carried out in breach of the relevant regulations, the Court found that this treatment did not reach the minimum level of severity prohibited by Article 3 but was in breach of the requirements under Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Wainwright v. the United Kingdom, no. 12350/04, 20 September 2006).",

However, no such argument has been adduced to show that the strip search was necessary and justified for security reasons. The Court notes in this regard that the applicant, who was already handcuffed was searched for arms and not for drugs or other small objects which might not be discerned by a simple body search and without undressing the applicant completely.",

Bearing in mind that the applicant was reported to be trained in hand-to-hand combat and \u201cup to anything\u201d, he might easily have acted violently, even though he was handcuffed. Thus, frisking him would have been a clearly inadequate measure. A strip search therefore remained as the only realistic option.
