The greatest number of casualties has been recorded in the governorate of Rural Damascus, followed by Aleppo, Homs, Idlib, Dera\u2019a and Hama governorates. While men (both fighters and civilians) account for the highest number of deaths, women and children are reported to account for one quarter of all civilian deaths. As a result of the conflict, the deterioration of Syria\u2019s healthcare system has reportedly led to hundreds of thousands of ordinarily preventable deaths from chronic diseases, premature deaths due to normally nonfatal infectious diseases, neonatal problems and malnutrition. In addition, over one million people have reportedly been wounded as a direct result of the conflict, often leading to long-term disabilities, while many more are suffering from the psychological consequences of having been witness to violence, the loss of family members, displacement and deprivation. ...",

A particular and deepening feature of the conflict is that different parties to the conflict frequently impute a political opinion to larger groups of people, including families, tribes, religious or ethnic groups or whole towns, villages or neighbourhoods, by association. As such, members of a larger entity, without individually being singled out, become the targets for repercussions by different actors, including government forces, ISIS, and anti-government armed groups, for reason of real or perceived support to another party to the conflict. According to consistent reports, whole communities which are perceived to be holding a particular political opinion or affiliation in relation to the conflict are targeted by aerial bombardments, shelling, siege tactics, suicide attacks and car bombs, arbitrary arrest, hostage-taking, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and extra-judicial executions. The perception of sharing a political opinion or affiliation in relation to the conflict is often based on little more than an individual\u2019s physical presence in a particular area (or the fact that he/she originates from a particular area), or his/her ethnic, religious or tribal background. The risk of being harmed is serious and real, and in no way diminished by the fact that the person concerned may not be targeted on an individual basis. ...",

Nevertheless, the Court would adopt such an approach only in the most extreme cases of general violence, where there is a real risk of ill-treatment simply by virtue of an individual being exposed to such violence on return (see N.A. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, \u00a7 115, 17\u00a0July 2008).\u201d",

There is nothing to suggest that this provision was not sufficiently clear and precise or that it was not properly interpreted and applied in the majority of cases (see, however, Muminov v.

The Government submitted that the applicant had been prosecuted for an offence that he had committed in 2012. It is true that the first-instance court stated that the penalty of administrative removal was optional. However, the appeal court corrected that view, finding that the penalty for the offence of which the applicant had been convicted was a fine with administrative removal (see paragraph 12 above). As clearly stated by the appeal court in the applicant\u2019s CAO case (see paragraph 12 above), the applicant was convicted under Article\u00a018.8 \u00a7\u00a01.1 of the CAO that was introduced into the CAO in 2013 and provided for two mandatory penalties: a fine and administrative removal. So, the Court is not convinced that the courts had an opportunity to take into account arguments relating to Articles\u00a02 and 3 of the Convention when imposing the sentence and thus to afford redress. In other words, the Court has no reason to consider on the basis of the material made available to it in the present case that it was open to the court to dispense with the penalty of removal on the strength of arguments relating to Article 2 or 3 of the Convention. Therefore, at the time, as the applicant was found guilty of the offence, the court had no choice but to impose that penalty, irrespective of the validity of the arguments relating to Article 2 or 3 of the Convention (see, by way of comparison, Gablishvili v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a039428/12, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049-53 and \u00a7\u00a7\u00a056-57, 26\u00a0June 2014, and Alim v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a039417/07, \u00a7\u00a095, 27\u00a0September 2011, which dealt with complaints under Article 8 of the Convention).",

The Court has taken note of the position expressed by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 38 above) and has not been given sufficient reason to rule out that the temporary asylum procedure was, in theory, capable of a thorough assessment of the risks arising under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention. In fact, the Court has taken note of the typical situations for granting temporary asylum as listed by the District Court in its judgment of 9\u00a0December 2015 in the applicant\u2019s case, albeit without reference to any relevant international or domestic material (see paragraph 21 above). It is conceivable that the risk arising in relation to the context of ongoing grave hostilities in a foreigner\u2019s home country could fall within the scope of one of the situations listed.

The Court also reiterates that deprivation of liberty under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention must conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. The notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond a lack of conformity with national law, so that deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary, and therefore contrary to the Convention. To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the grounds of detention relied on by the Government, the place and conditions of detention must be appropriate, and the length of the detention must not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Saadi v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013229/03, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2008; and Rustamov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a011209/10, \u00a7 150, 3 July 2012, with further references).",

With a view, however, to helping the respondent State fulfil its obligations under Article 46, the Court may seek to indicate the type of individual and/or general measures that might be taken in order to put an end to the situation it has found to exist (see Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a036760/06, \u00a7 255, 17 January\u00a02012; Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a010249/03, \u00a7 148, ECHR 2009; and Broniowski v.

The Court has also concluded that the applicant\u2019s continued detention there since March 2015 does not comply with Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

Having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and to the urgent need to put an end to the violation of the Convention it has found under Article 5 of the Convention the Court considers that the respondent State should ensure, by appropriate means, that the applicant is no longer exposed to this violation.
