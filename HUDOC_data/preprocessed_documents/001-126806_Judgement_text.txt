The case originated in an application (no. 62930/12) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Tibor Müller (“the applicant”), on 1 October 2012.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 31 January 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Budapest.
On 25 November 2002 the applicant lodged an action for annulment of a property sale and purchase agreement with the Budapest XVIII and XIX District Court.
On 10 April 2003 the court held the first hearing and transmitted the case to the Budapest Regional Court for reasons of competence.
On 12 April 2005, after one hearing, the proceedings were interrupted. On 20 April 2005, and subsequently on another three occasions, the applicant requested the continuation of the proceedings, which were eventually resumed in 2008.
On 7 December 2009 the court delivered a decision dismissing the applicant’s action.
On 28 October 2010 the Budapest Court of Appeal, acting as a second-instance court, dismissed the applicant’s appeal.
On 29 November 2011 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s petition for review, after an examination on the merits. This decision was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 2 April 2012.
