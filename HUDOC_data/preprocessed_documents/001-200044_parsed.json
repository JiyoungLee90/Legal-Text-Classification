The Court considers that those who have responsibility for deciding on the guilt or innocence of an accused ought, in principle, to be able to hear the victims, the accused and the witnesses in person and assess their trustworthiness (see, conversely, Kashlev v. Estonia, no. 22574/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a048-50, 26\u00a0April 2016). The assessment of the trustworthiness of a witness is a complex task which cannot usually be achieved merely by reading a record of his or her words, especially when only some of those words are taken into consideration. Of course, there are cases where it is impossible to hear someone in person at the trial because, for example, he or she has died, or in order to protect the right of a witness not to incriminate himself or herself (see Craxi v. Italy (no. 1), no.\u00a034896/97, \u00a7\u00a086, 5\u00a0December 2002, and Dan v. Moldova, no. 8999/07, \u00a7\u00a033, 5 July 2011). However, that was not the case here.",
