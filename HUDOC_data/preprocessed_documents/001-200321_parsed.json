In particular, the Court found that in reaction to the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Alekseyev and Others (cited above), the applicant, a well-known LGBT activist and a public figure whose social networking accounts have hundreds of followers, published on those accounts the virulently and personally offensive and threatening statements about the Court and its judges. Those statements clearly exceeded the limits of normal, civic and legitimate criticism. By publishing the impugned statements on social networking accounts accessible to all, Mr\u00a0Alekseyev sought to ensure the widest possible circulation of his accusations and insults and thereby provided evidence of his determination to harm and tarnish the image and reputation of the institution of the European Court of Human Rights and its members.

Mr\u00a0Alekseyev did not however withdraw his statements and, despite the Court\u2019s warning, published new offensive statements about it.",
