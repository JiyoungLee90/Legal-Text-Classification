For example, the District Court dealt with some defendants who had not had standing in the proceedings for several years, it held a number of oral hearings which did not result in meritorious judgment, and it failed to proceed properly with the matter between 1995 and 2009, which was also confirmed by the Constitutional Court in its first judgment. Furthermore, the Court also takes into account the applicants\u2019 generally passive attitude in the course of the proceedings and their lack of interest in the impugned litigation. In this connection, it observes that the applicants often failed to attend the scheduled hearings and they were not always diligent in defending their property rights, with some of them even failing to respond to the claim or provide any relevant arguments concerning their position.

To this end, it awards each applicant listed under points 1 to 28 the amount of EUR 500 and to the applicants listed under points 29 to 32 jointly the amount of EUR 500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",
