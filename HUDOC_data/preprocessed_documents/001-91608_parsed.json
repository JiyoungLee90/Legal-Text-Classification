The Court attaches importance to the fact that the attack occurred in connection with the applicant\u2019s attempt to enter a flat in respect of which she had obtained a court decision allowing her to occupy it. That decision was enforced with the assistance of the court\u2019s officials only a day before the event in question. The attackers also threatened to kill her if she returned.

When she was informed that the State Attorney\u2019s Office had declined to prosecute of its own motion, the applicant, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, lodged a request for an investigation with the competent investigation judge of the Split County Court. As to the Government\u2019s contention that the applicant should have brought a private prosecution against the three attackers on charges of causing bodily injury of a lesser nature, the Court notes that the act of violence in question could have been differently classified under domestic law. In her initial criminal complaint, as well as in her subsequent request for an investigation, the applicant, inter alia, alleged that the acts against her constituted the criminal offences of violent behaviour and making serious threats. These allegations were corroborated with a detailed description of the acts in question, which consisted in her being kicked and pushed by three individuals, who shouted insults and obscenities at her and threatened her, saying that she would disappear and be disposed of if she were to come back. In the Court\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s opinion that these acts went beyond the criminal offence of causing bodily injury of a lesser nature might not have been seen as unfounded. Therefore, the applicant\u2019s decision not to bring a private prosecution on the charges of causing bodily injury of a lesser nature but instead to request an investigation against her attackers on charges of violent behaviour and making serious threats was in compliance with the rules of the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning the role of the injured party as a subsidiary prosecutor.",

Furthermore, the relevant authorities did not allow the applicant\u2019s attempts at a private prosecution. Lastly, as to the Government\u2019s contention that adequate protection was given to the applicant in the minor-offences proceedings, the Court notes that those proceedings were terminated owing to statutory limitation and were thus concluded without any final decision on the attackers\u2019 guilt. In view of these findings, the Court holds the view that the decisions of the national authorities in this case reveal inefficiency and a failure to act on the part of the Croatian judicial authorities.",
