Complaints mechanisms need to be made accessible and credible; a mechanism to investigate promptly and impartially allegations of torture and ill-treatment should be put in place and be independent of the alleged perpetrators; the de facto time of apprehension should be recorded and terms of police custody reduced to international standards; temporary detention isolators should be transferred from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Justice; and the burden of proof to show that a confession has not been extracted by torture should be transferred to the prosecutor.\u201d",

In cases such as the present the Court must examine the foreseeable consequences of sending the applicant to the receiving country, bearing in mind the general situation there and his personal circumstances.

It further notes that international reports still voice serious concerns as to the human rights situation in , in particular with regard to political rights and freedoms.

The applicant's allegation that any criminal suspect in  runs a risk of ill-treatment is too general and not corroborated by any other evidence. Furthermore, his submission that his prosecution is part of a politically motivated campaign against the managers of the BTA Bank is not supported by any documents or other evidence. For instance, the US State Department, which reported on the politically motivated prosecution of Mr Ablyazov in 2002-2003, did not mention the proceedings against the BTA Bank managers in its recent report for 2009 either as an example of political repression or otherwise.

Although in the instant case, the less restrictive measure was applied to the applicant, the legal solution adopted by the domestic authorities seems to be very similar to that applied in the other cases against Ukraine concerning extradition (see, among other authorities; Svetlorusov\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 2929/05, \u00a7 58, 12 March 2009).
