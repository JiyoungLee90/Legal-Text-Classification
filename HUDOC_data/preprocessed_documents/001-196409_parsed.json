It appears to have acted on the assumption that the claimant\u2019s interest in protecting his reputation prevailed over the respondents\u2019 interest in disseminating the impugned information. Thus it did not strike a fair balance when protecting the two competing values guaranteed by the Convention (see, among many other authorities, B\u00e9dat v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, \u00a7 74, 29 March 2016, and Nadtoka v.\u00a0Russia, no. 38010/05, \u00a7\u00a047, 31 May 2016). Nor did the Town Court acknowledge that the limits of acceptable criticism were wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual (see, with further references, Lindon, OtchakovskyLaurens and July, cited above, \u00a7 46) or consider the subject matter of the impugned article, namely allegations of corruption of the mayor\u2019s office, even though there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest (see, with further references, Fedchenko v. Russia (no. 3), no.\u00a07972/09, \u00a7 64, 2\u00a0October 2018).",

It observes in this connection that none of the impugned statements was an expression of the applicant\u2019s own thoughts, but part of N.K.\u2019s interview. The Court has already had occasion to state that punishing a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be contemplated unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so (see, with further references, Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s v. France [GC], no.\u00a040454/07, \u00a7\u00a0142, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). A general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press\u2019s role of providing information on current events, opinions and ideas (see Thoma v.\u00a0Luxembourg, no.\u00a038432/97, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2001III). However, the domestic courts dealing with A.V.\u2019s defamation claims paid no heed to the fact that the statements had not emanated from the applicant but had been clearly identified as someone else\u2019s (see Godlevskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no. 14888/03, \u00a7 45, 23 October 2008).",

In the Court\u2019s view, the fact that the domestic courts did not provide \u201cparticularly strong reasons\u201d for an interference that seriously hampered a contribution by the press to a discussion of matters of public interest (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0142) is sufficient to conclude that they examined A.V.\u2019s defamation claims against the applicant by applying standards which were not in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 of the Convention (see Cheltsova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a092).",

Indeed, if the balancing exercise had been carried out by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for theirs (see Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0198). However, in the absence of such a balancing exercise at national level, it is not incumbent on the Court to perform a full proportionality analysis. Faced with the domestic courts\u2019 failure to provide relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the interference in question, the Court finds that they cannot be said to have \u201capplied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 of the Convention\u201d or to have \u201cbased themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts\u201d (see, with further references, Terentyev, cited above, \u00a7 24).

There is no exception.\u00a0It is not enough for the Court to declare a violation or to state that the domestic courts have not provided relevant and sufficient reasons, because in order to perform this evaluation and reach a conclusion, the Court must first carry out its own analysis and interpretation of what the domestic courts have already done and also conduct the proportionality test.
