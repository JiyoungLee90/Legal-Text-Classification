As to the necessity for the interference in a democratic society, the Government pointed out that the impugned measure responded to a pressing social need, that it was limited in time and could not be automatically extended. In their applications for travel documents and the ensuing judicial proceedings, the applicants did not refer to sufficiently specific, objective and valid grounds for leaving Russia. As regards the applicant Mr Vlasov, the Government submitted that he had been twice convicted of smuggling, that is to say of an activity connected with crossing the State border, and that there was accordingly a risk of reoffending. The restriction on his right to leave Russia was of a short duration, it applied in the period between 14\u00a0January 2009 and 20 March 2010, a total of one year and four months.

In cases where the travel ban was the consequence of the applicant\u2019s status as a convicted and not yet rehabilitated offender, the Court did not consider that such a general and almost automatic restriction could be regarded as necessary (see Milen Kostov v.

They thus failed to carry out the requisite assessment of the proportionality of the restriction of the applicants\u2019 right to travel abroad and to provide justification for it (compare Milen Kostov, \u00a7 17, and Nalbantski, \u00a7 67, both cited above). In particular, they gave no explanation why they believed that the travel ban was conducive to the applicants\u2019 rehabilitation or why a short-term absence on a trip abroad should have prevented Mr Benyash\u2019s from complying with the obligation to report twice a month to the probation authority.

Once satisfied that the prerequisites under section 15(4), namely conviction and lack of rehabilitation, were in place, the courts pronounced the travel ban to be lawful (see paragraphs 11, 12 and 17 above). They did not make any genuine attempt to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Vlasov to justify the need to go abroad (see the Moscow City Court\u2019s decision in paragraph 12 above), or to assess whether the restrictions on the applicants\u2019 right to leave Russia were a proportionate measure and whether they struck a fair balance between the public interest and the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of movement. Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual\u2019s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the circumstances (see Nalbantski, Sarkizov and Others and Milen Kostov, all cited above). In these circumstances, in the absence of reasons and proper judicial review of the question of proportionality by the domestic authorities, the Court cannot speculate as to whether or not there were grounds that could have justified the travel ban. The alleged risk of reoffending in the case of Mr Vlasov, to which the Government referred, was not mentioned in any form in the domestic decisions and was cited for the first time in the proceedings before this Court.",
