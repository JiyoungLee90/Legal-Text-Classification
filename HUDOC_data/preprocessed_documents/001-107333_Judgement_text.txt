The case originated in an application (no. 54191/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Estonian national, Ms Vaike Raudsepp (“the applicant”), on 29 November 2007.
The Estonian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Kuurberg, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the length of the administrative court proceedings to which she had been a party had been excessive. In substance, she also complained of the lack of an effective domestic remedy in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings (Article 13 of the Convention).
On 10 February 2009 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
On 1 February 2011 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1 of the Rules of Court) and the above application was assigned to the newly composed First Section.
The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in .
The applicant had been a tenant of a municipal apartment in  since 1968.
By a decision of the Tallinn City Commission for the Return and Compensation of Unlawfully Expropriated Property (“the City Commission” – Õigusvastaselt võõrandatud vara tagastamise ja kompenseerimise Tallinna linnakomisjon) of 21 November 1994, S. was recognised as entitled under property reform legislation to have the ownership of the block of flats including the applicant’s apartment, being previously nationalised property, returned.
On 2 February 1995 the applicant lodged an application with the municipal authority to be given the opportunity to become owner of the apartment through the privatisation process being conducted under the Privatisation of Dwellings Act (Eluruumide erastamise seadus).
On 28 July 1995 the Tallinn City Government decided to return the property to S., who on 1 September 1999 sold it to a private limited company, C.
The applicant lodged a complaint with the Central Commission for the Return and Compensation of Unlawfully Expropriated Property (Õigusvastaselt võõrandatud vara tagastamise ja kompenseerimise keskkomisjon) after having discovered certain archived documents, on the basis of which she concluded that the property should not have been returned to S. By a decision of the Central Commission of 16 December 1999 the matter was referred to the Tallinn City Commission for fresh examination.
On 28 August 2000, after having reconsidered the case, the City Commission found that the new evidence did not warrant a different conclusion and therefore confirmed its earlier decision.
The applicant lodged a complaint with the , which on 26 January 2001 declared the decision of the City Commission unlawful for lack of reasoning.
On 19 March 2001 the City Commission invalidated its decision of 21 November 1994 and took a new decision. Having assessed the evidence, including the additional evidence presented by the applicant, it once again recognised S. as the person entitled to the disputed property under property reform legislation.
Subsequently, the applicant brought a civil suit against the City of , claiming damages for the lost opportunity to seek ownership of the disputed apartment through its privatisation. On 12 October 2001 the Tallinn City Court awarded her 700,000 kroons (EEK – corresponding to approximately 45,000 euros (EUR)). On 21 May 2002 the Tallinn Court of Appeal quashed the City Court’s judgment, finding that the administrative and not the civil courts had jurisdiction over the matter.
In 2002 R., a public limited company which had in the meantime become the owner of the apartment, agreed to sell the apartment to a third party. On 26 November 2002 the applicant exercised a right of pre-emption in her favour and bought the property for EEK 700,000. The purchase was financed by the applicant’s daughter to whom the applicant gifted title to the disputed apartment on 25 May 2005.
On 19 June 2002 the applicant lodged a complaint against the City of  with the , seeking the award of EEK 880,000 (EUR 56,000) in damages for the loss of the opportunity to become the owner of the apartment through privatisation.
On 27 August 2002 the  decided not to proceed with the case, as the relevant court fees had not been paid. On 1 October 2002, at the applicant’s request, the  granted her exemption from the payment of the fee. It scheduled a hearing for 31 January 2003.
On 31 January 2003 a hearing was held at the . The applicant requested adjournment of the hearing as she wanted to make additional written submissions. The court granted the request and scheduled the next hearing for 27 February 2003.
On 13 February 2003 the applicant amended her complaint and also requested that parts of the City Commission’s decision of 19 March 2001 be invalidated. The second complaint was initially registered as a separate case and the hearing of 27 February 2003 was adjourned because of the applicant’s new complaint.
On 20 March 2003 the  joined the two proceedings and asked the applicant to further specify her claim. On 15 April 2003 the court decided that the new complaint had been filed within the statutory time-limit and scheduled a hearing for 9 June 2003.
On 9 June 2003 a hearing was held at the . By a judgment delivered on 20 June 2003 the  dismissed the complaint.
In order to appeal, the applicant was required to give notice of her intention to lodge an appeal. She failed to give such notice. However, she subsequently lodged an appeal which was considered as having been lodged out of time because she had not given the prior notice. On 21 August 2003 the  refused to restore the time-limit for lodging the appeal. On 23 October 2003 the Tallinn Court of Appeal dismissed a procedural appeal brought by the applicant against this refusal. On 29 January 2004 the Administrative Law Chamber of the Supreme Court quashed the lower courts’ decisions and restored the time-limit for the applicant to make an appeal.
On 9 February 2004 the  gave the applicant a ten-day time-limit for paying the court fee applicable to her appeal. The applicant’s request for an exemption was dismissed by the  but granted in part by the Tallinn Court of Appeal on 14 May 2004.
On 28 June 2005 the Tallinn Court of Appeal adjourned its hearing at the applicant’s request because of negotiations between the parties. The hearing was rescheduled for 3 October 2005.
By a judgment delivered on 17 October 2005 the Tallinn Court of Appeal quashed the Administrative Court’s judgment of 20 June 2003 in so far as it concerned the City Commission’s decision of 19 March 2001, declaring that decision unlawful. It also amended the reasoning for dismissing the applicant’s claim for damages.
The applicant did not appeal against the Court of Appeal’s judgment. On 15 November 2005 the Tallinn City Government lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal’s judgment in so far as it concerned the unlawfulness of the City Commission’s decision. On 1 February 2006 the Supreme Court adjourned its consideration of whether to accept the appeal for examination on the merits. The court determined that adjournment was necessary because the present case concerned matters similar to those dealt with in another case (no. 3-3-1-63-05) which the Administrative Law Chamber of the Supreme Court had referred to the plenary session of the Supreme Court on 19 December 2005. That case was finally resolved by the Supreme Court’s judgment of 6 December 2006 (see paragraphs 45 to 48 below).
On 20 December 2006 the Administrative Law Chamber of the Supreme Court decided to accept the appeal by the Tallinn City Government in the case concerning the applicant and on 1 March 2007 it decided to refer the case to the full panel of the Administrative Law Chamber.
On 23 March 2007 the Administrative Law Chamber dismissed the applicant’s request for an oral hearing.
On 19 June 2007 the Administrative Law Chamber decided to adjourn the proceedings in the case concerning the applicant pending the outcome of another case (no. 3-3-2-1-07) which had been referred to the plenary session of the Supreme Court on the same date. In the latter case Supreme Court’s judgment was delivered on 10 March 2008 (see paragraphs 52 and 53 below).
By a judgment of 14 May 2008 the Administrative Law Chamber of the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal by the Tallinn City Government in the case concerning the applicant and upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment.
Section 7(2-1) of the State Liability Act (Riigivastutuse seadus), which entered into force on 18 November 2006, provides that a person may claim compensation for damage caused by the unlawful acts of or failure to act by a public authority in the event that the European Court of Human Rights has found that his or her rights were violated, the violation was significant and no other remedies were available. Individuals who have lodged applications with the European Court of Human Rights regarding a similar matter or who have the right to lodge such applications are also entitled to claim compensation.
Section 7(3) provides that the above provision applies to direct pecuniary damage and loss of income.
On 27 January 2011 the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu) adopted an act whereby the Code of Civil Procedure (Tsiviilkohtumenetluse seadustik) was amended so as to provide for the opportunity for parties to such proceedings to request the expedition of the court proceedings. These provisions also apply to administrative court proceedings. The amendments entered into force on 1 September 2011.
By judgments of 21 May 2008 (case no. 3-07-1430) and 27 October 2008 (case no. 3-07-1129) the Tallinn Court of Appeal made awards to complainants who had been suspended from public service during criminal proceedings against them. The damage sustained by the complainants consisted of salary not received and the awards were made under section 16 of the State Liability Act, which provided for compensation, in certain cases, for pecuniary damage caused by a lawful administrative measure which restricted the fundamental rights of a person in a disproportionate manner.
By a decision of 30 December 2008 (case no. 3-4-1-12-08) the Constitutional Review Chamber of the Supreme Court dealt with a complaint concerning the length of criminal proceedings. It rejected the complaint, considering that the complainant could have had recourse to another effective remedy. The Supreme Court held:
“25.  In the examination of [the complainant’s] request for compensation for the damage caused by the violation of fundamental rights, the Chamber agrees with the opinion expressed in the written opinions of the parties to the proceedings that [the complainant] can demand compensation for damage in an administrative court on the bases and pursuant to the procedure established by the State Liability Act.”
The above decision of the Supreme Court is extensively quoted in the case of Malkov v. Estonia (no. 31407/07, § 32, 4 February 2010).
By a judgment of 22 March 2011 (case no. 3-3-1-85-09) the Supreme Court, sitting in plenary session, dealt with a case concerning a claim for compensation for the excessive length of a preliminary investigation in a criminal case.
The complainant in that case had been suspected of murder. The preliminary investigation had lasted for ten years and had then been discontinued because the statutory limitation period had expired. On 14 June 2006 the complainant filed a claim seeking compensation for non-pecuniary damage with the . The  and the Tallinn Court of Appeal rejected the complaint, finding that it had been lodged too late. By a decision of 17 June 2008 the Supreme Court quashed the lower courts’ decisions and remitted the case to the first-instance court for examination. The  and the Tallinn Court of Appeal dismissed the claim. On 21 June 2010 the Administrative Law Chamber of the Supreme Court referred the case to the Supreme Court’s plenary session because of an issue of constitutionality. It found that the administrative courts had no jurisdiction to assess the lawfulness of criminal proceedings, including the question of whether the proceedings were conducted within a reasonable time. According to the Administrative Law Chamber, the matter was not regulated by the State Liability Act; the existing regulation or absence of appropriate regulation raised an issue of constitutionality.
The Supreme Court obtained, according to the Constitutional Review Court Procedure Act (Põhiseaduslikkuse järelevalve kohtumenetluse seadus), opinions from the Constitutional Committee of Parliament, the Police and Border Guard Board (Politsei- ja Piirivalveamet), the State Prosecutor’s Office (Riigiprokuratuur), the Chancellor of Justice (Õiguskantsler), the Minister of Justice (Justiitsminister) and the Minister of the Interior (Siseminister).
The Supreme Court’s plenary session delivered its judgment on 22 March 2011. It found that the State Liability Act did not provide for compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by excessive length of a preliminary investigation in criminal proceedings. It considered such a situation unconstitutional. Therefore, the Supreme Court declared the State Liability Act unconstitutional in so far as it did not provide for compensation in the circumstances in question and awarded the complainant a sum of money.
The Supreme Court also noted that criminal proceedings constituted a specific area of the exercise of public authority subject to specific regulation. It would be unreasonable to decide on the damage caused by criminal proceedings according to the existing principles of state liability, which might subject criminal courts’ rulings to review by the administrative courts. Thus, the enactment of a special regulation for compensation for damage arising from criminal proceedings was required.
Section 7(3) of the Property Reform (Principles) Act (Omandireformi aluste seadus), as in force from 2 March 1997 until 12 October 2006, provided that requests for return of or compensation for unlawfully expropriated property of persons who had left Estonia on the basis of agreements concluded with Germany were to be resolved by an international agreement.
By a judgment of 28 October 2002 (case no. 3-4-1-5-02) the Supreme Court, sitting in plenary session, declared section 7(3) of the Property Reform (Principles) Act unconstitutional because in the absence of the international agreement referred to in that provision it was in conflict with the principle of legal certainty. The Supreme Court refrained from invalidating the provision, considering that to be a political decision reserved for the legislature. It instructed Parliament to bring the provision in question into conformity with the principle of legal certainty.
On 19 December 2005 the Administrative Law Chamber of the Supreme Court referred case no. 3316305 to the Supreme Court’s plenary session, as it had given rise to an issue of constitutionality.
By a partial judgment of 12 April 2006 the Supreme Court, sitting in plenary session, invalidated section 7(3) of the Property Reform (Principles) Act. It noted that the provision had not been amended since its judgment of 28 October 2002, nor had an international agreement been signed in the meantime. However, the Supreme Court adjourned the invalidation of section 7(3) for six months, leaving Parliament time to enact the necessary legislation.
As no pertinent legislation had entered into force by 12 October 2006, section 7(3) became invalid on that date.
By a judgment of 6 December 2006 the Supreme Court, sitting in plenary session, finally resolved case no. 3-3-1-63-05, basing its decision on the fact that section 7(3) had become invalid.
In the meantime, on 14 September 2006, Parliament adopted an act whereby section 7(3) of the Property Reform (Principles) Act was repealed. The act also contained certain other provisions aimed at regulating situations affected by section 7(3) no longer being in force.
The President of the Republic vetoed the act, considering that it was contrary to the principle of legal certainty. The Parliament again adopted the act without amendments and on 6 October 2006 the President of the Republic asked the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional.
By a judgment of 31 January 2007 (case no. 3-4-1-14-06) the Constitutional Review Chamber of the Supreme Court declared the act unconstitutional. As a result, it did not enter into force.
On 19 June 2007 the Administrative Law Chamber of the Supreme Court decided to refer case no. 332107 to the Supreme Court’s plenary session, considering it necessary for the uniform application of the law.
The Supreme Court, sitting in plenary session, delivered its judgment on 10 March 2008. It dismissed an application of 12 December 2006 by K.E. for the reopening of a case (teistmisavaldus) that had been decided in 1999 on the basis of section 7(3) of the Property Reform (Principles) Act. Moreover, going beyond the circumstances of the particular case, the Supreme Court outlined its general position on handling applications concerning property reform affected by section 7(3).
