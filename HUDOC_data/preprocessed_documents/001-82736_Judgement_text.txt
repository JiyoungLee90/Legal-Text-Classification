The case originated in an application (no. 26103/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Vasile Ţiberneac (“the applicant”), on 18 June 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr Victor Marcu, a lawyer practising in Edineţ. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr Vitalie Pârlog.
The applicant complained that the failure to enforce a final judgment in his favour violated his right to have his civil rights determined by a court as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention and his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 10 March 2006 the President of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. The President also decided to give priority to the case under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court in view of the applicant’s advanced age and poor state of health.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits of the case (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1921 and lives in Cupcini.
In 1949 the applicant’s parents were persecuted by the communist authorities. Their property was confiscated and they were exiled to Siberia.
In 1989 they were rehabilitated.
On an unspecified date in 2004 the applicant brought an action against the Edineţ Department of Finances, seeking compensation for the confiscation of his parents’ property.
On 24 March 2004 the Edineţ District Court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant to pay him 97,000 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 6,284 euros (EUR) at the time). The judgment was not appealed against and after fifteen days it became final and enforceable.
On 6 May 2004 a Bailiff received the enforcement warrant.
On 28 January 2005 the Bailiff sent the enforcement warrant to the President of Edineţ County, without having enforced it.
The judgment of 24 March 2004 has not been enforced to date.
The relevant domestic law was set out in Prodan v. Moldova (no. 49806/99, ECHR 2004III (extracts)) and Popov v.  (no. 1), (no. 74153/01, §§ 29-41, 18 January 2005).
