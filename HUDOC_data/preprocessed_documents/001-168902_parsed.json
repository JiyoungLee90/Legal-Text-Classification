They explained that after the entry into force on 29 December 2009 of amendments to the relevant legislation providing a remedy for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, a constitutional complaint could no longer be lodged in respect of Supreme Court decisions rendered in proceedings for protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time.

U-IIVs-3669/2006 of 2\u00a0March 2010, which was published in the Official Gazette on 19 March 2010. The applicant company, who had been represented by an advocate, should have been aware of that. Consequently, the final decision, within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, for the purposes of calculating the six-month time limit in the applicant company\u2019s case was not the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 31 January 2013 (see paragraph 16 above) but the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 6\u00a0September 2012 (see paragraph 15 above).
