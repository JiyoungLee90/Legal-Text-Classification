In particular, the 1998 Religious Communities Act established criteria for granting legal personality which were not objective and were discriminatory, such as a minimum number of members (section 11(1)) amounting to two-thousandths of the population of Austria (approximately 16,000\u00a0persons), which could hardly be fulfilled by any potential candidate for recognition. Also, the criterion of a ten-year waiting period before a religious community could apply for recognition as a religious society under the 1874 Recognition Act was arbitrary as no good reason for such a waiting period existed.

Given the number of these privileges and their nature, in particular in the field of taxation, the advantage obtained by religious societies is substantial and this special treatment undoubtedly facilitates a religious society\u2019s pursuance of its religious aims. In view of these substantive privileges accorded to religious societies, the obligation under Article 9 of the Convention incumbent on the State\u2019s authorities to remain neutral in the exercise of their powers in this domain requires therefore that if a State sets up a framework for conferring legal personality on religious groups to which a specific status is linked, all religious groups which so wish must have a fair opportunity to apply for this status and the criteria established must be applied in a non-discriminatory manner.",

In that case I voted against finding a violation of Article 9 read alone and in conjunction with Article 14, and, for the reasons explained in my dissenting opinion attached to that judgment, I might have arrived at the same conclusions in the present case. However, for the sake of the uniformity and coherence of our case-law, I have voted in favour of finding a violation of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 9 in the present case.",
