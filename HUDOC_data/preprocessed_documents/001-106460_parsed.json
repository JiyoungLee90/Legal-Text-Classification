The Court has previously assessed cases in which similar types of \u201ccharges\u201d were in question and found that they were \u201ccriminal\u201d in nature (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v.

However, under the MOA, as confirmed by the judgments submitted by the Government (see paragraph 32 above), an oral, and possibly public, hearing would be held if the judge decided that ordinary judicial proceedings should be conducted (see paragraph 16 above). This decision is taken at the judge\u2019s discretion (see Suhadolc, cited above). There is no provision in the MOA under which a defendant may request a hearing. In these circumstances and having regard to the principles concerning the waiver of the guarantees of a fair trial (see Hermi v.  [GC], no. 18114/02, \u00a7\u00a7 73-76, ECHR 2006XII), the Court does not consider that the applicant unequivocally waived his right to a hearing. It also notes that that the applicant explicitly complained to the  about the lack of a hearing in his case (see, mutatis mutandis, Baischer v. , no. 32381/96, \u00a7 26, 20 December 2001).",

These observations by the officers were the sole basis of the applicant\u2019s conviction. The Court also notes that the entire summary procedure under the MOA was conducted by the officers at the time of the offence. Subsequently, the applicant received a payment order, which is equivalent to a conviction, with a very brief statement of facts. No written exchange of arguments was conducted before the case was brought to the local court, or later in the proceedings. The local court upheld the police\u2019s decision on the basis of the file forwarded by the police, which contained the payment order, the statement of facts and the applicant\u2019s request for judicial review (see paragraph 10 above).",
