The calls had been recorded with help from the Computer Forensics Division of the Rejkjav\u00edk Metropolitan Police; they had been scanned by the investigators, who had at the same time made brief notes about what they regarded as relevant to the investigation of the case; the investigators had been instructed to stop listening to phone calls when it became clear that a defendant was speaking to his defence lawyer and not to record what had been revealed in the conversation up until that point.

Upon a request from one of the defence lawyers, further information on the exact day Mrs S. had left the FME Board was sent to the parties.

Shortly after the appointment of the Resolution Committee, Mr K. had started working for the Committee and he had been head of its legal department from December 2008. After the Resolution Committee had been discontinued at the end of 2011 and a Winding-Up Committee had been appointed, Mr K. had taken up the position as head of the legal department of the latter committee, a post which he had held until August 2013. Mr K. noted in his statement that when he had taken the position of head of the legal department of the Resolution Committee, it had been decided that cases concerning criminal investigations and actions for damages against former employees would not form part of the work of the legal division of the Resolution Committee, because he had been an employee of Kaup\u00feing before its collapse; the same applied after the Winding-Up Committee was appointed. These cases were entrusted to other employees who reported directly to the Resolution and Winding-Up Committees. Mr K. thus stated that he had not been involved in any way in the case against the applicants or civil actions against them. He added that there had never been any contracts between him and the said committees with an incentive tied to the recovery of Kaup\u00feing\u2019s assets. Following his resignation in 2013, he had acted as a consultant to the Winding-Up Board but the consultancy agreement had not related to the present case and had not included performance-related payments. Finally, with regard to the applicants\u2019 assertion that the defence had not been notified that he had been head of Kaup\u00feing\u2019s legal department, Mr K. observed that he was personally acquainted with all of the defence lawyers in the case and had worked with three of them. Moreover, he had been in contact with two of them while head of the legal department.",

In that connection, the Government pointed out that the son, Mr K., had been an employee of Kaup\u00feing at the same time as two of the applicants were directors of the bank and that, according to his statement of 16\u00a0September 2016, he was personally acquainted with all of the defence lawyers, having studied with three of them and worked with two of them. On that basis, and taking into account the small size of Iceland\u2019s legal community, the Government considered that Mr K.\u2019s connection with Kaup\u00feing should have been known to the defence. The Government accepted, however, that the applicants had not been aware of Mr K.\u2019s consultancy agreement with the bank from 2013.",

They noted in this respect that one of the other judges initially appointed had withdrawn after an observation from the defence. In their view, the explanation provided by the applicants for not objecting to \u00c1.K. was not consistent with the defence\u2019s comment on that other judge and they also noted that one of the defence lawyers had inquired further about the date of \u00c1.K.\u2019s wife\u2019s resignation before stating that no observations would be made. The Government concluded that the applicants could not reasonably have assumed that an objection would be in vain or detrimental to their case. While considering that a failure to challenge judges may not in general be regarded as a waiver of the right to an impartial tribunal, the Government maintained that such a failure, without justifiable reasons, constituted non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.

Rather, the issue in the present case is whether the applicants, when faced with a situation in which it was arguable that a judge should be disqualified, but he was not unequivocally excluded by law, by not objecting to his participation can be said to have accepted that there were no legitimate reasons to doubt the impartiality of the court (see Smailagi\u0107 v.

It stated in that respect that \u201cwhen the domestic law offers a possibility of eliminating the causes for concerns regarding the impartiality of the court or a judge, it would be expected (and in terms of the national law required) of an applicant who truly believes that there are arguable concerns on that account to raise them at the first opportunity\u201d. A similar situation arose in Smailagi\u0107, cited above, where the Court concluded that, \u201cgiven the failure of the applicant to use the opportunity to eliminate the concerns as to the lack of impartiality ... at the relevant time ..., and thus to ensure that his rights were respected, without invoking any relevant reason for such an omission, it cannot be considered that he had legitimate reasons to doubt the impartiality of the court.\u201d The Court was therefore prevented from concluding that the alleged procedural defect complained of had interfered with the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial.",

Rather, they submit that they had reservations about making an objection as they feared that this might have negative repercussions, given that neither \u00c1.K. himself nor the Supreme Court bench as a whole had considered it necessary for him to withdraw. However, the Court finds that argument speculative and unconvincing. First, it sees no concrete grounds for fearing that the Supreme Court and \u00c1.K. in particular would have adopted a negative attitude towards the applicants merely on account of an objection to \u00c1.K. Second, it agrees with the Government that the argument is seriously weakened by the fact that a query from the defence led to another judge withdrawing.",

It takes note of the information submitted by the Government that Mr. K. was personally acquainted with all of the defense lawyers in the case and that two of the applicants had been directors of the bank while he was working in its legal department. The Court further takes note of the Government\u2019s submission that in the context of a small legal community there is little doubt that Mr. K.\u2019s position was known to the defense. Nevertheless, the Court is unable to accept that such presumed general knowledge is sufficiently certain to put the defense on notice of a potential issue of lack of impartiality of a judge and it cannot therefore agree that the applicants should have objected to \u00c1.K.\u2019s participation on this ground in order to exhaust domestic remedies, even assuming that such an objection constituted an effective remedy to be exhausted for the purposes of Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

However, they maintained that \u00c1.K.\u2019s objective impartiality was compromised on account of his son\u2019s role in three specific situations. First, in their initial submissions the applicants pointed out that the Winding-Up Committee had in January 2013 initiated proceedings in the District Court against Hrei\u00f0ar M\u00e1r Sigur\u00f0sson and \u00d3lafur \u00d3lafsson for damages on account of their participation in the \u201cAl Thani transaction\u201d and maintained that it could not be denied that the outcome of the criminal case might have a substantial influence on the outcome of those proceedings. Second, the applicants submitted that following his resignation in 2013, Mr K. had been engaged as a consultant by Kaup\u00feing\u2019s Winding-Up Committee until mid-2015, as a consequence of which he had been financially dependent on Kaup\u00feing or at least receiving payment of substantial amounts from the bank, which was the alleged \u201cvictim\u201d in the criminal proceedings against the applicants, when the case was heard by the Supreme Court and when its judgment was delivered. The defence had been unaware of the consultancy agreement and in the applicants\u2019 view the connection could not be regarded as \u201cremote\u201d as claimed by the Government. Third, the applicants submitted that the fact that Mr K. had been an employee of the bank was a sensitive matter when he was carrying out his duties as head of the legal department following the collapse, and this was underlined by the fact that he had absented himself from meetings of a committee he chaired when cases against former employees were being considered. The applicants accepted that there was no reason to doubt that Mr K. had had nothing to do with the case against them in his capacity as head of Kaup\u00feing\u2019s legal department but stressed that the crucial point was how \u00c1.K. must have appeared. In that respect, referring to the case of P\u00e9tur Th\u00f3r Sigur\u0111sson v. Iceland (no.\u00a039731/98, 10\u00a0April 2003), the applicants submitted that it was obvious that an effective defence of former managers or board members of a collapsed bank had to be ready to include whether certain practices had been tolerated and also whether or not the bank\u2019s legal department had participated in or accepted certain practices. Such a defence became extremely difficult, if not impossible, when one of the judges was closely connected to a senior employee in the bank\u2019s legal department in the years leading up to its collapse and when the offences charged were committed.",

As to the applicants\u2019 concerns regarding Mr. K., the Government noted that these related to the claim that as head of Kaup\u00feing\u2019s legal department from 2008 to August 2013 he had been responsible for managing a sizeable lawsuit against two of the applicants. They considered that Mr K.\u2019s previous position did not constitute a connection that would in itself disqualify \u00c1.K. from sitting; in the Government\u2019s view, in order for fear of lack of impartiality to be objectively justified, it would have to be shown that Mr K. was involved in or had some financial or other ties to the case and that it would have been reasonable to assume that the outcome mattered to him personally. According to the Government, it was not clear how much interest Kaup\u00feing had in the outcome of the case, if any, and even if it might be regarded as having some interest, that interest did not automatically extend to Mr K. as an employee; he was neither the owner nor the main representative of Kaup\u00feing. Moreover, he had resigned from his position around 16 months before the case was heard by the Supreme Court, and his agreement to continue to work as an adviser to the Winding-Up Committee in a specific matter unrelated to the case or other cases against the applicants was a remote connection. The Government referred to the statement from Mr K. which they had submitted and which they regarded as evidence that he had at no point been involved in any cases against the applicants, criminal or civil. Moreover, the outcome of the criminal case could not have affected him financially or otherwise. In conclusion, the Government maintained that the applicants could not entertain legitimate doubts as to \u00c1.K.\u2019s impartiality on this account. They referred in that respect to Walston v. Norway ((dec.), no. 37372/97, 11 December 2001).",

According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 must be determined according to (i) a subjective test, where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge \u2013 that is, whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and (ii) an objective test, that is to say, by ascertaining whether, quite apart from the personal conduct of any of its members, the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, among other authorities, Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7 93, ECHR 2009, with further references).",

However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality, as the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to the tribunal\u2019s impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (the objective test) but may also go to the issue of the judges\u2019 personal conviction (the subjective test) (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2005XIII). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III).",

As concerns the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge\u2019s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise justified doubts as to his or her impartiality.

It laid emphasis on the fact that the proceedings, although there was no material link between them, had been pending simultaneously, so that there was an overlap in time. Conversely, in the case of Puolitaival and Pirttiaho v. Finland (no.\u00a054857/00, 23\u00a0November 2004), the Court held that there had been no violation where the (part-time) appeal court judge in question was a partner in the firm which had represented the appellant\u2019s opponent in separate proceedings. The Court distinguished the case from Wettstein essentially on the basis that the dual functions of judge/representative had not overlapped in time and although the two sets of proceedings had been contemporaneous for a year and had been pending simultaneously before the Court of Appeal for two or three months, the judge\u2019s role as a representative during that time had been limited to drafting and signing the notice of appeal in the first set of proceedings, the case having been otherwise handled by another lawyer. In Steck-Risch v. Liechtenstein (no. 63151/00, 19 May 2005), the Court considered that the fact that a Constitutional Court judge\u2019s partner in a law firm had been the presiding judge when the case was examined by the Administrative Court did not constitute grounds to justify objective fears as to lack of impartiality, taking into account in particular that neither of them had exercised dual functions, that their relationship was purely professional without any interdependence and that there was no indication that they had shared any substantial information about the applicant\u2019s case. Finally, in Me\u017enari\u0107 v. Croatia (no. 71615/01, 15 July 2005), M.V., one member of a panel of five judges of the Constitutional Court which had dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint in December 2000 had represented the other party at an early stage of the same proceedings, some nine years before, his participation being however limited to lodging one set of submissions, responding to the applicant\u2019s arguments; he had subsequently been replaced by his daughter, who had acted for the other party until 1996. The Court concluded that there had been a violation of Article 6 of the Convention. While it recognised that M.V.\u2019s previous involvement had been both minor and remote in time, and that his dual function had in fact related to different legal issues, it placed decisive weight on the fact that M.V. had acted in both capacities in the course of the same proceedings. This, reinforced by the involvement of his daughter, had created a situation which was capable of raising legitimate doubts about his impartiality.",

Similarly, in Huseyn and Others v.\u00a0Azerbaijan (nos.\u00a035485/05, 45553/05, 35680/05 and 36085/05, 26\u00a0July 2011), a violation was found on account of the fact that a judge\u2019s brother had initially been a member of the investigation team working on the applicants\u2019 criminal case and that they had therefore been de facto involved in the same criminal case concerning the same defendants and the same criminal charges, notwithstanding any regrouping of defendants into separate sets of proceedings and formal reassignment of case numbers that had taken place in the meantime; it was also taken into account that the majority, if not all, of the main incriminating evidence subsequently used against the applicants at the trial had been collected by the investigation team prior to the date on which the brother had left the investigation. Moreover, the fact that the son of another judge had been an employee of the State Prosecutor\u2019s Office and directly subordinate to the prosecutor who had served as a head of the investigation team in the applicants\u2019 case, despite never having been assigned to work on the case, and however insignificant and remote the link of the judge with the prosecution might have been considered if viewed separately, in the specific context of the case at least compounded the justified fears as to lack of impartiality arising from the situation of the first judge. Finally, in the case of P\u00e9tur\u00a0Th\u00f3r\u00a0Sigur\u00f0sson, cited above, the Court found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on the ground that, irrespective of whether the Supreme Court judge in question or her husband had any direct interest in the outcome of the case between the applicant and the National Bank, \u201cthere was at least the appearance of a link between the steps taken by [the judge] in favour of her husband and the advantages he obtained from the National Bank\u201d, so that \u201cthe judge\u2019s involvement in the debt settlement [concerning her husband], the favours received by her husband and his links to the National Bank were of such a nature and amplitude and were so close in time to the Supreme Court\u2019s examination of the case that the applicant could entertain reasonable fears that it lacked the requisite impartiality.\u201d",

Thus, unlike in the cases referred to above, Mr K. did not participate in any capacity in the criminal proceedings in which his father sat as a Supreme Court judge. Nevertheless, Mr K., in his role as head of the bank\u2019s legal department, had a connection with the civil proceedings brought by the bank against two of the applicants. Even if he had no direct involvement in those proceedings, which according to his letter submitted by the Government were dealt with outside the legal department, and even if he had no personal or financial interest in the outcome of the proceedings, his position as a senior legal adviser within the bank meant that he could at least have appeared to retain a certain formal responsibility for the proceedings. Moreover, such a perception could have been compounded by the fact that he was chairman of the committee set up to deal with, inter alia, damages claims against former directors of the bank, notwithstanding his efforts to distance himself from them by absenting himself from meetings where cases against former staff members were to be discussed. In the Court\u2019s view, the internal measures taken within the bank to avoid any direct involvement of Mr K. in civil proceedings arising out of the bank\u2019s collapse were not sufficient to make up for the fact that, for the purposes of appearances, he was formally responsible for the legal affairs of the bank at a time when it was pursuing a civil action against two of the applicants. On that basis, the applicants could legitimately have regarded him as a representative of their \u201copponent\u201d \u2013 the bank \u2013 in the civil proceedings. While the bank was not a party to the criminal proceedings and the proceedings were not materially related, the charges clearly concerned acts of which the bank was a victim and the two sets of proceedings had their origins in the same events (see, in that connection, Indra v. Slovakia, no. 46845/09, 1\u00a0February 2005, in which the Court found that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on account of the fact that the judge in question had previously sat in related proceedings, considering that it was necessary to take into account that both proceedings referred to the same set of facts). Indeed, from the applicants\u2019 standpoint they were defendants in two sets of parallel proceedings in which their respective criminal and civil responsibility for the essentially same conduct was at issue.",

Nevertheless, Mr K worked at the legal department of the bank from 2007 and was subsequently head of the legal departments of its Resolution Committee and Winding-Up Committee, from 2008 until 2013, and thus during the time of the criminal investigation and the trial before the District Court, as well as during the civil proceedings, and he continued in the role of consultant to the bank while the case was before the Supreme Court. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the family link between Mr K. and \u00c1.K. was sufficient to create objectively justified fears as to \u00c1.K.\u2019s impartiality as a judge in the criminal appeal proceedings against the applicants. \u00c1.K. was acting as a judge in a criminal case concerning transactions which had taken place within a bank with which his son had had close connections as a senior employee both before and after its collapse and which had been the opposing party in civil proceedings brought against two of the applicants while he was head of its legal department. Moreover, the fact that Mr K. was in receipt of payments as a consultant for the bank after having left its employment is an additional element which must be taken into account, especially in view of the fact that the consultancy was contemporaneous with the Supreme Court proceedings. Finally, the Court considers that all of the applicants could legitimately harbour doubts as to \u00c1.K.\u2019s objective impartiality, although the civil proceedings in question were brought against only two of them.",

Thus, although the searches had taken place in the premises of the Special Prosecutor, the information obtained could not be regarded as part of the investigation file and accessible to the applicants without limitation. Allowing the defence to conduct a search independently would have equated to giving it investigative authority which by law was restricted to the police.

In this context the Court reiterates that it is a fundamental aspect of the right to a fair trial that criminal proceedings, including the elements of such proceedings which relate to procedure, should be adversarial and that there should be equality of arms between the prosecution and the defence. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and to comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party (see Jasper v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27052/95, \u00a7\u00a051, 16 February 2000; Rowe and Davis v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28901/95, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2000II; Fitt v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29777/96, \u00a7 44, ECHR\u00a02000II; Edwards and Lewis v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39647/98 and\u00a040461/98, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 48, ECHR 2004X; and \u00d6calan v.

In any criminal proceedings there may be competing interests, such as national security or the need to protect witnesses at risk of reprisals or keep secret police methods of investigation of crime, which must be weighed against the rights of the accused. In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 \u00a7 1. Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see Jasper, cited above, \u00a7 52; Rowe and Davis, cited above, \u00a7 61; Fitt, cited above, \u00a7 45; and Edwards and Lewis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 48; see also AlKhawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 145).\u201d",

They maintain moreover that there were no technical obstacles to allowing them to conduct their own search of the \u201cfull collection of data\u201d using the Clearwell technology. The Government, on the other hand, refer to the mass of data involved and to the confidential nature of certain information, as well as to the failure of the applicants to specify what evidence might have been relevant to their defence. The issue in the case is thus whether the defence had a right to obtain access, on the one hand, to the mass of information collected indiscriminately by the prosecution and not included in the investigation file, and on the other hand to the \u201ctagged\u201d data obtained by Clearwell searches, in order to identify potentially disculpatory evidence.",

Moreover, it can accept that when the prosecution is in possession of a vast volume of unprocessed material it may be legitimate for it to sift the information in order to identify what is likely to be relevant and thus reduce the file to manageable proportions. It considers nevertheless that in principle an important safeguard in such a process would be to ensure that the defence is provided with an opportunity to be involved in the definition of the criteria for determining what may be relevant. In the present case, however, the applicants did not point to any specific issue which they suggested could have been clarified by further searches, and in the absence of such specification \u2013 which was open to them under section 37 \u00a7 5 of the Criminal Procedures Act \u2013 the Court has difficulty in accepting that a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d of this kind would have been justified. In that respect, the data in question were more akin to any other evidence which might have existed but had not been collected by the prosecution at all than to evidence of which the prosecution had knowledge but which it refused to disclose to the defence. Thus, while the Court reiterates that the prosecution authorities should disclose to the defence all material evidence in their possession for or against the accused, and indeed the prosecution in the present case had a duty under domestic law to take into consideration facts both for and against a suspect \u2013 in line with the Court\u2019s own case-law \u2013, the prosecution was not in fact aware of what the contents of the mass of data were, and to that extent it did not hold any advantage over the defence. In other words, it was not a situation of withholding evidence or \u201cnon-disclosure\u201d in the classic sense.",

These data were reviewed by the investigators, both manually and by means of further Clearwell searches, in order to determine which material should be included in the investigation file. While here again the excluded material was a priori not relevant to the case, this selection was made by the prosecution alone, without the defence being involved and without any judicial supervision of the process. In that connection, the Court recalls that \u201ca procedure, whereby the prosecution itself attempts to assess the importance of concealed information to the defence and weigh this against the public interest in keeping the information secret, cannot comply with the above-mentioned requirements of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01\u201d (Rowe and Davis, cited above, \u00a7 63). Moreover, the defence was denied lists of the documents \u2013 and in particular the \u201ctagged\u201d documents \u2013 on the ground that they did not exist and that there was no obligation to create such documents, and reference was also made to the technical obstacles to remigrating the data and conducting new searches, given the volume in question. As to the denial of lists, the Court has no reason to question the finding of the Supreme Court that under domestic law there was no obligation on the prosecution to create documents which did not already exist. It notes, however, that it appears that further searches in the data would have been technically rather straightforward and it considers that in principle it would been appropriate for the defence to have been afforded the possibility of conducting \u2013 or having conducted \u2013 a search for potentially disculpatory evidence. While it is sensitive to the privacy issues raised by the Government, the Court does not consider that there were insurmountable obstacles in that respect. It thus finds that any refusal to allow the defence to have further searches of the \u201ctagged\u201d documents carried out would in principle raise an issue under Article 6 \u00a7 3(b) with regard to the provision of adequate facilities for the preparation of the defence.",

Thus, the Supreme Court, in its judgment, dismissed the applicants\u2019 claims in this respect, referring to the requirement that \u201cthe basic condition must be satisfied that a demand concerning [access to documents] has been referred to the courts\u201d. This possibility of review by a court was, however, an important safeguard in determining whether access to data should be ensured. The Court takes note in this connection of the Government\u2019s submission that among the evidence submitted to the District Court were overviews of the seized items and their rough content. In these circumstances, and bearing in mind that the applicants did not provide any specification of the type of evidence they were seeking, the Court is satisfied that the lack of access to the data in question was not such that the applicants were denied a fair trial overall.",

In particular, it was likely that they would have confirmed that the company owned by Al Thani was the sole owner of the shares in Kaup\u00feing, contrary to the prosecution\u2019s allegation that \u00d3lafur \u00d3lafsson was a co-investor. However, neither of them had been effectively heard in that connection. The applicants had never been given an opportunity to question them during the trial, and according to the applicants the attempts to hear them as witnesses had been half-hearted and insufficient. Moreover, the defence had not been invited to participate in the interviews with Al Thani and Sultan in London but had only learned of them later. In the applicants\u2019 view, the police had failed to ask them crucial questions about the nature of Al Thani\u2019s interest in Kaup\u00feing and the purpose of his investment.",

In their view, it could have been arranged for the two witnesses to be questioned by the prosecution and the defence at Al Thani\u2019s home in London or at an Embassy. Alternatively, the prosecution could have requested the District Court to summon the witnesses under section 120 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Procedures Act, or the court could have summoned them on its own initiative.

The Court notes in this respect that the prosecution did initially wish to call the witnesses to give evidence before the court but that ultimately the witnesses did not appear. However, the statements which they had given during their earlier interviews were not used in the applicants\u2019 conviction; on the contrary, the applicants claim that those statements should have been used in evidence, as they were favourable to the defence. In that light, the Court considers that the complaint relates to the right \u201cto obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on [the accused\u2019s] behalf\u201d, set out in the second part of sub-paragraph (d) of Article 6 \u00a7 3, rather than to the right \u201cto examine or have examined witnesses against [the accused]\u201d. Consequently, the principles set out in the judgments of Schatschaschwili, Al-Khawaja and Tahery, both cited above, and more recently Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 50541/08, 50571/08, 50573/08 and 40351/09, 30\u00a0September 2016), are not directly relevant in this case. The Court will therefore rely rather on the principles set out in the recent Grand Chamber judgment of Murtazaliyeva v. Russia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 150-168), which clarified the case-law established in Perna v. Italy ([GC], no.\u00a048898/99, ECHR 2003V).

The fact that Al Thani might have maintained that his intentions were bona fide was of no direct relevance to the way in which the loans had been set up within the bank, something of which neither he nor Sultan could be expected to have any knowledge. In these circumstances, the Court concludes that the request for the witnesses to be examined remained vague and unsubstantiated.",

It also emphasised that the prosecution would have to bear the adverse consequences of the lack of that evidence. Given the limited and vague scope of the applicants\u2019 request, the Court is satisfied that this was an adequate response to that request. Moreover, the Court bears in mind that the witnesses were not within Icelandic jurisdiction and could not be compelled to attend, and that they had made it clear that they did not wish to participate in the proceedings, despite having been informed informally by the Special Prosecutor that the prosecution and the court itself wished to hear them and that they could give evidence by telephone.

The Supreme Court also conducted a thorough review of the evidence in the case. Moreover, the evidence which the absent witnesses could have provided did not go to the core of the charges against the applicants: even if they could have testified that for them it was a bona fide transaction, their subjective perception of the purpose of the transactions was not directly relevant to the establishment of how the loans themselves were processed or whether the wrong impression was given regarding demand for shares in the bank.",

Consequently, it cannot be held that he raised a complaint under Article 8 in substance. Conversely, Hrei\u00f0ar M\u00e1r Sigur\u00f0sson made specific reference to Article 8 in his appeal to the Supreme Court, maintaining that his right to privacy had been violated, and to that extent it may be accepted that he raised his complaint under that provision explicitly, albeit without further elaboration. However, the Court observes that while the Supreme Court could undoubtedly have declared the telephone tapping in question to be unlawful and/or unjustified, it is less clear whether it was open to the Supreme Court, in the context of criminal proceedings, to deal with the substance of the Convention complaint that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life was not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d or not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d and to grant appropriate relief in that respect (see Akhlyustin v.

Indeed, the Supreme Court did not address the issue of private life in its judgment, referring rather to the fact that the recordings had not been used in evidence and the absence of any argument to the effect that they might have affected the investigation. While the Government do not explicitly maintain that this remedy was ineffective (nonetheless qualifying the notion of an examination of the Article 8 complaint by the Supreme Court as \u201cunconventional\u201d), the Court finds in the light of its aforementioned case-law that an appeal to the Supreme Court in the context of criminal proceedings did not constitute an effective remedy in respect of a complaint of a violation of the right to private life under Article 8 of the Convention.",

In this regard, the Court observes that Articles\u00a0228 and 232 of the Criminal Procedures Act provide that the Committee on Reopening of Judicial Proceedings can, when certain conditions are fulfilled, order the reopening of criminal proceedings that have been terminated by a final judgment rendered in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 315, and Ramos Nunes de Carvalho E S\u00c1 v. Portugal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0222). In this regard, the Court emphasises the importance of ensuring that domestic procedures are in place whereby a case may be re-examined in the light of a finding that Article 6 of the Convention has been violated. As the Court has previously stressed, such procedures may be regarded as an important aspect of the execution of its judgments and their availability demonstrates a Contracting State\u2019s commitment to the Convention and to the Court\u2019s case-law (Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a019867/12, \u00a7 99, 11 July 2017).",

Again, the underlying premise for the use of such advanced technology is, of course, that both sides are granted the fullest possible access to begin with.

This line of reasoning is objectionable on at least three grounds. To begin with, the Government\u2019s argument under this heading is in the nature of a non-exhaustion claim; not having raised such an argument at the admissibility stage, the Government is normally estopped from relying on it on the merits. In second place, it does not appear to be entirely correct factually: the applicants did file, for example, requests for lists of documents that would be found by using a certain keyword, which were rejected by the domestic courts on unspecified grounds (see paragraph 83). But finally and most importantly, this line of reasoning is inconsistent with the duty of the prosecution to provide extensive disclosure by default in cases involving large volumes of electronic investigative data, as the only way to begin to ensure genuine equality of arms.",

Secondly, it constitutes a missed opportunity to provide clear and coherent guidance to national courts and other authorities on how these intricate Convention guarantees are to be interpreted and applied at the national level. This, in my view, is one of the central functions of this Court, which tends to be undermined if all competing considerations are reflexively force-fed into a less-than-transparent meat grinder labelled \u201cthe overall fairness of proceedings.\u201d",
