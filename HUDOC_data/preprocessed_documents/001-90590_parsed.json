The protection of \u201csecurity\u201d is concerned with guaranteeing an individual\u2019s personal liberty against arbitrary interference by a public authority\u00a0(see Kemal G\u00fcven v. Turkey (dec.), no. 31847/96, 30 May 2000). The \u201csecurity\u201d clause reminds the national authorities of the requisite obligation to follow the rule-of-law safeguards and other rudimentary forms of legal protection when the deprivation of a person\u2019s liberty is at stake (see Kurt v. Turkey, judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998III, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0122-123).",

The subsequent interpretation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention has shown, \u201cwhat is at stake [under the above provision] is both the physical liberty of individuals as well as their personal security\u201d (see Kurt, cited above, \u00a7 123). Relying on the notion of \u201csecurity\u201d, the Court has found that national authorities who are competent to deprive a person of his or her liberty are normally expected to act in good faith in their dealings with the latter (see \u010conka v. , no.\u00a051564/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041 and 42, ECHR 2002I; Bozano v. France, judgment of 18 December 1986, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0111, \u00a7 55). Thus, the intention to deprive or otherwise affect an individual\u2019s physical liberty should not, in the normal course of events, be consciously hidden by the authorities (see also paragraph 58 below). The individual should be able to resort, if need be, to the available and legitimate remedies aimed at opposing the authorities\u2019 actions and preserving his or her liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Bozano, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059-60; Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and , no.\u00a036378/02, \u00a7\u00a0380, ECHR 2005III). When a person\u2019s liberty is at stake, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty is satisfied. It is essential that the statutory criminal law, as well as the authorities\u2019 formal decisions and actions, are accessible and unequivocal to such an extent that the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 is able to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Gusinskiy v. Russia, no. 70276/01, \u00a7\u00a7 62 and 68, ECHR 2004IV; Ladent v. , no. 11036/03, \u00a7\u00a7 53 and 56, ECHR 2008...; Kawka v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a025874/94, \u00a7\u00a049, 9 January 2001; Lukanov v. Bulgaria, judgment of 20 March 1997, Reports 1997II, \u00a7\u00a044). The Court has assumed that an arrest under circumstances which undermine the principles of legal certainty could, in principle, entail a breach of the right to security of person (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6calan v.  [GC], no.\u00a046221/99, \u00a7\u00a085, ECHR 2005IV).",

The applicant had come forward to be interviewed as a witness in the unrelated murder case in which his brother was implicated. In this connection the Court observes that any possible compulsion imposed on the applicant to testify against his brother was clearly incompatible with Article\u00a095 \u00a7 1 (g) of the CCP, which unequivocally excused the former from such a burden (paragraph 33 above). In principle, it cannot be ruled out that the suspicion that the applicant had committed the firearms offence \u2013 the latter being the only formal basis for his detention \u2013 could have emerged as a result of the statements made by him during that interview. However, having due regard to the relevant decisions of the domestic authorities, the Court notes that this suspicion, the subsequent charge and the reasons given for the detention were based on evidence which had already been obtained in the course of the investigation into the murder case in June and July 2003 (see paragraphs 18, 21 and 23 above). The Court also notes that the Government have not provided any explanation for this lack of transparency, firstly, as to why the authorities did not initiate the firearms case against the applicant as soon as they learnt of the incriminating facts and, secondly, as to why there was such urgency to arrest him on the very day of his voluntary appearance before the prosecution authority as a witness (see Stepuleac v. , no.\u00a08207/06, \u00a7\u00a076, 6\u00a0November 2007).",

The circumstances surrounding the applicant\u2019s arrest in the present case are all the more troubling. Thus, whilst maintaining that his cooperation as a witness was necessary for the investigation into the unrelated murder case (see paragraphs 8, 9 and 18 above), the authorities were apparently misleading the applicant about their real interest in him. The Court considers that such opaque methods may not only undermine legal certainty and, consequently, as the present case suggests, instil a feeling of personal insecurity in individuals summoned as witnesses, but they may also generally risk undermining public respect for and confidence in the prosecution authorities.",

This allegation, in the Court\u2019s view, gains credibility when assessed in the light of the reasons given by the national authorities when ordering the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention. Thus, neither the prosecution nor the judicial authorities denied the fact that, by detaining the applicant, their aim was to ensure the proper investigation of his brother\u2019s criminal case (see paragraphs 22 and 24 above). In such circumstances, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s arrest, even if formally consistent with the domestic law, was nevertheless contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, as it served to acquire additional leverage over the unrelated criminal proceedings, an aim extraneous to sub-paragraph (c) of the above provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Gusinskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07477).",

Such reasoning was not only irrelevant for the purposes of assessing the reasonableness of the applicant\u2019s detention under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention, it also circumvented the very essence of the exception under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c) of the Convention.

This period appears to be unreasonable when assessed, as the Court\u2019s well-established case-law dictates, not in abstracto but in relation to the above-mentioned irrelevant, insufficient and even arbitrary reasons put forward by the domestic authorities (see, for example, Michta\u00a0v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a013425/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045 and 46, 4 May 2006).\u00a0The Court reiterates in this regard that the right to provisional release pending trial is guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention notwithstanding the length of the detention in question. Article 5 \u00a7 3 cannot be seen as authorising pre-trial detention unconditionally even if it is relatively short (see, among other authorities, Belchev v.

When issuing the first order for the applicant\u2019s detention on 2\u00a0April 2004, three days after his arrest, the national authorities were already under an obligation to demonstrate convincingly the justification for such a measure.

After having remanded the applicant in custody for almost ten months, six months of which had no lawful basis (see paragraph 66 above), the domestic court, contrary to its obligation to establish convincingly the existence of concrete facts justifying continued detention (see G.K., cited above, \u00a7\u00a084), left the applicant in custody on the basis of a single abstract phrase: \u201cthe imposed measure of restraint has been correctly chosen.\u201d This constituted a particularly broad restriction of the applicant\u2019s rights guaranteed by Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Patsuria, cited above, \u00a7 74).",

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the individual did everything that could reasonably be expected of someone to exhaust domestic remedies (see the aforecited judgments of Akdivar, \u00a7 69, Aksoy, \u00a7\u00a7 53 and 54, and \u015earli, \u00a7\u00a060).",

Furthermore, it is not solely the public disclosure of the applicant\u2019s image, as such, which was at stake in the present case, but also the manner in which it was done and the aims it pursued. In identifying the applicant as being wanted in connection with a murder case, the authorities\u2019 action amounted to a public denunciation that he had been involved in a very serious crime. This denunciation constituted a statement of fact within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention, which, since it failed to correspond to reality \u2013 the applicant never having been formally accused or suspected of murder \u2013 was defamatory (see White v. , no.\u00a042435/02, \u00a7 24, 19 September 2006; Pfeifer v.
