They further submitted that were the criterion of impartiality taken so far as to require judges to keep records of all the parties they had previously represented or the proceedings in which they had sat in their career, this would paralyse the entire legal profession.

Accordingly, there is no reason to doubt that legislation and practice concerning the part-time judiciary in general was framed so as to be compatible with Article\u00a06. In the present case the Court notes, however, that there is no indication that there was any system in the Court of Appeal to ensure that judges were reminded of their prior involvement in particular cases or with former clients. The Court would observe that there is a risk of problems arising in a system where such matters are left entirely to the judges' own assessment, which may, inevitably, suffer from a lack of recollection of a particular instance of prior involvement. The Court's task at hand is, however, limited to assessing whether the particular circumstances of the present case disclosed any appearance of bias in the Court of Appeal's composition in the second set of proceedings.",

In Wettstein (cited above, \u00a7 47) there was an overlapping in time of two sets of proceedings in which R. had exercised the function of judge in one case, and of legal representative of the party opposing the applicant in the other. As a result, the applicant had reason for concern that Judge R. would continue to see him as the opposing party. The Court concluded that this situation could have raised legitimate fears in the applicant that Judge R. was not approaching his case with the requisite impartiality. Further, in Walston ((dec.), cited above) the time-frame was regarded as relevant when assessing the significance of a judge's previous relationship to the opposing party.",
