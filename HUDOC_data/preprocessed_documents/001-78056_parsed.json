They were heard in person at the hearing, where the applicant, who was assisted by counsel, had the opportunity to put questions to them and to challenge their credibility.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant did not specify what evidence he alleged had been obtained by the trial court of its own motion. The Court notes that the only evidence relied on in the judgment, apart from the aforementioned statements of the witnesses and victims, was a transcript of a meeting of the school disciplinary committee, at which the applicant had been present. There is no evidence that the applicant had not had access to that document before the hearing and could not contest it at the hearing. Accordingly, there is no indication of an infringement of the applicant's defence rights or of the principle of equality of arms.",
