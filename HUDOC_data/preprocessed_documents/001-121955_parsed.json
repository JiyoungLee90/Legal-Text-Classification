Additional information was requested from the health-care institutions and a radiologist in relation to the applicant\u2019s chest injury. On 12\u00a0October\u00a02006 the radiologist concluded that the applicant had four fractured ribs on the upper left side under the arm. The fractures were considered to be \u201cfresh\u201d, possibly sustained on 9\u00a0June\u00a02006. On 16\u00a0October\u00a02006 the medico-legal expert concluded that the fractured ribs constituted a medium-to-severe bodily injury causing longterm health problems of more than twenty-one days, whereas the other bruising constituted light injuries causing short-term health problems of no more than six days. The conclusion stated that the applicant himself could have inflicted the bruising to his head and the hematomas on 9\u00a0June\u00a02006, and that they may have been caused by a blunt object. The expert noted that the applicant had not been subjected to an early medico-legal assessment and it was therefore impossible to draw conclusions concerning the exact number of traumatic impacts. Nor could the expert draw conclusions about the exact manner and time at which the fractures had been sustained because the initial X-ray examination of 9\u00a0June\u00a02006 had not disclosed that injury (the report stated that the results of that examination had not been kept) and the information about it had appeared for the first time on 13\u00a0June\u00a02006. The expert stated that it could not be excluded that the fracture might have been caused on 9\u00a0June\u00a02006 because the applicant had complained of pain on the same day. Nor could it be excluded that some of the injuries could have been caused as a result of the applicant falling down against a hard, uneven surface, but it would have had to have happened more than once.",

Later, at the police station, the applicant continued to behave aggressively, kicking one of the police officers and threatening them. In order to put a stop to his aggressive behaviour, the officers ordered the applicant to lie face down on the ground. The applicant refused, so K.H. forced him to lie down. During the search, O.K. and G.L., in the presence of two witnesses, found drugs in the applicant\u2019s pocket. The decision referred to the fact that the police officers had been engaged in an unplanned operation in relation to a serious crime; that there had been a firearm in the apartment; and that the applicant had attempted to escape and that he had not obeyed police orders. Quoting section 31(1) of the Criminal Law it concluded that the bodily injuries inflicted on the applicant at the time of his arrest and at the police station were proportional to the applicant\u2019s behaviour. During the arrest and in the police station the police\u2019s use of force against the applicant had been in compliance with section 13 of the Law on the Police and no criminal liability under section 371\u00a0(2) of the Criminal Law could arise.

According to the Government, the applicant had two types of remedies available to him. Under section 337 of the Criminal Procedure Law he was entitled to appeal to the R\u012bga City Centre District Prosecutor\u2019s Office against the second decision of 20\u00a0May\u00a02009 by which the State police Internal Security Office terminated the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 37 above). The decision adopted by the above prosecutor\u2019s office could then be challenged before a prosecutor at the next level, namely the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the R\u012bga Court Region. They asserted that the applicant had clearly been aware of that procedure and its effectiveness, because in May\u00a02007 the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the R\u012bga Court Region had quashed the first decision by which the Internal Security Office had terminated the investigation into the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment. The Government contended that, as in the case of Leja v. Latvia (no. 71072/01, 14\u00a0June\u00a02011) in which the Court accepted the Government\u2019s preliminary objections in relation to the applicant\u2019s failure to submit a complaint to the prosecutor\u2019s office, in the case at hand the applicant had failed to avail himself of an effective remedy and the State had therefore been denied an opportunity to remedy the matter before it had reached the Court.",

She also noted that in most cases the decisions adopted by the State police Internal Security Office had remained unchanged because the police officers had defended each other and refused to recognise procedural mistakes. Therefore, in cases such as this, the procedure set out by the Government for exhausting domestic remedies would have been a mere formality, as had been proved by the decision adopted in the applicant\u2019s case.",

They emphasised that the outcome of the criminal proceedings were not determinative for the success of compensation proceedings. According to the Government, the Court reached similar conclusions in cases such as Ploti\u0146a\u00a0v. Latvia ((dec.), no. 16825/02, 3\u00a0June\u00a02008), Pundurs v.

They added that the threshold for awarding damages in civil proceedings was lower than the one required for establishing criminal responsibility. Concerning the effectiveness of the compensation proceedings, the Government submitted several decisions adopted by the domestic courts in which compensation had been awarded for damages sustained as a result of the unlawful actions of State officials. The Government observed that the applicant had never lodged a civil claim and thus the State had been denied the opportunity to remedy the matter before it had reached the Court.",

Turkey, [GC], 16 September 1996, \u00a7\u00a066, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV). However, there are exceptions to the rule, especially where the national authorities remained totally passive in the face of serious allegations of misconduct or infliction of harm by State agents, for example where they failed to undertake investigations or offer assistance. In such circumstances the burden of proof shifts back to the Government (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a068-69). Concerning the appropriate remedies, the Court has established that in cases of wilful ill-treatment by State agents in breach of Article 3, two measures are necessary to provide sufficient redress: a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible; and, where appropriate, an award of compensation (see, amongst other authorities, G\u00e4fgen v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7\u00a0116, ECHR 2010).

The Court notes, however, that none of the examples concerned claims resulting from the allegedly excessive use of force by the police during arrest.

Slovenia, no. 43393/98, 2\u00a0November\u00a02006, they contended that in this particular case physical force had been used against the applicant only during the course of his arrest when, in the absence of any planned operation and given the small number of police officers present, the unexpected development of the events made it necessary to use certain combat techniques. The Government relied on the fact that before arriving at the relevant address, the police had received information that a serious crime had allegedly been committed and that a victim was still in danger. Moreover, a gun-like object had been within reach of the perpetrators. The Government further emphasised that both at the place of his arrest and later in the police station the applicant had behaved aggressively and provocatively; he had not cooperated with the police and had disobeyed their orders. Relying on Spinov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a034331/03, 27\u00a0November\u00a02008, the Government considered that those circumstances had counted heavily against the applicant and therefore the Government\u2019s burden of proof that the use of force had not been excessive became less stringent.",

In this connection, the Government raised doubts about the applicant\u2019s allegations that his ill-treatment while in the police station had lasted for half an hour. According to the police reports, the police had arrived at the apartment after 7.18 a.m. whereas the administrative arrest report had been drawn up at 8 a.m. Moreover, the applicant had not raised any objections concerning the alleged ill-treatment either during his administrative arrest or when he was arrested in the context of the criminal proceedings. The Government also emphasised the consistency of the statements given by police officers K.H. and V.O. on the circumstances of the use of force against the applicant. Lastly, referring to the medico-legal report, the Government noted that it had not been possible to exclude that the bodily injuries the applicant had sustained, namely broken ribs, were not the direct result of physical force applied on the day of the incident but had pre-existed or resulted from another cause.",

France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7\u00a087, ECHR 1999). Besides, any allegation of illtreatment must be supported by appropriate evidence, in assessment of which the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0161, Series A no. 25). In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention. The Court reiterates that the requirements of an investigation and the undeniable difficulties inherent in the fight against crime cannot justify placing limits on the protection to be afforded in respect of the physical integrity of individuals (see Tomasi v.\u00a0France, 27 August 1992, \u00a7 115, Series A no. 241-A).",

This conclusion is supported by the fact that the use of force at the police station was the object of the criminal proceedings instituted by the State police Internal Security Office (see paragraph 15 above). It is undisputed that at the time of his arrest in the apartment, the applicant\u2019s behaviour could be described as belligerent (see paragraphs -19 above) and that the development of an unplanned arrest may, if strictly necessary, justify the use of force (see, for instance, Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, \u00a7\u00a030 Series A no. 269; see also Hurtado v. Switzerland, (Rep.), 8\u00a0July\u00a01993, Series A, No 280-A where the injuries inflicted on the detainee were considered proportional in the context of an arrest of members of a mafia-type organisation). The Court nevertheless notes that the applicant\u2019s complaint concerned primarily the use of disproportionate force in the police station, where he was taken after his arrest. The Court will therefore focus on evaluating all the materials of the case, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions, in order to establish and assess, in the light of Article 3 of the Convention, the applicant\u2019s behaviour and the reaction of the police officers.",

Moreover, the X-ray examination carried out a couple of hours after the arrest disclosed \u201csuspicions\u201d of a fracture, which were later confirmed by further X-ray examinations on 13 and 19 June 2006 (see paragraph 28 above).

Latvia (dec.), no. 16987/02, 28\u00a0September\u00a02010, where the applicant was shown to be suffering from a chronic illness) and no such allegations, supported by any evidence, were made by the investigation. The Court therefore concludes that the injuries, which were described as medium to severe and thus fall within the level of severity required by Article 3 of the Convention, were caused during the applicant\u2019s arrest. It remains for the Court to assess whether the force used against the applicant was in any manner justified and proportionate.",

Those who had seen the applicant behaving aggressively at the police station specified that he had been swearing, had attempted to kick the police officers and had threatened them with \u201cproblems at work\u201d. The Court puts however particular weight on the undisputed fact, supported by the testimonies of various police officers, that during the disputed events the applicant had already been handcuffed (see paragraph  above). The domestic investigation found that it was strictly necessary for police officer K.H. to apply special measures in order to prevent the applicant from absconding. However, the above findings are not supported by other evidence of the applicant\u2019s alleged aggression or any other grounds justifying the use of force as provided for by section 13 of the Law on the Police.",

None of them admitted to seeing K.H. use force against the applicant, even though it follows from K.H.\u2019s testimonies to the Internal Security Office that various police officers had asked the applicant to stop cursing and ordered him to lie down (see paragraph 19 above), after which K.H. had forced the applicant to the ground. In the course of the internal investigation conducted by the State police, K.H. denied that fact. The statements of the other police officers that when they arrived, the applicant was already on the ground, are in contradiction with K.H.\u2019s statements that he was not the only officer present at the police station during the contested events (ibid.). There are strong indications that during the contested events there was a considerable number of police officers present because they were changing shifts and at a certain point there were between seven and nine police officers present and two civilians who had been invited as witnesses during the search of the applicant (see paragraph 20 above). In the light of the controversial testimonies of the police officers concerning the circumstances of the events, and the apparent understanding expressed by some police officers that the applicant\u2019s insulting language had justified the use of force, the Court notes that the atmosphere in the police station was very likely to have provoked the police officers into acting in the way alleged by the applicant. However, the Court cannot conclude from the case file that the applicant\u2019s conduct justified the deployment of strict restraint measures by the police officers. Noting that the applicant was already handcuffed before his arrival at the police station, the police should have reacted with more restraint to the applicant\u2019s verbal insults, if any (see Fahriye \u00c7al\u0131\u015fkan v.

In addition, the Court notes that such elements of the investigation as the contradictory statements of the police officers, the fact that the medico-legal assessment was based purely on the medical documents; and the fact that the applicant was first questioned four months after the alleged events, all indicate a lack of diligence during the initial phase of the investigation. In the light of the above observations, the Court will limit its assessment to the investigation carried out after the quashing of the first decision. It will pay particular attention to the adequacy of the prosecutor\u2019s supervision of the investigation as a whole.",

The Court reiterates that the independence of the authority carrying out the investigation tasks is one of the elements to be considered, the other elements being promptness, sufficiency, and access to information (see, for example, Ki\u015fmir v. Turkey, no. 27306/95, \u00a7 117, 31 May 2005). Without elaborating on the de facto independence of the State police Internal Security Office, the fact remains that both the Internal Security Office and the human resources department are part of the Ministry of the Interior.",

In addition to the supervisory authority\u2019s lack of promptness, there are clear indications that the instructions were issued as a consequence of the applicant\u2019s repeated complaints. The Court notes that the prosecutors responsible executed their tasks not in the course of thorough and permanent supervision, but rather as a mere reaction to a complaint (Vovru\u0161ko v.\u00a0Latvia, no. 11065/02, \u00a7\u00a052, 11\u00a0December\u00a02012). Secondly, concerning the organisation of the confrontation, it appears that the applicant was confronted with those police officers whom he could name, having seen them appear as witnesses in the criminal proceedings against him, even though, as follows from the case file, it was likely that other police officers and at least one civilian were present during the contested events and could have been recognised by the applicant. Thirdly, during the additional investigation no efforts were made to clarify the contradictions in the witnesses\u2019 statements noted above.",

Seized to examine the lawfulness of the above decision, the supervising prosecutor of the R\u012bga City Centre District Prosecutor\u2019s Office upheld it, but in addition relied on the fact that the medico-legal expert had not confirmed with certainty that the applicant had already had the chest injury before his arrest (see paragraph  above). The supervising prosecutor expressed a similar argument before the adoption of the impugned decision (see paragraph  above). That decision in essence was upheld by a superior prosecutor of the R\u012bga City Centre District Prosecutor\u2019s Office (see paragraph 32 above). Disregarding the findings of the regional prosecutor\u2019s office who considered that the force used to restrain the applicant was not necessary and was in any event disproportionate or the fact that the criminal case had been remitted for an additional investigation in order to identify the perpetrators, the additional investigation concluded that the fact of injury could not be established (see paragraph 37 above). That conclusion was concordant with the three previous decisions of two levels of prosecutors within the hierarchy of the R\u012bga City Centre District Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which, according to the Government, had to be addressed in order to exhaust domestic remedies in this case. Bearing also in mind the failure to follow their instructions, the Court considers that it would be unreasonable to require the applicant to launch a \u2018second round\u2019 of appeals within the hierarchy of the prosecutor\u2019s office where the same supervising authority had already clearly expressed its opinion about the principal issue of the complaint and where there is no new evidence which could change their opinion. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that with the passage of time, investigation becomes more problematic.",

In the present case the presumption that arises from the fact that someone was taken into police custody in good health does not apply. It is not clear for me how the burden of proof was divided between the applicant and the Government. Whereas the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d imposes a burden that may be impossible to meet for applicants, it is also necessary to take into account the unavoidable limits of a most effective investigation carried out in good faith by the authorities.",

Latvia (no. 6087/03, 25 June 2013) the Court, when considering an allegation of ill-treatment by the police, was confronted with similar difficulties in establishing the facts. The reasons in that judgment state that the Court found it \u201cimpossible to establish, on the basis of the evidence before it, whether or not the applicant\u2019s injuries were caused as alleged\u201d. Therefore the Court could not find a violation of the substantive aspect of Article 3 of the Convention. I do not see any reason to depart from the approach adopted in that case.",
