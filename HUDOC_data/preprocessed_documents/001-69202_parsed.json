It follows that the Government\u2019s obligation is engaged to explain how Abdulkadir \u00c7elikbilek was killed while still in the hands of State agents.

The circumstances in which a deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27\u00a0September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, \u00a7\u00a7 146-147).",

The deliberate or intended use of lethal force is only one factor, however, to be taken into account in assessing its necessity. Any use of force must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed from that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles\u00a08 to 11 of the Convention.

It accepted such a complaint, for instance, in the case of Kurt v. Turkey (judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III), where the mother of an arrested person, who was present at the moment of arrest and was left without news of him (the prosecutor having not even examined her complaint), was considered to be the victim of a violation of Article 3 in her own right, on account of the prolonged anxiety that she had suffered.",

Turkey (no. 23657/94, ECHR 1999IV), the Court did not accept that the applicant had been the victim of a violation of Article 3, since he had not been present when the security forces had taken his brother, had not personally borne the brunt of making petitions and enquiries to the authorities, and there had not been any aggravating features arising from the response of the authorities (see \u00c7akici, \u00a7\u00a099). I note that the Commission, by a very large majority, had expressed the opposite view.",

However, he himself took numerous steps, particularly in contacting the prosecutor and the court. A week after the abduction, alerted by the police, he saw his brother\u2019s corpse, which showed particularly horrible signs of torture. In addition, the present judgment finds that the Government were responsible for the death and that their authorities failed to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances of the murder (a two-fold violation of Article 2).",

Firstly, the distress arising from a lengthy disappearance, which, incidentally, prevents a family from going through what is known as the grieving process, is probably more inhuman than rapid discovery of a murder, although grief itself may give rise to very great suffering. Secondly, the case-law takes account of the proximity of the family tie and attaches greater weight to the parent-child bond than to the sibling bond (see \u00c7akici, \u00a7 98). Nonetheless, I remain very hesitant in the present case.",
