The case originated in an application (no. 53048/10) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Igor Viktorovich Isaykin (“the applicant”), on 6 July 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr E. Markov, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 20 November 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1972 and is detained in Belovo, Kemerovo Region.
Following the applicant’s arrest on suspicion of drug trafficking, on 14 November 2008 he was placed in temporary detention facility no. 70/1 in Tomsk. He remained in that facility until 20 April 2010. He was detained in cells nos. 91, 1, 7, 55, 4, 56, 51. Each cell measured approximately twenty metres and housed, for the major part of his stay, between 10 and 14 inmates. In the majority of the cells the toilet was merely a hole in the floor. A lavatory pan was installed in three cells, in the corner, and was separated from the living area by a 1.5-metre fence. The applicant was afforded an hour-long walk daily in the recreation yard.
According to the Government the applicant was provided with an individual sleeping place, except for the detention period between 18 November and 2 December 2008. There was artificial lighting, natural and artificial ventilation in the cells; the cells were heated.
On 30 December 2009 the Leninskiy District Court of Tomsk found the applicant guilty of attempted drug trafficking and sentenced him to nine years and six months’ imprisonment.
The applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal and asked to ensure the applicant’s presence at the appeal hearing.
On 17 May 2010 the Tomsk Regional Court upheld the conviction, having heard a prosecutor and the applicant’s lawyer. The applicant was not transported to the hearing.
On 13 February 2013 the Presidium of the Tomsk Regional Court quashed the decision of 17 May 2010 and remitted the case for a fresh examination.
On 25 March 2013 the Tomsk Regional Court upheld the applicant’s conviction on appeal. The applicant and his lawyer were present at the hearing.
Domestic provisions relating to conditions of detention are described in Ananyev and Others v. Russia (nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, §§ 25-54, 10 January 2012).
If a convicted person wishes to take part in appeal hearing, he or she must indicate this request in his or her statement of appeal (Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, Article 375 § 2).
The failure of a party, who has been duly notified of the date, time and place of the appeal hearing, to attend the hearing should not preclude the court from proceeding with the examination of the case (Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 376 § 4).
If the court is unable to proceed owing to the absence of a party summoned to court, it must adjourn the hearing (Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 253 § 1).
