On the applicant’s request, the enforcement of this decision was suspended until 31 October 2006 by the Duties Office on 7 October 2005. On 22 March 2007 the applicant’s salary was attached by the Tax Authority. The applicant lodged a demurrer of execution against the decision, which was dismissed. The enforcement proceedings are still pending.
On 25 June 2002 the Tax Authority seized part of the payment which the applicant, in tax debt, had received as a result of his claim against the Company.

The applicant lodged a complaint against these impositions with the Bács-Kiskun County Administrative Office.
On 27 February 2006 the Administrative Office rejected the complaint.
On 31 March 2006 the applicant finally paid the debt. However, the Notary obliged him to pay default interest.

The applicant did not lodge a demurrer of execution against the enforcement measures.
