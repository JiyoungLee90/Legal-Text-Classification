However, when doing so, the court disregarded the applicant's pending request to have a lawyer appointed under the legal aid scheme for lodging such appeal. Later on, the Supreme Court quashed both the decision of 5\u00a0August 1999 for having been given without due consideration of the applicant's pending legal aid application, and the decisions of 29 December 1998 and 29 April 1999 for procedural defects.",

It is true that in 1986 the applicant was granted a lump sum as compensation for damage to his health and, at the same time, a monthly supplementary pension was awarded to him which he claimed was insufficient for his need bearing in mind the reduction of his life prospects as a result of the incident.
