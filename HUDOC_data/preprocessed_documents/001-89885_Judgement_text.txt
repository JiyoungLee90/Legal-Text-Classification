The case originated in an application (no. 37758/05) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Sergiy Yevgenovych Peretyatko (“the applicant”), on 5 October 2005.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 12 December 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in the Vinnytsya Region.
In October 2003 the applicant retired from military service.
On 4 December 2003 the Military Court of Zhytomyr Garrison ordered the Military Unit A-2128 to pay the applicant 3,253 Ukrainian hryvnas (UAH) in relation to his military uniform and UAH 51 in relation to court fees. This judgment was not appealed against and became final.
In April 2004 the applicant sent by registered post the writs of execution to the Berdychiv Bailiffs’ Service, which on 26 April 2004 instituted enforcement proceedings.
On 28 January 2005 the court, following the request of the Bailiffs, replaced the original debtor in the enforcement proceedings by its successor, the Berdychiv Town Military Enlistment Office.
In November 2006 the applicant received UAH 51.
On 29 December 2006 the court, following the request of the Bailiffs, replaced the Berdychiv Town Military Enlistment Office by the Zhytomyr Regional Military Enlistment Office which was responsible for the former’s finances.
The judgment of 4 December 2003 remains partially unenforced due to the debtor’s lack of funds.
