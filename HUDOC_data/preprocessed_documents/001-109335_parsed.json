The Court further observes that the applicant decided not to waive the time bar, which he was entitled to do under Italian law (see Le droit et la pratique internes pertinents, paragraph 42 [see full text of judgment, available in French only, in Hudoc]). In those circumstances, the Court considers that the reduction of his sentence at least compensated for or significantly reduced the damage normally entailed by the excessive length of criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the Court fails to see the relevance of the applicant\u2019s observations concerning the fact that the judgment of 1 March 1996 had given him a suspended sentence (see paragraph 23 above).
