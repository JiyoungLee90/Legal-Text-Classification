A\u00a0hypothetical sentence ranging from two to twelve years imprisonment must, with the passage of time, inevitably have called for reassessment of the need for the applicant's continued detention in the light of the evidence progressively obtained by the court. It is to be observed in this connection that the actual sentence imposed on the applicant, four years' imprisonment (see paragraph 19 above), was at the lower end of the applicable scale (see, mutatis mutandis, Klamecki (no.2) v. , no. 31583/96, \u00a7 122).",
