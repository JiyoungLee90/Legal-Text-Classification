Having regard to the provisions of the Russian law on service of courts summonses (see paragraph 12 above), the Court considers that the Government should have been in possession of such evidence, or at least reasons should be given why the court courier could not have had the applicant sign for the receipt of the letter. The failure on the Government\u2019s part to submit evidence without a satisfactory explanation gives rise to the drawing of inferences as to the ill-foundedness of their allegations.
