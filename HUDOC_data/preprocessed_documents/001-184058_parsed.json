In addition, the second applicant was a student and did not have any income. An analysis of the documents and expert reports included in the file showed that the annual income of S.T. and his wife, the first applicant, amounted to EUR 35,000, whereas the value of the assets acquired by the family in the preceding five years \u2013 the equivalent of EUR 300,000 in bank accounts or in cash, fifteen flats and plots of land, five garages and four vehicles \u2013 grossly exceeded their lawful income. However, referring to Decision no.\u00a0356 of 25 June 2014 of the Constitutional Court (see paragraph\u00a037 below), the District Court explained that the confiscation measure would apply only to the assets acquired after April 2012.

It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation and assess the facts. It is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts or to give a ruling as to whether certain elements were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was taken, were fair (see Arcuri and Others v. Italy (dec.), no.\u00a052024/99, ECHR 2001-VII).",

However, even though the applicant in that case had never been a party to the proceedings in which the measure had been decided, the Court considered that \u201cthe Lithuanian authorities had de facto afforded her a reasonable and sufficient opportunity to protect her interests adequately\u201d and found that there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Silickien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 50). In reaching this conclusion, the Court attached certain weight to the fact that the confiscation of the applicant\u2019s property had originated in a measure taken by the investigative authorities, namely the seizure of her assets. The Court considered that it had been open to the applicant to institute judicial review proceedings to obtain the lifting of that seizure, challenging the reasons for it and presenting evidence that those items of property had been acquired lawfully. Whilst acknowledging that seizure was a temporary measure that had no conclusive influence over the subsequent confiscation, the Court was of the view that, at the time when the measure had been ordered, the applicant could have reasonably foreseen that the seizure could result in confiscation of the property at a later stage of the proceedings (ibid., \u00a7 48).",

Therefore, the domestic authorities were not under a legal obligation to grant, of their own motion, the applicants the status of parties to the proceedings, since national law provided interested persons with the opportunity to intervene in the proceedings at any stage. Notwithstanding these considerations, the Court notes that, as in the above-mentioned case of Silickien\u0117, the confiscation of the applicants\u2019 property originated in measures taken by the investigating authorities, namely the seizure of 17 March 2014 (see paragraph 7 above). At that time, the first and second applicants \u2013 whose ownership of some of the confiscated assets was substantiated by documents \u2013 had been represented by lawyers of their choice and had been informed of the seizure carried out with the purpose of subsequent confiscation, and of their rights as provided by law (see paragraphs 6 and 9 above). As regards the third applicant, the Court agrees with the Government that her involvement in the case was not made known to the investigative authorities and could not have been inferred from any of the documents found during the searches. Lastly, the Court observes that all of the applicants were accepted as parties to the proceedings as soon as they expressed an interest, before the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 19 above; and see, by contrast, Silickien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 48, where the applicant had not been a party to the criminal proceedings at all).",

The Timi\u015foara Court of Appeal made a careful examination of the financial situation of the first and second applicants\u2019 family and, as required by the domestic law (see paragraph 35 below), confirmed the existence of a considerable discrepancy between their income and their wealth. That discrepancy, which was a well-documented factual finding, then became the basis for the confiscation measure (compare Arcuri and Others, decision cited above). The domestic court also thoroughly analysed the allegations put forward by the third applicant and found them to be unsupported. The Court observes that all arguments and requests raised by the applicants were analysed and responded to by the domestic court (see paragraphs 30-34 above).",

At that point in the trial, the domestic court decided that additional witness statements or expert reports were not necessary to decide the case (see paragraph 26 above).

The confiscation involved assets which the domestic court had deemed to have been unlawfully acquired through corruption offences committed by S.T. while in public service. Therefore, it is evident that the rationale behind the confiscation of wrongfully acquired property and unexplained wealth owned by persons accused of committing serious offences while in public office and by their family members and close relatives was twofold, having both a compensatory and a preventive aim (see Gogitidze and Others, cited above, \u00a7 101). The Court accordingly finds that the confiscation measure in the instant case was effected in accordance with the general interest in ensuring that the use of the property in question did not procure advantage for the applicants to the detriment of the community for combatting corruption in the public office (see, mutatis mutandis, Phillips, cited above, \u00a7 52).",

Secondly, the onus of proving the lawful origin of property presumed to have been wrongfully acquired may legitimately be shifted onto the respondents in such non-criminal proceedings for confiscation, including civil proceedings in rem. Thirdly, confiscation measures may be applied not only to the direct proceeds of crime but also to property, including any income and other indirect benefits, obtained by converting or transforming the direct proceeds of crime or intermingling them with other, possibly lawful, assets. Finally, confiscation measures may be applied not only to persons directly suspected of criminal offences but also to any third parties which hold ownership rights without the requisite bona fide with a view to disguising their wrongful role in amassing the wealth in question (see Gogitidze and Others, cited above, \u00a7 105, and paragraphs 38-43 and 68 above).",
