While it does not detect any obvious procrastination on the part of the courts in scheduling the hearings and resolving the parties\u2019 motions, it takes cognisance of the fact that the first-instance judgments were set aside on appeal four times for breaches of the law, with the appeal court specifically pointing out that the trial court had repeatedly made the same errors. In this respect the Court reiterates that the Convention and its Protocols must be interpreted as guaranteeing rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and illusory. The right to have one\u2019s claim examined within a reasonable time would be devoid of all sense if domestic courts examined a case endlessly, even if at the end the length of proceedings per instance did not appear particularly excessive (see, mutatis mutandis, Svetlana Orlova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4487/04, \u00a7 47, 30 July 2009).",

The fact that the domestic courts heard the case several times did not absolve them from complying with the reasonable time requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Litoselitis v. Greece, no.\u00a062771/00, \u00a7\u00a032, 5\u00a0February 2004; and Svetlana Orlova, cited above, \u00a7 50).
