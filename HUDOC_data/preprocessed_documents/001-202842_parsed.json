Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 67).",

It observes that the applicant\u2019s detention lasted fiveand-a-half months (see paragraph 10 above) (see Suso Musa, \u00a7 102, and contrast Saadi, \u00a7 79, both cited above). For the Court, this duration alone is capable of raising concerns, even in the absence of any indication that the detention took place in inappropriate conditions (contrast Kanagaratnam and Others v. Belgium, no. 15297/09, \u00a7\u00a7 94-95, 13\u00a0December 2011). During that time, the authorities repeatedly relied on two elements: the need to confirm his identity and nationality, and the need to ensure that he would be available for the asylum procedure. In the Court\u2019s view, even if those objectives were initially justified, with the passage of time it was less and less so, especially after 1 August 2013 when his asylum case was admitted for examination on the merits (see paragraph 7 above). From that time on, the applicant\u2019s asylum case was at least arguable. Yet, the measure continued for more than another four-and-a-half months (see paragraph 10 above). For the Court, that stage of the applicant\u2019s detention cannot be said to have corresponded to the requirement of close connection \u201cto the purpose of preventing unauthorised entry of the person to the country\u201d (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 74). It follows that the applicant\u2019s detention, from then on and up to the date on which his asylum application was determined on 21 December 2013, was not compatible with Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (f) of the Convention, which has therefore been violated.",
