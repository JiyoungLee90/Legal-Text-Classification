In the present case, finding that the requirement laid down in Article 514, point (e), of the CCP was inadequate, it considered that the European Convention on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments and the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons provided a sufficient basis for the validation and enforcement in Albania of the Milan Assize Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.",

Nevertheless, the State must ensure that the health and well-being of detainees are adequately secured by, among other things, providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see Kud\u0142a v.

It follows from the very nature of interim measures that a decision on whether they should be indicated in a given case will often have to be made within a very short lapse of time, with a view to preventing imminent potential harm from being done. Consequently, the full facts of the case will often remain undetermined until the Court\u2019s judgment on the merits of the complaint to which the measure is related. It is precisely for the purpose of preserving the Court\u2019s ability to render such a judgment after an effective examination of the complaint that such measures are indicated.
