In that regard the Court considers that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the alleged criminal activities of the applicant may be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings (G\u00f3rski v. Poland, no. 289043/02, \u00a758, 4 October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention. The Court accepts that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Admittedly, the domestic authorities seem not to have shown special diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. Nonetheless, the Court is of the view that the reasons given by the national courts remained \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d throughout the whole relevant period of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand.",
