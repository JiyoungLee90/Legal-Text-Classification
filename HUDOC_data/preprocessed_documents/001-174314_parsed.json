Moreover, it would be impossible for a journalist to know what would be possible or impossible to reproduce, or how many lines he could publish from a document in the criminal case file without being regarded as breaching the highly formal statutory prohibition. In the applicants\u2019 view, it was unquestionable that the relatively brief quotation of statements in press articles on judicial proceedings was something extremely common and that this situation did not usually entail prosecution. They pointed out that journalists were justified in giving credibility to information that they imparted to the public.

In their view, this provision had enabled B. and Mrs Bettencourt to obtain the judgment against them quite easily, whereas proceedings under Articles 9 and 9-1 of the Civil Code, protecting private life and the presumption of innocence, or a defamation suit in B.\u2019s case, would have failed. Mrs Bettencourt had indeed been unsuccessful in her action under Article 9 of the Civil Code. Their legal actions had thus sought to circumvent any debate on the legitimacy of the information, the reality of the facts mentioned in the impugned documents, the quality of the journalist\u2019s investigative work or the way in which the article had really been drafted as a whole.

On the other, the right of B. to be presumed innocent had not been breached because otherwise he would have brought proceedings under Article 9-1 of the Civil Code. Lastly, they claimed that section 38 did not serve to protect the authority of the courts and their acts or the impartiality of the justice system, because the right of Mrs\u00a0Bettencourt and of B. to a fair hearing was not at issue; they had access to the case file and to the same documents, with all the procedural safeguards provided for by law.

The Government noted in this connection that the impugned articles had themselves made reference to the forthcoming criminal court hearings. Lastly, the difference in solution between the decision of the urgent applications judge on 2 March 2010 and that of the tribunal de grande instance on 21 June 2010 could not be interpreted as a demonstration of the unforeseeability of the law: a decision in urgent proceedings did not by any means prejudge the solution to be decided on the merits, on the one hand, and the use of remedies had enabled a uniform interpretation of section 38 in accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law, on the other.

After noting the slanted nature of the presentation of the statements, obviously directed in favour of the prosecution case, the courts had taken particular consideration of the fact that readers were likely to believe the reported facts to be true, on account of the special credibility attached to documents from criminal proceedings and the highlighting of the testimony and identity of the witnesses. In the Government\u2019s view, the grounds given by the domestic courts in the three cases thus appeared \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d.",

It agrees with the Government that the interference in question sought, in respect of B., to protect his right to a fair hearing with due respect for the presumption of innocence. As to Mrs Bettencourt, who admittedly was not the \u201caccused\u201d in the proceedings, the Court notes that, denying that she was the weak and manipulated woman portrayed by the impugned article, she had filed submissions to be joined as a civil party in the proceedings before the criminal court, whose task it had been to assess her degree of awareness at the time when she had granted her gifts to B. The purpose of the interference therefore, as far as she is concerned, was to protect her rights, while guaranteeing the proper administration of justice, in order to avoid any external influence on the judicial proceedings. Those aims correspond to the protection of the \u201creputation and rights of others\u201d and the maintaining of the \u201cauthority and impartiality of the judiciary\u201d, in so far as the latter expression has been interpreted as encompassing the rights enjoyed by individuals as litigants in general (see Tourancheau and July, cited above, \u00a7 63).",

The articles in Le Point were published in the context of proceedings which had begun in 2007 and had received wide media coverage. As pointed out by the tribunal de grande instance, the proceedings implicated public figures whose renown in the social and political arena was well established and the Bettencourt affair already had a high profile in public opinion at the time of the publication (see paragraph 45 above). Moreover, reiterating that the public have a legitimate interest in the provision and availability of information about criminal proceedings and that remarks concerning the functioning of the judiciary relate to a matter of public interest (see Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7\u00a0152, 23 April 2015, and B\u00e9dat, cited above, \u00a7 63; see also Recommendation Rec(2003)13, cited above, paragraph 59 above), the Court observes on this point that the public\u2019s interest in being informed about this case goes well beyond the context of the family conflict between Mrs Bettencourt and her daughter, or the relations between the latter and B.",

The other domestic courts, ruling on the merits and in urgent proceedings, did not deny that the information in the impugned publications was such as to contribute to a general-interest debate. They took the view, however, that this debate, having regard to the provisions of section 38 of the 1881 Act, could be informed otherwise than by quoting from procedural documents to which the reader would attach \u201cparticular credibility and an undeniable evidential value\u201d. In the Court\u2019s view, the weighing in the balance of, on the one hand, the interests of Mrs Bettencourt and B., together with those of the proper administration of justice, and on the other, the alleged general interest justification relied upon by the applicants, could have given rise to more explicit reasoning, in the same way that the alleged breach of the right to private life was itself dealt with (see paragraphs 33 and 35 above). That being said, the Court cannot infer from the decisions in question that the national courts failed to take into consideration the fact that the publications were capable of providing clarification for the benefit of the public debate and the public interest; their dismissal of this aspect as insufficiently pertinent fell within their margin of appreciation (see B\u00e9dat, cited above, \u00a7\u00a054).",

The Court of Appeal, however, stated that the bias displayed by the articles against B. had reduced his chances of a fair trial and made it necessary for him to explain his position on prosecution evidence that had not yet been debated before a court of law.

The Court reiterates in this connection that the publication of a slanted article is capable of undermining the objectivity of the trial court, irrespective of its composition (see B\u00e9dat, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069). Moreover, while it is true that B. had specific remedies at his disposal to secure respect for his right to be presumed innocent, such as that provided for in Article 9-1 of the Civil Code, which particularly concerns the media, the Court notes that B.\u2019s case before the civil court was declared admissible and that the \u201cincriminating\u201d effect of the publication was emphasised by that court.",

Given the complex issues before the courts, as regards both the vulnerability of Mrs\u00a0Bettencourt and the material element of the offence of undue influence with which B. was charged, the publication of those documents in the framework of biased articles risked disrupting the proper conduct of the proceedings and jeopardising B.\u2019s right to a fair trial. The Court confirms in this connection that the ban provided for in section 38 of the 1881 Act is not general and absolute in nature and does not totally restrict the right of the press to inform the public, being temporary and limited (see Tourancheau and July, cited above, \u00a7 73). Consequently it takes the view that the applicants, as media professionals, were in a position to avoid such risks without affecting the substance of the information that they wished to impart.",
