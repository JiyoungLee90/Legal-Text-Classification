The Court recalls that the most appropriate form of redress is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article\u00a06 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October\u00a01984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el\u00a0v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a053431/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23 October 2003). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violations found. It therefore considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the award made by the domestic court.",
