However, the Court would like to make a preliminary observation on the issue of applicability of Article 6 of the Convention to the legality review proceedings in the present case. Under the Court\u2019s case-law, the legality review request is not an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that applicants are required to exhaust (see Traj\u010de Stojanovski\u00a0v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 1431/03, 16 September 2008 and Dimitrovska v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 21466/03, 30 September 2008, in which the public prosecutor rejected the applicants\u2019 applications that the legality review request be submitted to the Supreme Court). In the Bo\u010dvarska judgment the Court considered Article 6 applicable in a situation when the legality review request was accepted to the applicant\u2019s significant disadvantage. In that case the Court found a violation of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement in respect of proceedings in which the legality review request had been used successfully on four occasions\u00a0(see Bo\u010dvarska, cited above).\u00a0 In the Gorou judgment (see Gorou v. Greece (no. 2) [GC], no. 12686/03, \u00a7\u00a7 27-36, ECHR 2009...) the Court found Article 6 applicable to similar proceedings, which ended with a refusal of the public prosecutor to submit an appeal on points of law to the Court of Cassation. In the present case, the public prosecutor submitted the legality review request to the Supreme Court which the latter dismissed\u00a0on the merits. Given the fact that the outcome of the legality review proceedings was directly decisive for the applicant\u2019s \u201ccivil right in question\u201d, there is no obstacle to the applicability of Article 6 to these proceedings after they were launched by the public prosecutor.",

It is true that one and the same judge sat twice in the same capacity, first as president of the adjudicating bench of the Court of Appeal, then as a member of the adjudicating bench of the Supreme Court. The bench of the Court of Appeal, when presided over by judge V.K., rendered both the decision of 19 June 1997 and that of 14 March 2001 quashing the first-instance court\u2019s decisions in the applicant\u2019s favour. The Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that the quashing of those decisions was based only on procedural grounds, as was the case with the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 15 December 1999, in which adoption judge V.K. has also participated (see paragraph 10 above). Both decisions were given after a comprehensive consideration of the case following the submission of written pleadings by the defendant. The Court of Appeal, on both occasions, gave concrete instructions as to the correct application of the substantive law (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above). The decision of the Supreme Court of 18 May 2005 dismissing the legality review request and confirming the decision that was to the applicant\u2019s disadvantage, cited relevant extracts from the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 14 March 2001 (see paragraphs 12 and 18 above). That judge V.K. did not participate in the adoption of the decision that was challenged by the legality review request is of no relevance, since she had already formed a view as to the merits of the applicant\u2019s claim before his case was brought before the Supreme Court.",
