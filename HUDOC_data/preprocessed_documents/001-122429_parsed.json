However, it is well established in the Court\u2019s case-law that, as a rule, Article 6 \u00a7 1 entails an entitlement to an \u201coral hearing\u201d, that is, a hearing of the parties (and / or their representatives) in person by the court, whether conducted in public or in private. The Court has, on many occasions, considered the right to an \u201coral\u201d hearing as an aspect of the right to a \u201cpublic\u201d hearing. It has repeatedly reiterated in that context that the entitlement to a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d necessarily implied the right to an \u201coral hearing\u201d (see, inter alia, D\u00f6ry v. Sweden, no. 28394/95, \u00a7 37, 12 November 2002; compare also Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 263). It further found that in proceedings before a court of first and only instance the right to a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1 entailed an entitlement to an \u201coral hearing\u201d unless there were exceptional circumstances that justified dispensing with such a hearing (see, inter alia, Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), 23 February 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22, Series A no. 283A; Fischer v. Austria, 26 April 1995, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 312; Allan Jacobsson v.

It reiterates that the public character of proceedings before the judicial bodies referred to in Article 6 \u00a7 1 protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts, superior and inferior, can be maintained. By rendering the administration of justice visible, publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 \u00a7 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see, for instance, Pretto and Others v.

As shown above (see paragraph 83), the publicity of hearings in that sense serves to render the administration of justice transparent and to subject it to public scrutiny. By referring to an \u201coral\u201d hearing, on the other hand, reference is made to a hearing of the parties (and / or their representatives) in person by the court, possibly without the public being present (see paragraph 82 above). This serves to allow both parties to present their arguments to the court, to clarify, in particular, questions of fact in an oral exchange and to examine evidence and assess its credibility by hearing also the comments of the parties concerned. An oral hearing can therefore be vital in ensuring adversarial proceedings and thus the fairness of the proceedings as a whole.",

The question is, however, what this reference to the \u201cpublicity\u201d of hearings encompasses. More specifically, should it be understood as including a reference to the oral character of proceedings?",

We would like to refer in particular to two reports of the European Commission of Human Rights from 1981. In these reports the Commission examined whether purely written proceedings (at the cassation stage) complied with the requirement of a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d (see Sutter v. Switzerland, no.\u00a08209/78, Commission report of 10 October 1981, and Axen v. Germany, no. 8273/78, Commission report of 14 December 1981). Both cases were referred to the Court. At the time of the depositing of Liechtenstein\u2019s instrument of ratification, the right to oral proceedings was therefore a contentious issue. If the Court recognised such a right, it was likely that it would do so by considering it as an aspect of the right to a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d. We conclude from all this that the reference to the \u201cpublic hearing\u201d requirement in Liechtenstein\u2019s reservation should not necessarily be interpreted as referring exclusively to the publicity requirement. On the contrary, given the circumstances, the wording used lends itself to an interpretation covering the more general requirement of oral proceedings as well.",

The relevant provision of that act is Section 100 \u00a7 4, which provides that the Administrative Court can decide \u201con the basis of the files\u201d, that is to say, after purely written proceedings, if an \u201coral hearing\u201d is considered unnecessary or not requested by the parties. The reference to this provision is a clear indication that Liechtenstein intended to have the reservation cover not only the public character of the hearing, but also, more generally, the oral character of the proceedings.",

This contradicts, however, the underlying philosophy of Article 6 of the Convention according to which judicial proceedings have to be transparent. Excluding the public is allowed only in exceptional circumstances (see the second sentence of Article 6 \u00a7 1) and can never be the general rule. While Article 57 of the Convention allows States to make a reservation in respect of a particular provision of the Convention and thus to exclude the applicability of a given rule, this must nevertheless not be done in such a way that the remainder of the Convention provision cannot stand on its own. Holding, like the majority does, that Liechtenstein refused only to be bound by the obligation to hold public hearings, and not by the obligation to have oral proceedings, leads to such a result. Indeed, to consider that Liechtenstein is obliged only to organise \u2013 as a matter of principle \u2013 oral proceedings, and not to ensure that the hearings are public, strips the requirement of a public hearing of its character as a general rule.",
