Ukraine (no. 40107/02, 10 February 2011), which summarised shortcomings identified in the Ukrainian system of detention on remand. One of the issues highlighted in that judgment was the detention of persons without any judicial decision during the period between the end of the investigation and the beginning of the trial. According to information published on the Committee\u2019s website, the case is currently under \u201cenhanced supervision\u201d. The most recent developments were in February-March 2013. On 21 February 2013 the Ukrainian Government submitted a Revised Action Plan in which they reiterated that Parliament had adopted a new Code of Criminal Procedure which had come into force and had largely eliminated the legislative shortcomings underlying recurrent violations of Article 5 of the Convention. At its 1164th meeting (5-7 March 2013) the Committee of Ministers noted, among other things, that further clarifications were required from the Ukrainian authorities regarding the legislative changes in question.",

Therefore, the Court is called upon to examine the present complaint in more detail, despite the clarity of its case-law with regard to the unlawfulness of prolonged detention not covered by any judicial decision.",

The division of competences between the above-mentioned authorities is therefore clearly marked by the point at which the investigation is completed, the indictment is approved and the criminal case is transferred to the trial court for examination. The Government confirmed this position in their observations (see paragraph\u00a023 above). After the transfer of the case for trial, the investigating judge may nevertheless verify the grounds for the deprivation of liberty of the accused (see Article 206 of the CCP, paragraph 18 above).",

Nevertheless, the trial court did not rule on the applicant\u2019s continued detention for about one and a half months (from 27 February to 15 April 2013) and the applicant remained in detention, even though Article 203 of the CCP clearly provided that any decision on preventive measures should cease to have effect immediately after the expiry of its term of validity (see paragraph\u00a018 above). All his complaints concerning the unlawfulness of his pre-trial detention without a judicial decision and his requests for release were rejected on the ground that his detention was in accordance with the law. In particular, the investigating judge rejected his complaint, stating that the trial court had two months to decide on his continued detention, under Article 331 \u00a7 3 of the CCP (see paragraphs 13, 18 and 23 above). Thus, the domestic authorities considered that there had been no violation of the applicant\u2019s right to liberty, despite the clear fact that he had been detained without a judicial decision for one and a half months. What is more, they referred to the provisions of the CCP as permitting such a situation to exist.",

Such measures must also be taken in respect of other persons in the applicant\u2019s position, notably by solving the problems that have led to the Court\u2019s findings (see, among many other authorities, Vyerentsov v.

This obligation has been consistently emphasised by the Committee of Ministers in the supervision of the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments. Whilst it is not for the Court to determine what measures of redress may be appropriate for a respondent State, the Court\u2019s concern is to facilitate the rapid and effective suppression of a shortcoming found in the national system of protection of human rights (see Driza v.\u00a0Albania, no.\u00a033771/02, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2007XII (extracts)).",
