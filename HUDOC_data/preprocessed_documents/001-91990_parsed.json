What is more, the procedural requirements of Article\u00a03 go beyond the preliminary investigation stage; the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must meet the requirements of the prohibition enshrined in Article\u00a03. While there is no absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction or in a particular sentence, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow grave\u00a0attacks on physical and moral integrity to go unpunished (see\u00a0 \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7\u00a095 \u2013 96, ECHR 2004-XII), Salman v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0104-109, ECHR 2000-VII; and Okkal\u0131 v.\u00a0, no.\u00a052067/99, \u00a7\u00a065, ECHR 2006-... (extracts)). This is essential for maintaining the public\u2019s confidence in, and support for, the rule of law and for preventing any appearance of the authorities\u2019 tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7\u00a096).",

In her appeals the applicant complained about certain procedural shortcomings, such as the lack of access to the case file and the lack of an opportunity of confronting the witnesses, namely the staff of the centre. It is true that these were remedied after the decisions of 1\u00a0January 2000 and 19\u00a0April 2000 had been quashed and the investigation resumed.",

In this connection, the Court cannot but note that the focus of the investigation was on the justification for depriving the applicant of her liberty and the use of force against her in the centre. Although the applicant challenged the assertion that she had been intoxicated and maintained that nothing in her conduct had justified the decision to deprive her of her liberty, she also complained that she had been brutally manhandled and stripped naked by the staff of the centre in a manner which had humiliated her and infringed her right to respect for her human dignity. For the Court, the procedural obligation under Article\u00a03 must be capable of assessing whether the facts of which complaint is made cross the threshold of treatment prohibited by Article 3. In the Court\u2019s view, the authorities investigated her allegations in too narrow a framework, and thus deprived themselves of the possibility of assessing the proportionality of the force applied to the applicant from the standpoint of Article\u00a03 standards, namely the justification for the forced removal of her clothing by two male employees and the use of restraining belts to immobilise her until the morning of 28\u00a0December 1999.",

The prosecutor observed that \u201cany final decision in the case must formally address all the acts reported by the applicant, [hence also] the infringement of her dignity (inter alia, by stripping her naked)\u201d. The district prosecutor, in the decision of 2\u00a0August 2000, followed that instruction but concluded, with reference to the applicant\u2019s complaint that the officers of the sobering-up centre had behaved in a manner violating her honour and dignity, that account should be taken of the fact that the applicant herself had the right to lodge a private bill of indictment in respect of that claim. Thus, the \u201chuman dignity\u201d aspect did not escape the attention of the authorities, even if their conclusion was that all the measures taken in the sobering-up centre had been lawful and that, therefore, there was no ground to proceed with criminal charges.",

                        "content": "It is true that the Court\u2019s assessment of the facts was different and that we found that the measures applied to the applicant had been disproportionately harsh. But this difference relates to the substantive aspect of the case and led to our finding of a substantive violation of Article\u00a03. It cannot be carried over into the procedural assessment of the case. The domestic authorities could hardly be blamed for applying domestic standards of lawfulness and for concluding that a lawful action cannot lead to a criminal charge. It should not be forgotten that the nature of States\u2019 responsibilities under international law differs from that of the criminal liability of individuals. Thus, a violation of the Convention must not necessarily translate in each and every case into criminal proceedings against the person responsible.",
