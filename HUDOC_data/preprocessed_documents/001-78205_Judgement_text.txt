The case originated in an application (no. 66824/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Ladislav Lesar (“the applicant”), on 20 October 2000.
The applicant was represented by Mrs Mengus, a lawyer practising in . The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney-General.
The applicant alleged, inter alia, under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts to which he was a party was excessive. In substance, he also complained about the lack of an effective domestic remedy in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings (Article 13 of the Convention).
On 8 July 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

On 17 June 1991 the court delivered a judgment, partly upholding I.Š.'s claim.
On 13 November 1991 the  (Višje sodišče v Ljubljani) quashed the first-instance court's judgment and remitted the case to the first-instance court for re-examination.

On 13 March 1995 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal.
On 16 January 1997 the  (Ustavno sodišče) annulled the lower courts' judgements due to a violation of equal protection of rights guaranteed in Article 22 of the Slovenian Constitution.

It ordered a re-examination of the case.
In the meantime, however, the applicant, on 10 April 1995, lodged a request for re-opening of the proceedings. After two hearings (the first one was adjourned due to the applicant's late submissions) the renamed  (Okrajno sodišče v Ljubljani), on 13 May 1996, upheld the applicant's request and annulled the first-instance judgement of 25 November 1993.

On 17 January 2000, the Celje District Court decided to discontinue the civil proceedings against the State until the main proceedings and the criminal proceedings would be concluded.
In the main proceedings, the case was again considered before the  as a result of the re-opening decision of 13 May 1996 and the 's decision of 16 January 1997 (see paragraphs 9 and 10).

On 28 November 2001 the court appointed a medical expert.
 During the proceedings, the court made also inquires with I.Š.'s employer and the Slovenian Institute for Statistics (Zavod Republike Slovenije za statistiko) concerning the question of loss of I.Š.'s potential income.

On 23 July 2003 the applicant and on 18 August 2003 I.Š. lodged appeals on points of law.
On 7 October 2004 the Supreme Court rejected the appeals.
The decision was apparently served on the applicant on 5 November 2004.
In the meanwhile, on 27 August 2003, the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against the first and the second-instance courts' judgments.
On 6 July 2005 the , taking into account also the Supreme Court's decision of 7 October 2004, dismissed the applicant's appeal as manifestly ill-founded. The decision was served on the applicant on 11 July 2005.
