The Court further stresses that there have been no requests from the Government asking the Court to take this new remedy into consideration in the instant case. Following its ordinary practice of confining the scope of its review to the remedies explicitly invoked by the Government, the Court is therefore not called upon to examine whether this new remedy could offer the applicant a reasonable prospect of redress for his complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, \u010cuprakovs v. Latvia, no. 8543/04, \u00a7 29, 18 December 2012).",

However, in the absence of any further explanation or information by the Government, it remains unclear how the remedies suggested would have provided relief for the applicant\u2019s particular complaint under Article 3, which arises from the legislation concerning the execution of life sentences as opposed to a particular wrongful conduct of any State authorities. In these circumstances, the Court is not satisfied that the remedies mentioned by the Government were relevant or appropriate and, therefore, rejects their objection regarding the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in relation to the applicant\u2019s Article 3 complaints.",

The applicant subsequently sent his first letter to the Court outlining his complaints on 24\u00a0December 2003.

While the Court acknowledges that the case presented some complexities on account of the number of the accused and the nature of the charges involved, it cannot but note that the case was considerably delayed as a result of the relevant State authorities\u2019 failure to arrange the attendance of the detained defendants, including the applicant, at a number of hearings for no apparent reason. Further delays were encountered because the trial court could not compel the attendance of the police officers, who were the main witnesses to the case, at the hearings until more than a year after the commencement of the proceedings. The Court considers that these delays were unjustified and caused the prolongation of the proceedings unnecessarily.",
