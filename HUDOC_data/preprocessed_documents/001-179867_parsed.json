The competent ministry had not informed the owners of the property or the construction company of the expropriation, therefore they and any other third parties had been deprived of the opportunity to challenge it. According to their claims submitted before the district court, the applicants had only learned of the expropriation decision through the media, while the building was being demolished. Even afterwards, the applicants had never been informed, despite it being a legal requirement. This would have given them reasonable time to leave the building and take their belongings to other places. The authorities had continued with the demolition of the property without having all the information as to who the residents were. From the documents in the case file it was evident that the relevant ministry had only asked the Vlora Municipality for information about the residents of the Jon Residence a month after the building had been demolished and more than forty-five\u00a0days after the decision on the expropriation had been issued. It further held that the expropriation had been disguised as a formal expropriation taken in compliance with the legal provisions in force, but that in reality the seriousness of the violations had been such as to make it a \u201cde facto expropriation\u201d (shpron\u00ebsim de facto). The Council of Ministers\u2019 decision to expropriate the property had been a formal act, the sole purpose of which had been to disguise the actual nature of the expropriation. Furthermore, as a result of the immediate demolition of the building, without the authorities respecting the deadlines set in the law, the applicants had been prevented from being returned to their previous situation, even though the Council of Ministers\u2019 decision had been null and void. The District Court reasoned that the non-compliance with domestic law concerning the expropriation procedure had aggravated the applicants\u2019 situation and, therefore, the violation of the property rights had been so serious that it was unacceptable in a State governed by the rule of law. It reasoned that, according to the Court\u2019s case-law (reference was made to Guiso-Gallisay v. Italy judgment (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 58858/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a094-95, 22 December 2009), in cases of unlawful expropriation the domestic courts had a strict obligation to award higher compensation than in cases of lawful expropriation. Moreover, as regards the existence of any legitimate aim in the public interest, the District Court noted that there had been no infrastructure or ecological (environmental) regulatory plan approved by law, not even a plan for the development of the protected area. The District Court noted that the decisions of the NCPT of 8\u00a0October\u00a02013 and 23 June 2004 had not provided for the demolition of any legal building or its expropriation, or the invalidity of any authorisation that had already been granted and of any construction already built. On the basis of the above considerations, the District Court decided to amend the Council of Ministers\u2019 decision of 27\u00a0November 2013 concerning the exact total surface area of the expropriated property, as well as the total amount of compensation and the amounts to be paid to each applicant. More concretely, the District Court increased the total compensation to be awarded to the applicants to ALL\u00a01,580,712,321, on the basis of a court-ordered experts\u2019 report. The District Court found that the authorities had blatantly violated the procedure set out in the Constitution and domestic law concerning the determination of the compensation to be paid in expropriation cases. Therefore, the calculation by the Council of Ministers in its decision of 27 November 2013 had not been made in accordance with the law. It accepted the report on the grounds that the valuation of the property had been based on the open market value following contemporary valuation methods for immovable properties such as the direct comparison and the state of the development of the property and taking also into consideration the location of the property, the development of the property, its actual development on the basis of legal documents as well as analysing the values of sales and rents of similar properties. The experts had also tried to analyse increases or decreases in the market prices of sales or purchases of similar properties. Under the expert report, the price per square metre was EUR\u00a01,155\u00a0(ALL\u00a0161,700) in respect of the flats and EUR 2,000 (ALL\u00a0280,000) in respect of the business premises. The price was calculated using the average market value during the period between 2013 and January 2014 based on a Council of Ministers\u2019 decision \u201con the valuation methods for immovable properties in Albania\u201d which stated that such calculations are made in accordance with international valuation standards.",

Lastly, the court ruled that the compensation was to be paid by the Council of Ministers and the Vlora Municipality in three tranches over a period of eighteen months from the moment the court\u2019s decision became final. Both the Council of Ministers and the Vlora Municipality were obliged to pay jointly the judicial costs and expenses including the experts\u2019 fee, the court fees for lodging the claim (ALL\u00a011,409,852) and the lawyers\u2019 fee for the representation of G.

It reasoned that the NUCI\u2019s employees under domestic law had been entitled to carry out the inspection and verify the regularity of the documents concerning the approval of the building permit and the implementation of its technical standards by the construction company. They had accordingly been entitled to enter the premises of the Jon Residence. Furthermore, the officers of the State Police had been entitled to cooperate with and support the NUCI. After the authorities had carried out the inspection criminal proceedings had been instituted, therefore the suspicion of non-compliance with the rules and urban planning conditions had been realistic. The District Prosecutor further reasoned that one of the complainants had said that when he had returned to the building the following day he had seen officers of the State Police inside and had been allowed to enter his flat freely after showing them his certificate of ownership. That statement had also been corroborated with the information given by the NUCI and the Vlora police.",

Sections 2 and 4 provide that an expropriation is only in the public interest, where the public interest prevails over the private interest, and only for the reasons and in accordance with the procedures expressly set out in the Act, to the extent that it is essential for the achievement of the purpose of the expropriation and is in exchange for fair compensation. The principles of transparency, equality of citizens and protection of their property interests and rights must be respected (section\u00a03). An expropriation can be made for various reasons, including the realisation of national or local projects and investments in the interests of the environment, health, etc. as well as infrastructure protection in the public interest (section 8). Under section 10, the applicant in whose favour the expropriation is to be carried out, including a municipal authority, must apply to the ministry that is competent under the law. The application must be accompanied by several documents, including a list of the owners of the private properties to be expropriated, together with explanations and information concerning each owner, including their addresses and last known residences, with respective estimates in respect of the valuation of the properties, and the amount of compensation that is to be paid for each of them. Section 11 provides that the competent minister must order the setting up of a special commission to supervise the implementation of the expropriation procedure. Section 12 provides that the competent ministry must verify the application and supporting documents. Section 13 provides that if the application is in accordance with the Act, the competent ministry accepts it and immediately notifies the applicant in whose favour the expropriation is sought in writing. An agreement must be entered into between the applicant and the competent ministry on the mutual rights and obligations related to the expropriation procedure. Section 14 provides that within ten days of the agreement the competent ministry must directly notify each owner or co-owner of the private properties to be expropriated of their compensation. Under section 15, the competent ministry must publish the application for expropriation in the Official Gazette, and in a national and local newspaper for a one week period. Section 16 \u00a7 2 provides that upon the completion of the expropriation proceedings, the competent Ministry is obliged to decide on the amount of compensation. That amount is paid to the person concerned as decided by the final court decision, in case of appeal, after having informed the competent ministry. Section 16 \u00a7 3 provides that the owners of the private properties must inform the competent ministry whether they accept the voluntary transfer of the property. Within fifteen days of receipt of the answer of the owners, and in any event no less than one month from the publication of the application for expropriation, the competent ministry, in the event that the parties have accepted the conditions of expropriation, must initiate the procedure for transferring ownership to the State in exchange for fair compensation (section 16 \u00a7 4). Section 17 provides that the special commission must calculate the amount of compensation related to the property to be expropriated. Section 20 provides that the competent minister must then submit to the Council of Ministers the proposal for expropriation accompanied by several documents. Under section 21, the Council of Ministers decides on the expropriation when the proposal for expropriation is considered to have a basis in law and in fact. The decision on expropriation must include the private properties to be expropriated and their respective owners, the amount of compensation to be awarded as well as the time limit and the manner for payment. The decision on expropriation comes into effect immediately and is published in the Official Gazette. Section 23 provides that the amount of compensation must be given to the person concerned within the time-limit indicated in the decision of the Council of Ministers, or from the date when the court decision becomes final in accordance with sections 16 \u00a7 2 and 24 of this Act. Section 24 provides that the decision of the Council of Ministers on expropriation must be sent by the competent ministry directly to the owners concerned. They may appeal to a court within thirty days against the amount of compensation specified in the decision. An appeal against a decision of the Council of Ministers on the expropriation does not stay implementation of the decision. As regards the amount of compensation, if an appeal to the court is not submitted within thirty days in accordance with the Act, the decision of the Council of Ministers on the expropriation becomes executable. Under section 26, the expropriation procedure is considered invalid when the subject in whose favour the expropriation was done does not commence or terminate the works within three months of the date specified in the decision of the Council of Ministers. The expropriation is also invalid when the subject uses the expropriated properties or performs actions in noncompliance with the purpose of the expropriation, or when he changes the intended use of the properties or projects already performed on them before the expiry of the period as set out in the expropriation decision. An expropriation is also considered invalid if no payment has been made or no amount of compensation has been given in favour of the expropriated party and other owners in accordance with the Act. If the expropriation is invalid, upon an application by the respective owners, the private properties are returned to them with the same rights they had at the time of expropriation. The owners concerned may request compensation in respect of damage suffered as a result of the invalid expropriation.",

Secondly, the Court notes that the applicants did not complain to the Court of a lack of compensation for pecuniary damage for the non-enforcement of the interim order of 7\u00a0November 2013, rather that the authorities failed to enforce the interim measure, which made it impossible for them to have the merits of their case properly examined.",

It further observes that the Constitutional Court, other than making a declaratory finding of a breach where final court decisions are not enforced (see paragraph 68 above), is unable to offer any means of redress to remedy the situation.

The right of access to a court guaranteed under that Article would be rendered illusory if a Contracting State\u2019s legal system allowed a final binding judicial decision or an interlocutory order made pending the outcome of a final decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party.

Taking into consideration the Government\u2019s submissions, it should firstly examine whether the interim proceedings were related to the demolition of the building which took place one month after the issuance of the interim order. Following the applicants\u2019 explicit request to stay the adoption of all administrative decisions related to the demolition of the building (see\u00a0paragraphs 17-18 above), the District Court in the operative part of its decision explicitly suspended all administrative actions of any public authority that could interfere with the peaceful enjoyment by the applicants of their respective properties. It further gave extensive reasons why the interim order had been issued (see paragraph 19 above). On 20\u00a0January 2014 the Administrative Court of Appeal noted that the consequence which the interim order had tried to stop \u2013 namely the demolition of the building \u2013 had occurred (see paragraph 22 above). Also, subsequent decisions of the domestic courts noted that the NUCI and MUCI had abusively taken arbitrary action with the aim of demolishing the building (see paragraphs 26\u00a0\u2013 27, and paragraphs 37 and 41 above). For all the above considerations, the Court concludes that the interim order was issued with a view to preventing any possible demolition of the applicants\u2019 building.",

It notes that under Article 510 of the Code of Civil Procedure an interim order is directly enforceable and binding to all state institutions (see paragraphs 19 and 62 above). Turning to the present case, the Court notes that the interim order, directed to any official body, was to remain in place until a decision was given on the merits of the case (see paragraph 19 above). By contrast, by the time the domestic courts should have decided on the merits of the case, the Council of Ministers had decided that the Jon Residence should be expropriated in the public interest and the building had been demolished. Therefore, the enforcement of the interim order and the outcome of the main proceedings became redundant (see paragraphs 22 and 26-27 above).\u00a0The Court also notes that the domestic courts at all levels observed that the Albanian authorities had failed to comply with the interim order (see also paragraphs 78 and 94 above).",

However, that access was only possible if residents presented a certificate of ownership and valid ID to the authorities. The Court also notes that one of the residents declared during the proceedings before the District Prosecutor that he had only been allowed to enter his flat the day after he had shown the authorities his certificate of ownership (see paragraph 46 above). The fact that the District Prosecutor, following the first applicant\u2019s criminal complaint, decided not to initiate any criminal proceedings on the grounds that on 3 November 2013 the authorities had acted in accordance with the law does not alter the decisions of the domestic courts which stated that the actions of 3\u00a0November 2013 had been arbitrary (see paragraphs 19, 26-27 and 37 above).",

However, it is for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among many other authorities, Paradiso and Campanelli v.

More concretely, the District Court in its decision of 28 January 2014 concluded that the surrounding of the building had taken place without informing the owners or the construction company, and that no order had been issued by the authorities prohibiting the applicants from entering their flats (see paragraphs 19 and 26 above). That decision was upheld by the Administrative Court of Appeal in 6 May 2016 (see\u00a0paragraph 27 above). The Court also notes that the interim order to remove the yellow police tape was not respected, in clear breach of national law, as the Albanian courts stated (see also paragraph 37 above). It is clear that in the present case there was no legal basis for the police intervention in the seizure and surrounding of the building. Furthermore, the requirement for the applicants to show the authorities a certificate of ownership or ID to access their properties was not based on any domestic law or a court decision. At this juncture, the Court considers it necessary to emphasise that the practice of police forces preventing people from entering their homes without any legal basis, and the seizure and cordoning off of a building contrary to domestic law, are not compatible with the rule of law in a democratic society respecting the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Khalikova\u00a0v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 42883/11, \u00a7 128, 22 October 2015).",

Having reached this conclusion, the Court is not required to determine whether the interference was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d for one of the aims listed in paragraph 2 of Article 8. There has accordingly been a violation of these applicants\u2019 right to respect for their home, within the meaning of Article 8, on account of the seizure and surrounding of the building (see among many other authorities, Khalikova, cited above, \u00a7 129, and Demades, cited above, \u00a7 37).",

The first rule, which is set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose. However, the rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7\u00a037, Series A no. 98; and Sargsyan v. Azerbaijan [GC], no. 40167/06, \u00a7\u00a0217, ECHR 2015).",

Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. It follows that the issue of whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights becomes relevant only once it has been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary (see, among many other authorities, Serkov\u00a0v.

The continuous denial of access for a period of one month must therefore be regarded as an interference with their rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Such an interference, in the view of the fact that the measures were taken with the purpose of demolishing the Jon Residence between 4 and 8 December 2013, clearly falls within the meaning of the first sentence of that provision as an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. Based on the reasons given by the domestic courts, the Court notes that the Government did not provide any legal justification whatsoever for this interference. The Court observes, as it did under Article\u00a08 of the Convention above, that the seizure and surrounding of the Jon Residence with yellow police tape, and impeding the applicants\u2019 use of their properties for about one month, were not lawful under domestic law because the authorities disregarded the interim order issued by the domestic courts.",

Secondly, the proceedings had been pending since 2013 and despite repeated requests by them for the case to be dealt with urgently, not even the first hearing had been scheduled. Thirdly, the proceedings had no reasonable prospect of success since it was unlikely that the Supreme Court would allow their appeal and rule against the Government and order them to pay them compensation at full market value, considering both the high political profile of the present case and the broader context of growing governmental interferences in the administration of justice. They relied on Kozac\u0131o\u011flu v. Turkey ([GC], no. 2334/03, 19\u00a0February 2009). Lastly, even if the appeal before the Supreme Court turned out to be successful, the decision was doomed to remain unexecuted as the Government had clearly shown no intention of complying with the domestic decisions or even its own decisions. Payment of compensation was thus at the State\u2019s discretion and dependent on their willingness. They relied on Driza v. Albania (no. 33771/02, \u00a7\u00a7 119-120, ECHR 2007V (extracts)).",

Both the District Court and the Court of Appeal found that the Expropriation Act had been breached and that the authorities had \u201cde facto expropriated\u201d (shpron\u00ebsuar de facto) the applicants\u2019 properties. An appeal has been pending before the Supreme Court since 2014. As to the second criterion, the Court notes that both courts awarded compensation to the applicants and that the Court of Appeal increased the amount of that compensation. However, the Court notes that the Ministry of Finance approved a fund of only EUR 3,460 for the implementation of the Council of Ministers\u2019 decision of 27 November 2013, that is to say one thousand times less than the amount awarded in the decision. Even that amount has not yet been paid to the applicants (see\u00a0paragraph 34 above). Under domestic law, expropriation should be made against fair compensation. Furthermore, in its own case-law the Court has recognised that the mere acceptance of a violation without adequate compensation does not deprive the applicants of their victim status. The Court, taking into consideration the fact that the applicants have not received any compensation for the demolition of their properties (see also paragraph 153 below), and that no sufficient relief has been provided to them to date at domestic level, meaning that they continue to suffer the consequences of a breach of their rights, considers that the applicants thus retain victim status for the purposes of this complaint (see Almeida Garrett, Mascarenhas Falc\u00e3o and Others v. Portugal, nos. 29813/96 and 30229/96, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2000I; \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 156, ECHR\u00a02004XII; and Montanaro Gauci and Others v.

On 15\u00a0January 2015 the Supreme Court stayed the proceedings, without giving any reasons (see paragraphs 42- 43 above). The Court notes that the applicants have not to date been compensated at all, not even in the amount awarded under the Council of Ministers\u2019 decision of 27\u00a0November 2013. In addition, the Court notes that the Council of Ministers, by its decision of 9\u00a0April 2014, unilaterally reduced the amount of compensation as awarded by the District Court\u2019s decision of 6 March 2014, and that only EUR 3,460 have been allocated so far to the applicants. Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, the duration, and in particular the lengthy stay, of the Supreme Court proceedings further exacerbates the applicants\u2019 situation. A delay of four years in paying compensation to the applicants, who have lost their homes and belongings, cannot be considered effective for the purposes of effective compensation. Such a delay already constitutes a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z cited above, \u00a7 137). The Court also notes that, in view of the lack of compensation, the applicants were denied an effective remedy for the alleged breach of their rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0156).",

An applicant who has exhausted a remedy that is apparently effective and sufficient cannot be required also to have tried others that were available but probably no more likely to be successful (see\u00a0O\u2019Keeffe\u00a0v.\u00a0Ireland [GC], no. 35810/09, \u00a7\u00a7 109-111, ECHR 2014 (extracts)), and the cases cited therein). The applicants requested the authorities to refrain from any future actions in respect of the building with a view to its demolition. The judicial authorities granted the interim order to that effect, which was disregarded by the executive authorities and became futile. Therefore, the Court is left to wonder how a similar remedy could have been effective. At no point did the authorities inform the applicants or the construction company of the demolition of the property or the initiation of the expropriation procedure (see paragraphs 36-38 and 41 above). In view of the above, the applicants had no apparent opportunity to challenge the demolition when no demolition order had been issued except the Council of Ministers\u2019 decision on expropriation, or to apply for a new interim order.",

According to the Government, there had existed a legitimate aim in the public interest for the applicants\u2019 expropriation, namely the realisation of the infrastructure project, which also included a reclassification of the area and an environmental intervention, mainly due to problems of flooding in the area. Despite the difficulties encountered, the project was now complete and most of Lungomare had come into use. The expropriation procedure had been undertaken in accordance with domestic law and the Council of Ministers\u2019 decision of 27 November 2013. It was on that basis that the Vlora Municipality had requested the assistance of the NUCI with the demolition of the property. According to the Government, the applicants had been aware that a legitimate reason for the expropriation had existed, that is why they had only challenged the expropriation value before the domestic courts. Even supposing that the expropriation had been declared invalid, that would have simply delayed matters \u2013 an expropriation would have taken place one day.

On 27\u00a0November\u00a02013, despite the interim order and twenty days after it had been issued, the Council of Ministers issued the decision to expropriate the applicants\u2019 properties, without informing them or the construction company. By 8\u00a0December 2013 the building had already been demolished. Taking into consideration the described sequence of events, the Court finds that legitimate concerns arise about the adequacy of a procedure whereby the authorities could decide, in such a short time, to expropriate the applicants\u2019 properties in the public interest, and immediately proceed with the demolition. The Court also notes that in their decisions the domestic courts concluded that both the authorities\u2019 failure to comply with the interim order, and the demolition of the Jon Residence had been unlawful. Therefore, the Court, as the domestic courts rightly pointed out (see paragraphs 36, 38 and 41 above), concludes that in the present case the whole procedure on the applicants\u2019 expropriation was carried out hastily and was thus not in accordance with domestic law.",
