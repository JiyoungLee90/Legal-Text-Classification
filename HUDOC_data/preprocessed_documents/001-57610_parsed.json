She also states that she was told to contact a senior social worker, whom she had never met, who informed her that she could not have her children returned to her if she intended to resume her relationship with Mr. B; she understood the position to be that she should leave the children with the foster parents until 3 April, that the Authority would take no action in the meantime and that, on that date, she should discuss the matter with the social worker whom she knew. According to the social worker\u2019s records, the applicant and Mr. B were both warned on 1 April that the Authority would have to obtain some legal authority over the children, although a parental rights resolution was not mentioned.",

Although at the time the children were de facto placed with the foster parents who had looked after them when they were in voluntary care (see paragraph 13 above), it appears to be very doubtful whether they were then, as a matter of law, in the voluntary care of the Authority and therefore whether the resolution was lawfully made (section 3(1) of the Child Care Act 1980; see paragraph 43 below). According to the Local Ombudsman, the Authority believed the resolution to be lawful and its officers had acted in good faith. The grounds for the purported assumption of the applicant\u2019s parental rights were that she had consistently failed, without reasonable cause, to discharge the obligations of a parent so as to be unfit to have the care of the children.",

Accordingly, the Court is entitled to have regard to that process to determine whether it has been conducted in a manner that, in all the circumstances, is fair and affords due respect to the interests protected by Article 8 (art. 8). Moreover, the Court observes that the English courts can examine, on an application for judicial review of a decision of a local authority, the question whether it has acted fairly in the exercise of a legal power (see paragraph 53 above).",

As the Commission has rightly pointed out, in cases of this kind there is always the danger that any procedural delay will result in the de facto determination of the issue submitted to the court before it has held its hearing.

Again, when the English courts spoke of access as being a right in the child, they appear not to have been asserting the absence of any parental right of access whatsoever, but to have been expressing the principle that in the event of a conflict between concurrent rights of parent and child it is the welfare of the child which should be treated as the paramount consideration.",

The issue for determination in such proceedings is the restoration of parental rights in regard to custody and control of the child. It would appear to the Court that the determination of a parental right is equally in issue where, during the currency of the order or resolution, a parent claims that the continuance or renewal of access is in the child\u2019s interests.
