Consequently, the establishment of an educational programme had not been successful. It found on the one hand that the first applicant\u2019s anger towards the father was persistent and involved the child. On the other hand the father had shown consideration and put the needs of the child first. He sincerely loved his daughter and was cooperating with children\u2019s services. The father and the child had a warm and caring relationship, and the child felt comfortable and happy in his presence. It appeared however that the child might have fears of losing her loved ones, probably due to the various moves, which had also detached her from members of her extended family. The report therefore advised the grant of temporary sole custody to the father, with regular supervised visits by the mother, until this could be reversed. It concluded that schooling should be in accordance with the custody decision, as this would be favourable to the child\u2019s emotional stability, notwithstanding the unfortunate moves of house. It also advised psychotherapeutic and parental education support for the parents, together with further monitoring by children\u2019s services.",

The court considered that Article 6 of the Convention had detailed provisions regarding criminal proceedings, but nothing in relation to civil proceedings. Thus, it was a matter subject solely to ordinary law. That being stated, he considered that in the instant case there had not been a breach of the right to defence or to the right to cross-examination (contraddittorio). Indeed, the first applicant had originally been represented at the opening of the hearing, thus, the prerequisites existed to hear the case and to cross-examine. It was only following the rejection of the request for an adjournment that the first applicant\u2019s co-lawyer forfeited her mandate. Moreover, when the latter forfeited her mandate she was not forfeiting her colleague\u2019s mandate, who therefore remained counsel to the applicant. The court further noted that there existed no law recognising a right to defer a case. The decision in relation to the existence of a legitimate impairment was subject to the judge\u2019s discretion after hearing the relevant arguments. In the present case, the results of the investigation and rogatory enquiry with the Rimini Tribunal could not lead to the existence either of a legitimate impediment or of an ex post one. The Commissario della Legge had according to his prerogatives considered it opportune to decide the case speedily in view of the urgency and gravity of the matter. Indeed, it shared the view that, there not being any legal and binding procedural requirements in this respect, in the urgent circumstances of the case the decision could have been taken even in the absence of one of the parties (audi alteram partem). Moreover, the appeal judge considered perplexing the fact that the first applicant was contesting a situation she had created herself. Lastly, as to the impartiality complaint, the first applicant had not challenged or requested the withdrawal of the Commissario della Legge at the relevant time.",

In particular, minors can apply to the Court even, or indeed especially, if they are represented by a mother who is in conflict with the authorities and who criticises their decisions and conduct as not consistent with the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In the event of a conflict over a minor\u2019s interests between a natural parent and a person appointed by the authorities to act as the child\u2019s guardian, there is a danger that some of those interests will never be brought to the Court\u2019s attention and that the minor will be deprived of effective protection of his or her rights under the Convention. Consequently, even where a mother has been deprived of parental rights - and indeed that is one of the causes of the dispute which she has referred to the Court - her standing as the natural mother suffices to afford her the necessary power to apply to the Court on the child\u2019s behalf, too, in order to protect his or her interests. Moreover, the conditions governing individual applications are not necessarily the same as national criteria relating to locus standi. National rules in this respect may serve purposes different from those contemplated by Article 34 of the Convention and, whilst those purposes may sometimes be analogous, they need not always be so (see Scozzari and Giunta v.

This delay was not understandable in view of the delicate situation, the best interest of the child and her rights under Article 8.

They submitted that in 2009 they had received a number of requests from separated parents in respect of their loss of parental rights and/or joint custody. Some of these cases had turned out to be extremely alarming from the point of view of the right to joint parenting and regular contact rights. These complaints mainly concerned children\u2019s services. During the association\u2019s discussions on child custody, strong criticisms of children\u2019s services were voiced by parents, in particular in respect of their lack of qualifications and ineffective support for parents. Many spoke about their distressing experiences in trying to see their children, particularly in cases of parents with dual nationality, who publicly complained that they had faced discriminatory treatment from the services. The association therefore invited children\u2019s services and the Council of the Order of Psychologists of  (\u201cthe Council\u201d) to attend subsequent sessions. Unlike the Council, children\u2019s services did not send any representatives. The Council\u2019s representative, in reply to questions set, confirmed that in San Marino it sufficed to have a degree in pedagogy without a further professional qualification to be employed by children\u2019s services.

Family life in the Contracting States encompasses a broad range of parental rights and responsibilities in regard to care and custody of minor children. The care and upbringing of children normally and necessarily require that the parents or an only parent decide where the child must reside and also impose, or authorise others to impose, various restrictions on the child\u2019s liberty. Thus, the children in a school or other educational or recreational institution must abide by certain rules which limit their freedom of movement and their liberty in other respects. Likewise a child may have to be hospitalised for medical treatment. Family life in this sense, and especially the rights of parents to exercise parental authority over their children, having due regard to their corresponding parental responsibilities, is recognised and protected by the Convention, in particular by Article 8 (see Nielsen v. , 28 November 1988, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 144).",

On 12\u00a0November\u00a02007 joint custody was upheld as being in the best interest of the child. By a decision of 19 February 2008, the court, again upheld joint custody and ordered the child to be returned to  to live with her father and to attend school there. This decision was confirmed on appeal three years later. In the meantime a number of orders had been issued on the matter, upholding joint custody and residence with the father, in .",

In each of their decisions they relied on detailed and complete reports from the children\u2019s services (see, for example, paragraphs 22, 28, 38, 50 and 77) which were drawn up following constant and specific requests by the domestic courts. These reports were a result of the constant monitoring performed by the service.

Moreover, the parties had regularly made written and oral submissions before the court and were allowed to air all their requests and concerns, which the courts undoubtedly took into consideration.",

It is also noted that the domestic courts did not exclude a change in regime if circumstances so required. Furthermore, the domestic courts took due care to recommend education programmes for the family and to foster the parents\u2019 reconciliation and co-operation in the best interest of their daughter.",

It reiterates that the national authorities having the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned are better placed than the international judge to assess such needs. The Court considers that the measures adopted do not appear manifestly arbitrary or unfair. In consequence, it is not for the Court to enter into a detailed assessment of the most appropriate contact arrangements. It suffices for the Court to note that these rights were not denied or suppressed at any moment, the applicants having maintained constant and regular contact with each other, and the first applicant having retained joint custody over the second applicant. While supervision and often limitation as to the venue of contact meetings (the father\u2019s residence), must have restricted the purpose of visits between mother and child, limiting to some extent their contact and the opportunity to develop their relationship - a matter which was in both of their interests and particularly the child\u2019s, whose interest is paramount - the Court considers that monitoring by the child services was necessary to allow the domestic courts to make informed decisions as to custody and contact rights. Moreover, such monitoring also served to ensure the child\u2019s well being. The Court is ready to accept that while there was no threat of violence or serious health issues (see, a contrario, Gluhakovi\u0107 v. , no. 21188/09, \u00a7 63, 12 April 2011) there could have been a risk of psychological abuse as evidenced by the suggestions that the child might develop Parent Alienation Syndrome, thus justifying the father\u2019s presence at meetings. This having been said, the Court refutes the Government\u2019s argument that such limitations were necessary as a precautionary measure against a possible abduction by the first applicant. The Court notes that when the first applicant moved to , she had informed the judge (see paragraph 26), similarly, when requested to submit the second applicant\u2019s passport she did so (see paragraph 56). While she appeared to be more hesitant to submit the second passport, the Court notes that in the meantime it was Mr X. who had requested a second passport and who was allowed to travel with the child (see paragraphs 70 and 92). Moreover, it had been repeatedly stated by the courts that travel was banned unless authorised by it (see paragraphs 51, 70 and 99), a measure which in principle deterred unilateral decisions to take the child away. Furthermore, the Court notes that there is nothing in the case file which gives objective grounds for any fear of the applicants\u2019 absconding, particularly since the first applicant\u2019s family lived in Rimini, not far from San Marino, and indeed any mere suspicions or fears which Mr X. might have had had neither been substantiated nor confirmed by the courts. Lastly, the Court notes that the presence of the parties\u2019 lawyers had not been court ordered, and indeed it was the children\u2019s services that requested the court to prohibit such a practice (see paragraph 69 above). Thus, any discomfort caused in this respect could have easily been avoided by the parties\u2019 good will.",

While it is true that the domestic courts have a duty to exercise constant vigilance, particularly as regards action taken by social services, to ensure the latter\u2019s conduct does not defeat the authorities\u2019 decisions (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], cited above, \u00a7 179), the Court notes that in the present case, the applicants had ample possibilities to criticise and contest the children\u2019s services qualifications, actions and findings in the contentious proceedings, as in fact the first applicant had done in relation to the children\u2019s services failure to facilitate her contact rights (see paragraphs 46, 48 and 56 above).

As to the hearing of 19 February 2008 on the merits of her and Mr X.\u2019s requests, the Court considers that given the fact that the first applicant\u2019s representative had been duly notified of the date of the hearing (see paragraph 43 above), that at the actual hearing she had originally been represented by co-counsel, and that she had had the opportunity to submit written pleadings, it cannot be said that her involvement had not been effective at that stage. This is more so in view of the fact that in cases concerning a person\u2019s relationship with his or her child there is a duty to exercise exceptional diligence in view of the risk that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the matter. In this light, and bearing in mind that the decision of 19 February 2008 only confirmed the retention of a joint custody regime which had previously been decided (see paragraphs 28 and 38 above) the Court finds reasonable the refusal of the domestic court to adjourn the hearing.",

As to the overall length of the proceedings the Court notes that the first applicant intervened in the custody and contact proceedings in December 2006 and the proceedings are to date still pending. However, it is evident from the facts of the case that there have not been any significant lapses of inactivity, or adjournments for reasons related to internal organisation (see, a contrario Veljkov v. , no. 23087/07, \u00a7 88, 19 April 2011 and Wildgruber v. , nos. 42402/05 and 42423/05, \u00a7 61, 21 January 2010). Indeed it also transpires that the parties\u2019 requests for urgent hearings had been immediately followed up, with the domestic courts calling on extraordinary hearings of their own motion when necessary (see, for example, paragraph 43 above). Thus, although parallel proceedings and the fact that the courts had to decide a number of ancillary matters simultaneously must have detracted from the required speediness of custody proceedings, the Court considers that overall the domestic courts appear to have dealt with the proceedings with the requisite diligence.",

The only reason given by the domestic court for such a refusal was that the applicant had no right to such materials, children\u2019s services being the judge\u2019s auxiliary (see paragraph 77 above). The Court is not persuaded by this reasoning and no other compelling reasons supporting their refusal to provide the video recordings have been put forward. However, it notes that nine months later the parties\u2019 requests for CTU recordings and all relevant documentation had been granted (see paragraph 104 above), thus, the first applicant could make use of such relevant information for the purposes of the proceedings which were still ongoing. Thus, the initial refusal cannot suffice to conclude that the State failed to comply with its positive obligations to ensure respect for the first applicant\u2019s private and family life.",

I note that the Court\u2019s case-law has crystallised the following principles that the national authorities have to follow in striking a balance between the competing interests of the child and the parents. First of all, in the balancing process particular importance must be attached to the best interests of the child which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parents (see Maumousseau and Washington v. France, no. 39388/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a066 and 67, 6 December 2007, and Sommerfeld v. Germany [GC], no. 31871/96, \u00a7\u00a064, ECHR 2003VIII). Secondly, the observance of the procedural requirements implicitly enshrined in Article 8 of the Convention means that the persons concerned must be guaranteed sufficient involvement in the decision-making process and that the domestic courts must conduct an in-depth examination of the entire family situation and of a whole series of factors, in particular of a factual, emotional, psychological, material and medical nature (see Maumousseau and Washington, cited above, paragraph 74, and more recently, Neulinger and Shuruk, [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7\u00a0139, 6\u00a0July 2010).",

It is unclear how the parents\u2019 submissions were represented in these proceedings and the majority does not refer to this problem either (paragraph 179). In January 2008 Mr X asked for sole custody of the child. It is because of this request that a more extensive expert report on the situation was drawn up, noting also the state of mind of the child (paragraph 42). It appears to me that this was a particularly crucial moment in the proceedings. However, the first applicant\u2019s legal representation was not ensured since the immediate notification by her lawyer of his inability to attend the extraordinary hearing was not accepted. Furthermore, at that meeting the applicant\u2019s submissions were refused without detailed reasoning. In the meantime, Mr X had arbitrarily retained the child in  (paragraphs 43, 44 and 48).",

When a year later, on 25 February 2009, a report on the child was drawn up, it was noted that her character had deteriorated (paragraph 97), and it continued to deteriorate (paragraph 107). The Court has repeatedly stated in similar cases that the domestic authorities should, above all, keep the best interests of the child in mind. I fail to see \u2013 and the medical reports seem to confirm this view \u2013 how the course of action taken by the  authorities served the best interests of the child. Certainly, I do not see in the reasoning of the domestic authorities how the principle of the best interests of the child affected one decision or another. It is surprising that Mr X was allowed to effectively kidnap the child and that more in-depth reports on the child\u2019s well-being only appeared in the later stages of the proceedings.",
