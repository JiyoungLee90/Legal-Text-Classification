The same pseudonym had also been used at a social media site (IRC-Galleria) as a member of a community called \u201cZero Hour: Massacre at Columbine High\u201d. The perpetrator had also commented this movie as \u201centertainment as its best\u201d on 18 August 2008. On the basis of these materials, several police officers had started to suspect that the perpetrator might commit a school killing since he seemed to imitate, with his way of dressing and gestures, the perpetrator of the previous school killing which took place in Finland less than a year earlier. Since the Detective Chief Inspector was off duty that day, the police officers contacted his replacement and requested a permission to temporarily seize the perpetrator\u2019s weapon. This request was granted at 3.40 p.m. When the police officers about 10 minutes later went to execute this assignment, they no longer found the perpetrator at his home or at school since he had left for the weekend to visit his home town.",

However, he had called the perpetrator in for questioning on the same day. As the interview with the perpetrator had not revealed any clear reason to withdraw his firearms licence, the Detective Chief Inspector had only given him a verbal warning. The court found that the Detective Chief Inspector had had all relevant material in his possession and he had discussed the situation with his colleagues. He had questioned the perpetrator in person, and found nothing unusual in his behaviour. The decision had been within his discretion and there was no evidence of any negligence.

The court noted that the subordinate police officers, based on the evidence collected prior to the interview conducted by their superior, had expressed mutually differing views concerning the risk posed by the perpetrator. The court found it likely that their perceptions, as reflected in their testimonies, might in part have been affected by the shock of the subsequent events, reinforcing a sense of risk. On the evidence the court found that neither the circumstances relating to the perpetrator\u2019s prior behaviour, nor his behaviour in the context of the interview, had been of a kind to give the Detective Chief Inspector reasonable grounds for suspecting that the perpetrator might commit a school shooting. In fact, it was possible that it had been only after the interview and the verbal warning that the perpetrator had decided to commit such an act. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that nothing in the extensive evidence adduced in the case suggested that the perpetrator had had an intention to commit such an attack, and that it had been only following his encounter with the Detective Chief Inspector and shortly before the attack that he had downloaded to Internet material indicating his intention to carry out the attack.",

The court further examined whether the liability of the State was engaged on the grounds of cumulative negligence on the part of the authorities.

The applicants had pursued their own charges of breach of an official duty covering the period of 22 June to 23 September 2008 and, in the alternative, joined the public prosecutor\u2019s charges. They had also pursued charges against the Detective Chief Inspector on ten counts of grossly negligent homicide covering the period of 25 June to 23 September 2008. In its final judgment, the Court of Appeal considered that the applicants had lacked locus standi as far as the charges of negligent breach of an official duty and breach of an official duty were concerned. The applicants could not therefore be considered in this respect as victims in the present case and their application should be rejected as incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention and be declared inadmissible in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

As the Court had stated in its earlier case-law, the next of kin should be able to complain in Article 2 cases in their own right because of the nature of the violation. All the applicants were either parents, spouses or children of the persons killed in the shooting. Although the Court of Appeal had denied the applicants locus standi, it was incorrect to claim that this decision had relevance in respect of their victim status before the Court. Victim status should be established solely on the basis of the Convention and the Court\u2019s case-law. In the present case, the State of Finland had in no way recognised any violation, nor awarded any compensation to the applicants. The applicants had to therefore be considered as victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.",

Spain, no. 62543/00, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2004III). In the Court\u2019s settled case-law, it is also accepted that, in Article 2 cases, close family members of the deceased can legitimately claim to be victims of an alleged violation of that Article. Moreover, a domestic decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him or her of victim status unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, a breach of the Convention and subsequently afforded appropriate and sufficient redress for it (see, for the main principles, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 178-213, ECHR 2006-V, and Nikolova and Velichkova v. Bulgaria, no. 7888/03, \u00a7 49, 20\u00a0December 2007, as well as the cases cited therein). The Court has generally considered this to be dependent on all the circumstances of the case, with particular regard to the nature of the right alleged to have been breached (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2010), the reasons given for the decision (see M.A. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 35242/04, ECHR 2005, and contrast Jensen v. Denmark (dec.), no.\u00a048470/99, ECHR 2001-X) and the persistence of the unfavourable consequences for the person concerned after that decision (see Freimanis and L\u012bdums v. Latvia, nos. 73443/01 and 74860/01, \u00a7 68, 9 February 2006). Only when those conditions are satisfied does the subsidiary nature of the protective mechanism of the Convention preclude examination of an application (see Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2006-V, and Cataldo v. Italy (dec.), no. 45656/99, 3 June 2004). It is therefore for the Court to verify, ex post facto, whether the redress afforded domestically by the domestic courts was appropriate and sufficient, having regard to the just satisfaction as provided for under Article 41 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Normann v. Denmark (dec.), no.\u00a044704/98, 14 June 2001; Jensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark (dec.), no.\u00a052620/99, 20 March 2003; and Nardone v. Italy (dec.), no. 34368/02, 25\u00a0November 2004).",

The material had clearly shown that the perpetrator had admired mass killings and that he had found school massacres \u201centertainment at its best\u201d. The police had known already in 2002 that the perpetrator had planned to carry out a similar school shooting at his previous school. The police had also known, or ought to have known, that the perpetrator had lied to them when applying for a firearms acquisition permit about having had shooting as a hobby, whereas totally different information had been published on one of his social-network profiles. The type of firearms acquired had not even been suitable for the purposes the perpetrator had submitted to the police. The police should have learned, at the latest a few days before the incident when they had examined the perpetrator\u2019s online profile, that the perpetrator had not acquired the firearm for recreational purposes as he had claimed.

The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see, among many other authorities, Anguelova v.

Such a positive obligation has been found to arise in a range of different contexts. Thus, for example, the Court has held that the State\u2019s positive obligation under Article 2 is engaged in respect of the management of various dangerous activities (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2004XII) as well as in the context of road safety (see Nicolae Virgiliu T\u0103nase v. Romania [GC], no. , \u00a7 135, 25 June 2019). These duties of the domestic authorities entail above all the primary obligation to have in place an appropriate set of preventive measures geared to ensuring public safety. This entails above all a primary duty on the part of the State to adopt and implement a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, and Masneva v. Ukraine, no. , \u00a7\u00a064, 20 December 2011). In this regard, the Court has emphasised that the States\u2019 obligation to regulate must be understood in a broader sense which includes the duty to ensure the effective functioning of that regulatory framework. The regulatory duties thus encompass necessary measures to ensure implementation, including supervision and enforcement (Lopes de Sousa Fernandes v. Portugal [GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7 189, ECHR 2017). Thus, the States\u2019 positive obligation under the substantive limb of Article\u00a02 extends to a duty to ensure the effective functioning of the regulatory framework adopted for the protection of life (see Cavit T\u0131narl\u0131o\u011flu v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 3648/04, \u00a7 86, 2 February 2016).",

Thus, in the context of activities which may pose a risk to human life due to their inherently hazardous nature, States are required to take reasonable measures to ensure the safety of individuals as necessary (see Cevrio\u011flu v. Turkey, no. 69546/12, \u00a7 57, 4 October 2016, with further references). In this regard, special emphasis must be placed on regulations geared to the special features of the activity in question, particularly with regard to the level of the potential risk to human lives (see Masneva, cited above, \u00a7 64). The regulatory measures in question must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks (see Cevrio\u011flu, cited above, \u00a7 51, and Zinatullin v. Russia, no. 10551/10, \u00a7\u00a7 25-27, 28 January 2020). The Court has, however, also emphasised that the positive obligation is to be interpreted in such a way as not to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind, in particular, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0107, and Ciecho\u0144ska v. Poland, no. , \u00a7\u00a7 63 and 64, 14 June 2011). Accordingly, not every potential risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take preventive measures to deter that risk from materialising. The extent of the positive obligations in a given context depends on the kind of risks concerned and the possibilities of mitigating them (see Cavit T\u0131narl\u0131o\u011flu, cited above, \u00a7 90).",

The findings of the investigation commission similarly stated that the material posted by the perpetrator in the Internet did not contain any references to a school killing. The Court finds it important to emphasise that there remains a substantial difference between conduct involving video clips and cryptic postings on the Internet without any specific or even unspecific threats, and the indiscriminate killing of persons present at a specific location (see, mutatis mutandis, Van Colle v. the United Kingdom, no. 7678/09, \u00a7 99, 13\u00a0November 2012).

The question whether there had been any decisive stage in the sequence of events leading up to the fatal shooting when it could have been said that the authorities had known or ought to have known of a real and immediate risk to the life of the applicants\u2019 next of kin must therefore be answered in the negative (see Van Colle, cited above, \u00a7 95).

In the present case, the domestic courts, having examined the facts and the evidence, did not conclude that the perpetrator could be foreseen to pose a real and immediate risk to the life of others. The circumstances of the present case are indeed distinctly different.

The Court has acknowledged that respect for such confidentiality is crucial not only for the sake of the patients\u2019 sense of privacy but to preserve their confidence in the health service and to ensure that persons are not discouraged from seeking diagnosis or treatment, which would undermine the preventive efforts in health care (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, \u00a7 95, Reports 1997I; P.\u00a0and S. v. Poland, no. , \u00a7 128, 30 October 2012; and L.H. v.\u00a0Latvia, no. , \u00a7 56, 29 April 2014). The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in Article 8 of the Convention (see Z v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a095). While there are undoubtedly many circumstances in which it is necessary and justified for the police authorities to be able to obtain certain medical data in order to carry out their functions in law enforcement and crime prevention, access by the police to an individual\u2019s medical data cannot be a matter of routine. Such access must remain subject to specific requirements of necessity and justification based on the concrete circumstances. The presence of such necessity or justification cannot be established with the benefit of hindsight. Furthermore, even if the data on the perpetrator\u2019s medical history (see paragraph 9 above) had been available, it cannot be determined whether or to what extent the assessment of whether the perpetrator posed a real and imminent risk at the relevant time might have depended on such information.",

Although the perpetrator was not in the charge of State authorities, those authorities are responsible for determining and upholding the requirements for the lawful possession of firearms.

Indeed, the police did not remain passive but conducted an interview with the perpetrator. No action was taken, however, to seize the weapon he was known and licensed to possess. While an individual error of judgment cannot suffice to conclude a violation of the State\u2019s positive obligations (see paragraph 68 above), especially not when identified with the benefit of hindsight, what is in issue in the present case can be seen to go beyond such an error of judgment. The Court notes, however, that it cannot accept the applicants\u2019 argument suggesting that the perpetrator was actually provoked by the police interview to proceed with the attack the following morning.

Bulgaria, no. 23302/03, \u00a7 72, 24 May 2011, and Antonov v. Ukraine, no. 28096/04, \u00a7 44, 3 November 2011). Such a system may, and under certain circumstances must, include recourse to criminal law (ibid., \u00a7 45). In the particular context of the loss of life or serious injury incurred in connection with dangerous activities, the Court has considered that an official criminal investigation is indispensable given that public authorities are often the only entities to have sufficient relevant knowledge to identify and establish the complex phenomena that might have caused an incident (see, in particular, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7 93, and Brincat and Others v. Malta, nos. 60908/11, 62110/11, 62129/11, 62312/11 and 62338/11, \u00a7\u00a7 121-22, 24 July 2014). As regards the possible responsibility of State officials for deaths occurring as a result of their alleged negligence, the obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case (see, among other authorities, Branko Toma\u0161i\u0107 and Others v. Croatia, no. 46598/06, \u00a7 64, 15 January 2009).",

To my regret, I have come to the conclusion that, for the reasons set out below, the present judgment does exactly that. It is, in my eyes, an example of such overreach in the form of an undue extension or enlarging of the existing case-law under Article 2.

Ukraine also does not, in my view, significantly expand the narrow class of cases established in Mastromatteo and Maiorano. In that case, the culprit was a police officer (i.e. an agent of the State) who killed two persons with his service gun. The Court there, expressly based its decision inter alia on the fact that \u201cthe States are expected to set high professional standards within their law-enforcement systems and ensure that the persons serving in these systems meet the requisite criteria (...). In particular, when equipping police forces with firearms, not only must the necessary technical training be given but the selection of agents allowed to carry such firearms must also be subject to particular scrutiny\u201d (\u00a738).",

In this specific context, this Court would \u2013 by reference to the right to life under Article 2 \u2013 recognise that the state had a \u201cduty of care\u201d when making that assessment at the time of (and during) any temporary release. The Grand Chamber in Murray v. the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a010511/10, \u00a7 111, 26 April 2016 described this as part of the State\u2019s \u201cpositive obligation to protect the public by continuing to detain life prisoners for as long as they remain dangerous\u201d.",

Even if the assertion in \u00a7\u00a088 of the judgment were right that the suspension of this perpetrator\u2019s licence and/or a temporary seizure of his gun \u201cwould not have entailed any significant interference with any competing rights under the Convention\u201d (and this will, of course, not necessarily always be the case), it is difficult to see how (and subject to what safeguards) such a licence holder would be able to establish to the authorities that the information (e.g. as in this case internet postings) which led to the temporary seizure/suspension did not, in fact, give rise to a suspicion that s/he poses a threat to the right to life.
