The Government stressed that the applicant had unlawfully sought her husband's release, which had been effected in compliance with domestic requirements, including that of informing an individual of the reasons for his arrest. The applicant, who in the trial hearings did not deny this, was drunk, acted aggressively, attempted to resist her husband's arrest, used offensive language, grabbed the police officers by their uniform, threatened them with violence and even kicked an officer on the leg. She continued her outrageous behaviour in the police station by breaking the panes of glass in the entrance door and bursting into the building. The Government argued that in those circumstances the use of force by the police officer, as well as the use of handcuffs, was a justified and lawful response to the applicant's conduct. Moreover, it was the only possible and effective response, as no non-violent methods were capable of calming the applicant down. In the Government's opinion the force used against the applicant did not run contrary to the guarantees envisaged by Article 3 of the Convention. In particular, the force did not reach the minimum level of severity required by that Convention provision for it to become applicable. The damage caused to the applicant as a result of the use of force did not lead to any long-term negative consequences for her health and was considered \u201cinsignificant\u201d by the experts. Furthermore, while applying force and handcuffing the applicant, the officer had no intention of causing her physical or psychological suffering or of humiliating her.

They instituted criminal proceedings against the police officer and prepared his case for trial, having collected necessary evidence for the charges to be upheld in court.

In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element to torture, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which in Article 1 defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see Akko\u00e7 v. , nos. 22947/93 and\u00a022948/93, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2000X).",

Where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

She accompanied her actions with obscene language and threats of violence. The police officer ordered the applicant to stop this unruly behaviour, but the applicant refused to comply. The Court accepts that in these circumstances the officer may have needed to resort to physical force to prevent further disruptions and calm the applicant down. It is also prepared to accept that some injuries on the applicant's body, such as small bruises on the forearms and shoulders, are consistent with a minor physical confrontation which might have occurred between the applicant and officer Sh. when the latter attempted to overcome the applicant's resistance and close the door to the police station or handcuff her. At the same time, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the injuries suffered by the applicant were not restricted to the area of her arms and shoulders, that the degree of bruising established during the medical examinations was excessive and that she had sustained a serious head injury (see, by contrast, Stefan Iliev v. , no. 53121/99, \u00a7 44, 10 May 2007).",

The force used against the applicant in preventing or terminating her violent behaviour went beyond what was strictly necessary in the circumstances. In fact, the Court is of the opinion that the actions by the police officer were disproportionate to the applicant's imputed transgressions and inconsistent with the goals he sought to achieve. The Court further finds that the degree of force to which the applicant was subjected must have caused her mental and physical suffering, even though it did not apparently result in any long-term damage to her health.

It is apparent from the Government's submissions, that handcuffing was aimed at facilitating the police officer's task of calming the applicant down and restoring order. The Court reiterates that the use of handcuffs or other instruments of restraint does not normally give rise to an issue under Article 3 of the Convention where the measure has been imposed in connection with lawful detention and does not entail the use of force, or public exposure, exceeding what is reasonably considered necessary. In this regard, it is important to consider, for instance, the danger of the person's absconding or causing injury or damage (see Raninen v.\u00a0Finland, 16 December 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, \u00a7 56, and Mathew v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, no. 24919/03, \u00a7 180, ECHR 2005). However, the manner in which the applicant is subjected to the measure in issue should not go beyond the threshold of a minimum level of severity envisaged by the Court's case-law under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Nevmerzhitsky v. Ukraine, no. 54825/00, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2005\u2013II). Assessing the parties' description of the events which occurred in the police station on 22 September 2001, the Court notes that handcuffing may be regarded as a less intrusive measure, as opposed to pure violence, to restore order and calm the applicant down. It is also ready to accept that the handcuffing was made necessary by the applicant's own aggressive behaviour to prevent further disruptions. In this connection, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant's handcuffing was, as is apparent from the Government's submissions, more effective in facilitating the police officers' task of restoring order. The Court observes that the applicant did not contend that the handcuffing had affected her physically. There is also no evidence that the handcuffing was aimed at debasing or humiliating her. While regretting that the applicant was left for a few hours handcuffed near the entrance door where she was visible to the public, the Court is of the opinion that, given the parties' description of the events, the manner in which the handcuffing was carried out in the applicant's case can be considered inevitable and could be justified by the danger posed by her to surroundings. It is also evident from the applicant's behaviour following the handcuffing, in particular her persistent attempts to attract attention of passers-by, that the applicant herself did not perceive the handcuffing as a humiliating and degrading treatment. The Court therefore does not find unacceptable the manner in which the handcuffing was effected.",

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. An obligation to investigate \u201cis not an obligation of result, but of means\u201d: not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimant's account of events; however, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Thus, the investigation of serious allegations of illtreatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev, cited above, \u00a7 107 et seq., and Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, Reports 1998VIII, \u00a7\u00a0102 et seq.).",

The authorities thus had an obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances in which the applicant sustained her injuries (see Krastanov v. , no.\u00a050222/99, \u00a7 58, 30 September 2004).",

The case was sent back to the prosecution for correction of the defects. As a result the examination of the applicant's case by the trial court was delayed for almost a year. Furthermore, having examined the merits of the case the District Court acquitted the police officer, finding that there was no evidence of ill-treatment. In this respect the Court reiterates that the applicant was entirely reliant on the prosecutor to assemble the evidence necessary to corroborate her complaint. The prosecutor had the legal powers to interview the police officers, summon witnesses, visit the scene of the incident, collect forensic evidence and take all other crucial steps for the purpose of establishing the truth of the applicant's account. His role was critical not only to the pursuit of criminal proceedings against the perpetrator of the offence but also to the pursuit by the applicant of other remedies to redress the harm she had suffered (see paragraph  above). In these circumstances the Court is bound to interpret the District Court's finding of insufficiency of evidence as a sign of serious flaws in the work of the prosecuting authorities.",

The Court observes that the prosecution merely concentrated on raising the issue of the applicant's having sustained an injury to the forehead as a result of the police officer's actions, and excluded the remaining injuries recorded by the medical experts from the description of the actus  of the alleged crime. In this respect the Court reiterates the Regional Court's finding that the limited scope of accusations brought by the prosecution against officer Sh. prevented the trial court's assessment of the entire set of facts as the court was legally bound to respect the boundaries of the indictment drafted by the prosecution (see paragraph 16 above). It is also apparent that in these circumstances the trial court was unable to give a correct interpretation of the findings of the medical experts as to the nature and origin of the applicant's injuries, in particular their inflicted character. The Court is of the opinion that the defective indictment made it impossible for the prosecution to sustain a conviction. Moreover, the Court observes that given a chance to correct the procedural defects pointed out by the District Court in April 2002, it was open to the prosecution authorities to check one more time that they had prepared their case effectively for trial in order to obtain a guilty verdict against officer Sh. The Court finds it surprising that no such efforts were made by the prosecution.",
