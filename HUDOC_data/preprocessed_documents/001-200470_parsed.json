For this reason, the Convention organs have consistently refused to uphold applications from persons convicted of criminal offences who complain that their convictions or sentences were found by the appellate courts to have been based on errors of fact or law (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10\u00a0June 1996, \u00a7 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III). For the assessment of compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention the basic distinction has to be made between ex facie invalid detention orders \u2013 for example, given by a court in excess of jurisdiction or where the interested party did not have proper notice of the hearing \u2013 and detention orders which are prima facie valid and effective unless and until they have been overturned by a higher court (see Khudoyorov v.

This finding is undisturbed even though the supervisory-review court later recharacterised the first offence and acquitted the applicant of one of the charges that had been levelled against her in the second trial. Although the applicant stayed in custody one month longer than the adjusted sentence had required, her situation was no different from people whose convictions were set aside on appeal. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s complaint about her detention between 9\u00a0April 2009 and 12 August 2010 is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and\u00a04 of the Convention.",
