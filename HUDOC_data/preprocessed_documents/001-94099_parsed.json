The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used.

In particular, while mentioning the abductors' camouflage uniforms, the applicants had never referred to insignia on them or other details which could have enabled the authorities to establish the affiliation of the perpetrators to a particular military service. Moreover, the first applicant had described the uniforms as \u201cunusual\u201d and, in any event, she had not been an eyewitness to the abduction, her only source of information being Mr Sh. From his description of the abductors' camouflage uniforms as \u201cunusual\u201d it transpired that he had doubted that the perpetrators had belonged to the Russian military. The applicants also failed to indicate whether the abductors had used specific military terms or expressions. The fact that they had carried weapons and had spoken Russian did not prove that they had belonged to the Russian military. The Government further stressed that members of illegal armed groups had often passed themselves off for servicemen or members of law-enforcement bodies and had freely entered the premises where the latter had been stationed. In this connection they referred to the events in Beslan where the perpetrators had passed several checkpoints unhindered and had subsequently taken over one thousand people hostage. In the Government's opinion, Bekman Asadulayev might have been abducted either by members of illegal armed groups in connection with his professional activity as a police officer or by third persons because of a personal feud. Moreover, had the authorities suspected him of membership of illegal armed groups, they would not have needed to mount a plot and would have prosecuted him in the proper way. The Government stressed in that connection that none of the heads of the \u201cpower structures\u201d had formally confirmed the fact of Bekman Asadulayev's arrest.",

More importantly, Mr\u00a0Sh. had never specified that the men by the VAZ vehicle and those who had entered Mr G.'s office had been the same persons. According to the Government, Mr\u00a0Sh. had submitted that he would have been able to identify the abductors because they had not worn masks. However, when he had subsequently visited various departments of the Ministry of the Interior, he had never met those persons, although the overall number of police officers in the  is not particularly high.

They submitted that State representatives frequently omitted to wear uniforms with recognisable insignia, so that their actions could not be traced. Since the beginning of the military conflict in 1999 camouflage uniforms had been withdrawn from unrestricted sale and representatives of the federal forces had seized such uniforms and detained individuals who had them. The applicants further stressed that the unhindered passage of the abductors of Bekman Asadulayev through the checkpoints had indicated that the MVD security personnel had either recognised them or had had an order to let them through. In that connection the applicants emphasised that if the abductors had been members of illegal armed groups, their unhindered passage through the secure MVD grounds should have prompted the authorities to investigate such a serious security breach. However, nothing in the Government's submissions indicated that this had been done. They further pointed to the Government's admission that Mr G. had not been surprised by the arrival of the armed men in his office which, in the applicants' opinion, lent further credence to their argument that the abductors of Bekman Asadulayev had been State agents. The applicants also argued that the alleged discrepancies in their account of events had not had particular bearing on the establishment of the fact of their relative's detention by State agents. In any event, it followed from the statement by Mr Sh. cited by the Government that Bekman Asadulayev had simply surmised that his summoning had been prompted by unauthorised leave. Furthermore, the applicants had not alleged that Mr Sh. had also been summoned to the MVD. As for the exact time of arrival of the armed men in Mr G.'s office, it had also been irrelevant since the Government had not disputed the fact of their arrival there. Insofar as the Government argued that the armed men who had entered Mr G.'s office and those outside the building might have been different persons, it could not be verified since the Government had failed to produce a copy of the statement by Mr Sh. to that effect. In so far as the handcuffing was concerned, Mr Sh. had not mentioned it in the statement relied on by the Government. In reply to the Government's submission that Bekman Asadulayev might have been targeted by insurgents because of his professional activities, the applicants pointed out that the domestic investigation had not obtained any evidence of the possible involvement of members of illegal armed groups in his disappearance. With reference to the case of Kukayev v. Russia (no.\u00a029361/02, 15 November 2007), they further claimed that the fact of being a police officer in the Chechen Republic did not, as such, minimise the risk of abduction by State agents.",

From those documents it follows that the MVD grounds were surrounded by a high fence; that the entrance to the grounds had been secured by armed guards and that access to the grounds was only possible through a checkpoint where the visitors' identity information was registered in special logbooks. Moreover, two further checkpoints were situated on the access road to the MVD grounds. In the absence of any submissions by the Government to the effect that on 14\u00a0January 2004 there had been a security breach on the grounds of the MVD by reason of the insurgents' unhindered passage through several checkpoints, or any indication that the authorities had investigated that security breach, the Court is bound to conclude that the abduction took place on premises over which State authorities exercised full control at the material time. Bearing this in mind and applying the principles enunciated in paragraph 79 above, the Court considers that the onus is thus on the Government to provide a plausible explanation of what happened on the premises and to show that Bekman Asadulayev was not detained by the authorities, but left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his liberty.",

In the Court's view, this fact would rather strongly support the applicants' allegation that these were State agents (compare Alikhadzhiyeva v. Russia, no. 68007/01, \u00a7 59, 5 July 2007; Nasukhanova and Others v. Russia, no. 5285/04, \u00a7 95, 18 December 2008; and Ruslan Umarov v. , no. 12712/02, \u00a7 91, 3 July 2008).

Thus, the Court points out that it has found it established that the applicants' relative was abducted from the secure premises of the MVD by unidentified State agents. There has been no news of him since that date, which is more than five years ago. The Court particularly stresses that in a number of cases concerning disappearance of people in the Chechen Republic it repeatedly held that when a person is detained by unidentified State agents without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention, this can be regarded as life-threatening (see, among many other authorities, Bazorkina and Imakayeva, both cited above; Luluyev and Others v. Russia, no. 69480/01, ECHR 2006... (extracts); Baysayeva v. Russia, no. 74237/01, 5 April 2007; Akhmadova and Sadulayeva v. , no. 40464/02, 10 May 2007, and Alikhadzhiyeva v. Russia, no. 68007/01, 5 July 2007). The Court has found the same considerations to apply to a situation where a person entered the premises of a police station and went missing for years (see Yusupova and Zaurbekov v. Russia, no. 22057/02, \u00a7 55, 9 October 2008). The absence of any news of Bekman Asadulayev for over five years corroborates this assumption. Moreover, his name has not been found in the official records of any detention facility. Lastly, the Government failed to provide any explanation for Bekman Asadulayev's disappearance, and the official investigation into his kidnapping, which has been dragging on for more than five years, has produced no known results.",

Turkey, 19 February 1998, \u00a7\u00a086, Reports 1998I). The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. This investigation should be independent, accessible to the victim's family, carried out with reasonable promptness and expedition, effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances or otherwise unlawful, and afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results (see Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a024746/94, \u00a7\u00a7 105-09, ECHR 2001III (extracts), and Douglas-Williams v. the  (dec.), no.\u00a056413/00, 8\u00a0January 2002).",

However, it does not appear that any steps were taken by the authorities until 17 January 2004, when the third applicant filed with the district prosecutor's office a formal complaint about the abduction of her brother. It further transpires that although on\u00a017\u00a0and 23 January 2004 Mr Sh. and Mr S., respectively, were questioned in the course of an internal inquiry, it was only eighteen days later that the district prosecutor's office decided to institute a criminal investigation into the abduction of Bekman Asadulayev. In the Court's opinion, this important delay, for which no explanation was provided, was in itself liable to affect the investigation of a crime such as abduction in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action must be taken expeditiously.",

The Court finds however that they failed to take a number of essential steps. Most notably, there is no indication that the investigators tried to identify and question the servicemen and the security guards on duty at any of the checkpoints on\u00a014\u00a0January 2004. Neither does it transpire that they checked the visitors' logbooks kept at those checkpoints. Furthermore, the Government conceded that the investigators had not questioned Mr G., who had received Bekman Asadulayev and Mr Sh. on 14 January 2004 and who, according to Mr Sh., had been in his office when armed men in camouflage uniforms had entered it. The Court is further struck by the fact that although, in the Government's submission, Mr Sh. had explicitly stated that the abductors of Bekman Asadulayev had not worn masks and that he would recognise them, no attempts had been made to identify them by, for example, compiling photofit pictures of them. It also does not follow from the Government's submissions that any attempts were made to identify the vehicle in which the abductors had taken Bekman Asadulayev away. In the Court's opinion, all those omissions on the part of the investigating authorities clearly undermined the ability of the investigation to establish the circumstances of the abduction of the applicants' relative and to identify those responsible for it.",

Furthermore, there is no indication that the first and second applicants were granted victim status. Accordingly, the investigators failed to ensure that the investigation received the required degree of public scrutiny, or to safeguard the interests of the next of kin in the proceedings (see O\u011fur v.

The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not mainly lie in the fact of the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the family member but rather concerns the authorities' reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities' conduct (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0358, and Imakayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0164).",

The Court's findings under the procedural aspect are also of direct relevance here. The Court also considers that the second applicant, who constituted immediate family of the disappeared person, was also to a certain extent involved in the search for her husband. In the Court's view, the second applicant's mental anguish in connection with her husband's disappearance must have been exacerbated by the fact that, whilst the District Court explicitly stated that her husband had been apprehended by officials of power structures and with the knowledge of the MVD officials, the investigation persisted in denying any implication of State agents in the abduction.",
