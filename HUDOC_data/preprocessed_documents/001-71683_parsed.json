In this connection, the Court reiterates that it is the States\u2019 duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet the requirements of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 (see Muti v. Italy, judgment of 23 March 1994, Series A no.\u00a0281C, \u00a7\u00a015). The Court further notes a period of approximately two years between August 2001 and July 2003 when no hearings on the merits were held, including another adjournment of the case on 7\u00a0October 2002 because the judge was on a mission. The Court reiterates that certain types of cases, for example those concerning civil status and capacity or employment disputes, generally require particular diligence on the part of the domestic courts (see Bock v. Germany, judgment of 29 March 1989, Series A no. 150, p.\u00a023, \u00a7\u00a049, and Ruotolo v. Italy, judgment of 27 February 1992, Series A no.\u00a0230-D, p. 39, \u00a7\u00a017). The Court finds this principle to be equally applicable to the present dispute as it concerned the payment of arrears of an old-age pension, which constituted the principal source of income for the applicant. Accordingly, the Court finds the length of the civil proceedings in the present case excessive, and the delays which occurred are attributable to the State.",
