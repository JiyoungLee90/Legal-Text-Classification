It held that the applicant had failed to identify a particular circumstance when his right of correspondence had been breached. The distribution of correspondence to prisoners by the supervisors of the prison sections rather than by specially authorised personnel had not been unlawful. The applicant had made a general complaint about the absence of adequate medical treatment without identifying the circumstances in which his right had been breached. His medical file contained information that he had repeatedly refused treatment or examinations by specialist doctors. The quality of the food had been adequate and had been reviewed daily by a representative of the medical office. Although the cells were overcrowded, the detainees had access to the statutory number of cubic metres of air, and to sanitary facilities and installations which provided access to drinking water as well as adequate privacy. They also had access to daily activities and exercise. The photographs of the cell bathroom submitted to the court by the applicant did not prove the absence of running or drinking water. Some of the bathroom installations were indeed damaged or missing, but that was linked to the inmates\u2019 behaviour and the limited budget available to the National Administration of Prisons. In addition, according to the documents submitted by the detention centre, in August 2011 the prison had been disinfected twice. The aspects the applicant complained of had been examined bearing in mind the needs of the other detainees and the aspects which made the observance of the detainees\u2019 rights possible, namely the available staff and budget. Lastly, the applicant\u2019s remaining complaints were examined and dismissed by the judge responsible for the execution of prison sentences on the basis of the documents submitted by the prison authorities.",
