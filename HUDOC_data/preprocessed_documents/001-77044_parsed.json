In the present case the objections against expert opinions were raised by both parties and the domestic court found the objections justified, requesting the experts to supplement their opinions (see paragraphs 12-15 and 17-18 above). Moreover, the Court notes that the case file was sent twice to an expert who had close personal relations with the husband of one of the defendants and the applicant\u2019s representative and for that reason he had to disqualify himself. Moreover, it was discovered that another expert who had been commissioned did not have sufficient qualifications to prepare an opinion. Accordingly, the part of the proceedings during which the opinions were ordered and examined lasted from October 1994 to December 1997 (see paragraphs 12 -18 above), thus prolonging the proceedings before the first instance court for 3 years and 2 months. In the opinion of the Court, the first-instance court did not deal with the estimation of the damage to the applicants\u2019 house with sufficient rigour. Quite apart from that, the Government have not provided any sufficient explanation for the length of the proceedings.",
