The seriousness of the offence could be inferred from the fact that the legislature had sought to afford increased protection to the dignity of the King, including vis-\u00e0-vis other public authorities (Articles\u00a0496 and 504 of the Criminal Code). Furthermore, the inviolability of the King, as proclaimed in Article 56 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution, demonstrated the unique position occupied by the Crown in the system of the 1978 Spanish Constitution. That constitutional position highlighted the disproportionate nature of the vexatious and insulting remarks made by the applicant. In the view of the public prosecutor, who referred several times to the case-law of the Strasbourg Court, it was clear that the King had been performing official duties and that he was a figure in the public eye; however, that did not deprive him of the right to respect for his honour. In that regard, the public prosecutor pointed out that Article 20 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Constitution did not protect a supposed right to proffer insults. Drawing a parallel with the special protection to be afforded under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention to the judiciary, the public prosecutor further argued that the same protection should be afforded to the Head of State, who was the \u201csymbol of the unity and permanence of the State\u201d and was above party politics, from the \u201cdestructive and baseless attack\u201d constituted by the applicant\u2019s remarks. Lastly, in the public prosecutor\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s remarks could be said to amount to \u201chate speech\u201d within the meaning of the Court\u2019s caselaw, given the existing situation with regard to terrorist attacks.",

It sentenced the applicant to one year\u2019s imprisonment, suspended his right to stand for election for the duration of the sentence and ordered him to pay costs and expenses, on the ground of his criminal liability for the offence of serious insult against the King. The Supreme Court considered the impugned remarks to have been value judgments rather than statements of fact. The remarks, described as \u201cignominious\u201d by the lower court, had expressed contempt for the King and the institution he represented, affecting the innermost core of his dignity by accusing him of one of the most serious manifestations of criminal conduct in a State governed by the rule of law. The exercise of the right to freedom of expression had therefore been contrary to the principle of proportionality and had been unnecessary, overstepping the limits beyond which criticism could be deemed to be hurtful or upsetting. The Supreme Court further observed that the context in which the remarks had been made did nothing to alter their offensiveness. Firstly, the proceedings relating to the complaints of ill-treatment of the persons detained in connection with the operation against the newspaper Euskaldunon Egunkaria had been discontinued for lack of evidence. Secondly, the impugned remarks could not be construed as a reaction or response to a political debate with the King. In view of the seriousness of the insulting comments and the fact that the applicant had deliberately expressed them in public, the Supreme Court sentenced him to one year\u2019s imprisonment.",

The judge agreed with the Basque Country High Court of Justice that the remarks had not targeted the King\u2019s private life or his personal honour but had been directed solely at his institutional role as Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish armed forces. The applicant had not claimed that the King was responsible for actual acts of torture, only that he was strictly liable as Head of the State apparatus.

However, freedom of expression did not protect vexatious expressions which, regardless of their veracity, were offensive and ignominious and were not pertinent for the purpose of conveying the opinions or information in question.",

In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, there was no denying the ignominious, vexatious and derogatory nature of the impugned remarks, even when directed against a public figure. That finding was all the more valid with regard to the King, who, by virtue of Article 56 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution, was \u201cnot liable\u201d and was a \u201csymbol of the unity and permanence of the State\u201d. Regard being had to his role as \u201carbitrator and moderator of the lawful functioning of institutions\u201d, the King occupied a neutral position in political debate.

His remarks had dealt with a topic of public interest, namely the use of torture by the Spanish security forces in the fight against terrorism, a practice confirmed by numerous international human rights organisations. As to the Supreme Court\u2019s argument that his remarks had been without foundation since the proceedings relating to the complaints alleging torture had been discontinued, the applicant submitted firstly that he could not have known when he was making his remarks what the outcome of the criminal investigation would be, since the latter had taken place several months after the events; secondly, no final decision had been issued discontinuing the proceedings. In that connection, the applicant, referring to the judgment in Martinez Sala and Others v. Spain (no.\u00a058438/00, \u00a7 160, 2\u00a0November 2004), stated that, in Spain, numerous complaints alleging torture were filed away without further action being taken although no detailed investigation had been carried out. Furthermore, the monarch had granted pardons under the Spanish Constitution to numerous members of the Spanish security forces convicted of torture. The applicant cited by way of example the decision of the United Nations Committee Against Torture in the case of Kepa Urra Guridi v. Spain (Communication no. 212/2002, UN doc. CAT/C/34/D/212/2002). It was against this background that his remarks had to be seen; the applicant claimed that he had himself been subjected to torture following his arrest in July\u00a01987.",

Turkey, no. 35839/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05152, 22\u00a0February 2005), the applicant argued that the excessive protection afforded to the Crown under Spanish criminal law was incompatible with Article\u00a010 of the Convention. Whereas in the case of ordinary individuals and other institutions an insult had to be characterised as serious in order for the person concerned to be prosecuted, in the case of the Crown any kind of insult sufficed and was punishable. The offence of serious insult against the Crown was unique in carrying a prison sentence (of six months to two years); under ordinary law and in the case of other institutions, the penalty for serious insult was a fine. The provisions in question therefore conferred on the Crown \u201ca special privilege that [could not] be reconciled with modern practice and political conceptions\u201d (the applicant referred to Colombani and Others, cited above, \u00a7 68). The applicant alluded to the legislative trends in Council of Europe member States, most of which dealt with attacks against the sovereign under the ordinary law. Hence, making insults against the King a criminal offence was not necessary in a democratic society, especially as the offences of criminal defamation and proffering insults provided Heads of State or monarchs with sufficient remedy against remarks that damaged their honour.",

France, no. 12697/03, \u00a7 19, ECHR 2006-XIII, and Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July, cited above, \u00a7 45).",

He is certainly entitled to have his reputation protected, even when he is not acting in his private capacity, but the requirements of that protection have to be weighed against the interests of open discussion of political issues, since exceptions to freedom of expression must be interpreted narrowly (see, among other authorities, Pakdemirli, cited above, \u00a7 45, and Artun and G\u00fcvener v.

The Supreme Court, in overturning the applicant\u2019s acquittal by the Basque Country High Court of Justice, sentenced him to one year\u2019s imprisonment for serious insult against the King. It considered that the impugned remarks had directly targeted the King in person and the institution he embodied and that they had overstepped the limits of permissible criticism.",

The Court points out in that regard that a distinction needs to be made between statements of fact and value judgments. While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10. The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see, for example, Lindon, OtchakovskyLaurens and July, cited above, \u00a7 55). Furthermore, the requirement to furnish facts in support of a value judgment is less stringent if the information is already known to the general public (see Feldek v.\u00a0Slovakia, no. 29032/95, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2001VIII).",

The Court observes that there was a sufficiently strong link between the applicant\u2019s remarks and the allegations of ill-treatment made public by the editor-in-chief of Euskaldunon Egunkaria on his release. It further notes that the terms used by the applicant could be understood as forming part of a wider public debate on the possible implication of the State security forces in cases of illtreatment.",

The Court observes that, while some of the remarks made in the applicant\u2019s speech portrayed the institution embodied by the King in a very negative light, with a hostile connotation, they did not advocate the use of violence, nor did they amount to hate speech, which in the Court\u2019s view is the essential element to be taken into account (see, conversely, S\u00fcrek v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, \u00a7 62, ECHR 1999IV).

In that connection, the Court has already stated that providing increased protection by means of a special law on insults will not, as a rule, be in keeping with the spirit of the Convention. In its judgment in Colombani and Others, it examined section\u00a036 of the French Act of 29 July 1881, which has since been repealed, concerning offences against foreign Heads of State and diplomats. It observed that the application of section 36 of the 1881 French Act conferred on foreign Heads of State a special privilege, shielding them from criticism solely on account of their function or status; this, in the Court\u2019s view, could not be reconciled with modern practice and political conceptions. The Court therefore held that it was the special protection afforded to foreign Heads of State by section 36 that undermined freedom of expression, not their right to use the standard procedure available to everyone to complain if their honour had been attacked (see Colombani and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69). In Artun and G\u00fcvener, the Court took the view that its findings in Colombani and Others on the subject of foreign Heads of State applied with even greater force to a State\u2019s interest in protecting the reputation of its own Head of State. That interest, in the Court\u2019s view, could not serve as justification for affording the Head of State privileged status or special protection vis-\u00e0-vis the right to convey information and opinions concerning him (see Artun and G\u00fcvener, cited above, \u00a7 31; see also, with regard to excessive protection of the status of the President of the Republic in civil cases, Pakdemirli, cited above, \u00a7\u00a052).",

In Pakdemirli, the excessive protection afforded to the President of the Republic derived also from the fact that the holder of the office ceased to have the status of politician and acquired that of statesman (see Pakdemirli, cited above, \u00a7 51). In the Court\u2019s view, the fact that the King occupies a neutral position in political debate and acts as an arbitrator and a symbol of State unity should not shield him from all criticism in the exercise of his official duties or \u2013 as in the instant case \u2013 in his capacity as representative of the State which he symbolises, in particular from persons who challenge in a legitimate manner the constitutional structures of the State, including the monarchy. In that connection, the Court notes that the Basque Country High Court of Justice, which acquitted the applicant at first instance, observed that criticism of a constitutional institution was not excluded from the scope of the right to freedom of expression (see paragraph 13 above). The Court cannot but emphasise that freedom of expression is all the more important when it comes to conveying ideas which offend, shock or challenge the established order (see Women On Waves and Others v. Portugal, no. 31276/05, \u00a7 42, 3\u00a0February 2009). Furthermore, it considers that the fact that the King is \u201cnot liable\u201d under the Spanish Constitution, particularly with regard to criminal law, should not in itself act as a bar to free debate concerning possible institutional or even symbolic responsibility on his part in his position at the helm of the State, subject to respect for his personal reputation.",

Nor did the remarks in question criticise the manner in which the King performed his official duties in a particular sphere or attribute any individual responsibility to him in the commission of a specific criminal offence.
