In contrast to an objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies which must be raised by the respondent Government, the Court cannot set aside the application of the six-month rule solely because a government have not made a preliminary objection to that effect. Since the applicant did not resort to any domestic remedies capable of affording him redress, the sixmonth period started to run from the date of the acts or measures complained of. It follows that this complaint was raised more than six\u00a0months after the impugned detention period had ended. It must therefore be rejected as being out of time in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention. By contrast, the final decision regarding the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention between 5 and 8 August 2005 was that of the Regional Court dated 23 September 2005.

This approach is applicable in the circumstances of the present case, which concerns a deprivation of liberty without a judicial order. The Court considers that genuine respect for human rights requires it to continue examination of the complaint and dismisses the Government\u2019s objection. It further notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention or inadmissible on any other grounds.

The procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question, including the possibility for a detainee to be heard either in person or through some form of representation (see Mamedova v. Russia, no.\u00a07064/05, \u00a7 89, 1 June 2006, with further references). The scope of judicial review under Article 5 \u00a7 4 should be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the detention of a person to be lawful within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Koroleva v. Russia, no. 1600/09, \u00a7\u00a0110, 13\u00a0November 2012, with further references).",

Secondly, the scope of the judicial review, as reflected in the decisions of 8 August and 23 September 2005, was manifestly insufficient in that the Russian courts did not address the applicant\u2019s crucial argument about his unlawful detention in the immediately preceding period or give any reasons for extending the custodial measure (see Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 109-15). Thirdly, it took the Regional Court one and a half month to examine the appeal against the detention order of 8 August 2005 and almost four months for the appeal against the order of 30 January 2006, neither period can be considered compatible with the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Mamedova, cited above, \u00a7 96).",
