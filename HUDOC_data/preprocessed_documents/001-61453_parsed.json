The Court observes that, while an applicant is entitled to make use of his procedural right to extend his claim in a civil case, he must be aware that it may lead to delays the consequences of which he would have to bear (see Malicka-W\u0105sowska v. Poland, (dec.), no.\u00a041413/98, 5 April 2001). It is particularly true in a situation were modification of the claim results in the transfer of the case to a higher court and possibly in the repetition of some of the trial court's proceedings. The Court is of the opinion that when such extension of the claim takes place in the course of judicial proceedings which are diligently and promptly conducted, the Government cannot be held responsible for the resulting delays. On the other hand, if the proceedings have already been affected by clear delays, the extension of the claim may be regarded as the only way for the plaintiff to cope with inflation and to adjust his claim to the changing economic context. In such a situation, the applicant cannot be reasonably expected to bear the consequences of further delays resulting from his action, unless the Government proves that there was no link between the extension of the claim and the delays which have already occurred in the course of the proceedings.",

The Court observes that several substantial periods of inactivity occurred in the course of the proceedings. In particular, between January\u00a01993 and December 1996 as well as between October 2001 and March\u00a02003 the domestic court waited for expert opinions to be prepared and no hearings were held during these periods (see paragraphs\u00a015,\u00a022 and 25\u00a0above). In this regard the Court notes that while it is true that the domestic court had difficulty in obtaining a satisfactory expert opinion, nevertheless the expert's work in the context of judicial proceedings is supervised by a judge, who remains responsible for the preparation and speedy conduct of proceedings (see, the Proszak v.\u00a0Poland judgment of 16\u00a0December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII, \u00a7 44).
