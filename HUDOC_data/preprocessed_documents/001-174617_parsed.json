The committee emphasised the fact that the applicant had not mentioned the conviction or his \u201clong prison sentence\u201d in his application to be admitted as a trainee advocate, his curriculum vitae or in the other documents submitted in support. Information about the conviction had been relevant for assessing his reputation.

In setting out its reasons the Court of Honour had regard to the crimes committed by the applicant and noted that during the criminal court proceedings he had expressed no remorse (see paragraph 7 above). For the Court of Honour, even though the law did not directly require that a person disclose a prior conviction when submitting a request to become a trainee advocate, such an obligation stemmed from Article 8 (4) of the Law of the Bar, which required candidates to be of high moral character (nepriekai\u0161tinga reputacija). Similarly, point 13.2 of the Code of Ethics set out that an advocate had to act honestly and ethically, even if certain acts or behaviour that did not meet the requirements of the Law on the Bar or the Code of Ethics were not described specifically in that Code (see paragraph\u00a037 below). The Court of Honour considered that the crimes which the applicant had committed whilst working in law enforcement had been cynical and had shown great disrespect towards society. Moreover, he had committed those crimes while working in the legal field. In the light of such considerations, the Court of Honour was convinced that the applicant, who had a university degree and had previously had a law-related job, had deliberately withheld information about his prior conviction, because he had been aware that, if information not only about his crimes but also about the manner in which he had committed them had come to light, then the Bar Association would have rejected his application to become a trainee advocate. Lastly, the Court of Honour noted that the profession of advocate was defined not only by legal acts, but also by certain ethical rules, historic practices and society\u2019s legitimate expectations as to the assistance an advocate was to provide as part of his or her role. An advocate should therefore always adhere to the moral and legal standards and obligations, protect the professional honour and dignity of advocates and do nothing that would discredit the good name of the profession, the advocate\u2019s oath, or the notion of justice.",

It dealt with the applicant\u2019s allegations about procedural violations by the Court of Honour by noting that that court had merely postponed the case on 25 September and 25 October 2007, without examining it on the merits (see paragraph 19 above). The applicant\u2019s suggestion that the Court of Honour had issued a ruling on either of those dates that the applicant had not committed a disciplinary violation was therefore unfounded. Furthermore, J.K., the advocate who had been the president of the Court of Honour, had been questioned as a witness by the Vilnius Regional Court and had testified that he had not been biased against the applicant; he had only had an opinion about the particular actions performed by the applicant. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s allegation about a lack of impartiality on the part of J.K. had also been dismissed as unfounded by the Court of Honour. Lastly, the change in the composition of that court when the case had been decided on 23\u00a0November 2007, removing A.P., a member said by the applicant to have been favourable to him (see paragraph\u00a020 above), had not been a decisive factor because the court had been unanimous in its finding against the applicant. The Vilnius Regional Court thus dismissed the applicant\u2019s request to summon for questioning advocate A.P., who, according to the applicant, had participated in the hearing when his case had gone before the Court of Honour. On the basis of the written evidence, the first-instance court established that A.P. had not taken part in the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant.",

While observing that the conviction had expired, the court noted that the crimes had been committed when the applicant had been working in law enforcement. The manner in which those crimes had been committed and their scale did not allow for the assertion that the applicant had automatically regained the status of being of high moral character immediately after the conviction had been expunged. Were it otherwise, society\u2019s expectations as to the morals and ethics of representatives of the advocate\u2019s profession would not be met. Only people of high moral character could be trusted to work in the process of the implementation of justice. In other words, the applicant\u2019s actions had to be looked at to see not only if they had been in accordance with applicable laws, but also whether they had adhered to the requirements of professional ethics. That stemmed, inter alia, from Article 8 (4) and other provisions of the Law on the Bar, which provided that an advocate was liable to disciplinary sanctions, including disbarment, for breaches of professional ethics (see paragraph 34 below), and was something that had also been confirmed by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 43 below).",

The fact that, according to the applicant, his supervising advocate, several other advocates in \u0160iauliai and some members of the Bar Association Council had known about his prior conviction, did not absolve him from the obligation to provide information that was as comprehensive as possible when applying to the Bar, so that it would be possible to assess his reputation objectively and comprehensively. The Court of Honour had also been correct in holding that the applicant had consciously withheld that information because he had understood that the nature of his criminal acts would not have permitted him to be considered as a person of high moral character. In any case, if the applicant had had any doubts about whether the information about his prior conviction was relevant, he could have asked the Bar Association. Consequently, it had been legitimate for the Court of Honour to impose a disciplinary measure on the applicant by removing him from the list of trainee advocates.",

The Court of Honour\u2019s conclusion had been supported by point 12.1 of the Code of Ethics, which set out that the relationship between an advocate and the Bar was based on mutual respect and good-will assistance, and by point 13.2, which stated that an advocate must also adhere to the traditions and customs which corresponded to the common principles of ethics and decency (see paragraph 37 below). As a result, the Court of Honour had had grounds to impose a disciplinary penalty on the applicant and to strike his name off the list of trainee advocates on the basis of Articles 7 \u00a7 1 (4), 8 (4), 13 \u00a7 1 (1) and 35 of the Law on the Bar.",

Ignorance of requirements of laws discredited the advocate\u2019s profession and undermined its prestige. An advocate or trainee advocate who had breached imperative legal norms could not excuse that failing by alleging that he or she did not know the law or that the law was not sufficiently precise, because that person was bound to know the law and ethical requirements as part of his or her job. The activity of advocate was not only regulated by standards applicable to the general public, but also by special requirements set out in the laws regulating the advocate\u2019s profession and by professional ethics. The requirements for the applicant\u2019s behaviour, which were set out in the rules for professional ethics, were objectively necessary: only a person whose professional behaviour was beyond reproach could be entrusted to take part in the process of the implementation of justice. The notion of the implementation of justice would be discredited if any and every person was allowed to take part in that process, irrespective of his or her behaviour. The applicant\u2019s case therefore did not give grounds for cassation appeal because it followed established case-law and was not relevant for developing it.",

Assessing from the legal point of view, the actions of an advocate or trainee advocate, the specific function of the Bar and its role within the legal system of the State should be taken into consideration. The role of an advocate is to defend the rights and legitimate interests of the client by lawful ways and means and to seek the implementation of justice. The profession of an advocate is one of the professions whose representatives must comply with higher and stricter standards of conduct. Not only the common standards of conduct but also special requirements established both by the laws regulating the activity of the Bar and the rules of professional ethics are applicable in respect of an advocate\u2019s practice. The necessity for requirements established by the rules of professional ethics is an objective one: only a person of high moral character can be trusted to participate in the process of administration of justice. Permitting anyone to participate in this process, without regard to his or her conduct, would discredit the idea of administration of justice.",

As far as the Government knew, the applicant had continued to work as a lawyer in the private sector after being dropped from the list of trainee advocates. Moreover, in Bigaeva the Court had held that the profession of advocate had certain aspects of public service.

In his submissions to the Supreme Court, which was the last instance to examine his complaints, the applicant also referred to the fact that his conviction had expired (see paragraphs 30 and 32 above), a circumstance which was directly related to his argument that he was of high moral character. In fact, the Supreme Court even provided certain explanations and answers to the applicant\u2019s complaints and examined the question of reputation for advocates, which is at the heart of this case (see paragraph\u00a031 above; also see Beiere v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a030954/05, \u00a7\u00a037, 29\u00a0November 2011). Contrary to what has been implied by the Government, the Court does not consider that the question of the disclosure of his conviction to the Bar Association was an issue that was fundamentally distinct from the all-inclusive matter of reputation already raised by the applicant (see paragraph\u00a054 above). Furthermore, under the domestic law, the Supreme Court alone had the task of deciding whether the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law raised questions of such importance that they merited examination (see paragraph 48 above). Last but not least, the applicant pointed out to the Supreme Court that the prohibition on him practising law was in breach of Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph\u00a030 above).

Accordingly, his prior conviction should not have been sufficient to disbar him for lack of high moral character. To make matters worse, he had been treated unfairly, and in a discriminatory manner, for there were lawyers with previous conviction who had been admitted to the Bar in Lithuania after their conviction had expired.

The fact that a criminal record, as such, was not an obstacle to admit others to the Bar had also been acknowledged by the President of the Court of Honour himself (see paragraph 26 above). The applicant also disputed the reasons behind the disciplinary action taken against him. On that point, the applicant stated that his criminal record had been known to his supervising advocate and some members of the Bar Association Council, and that the documents which needed to be filled in when applying to the Bar had not required that a candidate indicate any prior conviction. It was also because of unfairness of the decision making and partiality of the Court of Honour that the applicant could not have proven his case.",

The domestic court decisions in his case had been final and had meant that he could never become an advocate owing to a lack of high moral character.

The requirement of high moral character for those seeking to become an advocate thus clearly stemmed from domestic law and was supported by the well-established and consistent practice of the domestic courts. That caselaw, which the applicant could reasonably be assumed to have been aware of, made it clear that a person\u2019s earlier activities or behaviour could also come under scrutiny. Furthermore, high professional standards for advocates, including a requirement to be of high moral character, had been envisaged in the pursuit of the legitimate aim of safeguarding the interests of the public. Given the special nature of the work of advocates, namely the protection of the rights of others in need, such as safeguarding the right to a defence, the State had a legitimate aim when setting out requirements for people wishing to practise law as advocates, since they participated in the administration of justice.",

Prior conviction had an inevitable impact on a person\u2019s ability to meet such requirements. Sometimes, a criminal conviction could have a permanent impact and a person might never be considered as being of the required high moral character. To the Government\u2019s knowledge, such was the legal regulation as established in Latvia, Estonia and Turkey; in Poland, disbarment might be permanent following disciplinary proceedings. In other countries, presumption of the lack of high moral character might be valid for up to ten years (the Government referred to Belgium, Croatia and Portugal). There was also a common practice that the expiry of the conviction did not automatically mean that a person could not be reproached from a professional-ethics point of view. Usually the question of regaining one\u2019s good name was left to the discretion of certain authorities, which also took into account the gravity of the offence and whether it had been committed while performing a professional activity (the Government referred to the practice in France, Austria, Slovenia and the Czech Republic).",

It had therefore been necessary to take action against the applicant, given the advocate\u2019s role in the system of the administration of justice and the requirements of higher standards of behaviour imposed on that profession. Moreover, the applicant could always re-apply for admission to the Bar in future, or ask a court to reconsider whether he had regained the status of being of high moral character.

Furthermore, the Court of Appeal also relied on points\u00a012.1 and 13.2 of the Code of Ethics, which also applies to trainee advocates (see paragraphs 29 and 37 above), and which, as considered by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, also applied to the applicant\u2019s situation (see paragraphs 26 and 29\u201331 above). The courts also referred to numerous other provisions of the Law on the Bar, of the Code of Ethics, and the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law to explain their decisions that the applicant did not meet the criteria applicable to candidates to the Bar (see paragraphs\u00a021, 24, 28, 29 and 31 above).

In fact, the domestic authorities underlined that the applicant had committed his crimes while working in law enforcement, and that those crimes had been extremely cynical in nature, which obviously contradicted the requirements of professional ethics (see paragraphs 21, 24 and\u00a028 above). The Court also notes that in 2000, in finding the applicant guilty, the \u0160iauliai Regional Court also prohibited him from working in law enforcement and the justice system for five years (see paragraph 7 above). Given the nature of the crimes the applicant committed, the Court does not consider it unreasonable that first the Court of Honour and then the civil courts found that it was inappropriate to regard the applicant as being a person of high moral character so as to qualify to work in the justice system. In that connection, the Court notes that in its Recommendation R\u00a0(2000)\u00a021, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has emphasised that the profession of an advocate must be exercised in such a way that it strengthens the rule of law (see paragraph\u00a049 above). Furthermore, the principles applicable to advocate\u2019s profession contain such values as the dignity and honour of the legal profession, the integrity and good standing of the individual advocate, respect towards professional colleagues, as well as respect for the fair administration of justice (see paragraph 50 above). The Court has already noted that the applicant\u2019s crimes caused strains with his former colleagues (see paragraph 17 above). It therefore inclines to the view that the reasons given by the domestic courts can be regarded as relevant in terms of the legitimate aims pursued (see paragraphs 28, 29 and\u00a031 above).",

The Bar Association, the Court of Honour and the civil courts also noted that a person who wished to become an advocate had an obligation to cooperate honestly and fully with the Bar Association and to disclose all relevant information, which the applicant had failed to do (see paragraphs\u00a015,\u00a016,\u00a021,\u00a025 and\u00a029 above). Notwithstanding the absence of an explicit, written requirement to indicate previous, even expired, conviction when applying to the Bar, the Court does not find it unreasonable that the domestic authorities should conclude that such an obligation flowed from notions of honesty and ethics and the idea that the relationship between an advocate and the Bar Association must be based on mutual respect and good-will assistance (see paragraphs 21, 25 and 29 above). Likewise, the Court shares the Court of Honour\u2019s conclusion that the applicant should have understood the significance of such information for his application and therefore the need to provide it to the Bar Association when his aptness for the Bar was being considered (see paragraph 21 above). In that connection, the Court also reiterates that professional associations of lawyers play a fundamental role in ensuring the protection of human rights and must therefore be able to act independently (see paragraph\u00a049 above), and that respect towards professional colleagues and self-regulation of the legal profession are paramount (see paragraph 50 above). It is plain that the Bar Association could never perform that self-regulation function effectively if it was deprived of full information about a person wishing to become an advocate.",

The applicant\u2019s contention that the domestic courts held that he could never hold a position as trainee advocate for lack of high moral character (see paragraph\u00a063 above) is therefore devoid of any basis. Neither has the applicant claimed that after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in his case in 2009 he again approached the Bar Association to become an advocate because his reputation had improved. The Court therefore is satisfied that in the present case the domestic courts carried out a careful analysis and sought to strike a balance between the protection of the applicant\u2019s private life and the need to protect the rights of others and the justice system as a whole.",

However, the Court cannot but note the statement of the president of the Court of Honour that those other lawyers, unlike the applicant, had not hidden a previous conviction from the Bar Association (see paragraph 26 above). As to the reputational requirements applicable to bailiffs or civil servants, an argument explicitly relied on by the applicant during the domestic proceedings (see paragraphs\u00a022 and 26 above), the Court observes that the requirements on reputation applied to them were somewhat comparable to those applied to advocates because the severity and nature of the crime, or expiry of the conviction, determined whether a person could be held as being morally fit to take up those jobs (see paragraphs 41 and 42 above). Moreover, Lithuania\u2019s reputation-related restrictions on judges and prosecutors were at the relevant time even stricter than those applicable to advocates. In particular, a person who had been convicted of any crime, irrespective of its seriousness or whether it was intentional or due to negligence, could not become a judge or prosecutor (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above).",

There is nothing in the procedure followed by those courts that would lead this Court to a conclusion that the applicant was deprived of an opportunity to prove his complaints under Article 8 and/or the that decision-making process leading to measures interfering with his Article 8 rights was unfair (see, mutatis mutandis, McMichael v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 24\u00a0February 1995, \u00a7 87, Series A no.\u00a0307-B).",
