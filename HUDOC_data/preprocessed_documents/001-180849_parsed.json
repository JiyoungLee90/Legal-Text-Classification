This positive obligation entails above all a primary duty on the State to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life (see, for example, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a046477/99, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2004XII). While there is no absolute obligation under Article 2 of the Convention for all prosecutions to result in conviction or in a particular sentence, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow life-endangering offences to go unpunished (see, among other authorities, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2004-XII). The main purposes of imposing criminal sanctions are retribution as a form of justice for victims and general deterrence aimed at prevention of new violations and upholding the rule of law. However, neither of these aims can be obtained without alleged perpetrators being brought to justice. Failure by the authorities to pursue the prosecution of the most probable direct perpetrators undermines the effectiveness of the criminal-law mechanism aimed at prevention, suppression and punishment of unlawful killings. Compliance with the State\u2019s procedural obligations under Article 2 requires the domestic legal system to demonstrate its capacity and willingness to enforce criminal law against those who have unlawfully taken the life of another (see Jeli\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a057856/11, \u00a7 90, 12 June 2014).",
