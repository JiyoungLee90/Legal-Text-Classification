In determining whether there has been a breach of Article 2 or 3, the responsibility of a State under the Convention, arising from the acts of its organs, agents and servants, is not to be confused with the domestic legal issues of individual criminal responsibility under examination in national proceedings (see Golubeva v. Russia, no. 1062/03, \u00a7 98, 17\u00a0December 2009, with further references). As confirmed in substance by the domestic court on judicial review (see paragraph 50 above), the applicant\u2019s complaint related to possible ill-treatment and abusive use of physical force, rather than abuse of power. However, the Court does not have at its disposal enough material to conclude that the legal classification given to the applicant\u2019s complaint was such as to impinge upon the inquiring authority\u2019s ability to establish the relevant factual and legal elements in terms of Article\u00a03 of the Convention, or adversely affect the effectiveness of the investigation, which is discussed below.",

This official preferred to rely on the trial record containing the applicant\u2019s testimony in relation to the circumstances of his arrest. Indeed, the Court observes that there was a relatively short lapse of time between the alleged ill-treatment and the submission of the applicant\u2019s criminal case for trial. The trial court heard the arresting officers as witnesses, who were warned that they could face criminal liability for false testimony or for a refusal to testify. As follows from the detailed transcripts of the trial hearings, the applicant and his lawyer were afforded the opportunity to examine these officers and cast doubt on the authenticity and credibility of their statements, at least in so far as they were relevant to the determination of the criminal charge against the applicant.",

It also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised and facilitates the establishment of facts in a case, since with the passage of time, any fair examination of the issues raised is rendered problematic (see Sabri G\u00fcne\u015f v.

Where it was clear from the outset however that no effective remedy was available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of the knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see Ananyev and Others v. , nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7 72, 10\u00a0January 2012, with further references). Article 35 \u00a7 1 cannot be interpreted however in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, the Court considers that it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 to take the start of the six month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Norkin, cited above, \u00a7 15).",

The applicant had been entrapped by State agents and S., who had been acting under their instruction and supervision, into committing the criminal offence. The factual basis for the test purchase had been clearly insufficient and its purpose had been to create a criminal offence. The purchase had not been properly authorised in conformity with the OSAA. There had been no prior authorisation or subsequent supervision by a judicial authority. Without effective legal assistance at the pre-trial stage of the case, he had only been able to raise complaints in this connection during the trial.

While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a054810/00, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2006IX).

Even if the \u201ctest purchase\u201d that led to the applicant\u2019s arrest and conviction was affected by some procedural defects from the standpoint of domestic law, nothing suggests that they were of such an extent and character as to make the applicant\u2019s conviction unfair within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Trifontsov v.
