However, in assessing the reasonableness of the time that elapsed after that date, account must be taken of the state of proceedings at the time. Thus, the proceedings lasted over 9 years and 4 months, of which 6 years and 7 months falls within the Court\u2019s competence ratione temporis (from 11 September 1997 until 8 April 2004). The case was heard four times by two instances and once, at the end, by the Supreme Court.",

Although the Court is not in a position to analyse the quality of the adjudication by the domestic courts, it considers that, since the remittal of cases for re-examination is usually ordered as a result of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see Wierciszewska v.\u00a0Poland, no. 41431/98, \u00a7 46, 25 November 2003).",
