The applicant argued that the adoption was void because the father of the child had not consented to the adoption. She further argued that at the time of giving her consent she had been either in a temporary or in a pathological state of mental disturbance, which had prevented the free exercise of her will. She had not been aware of what she had been doing.

This had aggravated the depression she was already suffering from due to the accidental stillbirth in 1992. He put the applicant\u2019s decision to put the twin sisters up for adoption down to her desire to \u201cget her husband back\u201d.

No other member of the Youth Office had replaced the absent staff member. In September 2001 the applicant received photos of the children. When she mentioned that she was thinking about revoking her consent to the adoption, staff of the Bielefeld Youth Office threatened to stop her contact with the children. A letter that the applicant wrote to the adoptive parents and handed over to the Bielefeld Youth Office was returned with the remark that the applicant should seek psychological treatment. The applicant based her claim for contact on Article 1666 and additionally on Article 1685 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below).

An analogous application of the Article was, according to a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court of 9 April 2003 (no. 1 BvR 1493/96), not possible. Article 1685 of the Civil Code was applicable, but would not grant contact rights to the applicant as she did not fulfil the legal requirements. The applicant could not be considered as a person who had cared for the children for an extended period of time. In fact, she had only cared for them for two weeks. Even if the criteria of the Federal Constitutional Court in the above-mentioned decision \u2013 whether there was a social and family relationship \u2013 were applied, the applicant could not be granted contact, as she had not created a significant social and family relationship with the children. The time of pregnancy and the two weeks after the birth did not suffice. The Civil Code grants to the adoptive parents the sole right to establish, grant or deny contact with the children even in respect of the natural mother.

She further argued that the criteria of a \u201clong duration\u201d, when applied to parent-child relationships, had to be interpreted from the perspective of the child, whose concept of time differed from that of adults. The natural mother was always a \u201crelevant person\u201d in the sense of Article 1685 of the Civil Code, and this evaluation did not change even after the natural mother ceased to have legal responsibilities. Regarding the right to information, she argued that although she had consented to the adoption, she remained the natural mother and the constitutional protection of the family applied to her. Even the Federal Constitutional Court had acknowledged that during pregnancy a psycho-social relationship between mother and the foetus was established (judgment of 29 January 2003 \u2013 1 BvL 20/99 and 1\u00a0BvR 933/01).

Two hearings, one on 15\u00a0December\u00a02003 and the other on 30 January 2004, had taken place. Regarding the length of the proceedings before the district court, the Schleswig Court of Appeal found that that court had dealt adequately with the complex case within seven and a half months. Concerning the contact rights of the applicant, the court found that only Article 1685 Civil Code was applicable. Although the applicant was the children\u2019s natural mother, she did not belong to the circle of people who had lived in \u201cdomestic community\u201d with the child for a long period of time. According to the court, only foster parents are covered by this terminology. Furthermore, in order to determine \u201ca long period of time\u201d one had to establish whether a child had come to accept that his or her \u201crelevant surroundings\u201d (Bezugswelt) were with the individual in question. In the present case, the time of pregnancy was irrelevant, as an unborn child does not have a concept of its surroundings. Article 1685 Civil Code was in line with the constitutional protection of the family. The natural mother ceased to have contact or custody rights at the moment of adoption. The legal provisions regarding adoption were aimed at the undisturbed development of the child, and they served the best interests of the adopted child, who had to be fully integrated into the adoptive family; the biological family became irrelevant in accordance with the law. Even if the criteria of the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court of 9 April 2003 regarding the natural father of a child born out of wedlock were applied, the natural mother would have to have lived with the children for a considerable time, which was not the case here. As the applicant knew, the right to contact on the basis of a contractual agreement could not be enforced by the family courts, as they were not empowered to regulate such matters. Article 1666 of the Civil Code did not give grounds for a different solution.",

In the instant case, there are elements which suggest that the German courts\u2019 decisions could be considered in the light of a positive obligation. However, the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In determining whether or not such an obligation exists, regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the general interest and the interests of the individual; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see, for instance, Mikuli\u0107 v.

At the core of this lies the intention to safeguard the adopted child\u2019s right to develop and bond with his or her adoptive parents. The same applies to the adoptive parents who also hold a right to protect their private and family life, including a corresponding right to bond with their adopted children and to develop undisturbed family life. In pursuing this aim the German provisions are in conformity with Article 20 of the 1967 European Convention on the Adoption of Children, as well as with Article 22 of the 2008 revised version of that Convention, although the Court takes note that Germany has neither signed nor ratified this revised Convention. The Conventions provide for anonymous adoptions, the purpose of which, according to the explanatory reports of those conventions, is to avoid difficulties which may arise from the natural parents\u2019 knowledge of the adopter\u2019s identity. The Court observes in this context that even if the more recent Convention allows for less strict regulations on adoption, it does not favour such an approach. In this context it is also necessary to take into account if a State has rules on foster care which allow natural parents to retain, to a great extent, their legal status as parents. This is the case for Germany. The Court notes that the applicant was made aware of the existence of foster care prior to the adoption process even if, as the applicant alleges, the information given was not comprehensive (compare paragraph 12, above).",

The Government assessed the legal value of such arrangements as mere declarations of intent which were not enforceable against the adoptive parents\u2019 will. According to the Government, making such decisions enforceable was not considered expedient as adoptive parents should have freedom in the exercise of their custody rights.

There is no indication that the domestic courts failed to sufficiently establish the relevant facts, in particular the personal links between the applicant and the children, although they did not order an expert opinion on the children\u2019s best interests.

Under domestic law, her right to parental custody was \u2018suspended\u2019 at that stage. Her consent only became effective and thus, irrevocable, on the date it was \u2018received by the family court\u2019. No other court date being mentioned in the judgment such receipt, it may be assumed, became effective on 21 June 2001 when the Court took judicial notice of the decision of the applicant together with the half-open nature of the adoption agreed upon between the three parties. It then made the adoption order, accordingly. It was only at that point that the applicant\u2019s rights which, previously had been suspended, were now extinguished.",

This agreement, to which the authorities were party, clearly, led the applicant to believe that she would continue to receive information about her children after they had been adopted. Whilst the district court recognised that photographs would be sent to her, annually, this did not transpire after the adoption order was made. The adoptive parents retained the exclusive power to decide whether or not such an agreement was to be honoured and the applicant was left without recourse. The fact that statutory bodies can enter into \u2018half-open\u2019 adoption agreements with birth mothers before an adoption order is made creates, unfortunately, the entirely false and misleading impression that such agreements can have a binding effect upon the subsequent adoption that follows.",

Given the gravity of what is issue, there ought to be no room for the kind of vagueness and uncertainty that prevailed in this case. There is, to my mind, a positive obligation on a State that permits of such \u2018half-open\u2019 adoptions to ensure that legal clarity is unequivocally available to a vulnerable birth mother who enters into such a pre-adoption arrangement. Where the State is party to or involved in the making of such an agreement with a birth mother, it is incumbent upon the authorities to ensure that she is left in no doubt as to its utter worthlessness in the event that adoptive parents withdraw therefrom after an adoption order is made. To my mind, the State should not be complicit in a situation where vulnerable mothers take such a vital decision concerning their private and family life based on agreements that are entirely unenforceable. The general lack of clarity and the failure to provide the applicant with any procedures whereby the validity of the \u2018halfopen\u2019 adoption agreement could have been tested and, if necessary, enforced demonstrates a failure on the part of the respondent State to have clear and unambiguous legal principles regulating such a vital area of the applicant\u2019s private and family life.",

                        "content": "There is clear evidence before the Court that the applicant was psychologically traumatised at the time when she made her decision to consent to adoption. The domestic authorities were aware of the fact that the applicant had been suffering from \u2018depression\u2019, \u2018panic attacks\u2019 and \u2018suicidal tendencies\u2019 (\u00a7 11). It is common knowledge that such conditions may have an impact upon a person\u2019s capacity to make a free and informed decision. Given the obvious psychological difficulties under which the applicant laboured shortly after having given birth, it seems to me that the authorities were obliged to dispel any doubts as to her capacity to make a free and informed consent prior to encouraging and facilitating the adoption of her children. Despite earlier diagnoses of \u2018depression\u2019, \u2018panic attacks\u2019 and \u2018suicidal tendencies\u2019, no objective psychiatric assessment of the applicant\u2019s capacity to consent was made at the relevant time. A belated examination of her earlier capacity cannot replace the need for such an assessment to be made at the time when her decision was taken. To my mind, once on notice of such clear vulnerability on the part of the applicant, the authorities were obliged to ensure that it had independent expert evidence of capacity to consent prior to its facilitation and encouragement of adoption in this case. I do not suggest that in every case of adoption the authorities are obliged to obtain independent expert evidence of capacity to consent. However, where there are clear indications that questions arise in relation to such capacity then, in my view, such an obligation arises.",
