According to the applicant\u2019s architect, in 2009 the apartment had a sale value of EUR\u00a0198,000 and a rent value of EUR\u00a0608.19 monthly or EUR\u00a07,298.28 annually. It was of relevance that couple P. had made improvements to the apartment, and yet according to the applicant\u2019s architect the apartment in 2013 was valued for the purposes of sale at EUR 100,000 bearing in mind that it had been leased for a long time. In his view had it been free from lease it would be worth EUR 140,000. According to a courtappointed expert the sale value in 2014 was EUR 152,000. Relying on the sale value of the courtappointed expert the Constitutional Court considered that the rental value must have been around EUR 5,600 annually. When taking into account the improvements made by couple P. and the fact that the property might not have been constantly rented out, the Constitutional Court considered that a fair rent would be between EUR 3,000 and 4,000 annually. Under the contract of lease, couple\u00a0P. were paying EUR 1,186.46 which, in light of the public interest of the measure, was not entirely disproportionate, amounting as it did to around half of its real rental value. However, the law left little possibility of the applicant ever recovering his property, and the increase in rent every three years, according to law, was of no comfort given that it only reflected inflation increases. Moreover, there existed no mechanism to establish a fair rent in the light of the needs of the owner versus those of the lessee. It followed that Section 12 of the Ordinance did not respect the principle of proportionality required by the Convention and the applicant\u2019s property rights were therefore breached.",

Moreover, generally the Constitutional Court also ordered applicants who had been successful in their claims to pay part of the costs of the proceedings. They made reference to a number of domestic cases (see the list set out in Grech and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053).",

It was only in some of those cases that the Constitutional Court ordered, instead, that the tenants could no longer rely on the relevant law to maintain title to the property. The applicant considered that the latter order was not tantamount to an eviction order. While it was true that, like in the present case, once the Constitutional Court had ordered that the tenants could no longer rely on the relevant provisions of law to retain title to the property, an owner is sometimes successful in evicting the tenant, in the applicant\u2019s view such a process was burdensome and entailed another set of proceedings. In the applicant\u2019s case, following the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 29\u00a0April 2016, he instituted eviction proceedings which were decided on 30\u00a0May 2017 and physical possession of the property was only effectively achieved in September 2017. This meant that that he had to incur further expenses and that he continued to lose rent for nearly a year and a half after the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment finding that he had been suffering a breach of his property rights. It followed that the Constitutional Court had not adequately remedied the violation it had found.",

There is no doubt that, in law, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction could annul an order and evict a tenant (as sometimes ordered by the first-instance constitutional jurisdiction, see paragraph 43 in fine above), which measure would have prevented the continuation of the violation. However, it is clear, from the case-law relied on by the Government, that in situations such as those of the present case, namely where as a result of a protected rent regime (such as that arising from Chapter 158 of the Laws of Malta at issue in the present case) the owners have suffered an excessive burden leading to a violation, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction, and in particular the Constitutional Court on appeal, do not take such action. More particularly, the Constitutional Court revokes such an action when it was ordered by the first-instance court. Indeed, the Government have not provided one example of a final finding ordering eviction, despite having been requested to do so, and despite the fact that numerous violations of the kind have been found at the domestic level. In similar circumstances, in Apap Bologna (concerning violations arising from requisition orders) the Court found that, despite having the power to do so, in practice, the Constitutional Court had repeatedly failed to take the required action which would bring the violation to an end (ibid., \u00a7\u00a086).",

This course of action, however, has not been popular with the constitutional jurisdictions, save for one particular case at first-instance, submitted by the Government, which gave an allencompassing remedy, including a temporary future rent. In John\u00a0Mattei et (cited above) the first-instance court ordered the eviction of the tenants and the Housing Authority to find alternative accommodation for them. It also ordered the Housing Authority to pay EUR 800 monthly in rent to the applicants until the eviction took place. That judgment must be praised by this Court, as it takes an approach which provides a solution to all the concerns raised by it in Apap Bologna, and conforms to the principles of adequate redress. Such an impeccably comprehensive remedial action was revoked by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 5\u00a0October 2018 and the Court has not been informed that this course of action has been adopted by the constitutional jurisdictions, including the Constitutional Court, in other cases. That said, the Court reiterates that in the event that the constitutional jurisdictions award a higher future rent (to be paid by the Government, with the possibility of an arrangement with the tenants who would have for years benefitted from a generous regime), eviction would not always be necessary. Indeed, when the measure did pursue a legitimate aim (such as the social protection of needy tenants), the adaptation of the future rent to present circumstances might be sufficient to repair the existing disproportionality and thus bring the violation to an end.",

From the domestic caselaw brought to the Court\u2019s attention by the Government, that same action appears to have become rather customary, at least since 2016, and remains so to date despite a legislative amendment in 2018 which attempts to stultify court pronouncements to that effect, and which the Government felt was important to bring to the Court\u2019s attention, albeit for the wrong reasons. However, the Court will not enter into an examination of the 2018 amendments, which are irrelevant to the present case, the facts of which came to an end in September 2017 and which have escaped any repercussions resulting from the application of the 2018 amendments.

However, the Court still has doubts as to this approach. Unfortunately, the parties\u2019 limited submissions have shed little light on the situation pertaining to eviction proceedings in general in such cases. No other cases of eviction proceedings in similar circumstances have been brought to the Court\u2019s attention by the parties. In consequence, the Court is unable to establish whether such proceedings are generally, inter alia, too lengthy or too expensive. In this connection the Court reiterates that the speed of remedial action is also relevant to the effectiveness of a remedy and that successive procedures further burden applicants with supplementary legal costs and expenses (see, mutatis mutandis, Edward and Cynthia Zammit Maempel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a085).",

Why does an applicant have to undertake another set of proceedings with connected expenses, and continue to suffer the violation for a number of months or years, if its result is automatic? In what way is the applicant redressed for the months or years during which the eviction proceedings are pursued and during which the owners continue to suffer the upheld violation?
