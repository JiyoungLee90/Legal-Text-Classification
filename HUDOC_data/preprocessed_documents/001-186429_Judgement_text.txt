The case originated in an application (no. 16796/15) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Ms Vinka Ćorić (“the applicant”), on 31 March 2015.
The applicant was represented by Mr D. Kozomora, a lawyer practising in Novi Sad. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 28 June 2016 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government while the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Novi Sad.
The proceedings began on 19 November 1999 when a third private party brought a lawsuit concerning his tenancy rights in respect of a flat owned by a respondent. The applicant acted as an intervener in these proceedings on the side of the respondent since she had previously signed a tenancy agreement with him.
On 8 April 2003 the first instance court suspended the proceedings (mirovanje postupka).
On 20 August 2003, 20 October 2005 and 13 May 2009 the first instance court terminated the proceedings having deemed the lawsuit as withdrawn due to the fact that the parties had failed to appear at the scheduled hearings. All three of these decisions were subsequently quashed on appeal.
On 29 March 2012 the first instance court rendered a judgment in favour of the respondent and the applicant.
On 22 August 2012 this judgment was upheld on appeal.
On 28 September 2012 the applicant lodged a further appeal with the Constitutional Court alleging a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time.
On 10 February 2015 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicant’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time, but rejected her claim for non-pecuniary damages stating that the finding of a violation alone constituted sufficient redress for the said breach. In so doing it noted, inter alia, that the applicant had significantly contributed to the length of proceedings in question.
