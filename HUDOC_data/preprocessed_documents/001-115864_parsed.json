The passage of time does not mean either that a child\u2019s need to know his or her both parents and to have the paternity confirmed would disappear but it may even grow.

Even though the applicant had received child support from her putative father, it did not mean that the latter\u2019s paternity had been established. The applicant had known, or at least had had grounds for assuming, who her father was. She had suspected already as a teenager, that is, before the entry into force of the Paternity Act, that her mother\u2019s husband was not her biological father. She could have checked that in the church register, where the information had been correct, and initiated proceedings. The reform of family legislation, including the paternity laws, had been one of the main legal reforms of the 1970s and it had been widely publicised. The applicant, being an adult during the five-year period, must have been aware of the law reform and the new possibility to have her alleged father\u2019s paternity established by a court decision. The five-year time limit was thus proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, namely the general interest in protecting legal certainty of family relationships.",

Cyprus, no. 23890/02, ECHR 2007XIV (extracts)). The Court has also on several occasions found that it has difficulties in accepting inflexible limitation periods which do not provide any exceptions to the application of that period (see, mutatis mutandis, Shofman v. , cited above, \u00a7 43; Gr\u00f6nmark v.

The main problem therefore is the absolute nature of the time-limit rather than its dies a quo as such. As a result of this rigid time-limit, as upheld by the Supreme Court, the applicant was deprived of the possibility of obtaining a judicial determination of the paternity of her biological father. She was deprived of this right even though she was in a situation where she had not had any realistic opportunity to go to court during the limitation period due to the fact that she, at the time, had no reason to suspect what her origins were (see, mutatis mutandis, Phinikaridou v. Cyprus, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062; and Turnal\u0131 v. Turkey, no. 4914/03, \u00a7 44, 7 April 2009).",

In the present case, the national courts did not have any possibility to balance the competing interests but only concluded that the applicant\u2019s claim was time-barred. Thus, the national courts could not consider at all whether or not the general interest in protecting legal certainty of family relationships or the interest of the father and his family outweighed the applicant\u2019s right to have an opportunity to seek a judicial determination of paternity. The Court considers that such a straightforward restriction of the applicant\u2019s right to institute proceedings for the judicial determination of paternity was not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In this connection the Court reiterates that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 24, Series A no. 32).",

Therefore, in that case, the time-limit was left inapplicable on the strength of Article 106 of the Constitution (see KKO 2012:11).",

In view of the above, the Court finds that a fair balance was not struck in the present case between the different interests involved and, therefore, that there has been a failure to secure the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her private life.",

She was 22 years old when the Paternity Act entered into force on 1 October 1976. At that time the church register contained the correct information about the paternity of the applicant. In such a situation, she could have easily checked the information in the church register and initiated the appropriate proceedings to establish paternity within the time-limit defined by Finnish law.",

The judgment of the District Court of 18 June 2003 confirms that the applicant, since her teenage years, had doubts about the identity of her biological father. In such a context, according to the District Court, the applicant could have initiated the proceedings within the statutory time-limit. I note further that the Court of Appeal upheld, on the same grounds, the decision of the District Court.",
