The proceedings had made it clear that F.S.\u2019s expert report had been deficient. F.S. had been appointed by the public prosecutor and had delivered the basis for a bill of indictment, which showed that he was biased. F.S. had to be considered as a witness for the prosecution and not as an impartial expert assisting the court. Moreover, under Article 126 \u00a7 4 of the CCP a challenge for bias against an official expert could not be made on the grounds that he had previously been appointed as official expert in the preliminary investigations. They argued that this provision was not in line with the right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention, as they did not have a real chance to counter F.S.\u2019s expert report. This was aggravated by the fact that the expert reports commissioned by the applicants and their co-accused and submitted to the trial court had not been admitted to the file and the experts had not been summoned as requested.

At the trial, the applicants had the opportunity to question the appointment of F.S. On 18 July 2012 they requested that F.S.\u2019s expert report be excluded from the file and that F.S. be heard as a witness for the prosecution and not as an expert. The reasons they gave for that request were the inadequacy of the findings and the opinion of F.S. They claimed that he was not professionally qualified to answer questions for assessing the reasonableness of the fee claimed by D.B. After examining the submissions, the Regional Court refused their request, holding that given the content of the file and the results obtained so far in the trial, it had not been established that the expert was biased. The Supreme Court also considered in detail the appointment and activities of F.S. and upheld the Regional Court\u2019s decision in that regard. The applicants had had sufficient opportunities to question the report prepared by F.S. with the help of the private experts they had commissioned. The opinions of a private expert commissioned by the applicants had been transmitted to F.S. in the preliminary proceedings. The expert\u2019s detailed comments became part of the court\u2019s case file. The content of the private expert\u2019s opinions was thus included in the proceedings without being formally included in the case file or read out at the trial hearing. During the trial, F.S. answered questions put to him by the applicants on 9 August 2012 for more than two and a half hours regarding issues of methodology and discussed with them the content of his report. Sufficient time had been made available for the preparation of those questions. The applicants relied on the assistance of private experts providing them with the necessary expert knowledge and indicating possible problematic aspects of the expert report during the questioning of F.S.",

He was instructed to submit a report dealing with two questions: firstly, whether the services provided by D.B. were comparable to services normally offered by an investment bank in similar circumstances; and secondly, what remuneration would be appropriate and reasonable for the services D.B. had provided. F.S. had submitted his expert report and commented on the reports submitted by the private experts commissioned by the defence. On the basis of his findings, the public prosecutor had filed a bill of indictment. In the trial the Klagenfurt Regional Court also appointed F.S. as expert (Article 126 \u00a7 1 CCP). On the question of whom to appoint as an expert, the court was not bound by any request from the parties (see Article 254 CCP). Nor was there any provision requiring the court to appoint as an expert someone who had already been involved in the preliminary proceedings.",

On the contrary, they did not contest the Government\u2019s argument that F.S. had been chosen precisely because he had not previously been involved in legal and political disputes in Austria. Nor did F.S.\u2019s remuneration depend on whether the accused were convicted or not. F.S. was not, economically or otherwise, dependent on the public prosecutor\u2019s office.

Although the legal regulation granted the officially appointed expert a special status in the trial and allowed him to question witnesses and the accused on his own, he did not play any active role in the trial (see para. 59). The applicants had also been free to rely on assistance by private experts for support in the trial, for example when questioning the expert. One private expert was present at the trial, sitting at the defence\u2019s bench and could support the applicants in their questioning of the court appointed expert. Furthermore, the applicants did not show that F.S.\u2019s conduct in the trial gave reasons to doubt his impartiality.",

Rather, it examined the allegations as to the bias of F.S. and his lack of competence in the concrete case but eventually dismissed them as unfounded. Only insofar as the applicants relied on the simple fact that F.S. had, in the preliminary investigations been appointed by the Public Prosecutor, the Regional Court rejected the challenge on the basis of Article 126 \u00a7 4 CCP. The Court therefore considers that the applicants had the possibility to challenge the expert F.S. for bias if, judging from the concrete steps taken in the preliminary investigations, any doubt was cast on his impartiality. As far as they made use of this possibility, the Klagenfurt Regional Court examined their allegations in substance and dismissed them as unfounded (see paragraph 54 above). Further, there is no indication that in the present case F.S. had been instructed by the Public Prosecutor to carry out any investigations in the course of the preliminary investigations, nor does it appear that he had done so on his own initiative. The applicants have failed to substantiate their allegations in this respect. For these reasons the Court considers that the decision by the Constitutional Court of 10 March 2015 (see paragraphs 95-96 above), on which the applicants rely as argument, cannot prompt it to arrive at a different conclusion.",

Moreover, the fact that the defence was able to rely on the assistance of privately commissioned experts when questioning the court-appointed expert in the trial or formulating requests for the taking of evidence did provide it with sufficient means for effectively defending the applicants\u2019 case. Thus, the applicants did have a reasonable opportunity to present their case and were not placed at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the prosecution. Finally, his evidence was not decisive for the conviction (see paragraph 70 above). Thus in the circumstances of the case, there was no breach of the principle of equality of arms in the criminal proceedings conducted against the applicants.",
