Even though a one-metre-high partition between the squat toilet and the rest of the cell was insufficient to ensure a minimum level of privacy when using the toilet, this element, on its own, did not reach the threshold of severity required to characterise the treatment as inhuman or degrading within the meaning of Article 3 (see Szafra\u0144ski v. Poland, no.\u00a017249/12, \u00a7\u00a7 25-29, 15 December 2015).

It does not appear that there was any progress in the enforcement proceedings after 12 November 2014 and until the applicant\u2019s release more than seven months later. The Government did not provide evidence of any efforts having been made to secure the applicant\u2019s admission to a third country.
