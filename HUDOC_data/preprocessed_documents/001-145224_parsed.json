They were told to report for instructions at\u00a06\u00a0p.m. In another decision the head of the Directorate\u2019s organised-crime unit, Colonel A.K., ordered an operation against Mr Dimitrov, who was suspected of distributing narcotic drugs and pimping. According to the order, the operation\u2019s goal was to establish, document and put an end to those activities. The plan of the operation was to establish Mr Dimitrov\u2019s whereabouts and carry out urgent investigatory steps. The written plan specified that when making arrests, the police had to proceed with caution so as to avoid any risk to the life and health of arrestees and passers-by. The applicants submit that evidence given by police officers during the ensuing proceedings showed that, although this was not mentioned in the written plan, the police were anticipating resistance on the part of Mr Dimitrov. According to the plan, the officers who were to take part in the operation were split in three groups: one to find Mr Dimitrov and check for evidence of drug trafficking in his car, another to search a hotel run by his family with a view to uncovering evidence of drug trafficking and prostitution, and a third to search Mr Dimitrov\u2019s home, again with a view to uncovering evidence of drug trafficking. There is no information in the case file \u2013 the applicants submitted that none had been gathered in the course of the ensuing criminal proceedings \u2013 about whether the officers who were to take part in the operation were briefed about the plan or about the exact instructions given to them.

Mr Dimitrov then got out of his car without turning the engine off and rushed towards the closest building, disregarding the officers\u2019 shouts \u201cStop! Remain where you are! Police!\u201d. Two of the officers caught up with him and grabbed his hands, trying to put handcuffs on them. Mr Dimitrov put up fierce resistance.

They described in detail their visual inspection of the outside and the inside of the body. They took blood and urine samples and samples of stomach, intestine, brain, kidney and liver tissue and sent them for chemical testing. They also took samples of brain, myocardial, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland and spleen tissue and part of the wall of the aorta for histological testing. The experts\u2019 conclusion was that Mr Dimitrov had a number of abrasions and bruises on the head, body and limbs; that he had wellpronounced cyanosis of the skin and of the visible mucous membrane in the upper part of his body; two small and limited haemorrhages under the pia mater; a small laceration of the aortic arch with suffusion around it and haemorrhage in the left pleural cavity; rough pulmonary adhesions; swelling of the brain and of the lungs; and heavy venous stasis in the internal organs, with dark liquid blood. The experts said that the analysis of the cause of death and the manner in which the injuries had been sustained would be made in a further report by five experts, to be drawn up after obtaining the results of the chemical and histological tests.",

Then they set out their conclusions, saying, inter alia, that the cause of Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death had been a closed cerebral trauma, due to four violent blows to the head, accompanied by a commotion and contusion syndrome, which had led to a breakdown of the functions of the brain, and to a paralysis of the vital centres (cardiac and respiratory), which had been the direct cause of death. A secondary factor had been a traumatic rupture of the aorta, which had been caused by a sharp and violent blow to the back, between the third and the fourth thoracic vertebrae, and had led to a haemorrhage of about one hundred and fifty millilitres of blood in the left pleural cavity. The death had occurred fast, within minutes, but it was not possible to say exactly when. The traumatic injuries to the head and the body \u2013 except those to the face, the front of the body, the elbows and the knees \u2013 had been caused by multiple blows with a hard blunt object about three centimetres wide. The abrasions on the face, the front of the body, the elbows and the knees had been caused by a fall to the ground. The abrasions on the two wrists had been caused by handcuffs. There had also been at least eight blows, some of which possibly repetitive, to the waist, the abdomen and the body. Part of the injuries to the face and the head could have been caused while Mr Dimitrov had been upright, bending or recumbent, but it was not possible to say exactly; the blow between the vertebrae had most probably been administered while Mr Dimitrov had been upright or slightly bending. There was no medical data showing that Mr\u00a0Dimitrov had fought or defended himself. He had earlier consumed a small dose of cocaine, but had not been under its influence at the time of his death. The cocaine metabolites in his urine had no connection with his death.",

Those findings were based solely on the oral and written statements of the five officers, which appeared to have been coordinated beforehand, and failed to take into account the statements of the witnesses Ms M.Z. and Ms E.Z., whose content was quite different from those of the officers. In addition, the findings did not match the conclusions of the experts who had carried out the autopsy on Mr\u00a0Dimitrov\u2019s body and the fact that the officers had only sustained very minor injuries as a result of the incident. That evidence, together with the facts that Mr Dimitrov had been surrounded by five officers, had not been armed, and had been found dead at about two metres from his car, rather suggested that he had not put up any resistance or tried to flee. The conclusion of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office that the officers\u2019 actions had been in line with section 78 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997 (see paragraph 97 below) and could be justified by reference to Article 12a of the Criminal Code 1968 (see paragraph 102 below) was therefore erroneous, especially bearing in mind that there was no indication that at the time when he had been approached by the officers Mr Dimitrov had been in the process of committing an offence. The intensity of the violence used by the officers and the extent of the injuries sustained by Mr Dimitrov rather pointed to murder with direct intent and special cruelty, at a time when the victim was in a helpless state, and perpetrated in a way that was particularly painful for the victim, contrary to Article 116 of the Criminal Code 1968 (see paragraph 100 below). In addition, the inquiries made by the prosecuting authorities were incomplete in many respects: those authorities had not interviewed any higher-ups, gathered a number of relevant documents, asked the five officers specific questions about their individual participation in the events, or subjected Mr Dimitrov\u2019s clothes to testing. In effect, there had not been a proper investigation of the incident by a military investigator. For those reasons, the court set the discontinuance aside and referred the case back to the prosecuting authorities, giving them directions on the application of the substantive law and instructing them to carry out further investigative steps.",

It went on to describe the numerous injuries suffered by Mr Dimitrov, and to conclude that he had died of traumatic injuries to his head and his aorta and that no preexisting medical conditions had played a part in his death. It analysed in detail the expert, witness and other evidence, and expressed the view that Colonel\u00a0A.K. had criminally tried to conceal the offence committed by the five officers. On the basis of its findings of fact, the court concluded that the officers had murdered Mr Dimitrov by intensively beating him. It went on to set out its findings in relation to each aggravating element of the offence, concluding, inter alia, that the officers had acted with special cruelty and at a time when Mr Dimitrov had been in a helpless state because he had been handcuffed and because he had developed a commotion and contusion syndrome. However, the court did not find that Mr Dimitrov had died in a particularly painful manner. It held that the officers had acted with direct intent \u2013 they had kept on hitting Mr Dimitrov with intensity until he had died and even after that. The court also gave reasons on the quantum of the punishment that it had decided to mete out to each of the five officers. It found that there was a considerable preponderance of aggravating factors in relation to Major M.P. \u2013 he had been the group\u2019s leader and had tried to conceal the offence \u2013 and a slight preponderance of aggravating factors in relation to the other four officers. It went on to find that Mr Dimitrov had not been in the process of committing an offence when attacked by the officers, and said that in any event in a State adhering to the rule of law the way of dealing with offenders was to bring them justice, not to kill them. Nor was there an indication that Mr Dimitrov had failed to heed an order or had tried to resist arrest. The court found that the officers\u2019 actions could not be justified by reference to Article 12a of the Criminal Code (see paragraph\u00a0102 below), saying that that provision applied only to \u201ccivic arrests\u201d, not arrests by the police, and that in any event the force used by the officers had been grossly excessive.",

It went on to find that Mr\u00a0Dimitrov had died as a result of traumatic injuries to his head and his aorta, and had suffered a number of other injuries as a result of the beating to which the five officers had subjected him. It found that no pre-existing medical conditions or previous use of cocaine had played a part in Mr\u00a0Dimitrov\u2019s death. He had not tried to flee or resist the officers, had not failed to heed their orders, and had not been in the middle of committing an offence requiring prompt intervention by the police. The court analysed in detail the witness, expert and others evidence, including the statements of Ms M.Z. and Ms E.Z. and of the five officers, as well as the parties\u2019 arguments on the validity and the probative value of that evidence. The court also expressed serious concern about the actions of Colonel A.K. before, during and after the incident, and found that he had tried to conceal the actions of the five officers. It also observed that the evidence did not allow a conclusion that Mr Dimitrov had been a seasoned criminal who had rightfully incurred the wrath of the police. On the basis of its findings of fact, the court concluded that the officers had murdered Mr Dimitrov by intensively beating him. It found that the officers\u2019 actions could not be justified by reference to Article 12a of the Criminal Code (see paragraph\u00a0102 below), saying that that provision applied only to \u201ccivic arrests\u201d, not arrests by the police, and that in any event the force used by the officers had been grossly excessive. Their actions had amounted to aggravated murder, committed in the course of the performance of their duties and with special cruelty. However, it could not be said that the offence had been committed in respect of a person in a helpless state or in way that had been particularly painful for the victim. Nor could it be said that the officers had acted with direct intent \u2013 it was not sufficiently proved that they had a motive to kill Mr Dimitrov. They had acted with oblique intent (recklessness), being indifferent to the possibility of Mr Dimitrov dying as a result of the beating to which they had subjected him. That was evident from the fact that they had continued hitting him even after he had stopped moving because he had died. They had not tried to take any steps to avert the lethal outcome, but had on the contrary tried to conceal their act from the two officers who had been dispatched to the scene. It could not therefore be accepted that they had acted merely negligently. They had intended to arrest Mr Dimitrov in line with the plan for the police operation, but had without reason and without care for the consequences killed him by beating him to death. The underlying cause had been their low regard for the law and for Mr Dimitrov\u2019s rights to life and bodily integrity.",

For four of the officers the mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating ones.

On that basis they concluded, inter alia, that the main cause of Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death had been positional asphyxia, which had led to a mechanical blockage of his respiration as a result of the position in which he had been put. The medical findings \u2013 in particular, the cyanosis, the swelling of the internal organs, the vascular congestion, the limited petechial haemorrhages and liquid blood, and the faecal mass in the anus \u2013 were the classical symptoms of hypoxia. All witnesses\u2019 statements showed that upon his arrest Mr Dimitrov had been put in a hogtie position \u2013 face against the ground and hands fixed to one another behind the back \u2013 which was known to obstruct the respiratory tract and could lead to death. The medical findings \u2013 traces of handcuffs on both wrists, soil and abrasions on Mr Dimitrov\u2019s face \u2013 albeit indirectly, also showed that he had been put in that position. The asphyxia had been aided by Mr Dimitrov\u2019s chronic illnesses: limited flexibility of the lungs due to massive adhesions of the visceral and parietal pleurae, distended and full stomach which had in that position pressed the diaphragm, a hypertrophy of the heart due to the chronic abuse of cocaine (something shown by the fresh histological tests), moderate obesity, and a short neck. The emotional and physical stress under which Mr Dimitrov had been put, coupled with the possibility of emotional delirium resulting from the use of cocaine, could also have played a part.",

The haemorrhages under the pia mater and the swelling of the brain were in fact well-known symptoms of hypoxia. The location of the contusions on the head and the face did not match the location of the haemorrhages under the pia mater. The numerous small haemorrhages around the blood vessels of the brain stem found during the second autopsy, which had taken place nine days after the death, had for sure been postmortal. The rupture of the aorta was also definitely postmortal, had most probably occurred during the autopsy, and had not been caused by a blow. This was indicated by the lack of additional surrounding injuries (such as massive smashing of soft tissue, broken vertebrae and ribs, or injuries to other blood vessels, the lungs or the longitudinal ligament), the manner in which the blood had extravasated into the surrounding tissues (which was consistent with postmortal bleeding, something also confirmed by the fresh histological tests), and the small amount of blood in the left pleural cavity \u2013 insignificant for a rupture of the aorta, which would normally cause profuse bleeding of more than a litter of blood. A small amount of bleeding was normally something that occurred during autopsy dissections of blood vessels.",

Based chiefly on the conclusion of the fresh expert reports that it had ordered in the appellate proceedings (see paragraphs 49-52 and 56 above), the court found that Mr Dimitrov had died of asphyxia occurring as a result of the officers pressing his face against the ground after handcuffing him with hands behind his back, and keeping him in that position in spite of his cries that he was suffocating and his pleas. The particularities of his physiology and his medical conditions had also helped, but had not been decisive. There was no evidence that his death had been natural or resulting from the use of cocaine; that assertion ran counter to the conclusions of the fresh medical expert reports. The court found that those reports were more reliable than the one drawn up during the preliminary investigation (see paragraph 25 above), for several reasons. First, they had been drawn up not only by forensic experts, but also by experts in the fields of pathoanatomy, narcology, cardiology and neurology. All those experts had categorically said that the first report had been erroneous in its interpretation of the results of the histological tests and its discrepancies with objective medical findings. The conclusions of the fresh reports were more consistent with the witnesses\u2019 evidence, and were based on categorical histological findings supported by visual materials. The previous report had not explained the sequence of the deadly injuries \u2013 how Mr Dimitrov, with his heart stopped and unconscious as a result of his cerebral trauma, had managed to stand up, receive a blow in the back that had ruptured his aorta, and shout that he was suffocating. The second report was more persuasive in its explanation that there had been no cerebral trauma and that the rupture of the aorta had been postmortal, probably occurring during the autopsy.

Those additional factors made it likely that less force and less time had been necessary fully to develop the process of asphyxia; it was however impossible exactly to quantify that force. The process of asphyxia in a healthy person, given a total blockage of the airways, would take several minutes, and if the person concerned was able to breathe in several times, the process would take longer. The force applied to the back would have to be more than one hundred and two kilograms. Mr Dimitrov\u2019s pre-existing medical conditions had played a significant role in the lethal outcome.

The two expert reports ordered during the previous appellate examination of the case were therefore to be fully credited.

It was not to be overlooked that a term of imprisonment was the most lenient punishment that the law envisaged in respect of murder, the alternative being life imprisonment. The fact, established for the first time in the appellate proceedings, that Mr Dimitrov had medical conditions which had facilitated his death, was a mitigating circumstance, but not an exceptional one, and did not warrant opting for a punishment below the statutory minimum. It had played a minor role in the death, the major factor being the violence to which the officers had subjected Mr Dimitrov.

The first panel of the Military Court of Appeal had already answered the question on the basis of the fresh expert reports that it had ordered \u2013 Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death had resulted from asphyxia, not cerebral trauma and a rupture of the aorta. That court had given reasons why it had chosen to believe the conclusions of the fresh expert reports rather than those of the initial expert report. However, there had been a critical flaw in its reasoning in relation to the actus reus. It had accepted that the five officers had administered a number of blows to Mr Dimitrov. At the same time, it had found that the blows could not have caused his death. The court had therefore overlooked the lack of a causal connection between the death and the officers\u2019 actions, whereas only such a causal connection could serve as a basis for holding them criminally liable for the death. They were therefore to be acquitted, because their actions had not constituted the offence with which they had been charged.",

That had amounted to an impermissible modification of the factual basis of the charges, which had not only been contrary to the rules of procedure but also in breach of Article 6 of the Convention. No efforts had been made to amend the charges, as possible under the rules of procedure, and that omission could not be allowed to prejudice the accused. The only way to rectify it at that stage was to acquit them. It was true that when hearing the case for the first time the Supreme Court of Cassation had found that there had not been an impermissible modification in the factual basis of the charges in relation to the cause of death (see paragraph 67 above). Therefore, in as much as the court had not taken a stance in relation to the factual elements of the charges, there was no bar to reviewing that point. Since the Military Court of Appeal\u2019s findings of law had been based on findings of fact which had not featured in the indictment, it had to be concluded that the officers had been found guilty of a charge which had not been duly proffered against them. At the same time, the facts forming the basis of the initial charges against them did not constitute an offence.",

The officers\u2019 act had been perpetrated in the course of an operation for the arrest of a person known to have committed an offence. The officers\u2019 attitude to that person\u2019s death did not point to intent, which was clear from the cause of the death. Therefore, it had to be determined whether the officers had acted negligently in relation to the death, or whether the case fell under Article 15 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 103 above) because the death had been accidental. The elements that needed to be taken into account for that purpose were the expert reports ordered by the Military Court of Appeal, the rules governing arrest, as well as the internal police instructions on the use of handcuffs and the position in which to put handcuffed arrestees. Under those instructions, the police could use handcuffs and put arrestees face against the ground. They also had constantly to monitor the situation. A person with handcuffs on could remain in that position for a maximum of one hour without being checked for blood flow in the limbs. Therefore, police officers were entitled to put an arrestee face against the ground for not more than one hour. In the case at hand, the operation had lasted about ten minutes, and death by asphyxia could occur, as stated by the experts, in three to four minutes. Therefore, the officers had not acted negligently, because they had not been able to foresee the harmful consequences. They had been carrying out a police operation in line with the relevant rules, which could not a priori envisage death of the arrestee. In the circumstances, the officers had not been in a position to foresee the result or avert it. The events had unfolded very quickly, which had made it impossible to react, and the death had been due to a number of objective factors: chronic medical conditions; distended and full stomach; prior use of cocaine, which had exacerbated the chronic conditions and had led to overagitation; moderate obesity; and an anatomical peculiarity \u2013 shorter neck. Those factors, whose quick action, precluding any life-saving intervention, had led to the death, had been out of the officers\u2019 control. Therefore, the case concerned an accident, within the meaning of Article 15 of the Criminal Code, for which the officers were not criminally or civilly liable.",

In such circumstances, it was necessary to remit the case, so as to preserve the separation of roles between appellate and cassation courts. In any event, there had been no breach of the rules of procedure \u2013 as held by the panel of the Supreme Court of Cassation which had dealt with the case before (see paragraph 67 above). The main reason militating in favour of remitting the case, however, was the need to order an \u201carbitrage\u201d expert report, as requested by the applicants, with a view to resolving the discrepancies between the expert report ordered during the preliminary investigation and those ordered by the Military Court of Appeal, which had arrived at differing conclusions about the cause of Mr\u00a0Dimitrov\u2019s death. There was nothing in the previous judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation to preclude such a course of action. Such an expert report was the only means of resolving the differences of opinion between respected medical professionals, and the sole basis for the court to determine the validity of one or the other version. It was in addition the only means of finding out how the testing of tissue samples taken from the same individual at different times could lead to conflicting conclusions about the cause of his death. All of that showed that the refusal to order an \u201carbitrage\u201d expert report, to be drawn up by at least seven experts in the fields that had given rise to controversies and who had nothing to do with the institutions from which the previous experts came, had obstructed the possibilities to find out the truth.",

The Bill proposed, inter alia, the addition of a new paragraph 5 in Article 354 of the Code. Under that provision, when quashing for a second time an appellate court judgment, the Supreme Court of Cassation can remit the case for a ruling on the merits only to the appellate court; if the appellate court\u2019s fresh judgment is then appealed against, the Supreme Court of Cassation has to decide the case on the merits instead of remitting it again, and in doing so has the powers of an appellate court. In the explanatory notes to the Bill the Government said that repetitive examinations of criminal cases by the Supreme Court of Cassation, which unduly protracted criminal proceedings, had become an acute problem. That court\u2019s limited jurisdiction in respect of questions of fact often tied its hands vis-\u00e0-vis recalcitrant appellate courts. It was therefore necessary to give that court jurisdiction to rule on points of fact, something that it still lacked. With these new powers, the Supreme Court of Cassation could convict an acquitted defendant or acquit a convicted defendant. Parliament enacted the amendment on 10 November 2011. It was published in the State Gazette on 25 November 2011 and came into force on 29 November 2011.",

The injuries to his head, face and body had not been the \u201cmain factor causing his death\u201d, which had in fact resulted from \u201cacute cardiac and respiratory insufficiency\u201d. There was therefore no causal link between the actions of the police and the death, or an intention on the part of the police to cause it. The police had merely sought to carry out their duties and arrest Mr Dimitrov. They had had a significant amount of operative information that he had engaged in drug trafficking, pimping, including of underage girls, dealing in stolen motor vehicles and trafficking of women. There were therefore grounds to arrest him, and reasons to suspect that he might be dangerous, armed, aggressive, under the influence of narcotic drugs, and likely to try to conceal his criminal activities and evade arrest. The police had merely tried to overcome his resistance and had used a proportionate amount of force to that end, as required under section\u00a078(1)(2) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997. Mr Dimitrov\u2019s fierce resistance had made it impossible for them to arrest him without resorting to force.",

The force that they had used against him had been \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d within the meaning of Article 2 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.

They pointed out that he had died in the presence of no one but five police officers and in the course of a police operation involving violence on the part of all three groups of officers entrusted with carrying it out. The way in which the operation had unfolded showed that the police were not seeking to gather evidence against Mr Dimitrov but to inflict retribution on him. For instance, the group dispatched to his family\u2019s hotel had stopped the search for narcotic drugs after learning that Mr Dimitrov had died. The applicants contended that the authorities had not given a plausible explanation of how Mr\u00a0Dimitrov had lost his life. The ruling of the Supreme Court of Cassation that his death had been accidental did not correspond to the findings of the lower courts or the evidence in the case. The use of force against Mr\u00a0Dimitrov had not at all been necessary. He had not been convicted, had on all previous occasions cooperated with the police, was unarmed and not physically prepared for resistance, and was not doing anything illegal at the time when he encountered the five officers. He did not put up any resistance\u00a0\u2013 a fact established by all courts which had dealt with the case \u2013 and was alone against five experienced, well-armed and trained officers. His arrest should have been carried out without any force. The violence unleashed against him \u2013 especially after he was handcuffed \u2013 had therefore contravened the requirements of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997 and the terms of any briefing or order given to the officers. Indeed, the Sofia Military Court and the Military Court of Appeal had both, on four consecutive occasions, found that the officers had intentionally murdered him; their findings differed only in respect of the medical cause of death. Even if it were to be accepted that the death had occurred in the manner impermissibly established the Supreme Court of Cassation, it still engaged the respondent State\u2019s responsibility under Article 2 of the Convention.",

Contrary to what appeared to be suggested by the written plan of the operation, it had in fact had been planned with the expectation that Mr\u00a0Dimitrov would put up resistance. There were other discrepancies as well, such as the failure of the investigator to join the five officers and carry out any investigative steps, although the plan envisaged the gathering of evidence of Mr Dimitrov\u2019s alleged criminal activities. In fact, none of the three groups of officers who took part in the operation tried to gather such evidence, contrary to the written plan. The instructions in the plan on the use of force had also been flagrantly disregarded, with the result that an unarmed person who had not put up any resistance had lost his life. Another discrepancy was the lack of any suggestion in the written plan that Mr\u00a0Dimitrov might be aggressive or armed. Contrary to the expectations of the police officers, as described by the Government, there was no evidence that Mr Dimitrov was engaging in drug trafficking or pimping at the time of his arrest, or that he was armed, dangerous or under the influence of cocaine. Having reviewed the evidence, the domestic courts had found that Mr Dimitrov had not had on him any narcotic drugs.",

Attempts had been made to cover up Mr Dimitrov\u2019s murder from the very outset. The two military investigators and the prosecutor from the Sofia Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office who had visited the scene shortly after the events had not carried out any investigative steps. Mr\u00a0Dimitrov\u2019s relatives had been kept in the dark about his death and had not been allowed access to the body. The police had given a press conference at which they had made false statements about the case. A number of crime-scene investigative steps which could only have been taken immediately had not been properly carried out. The initial autopsy had not been sufficiently full, and the experts carrying out the second autopsy had faced obstructions. After taking over the case, the military prosecuting authorities had made an attempt unlawfully to discontinue the proceedings. When hearing the case on appeal for the first time, the Military Court of Appeal had quashed the Sofia Military Court\u2019s judgment on spurious grounds, as demonstrated by the dissenting opinion of one of its judges. Later, a series of improper procedural steps had led to the appointment of experts who could not lawfully have been appointed, and to the admission of expert reports which had unlawfully altered the conclusion on the cause of Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death. That had initially led to much lower punishments being imposed on the five officers convicted of his death, and eventually to their acquittal by the Supreme Court of Cassation, on the basis of impermissible fresh findings of fact.",

The second is that the officers caused Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death by pushing him against the ground and delivering blows to his head and body while fully aware that they were causing Mr\u00a0Dimitrov to suffocate and suffer pain, but pressing on with their actions, which, combined with the position in which he was, the stress induced by the continued violence against him, his pre-existing medical conditions and cocaine that he had taken some time before the incident, caused him to asphyxiate. The third is that Mr Dimitrov asphyxiated by accident, his death having no causal connection with the officers\u2019 actions (see paragraph 21 above). The Sofia Military Court credited the first version (see paragraph 37 and 44 above). The Military Court of Appeal subscribed to the second version on both occasions when it dealt with the substantive issues in the case (see paragraphs 59 and 76 above).

The Court further notes that the use of force against Mr Dimitrov and the numerous injuries sustained by him (see paragraphs 23, 25, 52 and 56 above) were not in themselves contested in the domestic proceedings. With the exception of two eyewitnesses, Ms M.Z. and Ms E.Z., whose vantage point did not allow them to gain a precise picture of the events, those officers appear to have been the only direct eyewitnesses to Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death (see paragraph 15 above). The Court therefore considers that the case falls to be examined under Article 2 of the Convention, irrespective of the fact that the exact cause of Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death and the direct causal link between the force used against him and his death are disputed. Furthermore, the responsibility of the State under Article 2 is not confined to cases in which there exists significant evidence that the use of force by State agents has, or could have, directly caused the death of a person.

The Sofia Military Court and the Military Court of Appeal specifically found that Mr\u00a0Dimitrov had been beaten and kicked by those officers with considerable force for about ten to fifteen minutes, and that the force used by the officers against Mr Dimitrov had not been rendered necessary by his resisting arrest (see paragraphs 15, 37, 44, 59 and 76 above). The Military Court of Appeal went on to say that the officers\u2019 resorting to such force had been in breach of sections 78 and 79 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997, which governed the use of force by the police at the relevant time (see paragraphs\u00a077, 97 and 98 above). Those findings were not disturbed by the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraph 85 above). Moreover, the expert reports obtained in the course of the proceedings were agreed, in spite of some discrepancies, that Mr Dimitrov had sustained a number of injuries to his head and body which were due to blows with hard blunt objects (see paragraphs 23, 25, 52 and 56 above). While their causal link with Mr\u00a0Dimitrov\u2019s death was contested, some of those injuries were characterised by the medical experts as capable of causing death and were in any event serious enough to trigger the application of Article 3 of the Convention, which prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, proscribes the authorities from using excessive force to carry out an arrest (see Ivan Vasilev v.

Bulgaria, no. 31365/02, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57, 15 January 2009, with further references). The burden to show this is on the Government (see Altay v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 22279/93, \u00a7 54, 22 May 2001; Rashid v.

Bulgaria, no.\u00a041452/07, \u00a7 113, 4 December 2012). They asserted that Mr Dimitrov had put up fierce resistance. However, that assertion does not match the findings of the Sofia Military Court and the Military Court of Appeal, which specifically established that the physical force used by the five police officers against Mr Dimitrov had not been rendered necessary by his resisting arrest; the latter court also found that the officers\u2019 resorting to such force had been in breach of sections 78 and 79 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997, which governed the use of force by the police at the relevant time (see paragraphs 15, 37, 44, 59, 77, 97 and 98 above). Focusing only on the actions of the officers necessary for Mr Dimitrov\u2019s immobilisation, the Supreme Court of Cassation did not overrule them on that point. In those circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the ill-treatment to which Mr Dimitrov was subjected was not the result of force strictly necessary to subdue him (contrast Bekirski v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a071420/01, \u00a7\u00a7 134-36, 2 September 2010).",

Limiting its findings to the acts potentially related to its fresh findings on the medical cause of Mr\u00a0Dimitrov\u2019s death, it glossed over the question of the use of excessive force. In this regard the decision accepted that in putting Mr Dimitrov down to the ground the officers had acted in line with the rules and failed to analyse in any detail the treatment sustained by Mr Dimitrov or its necessity and compliance with the rules governing use of force. Apparently considering this use of force inconsequential, that court concluded that the officers\u2019 actions had had no part whatsoever to play in Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death and did not constitute any criminal offence or tort (see paragraph 87 above). Thus, it appears that the Supreme Court of Cassation not only left open the question of the necessity and proportionality of the uncontested use of force, but also declared the officers\u2019 conduct lawful in so far as it had not resulted in death. As a result of that approach, all efforts to investigate and hold the officers accountable for their involvement in Mr Dimitrov\u2019s ill-treatment and death were set at naught. The numerous injuries suffered by Mr\u00a0Dimitrov \u2013 described in detail in the expert reports obtained in the earlier course of the proceedings (see paragraphs 25 and 52 above) and forming the basis for the conclusions of the lower courts that the officers had intensely beaten up Mr Dimitrov and had therefore acted with special cruelty (see paragraphs 44, 60, 76 and 79 above) \u2013 were apparently regarded by the Supreme Court of Cassation as completely inconsequential. Nor does that court appear to have paid any heed to the facts \u2013 likewise established by the lower courts \u2013 that Mr Dimitrov was shouting that he was suffocating (see paragraph 15 above), something clearly connected with the duty under Article 2 of the Convention to protect life, and that one of the officers, major M.P., turned back a police patrol car in order to prevent the two officers in it from becoming witnesses to the events (see paragraphs 17, 37, 44 and 45 above).",

Nor can it be said that there should be one unified procedure satisfying all requirements. The Court notes, however, that this is not the first case against Bulgaria in which it finds that the procedural response to a death at the hands of the police has failed to meet the Convention standards (see Velikova v. Bulgaria, no. 41488/98, \u00a7\u00a7 77-84, ECHR 2000-VI; Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, \u00a7\u00a7 141-46, ECHR 2002-IV; Ognyanova and Choban v.

A lack of such procedures will only add fuel to fears of sinister motivations, as is illustrated by, for example, the applicants\u2019 submissions concerning the alleged intention of the police physically to liquidate Mr Dimitrov (see, mutatis mutandis, McKerr, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 159-60).",

The combination of those factors was clearly liable to give rise to misgivings about the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Court of Cassation judges. At a minimum, any judge who had relatives employed by that Ministry should have revealed that fact to the parties and given them an opportunity to request his or her recusal. Under Bulgarian law, there was no mechanism allowing the parties to check for such dependencies with a view to seeking the recusal of the judges concerned. The exclusion of some judges in the Supreme Court of Cassation from sitting in the case did not constitute a sufficient safeguard in that respect because it had been done in secret and on the basis of criteria not known in advance by the parties.",

It can be gauged under a subjective approach, that is trying to ascertain the personal conviction or interest of a judge in a particular case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether that judge offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in that respect and whether, quite apart from the judge\u2019s personal conduct, there existed ascertainable facts which could cast doubt on the court\u2019s impartiality. The litigants\u2019 standpoint is important but not decisive; what is decisive is whether any misgivings in that respect can be regarded as objectively justified (see, among many other authorities, Kyprianou v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2005-XIII, and Micallef v.\u00a0Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7\u00a7 93-96, ECHR 2009). Even appearances may be of a certain importance in that context, because what is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public and in the parties to the proceedings (see, among other authorities, Academy Trading Ltd and Others v. Greece, no. 30342/96, \u00a7 45, 4 April 2000, and Kinsk\u00fd v. the Czech Republic, no. 42856/06, \u00a7 87, 9 February 2012).",

In the present case, the applicants have not adduced such proof. The facts that some of the judges hearing the case ruled against them on some points or decided to proceed in a certain manner do not constitute such proof (see Sofri and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 37235/97, ECHR 2003-VIII; Bracci v. Italy, no. 36822/02, \u00a7 52 in limine, 13 October 2005; Previti v.

Nor does the public campaign, joined by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Internal Affairs, in support of the five officers (see paragraph 90 above). It cannot be overlooked that the panels of the Military Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Cassation which heard the case against the officers were entirely composed of professional judges, who, on account of their training and experience, were less likely than a jury or lay judges to be influenced by external pressures (see, mutatis mutandis, Priebke v. Italy (dec.), no.\u00a048799/99, 5 April 2001; Akay v. Turkey (dec.), no. 34501/97, 19\u00a0February 2002; Craxi v. Italy (no. 1), no. 34896/97, \u00a7 104, 5 December 2002; and Mircea v. Romania, no. 41250/02, \u00a7 75, 29 March 2007). It should be noted in this connection that in spite of that campaign, which apparently continued throughout the criminal proceedings against the officers, both the Sofia Military Court and the Military Court of Appeal convicted them and gave them harsh sentences (see, mutatis mutandis, Papon v. France (dec.), no. 54210/00, ECHR 2001-XII).",

In that court\u2019s view, which was fully consistent with this Court\u2019s caselaw, the only way of making that breach good was to acquit the officers. That court had in addition found that the officers\u2019 actions could not be regarded as having a causal link with Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death, which was an essential prerequisite for criminal liability for homicide, and that Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death had been accidental, within the meaning of Article 15 of the Criminal Code 1968. The court had explained why it considered it unnecessary to remit the case to the lower court or order an \u201carbitrage\u201d expert report. A considerable number of expert reports had already been obtained. The reports ordered by the Military Court of Appeal had pointed out the errors in the earlier ones, and their conclusions they had been sufficient to enable the Supreme Court of Cassation finally to dispose of the case.",

To start with, it had made fresh findings of fact, contrary to the rules of procedure and its established case-law. Those findings, whose purpose had been to exonerate the five officers, differed considerably from those made by the lower courts and were based on the idea that the officers\u2019 actions had nothing to do with Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death. At the same time, the court had ruled that it was barred from making fresh findings on the medical cause of Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death, and had disregarded its earlier ruling that the different cause of death accepted by the Military Court of Appeal had not amounted to a modification of factual basis of the charges against the officers. Moreover, the court had based its findings of fact on unlawfully admitted evidence: the experts appointed by the Military Court of Appeal had been biased and selected in breach of the rules of procedure. Like the Military Court of Appeal before it, the court had also failed to address a number of crucial arguments raised by the applicants: (a)\u00a0arguments concerning the material on which the experts had relied to form their conclusions; (b) arguments concerning the accuracy of the experts\u2019 conclusions and their alleged failure to analyse properly certain injuries to Mr Dimitrov\u2019s body; (c) arguments concerning the experts\u2019 lack of professional competence in certain areas; and (d) arguments concerning certain allegedly unwarranted assumptions made by the experts. Lastly, the court had decided the case without gathering the requisite evidence, in particular the \u201carbitrage\u201d expert report requested by the applicants, which was the only means of resolving the discrepancies between the two versions on the exact medical cause of Mr Dimitrov\u2019s death. It had not given any reasons for its refusal to order such a report. Indeed, those points had been made by the president of the court\u2019s panel in his dissent.",

There is nothing in the second retainer that could be read as invalidating that agreement.

It can thus be regarded as reasonable. However, the Court finds that the number of hours for which he charged appears excessively high, especially when it is taken into account that he was already familiar with the case and that the submissions that he made to the domestic courts and to this Court were to an extent overlapping. Considering this, and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicants EUR\u00a05,000, plus any tax that may be chargeable to them. EUR 3,681.30 (the equivalent of BGN 7,200) of the resulting sum is to be paid to the applicants themselves, and the remainder to the law firm in which their legal representative, Mr V.

The dismay of the applicants at such an outcome must be evident. More disquieting are the actions of some police officers in, so the national courts held, attempting to hamper immediate and effective investigation of the incident (see paragraphs 17-19, 37 and 44 of the judgment in the present case \u2013 \u201cthe judgment\u201d), as well as the public statements made by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Internal Affairs apparently calling for a verdict of acquittal (paragraph 90 of the judgment). Nonetheless, not without some hesitation, given that the facts of the present case involve the death of a person during an arrest operation by the police (always a situation calling for the most careful of scrutinies), I have not been able to join my colleagues in finding a violation of Articles 2 and 3. In brief, when scrutinised carefully in relation to the actual facts of the case, the criticisms directed by my colleagues against the examination of the circumstances attending the arrest and ensuing death of the applicants\u2019 relative, Mr Angel Raychov Dimitrov (alias Chorata), by the Bulgarian authorities, in particular the Supreme Court of Cassation, do not in my view disclose shortcomings attaining the seriousness required to give rise to a violation of the procedural aspect of either Article 2 or Article 3 of the Convention.",

What the text focuses on as the main source of violation is the judgment delivered at the very end of the story by the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraph 141 of the judgment). Where the criminal justice system has apparently functioned normally with a police investigation, a prosecution, a trial, appeals and re-trials, with an evolving development in the state of the evidence, in particular expert medical evidence, it is not in principle for this Court to substitute its own conclusion on the case for that of the final national court, by for example expressing a preference for earlier or lower-court decisions based on different medical evidence. Yet that is what would appear to be what the majority of my colleagues have done in the present case. Unfortunately, I am not able to share their view that there are compelling reasons for so doing. Since the judgment is lengthy and the conclusion of violation is based on a myriad of details, the following explanation of my disagreement is also somewhat lengthy and detailed.",

The judgment is therefore presumably suggesting that such legal analysis by the Supreme Court of Cassation was \u201ccontrary to its normal role in the Bulgarian judicial system\u201d. Even supposing that it is appropriate for this Court to be addressing such admonitions to a superior national court as to the latter\u2019s observance of its own national law, this is something different. As to the powers of the Supreme Court of Cassation, it is to be noted that the Court was indeed competent to modify the lower court\u2019s judgment (see paragraph\u00a0106 of the judgment).",

The Supreme Court of Cassation likewise rejected the applicants\u2019 arguments challenging the reliability and completeness of these two reports and held that there were no grounds to prefer the earlier one (see paragraphs 62 and 65 of the judgment). In the third set of proceedings before it, the Military Court of Appeal again fully accepted the conclusions of the supplementary medical reports (now numbering three) and declared the applicants\u2019 objections to them to be ill-founded (see paragraph 75 of the judgment). The applicants\u2019 reiterated objections were not upheld by the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 83 and 85 of the judgment). It is difficult to understand how this Court should have more expertise in the medical domain than the superior Bulgarian courts, so as to be able to overturn the latter\u2019s conclusions as regards \u201cthe accuracy\u201d of the three medical reports in question.",

However, I do not find either in the assessment of the factual, objective evidence, notably medical, by the Supreme Court of Cassation or in the latter\u2019s legal reasoning any indices of irrationality, unreasonableness, arbitrariness or flagrant non-observance of rules of national law. Nor do I discern any failure to observe the procedural requirements of Articles 2 and/or 3 (the judgment seems to run the requirements of the two Articles together in this respect) by reason of insufficiently addressing the relevant considerations of the case going either to the right to life of the deceased person (that is to say, the circumstances that led to and caused his death when being arrested) or to his right not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment (that is to say, the other circumstances attending the arrest which did not have any causal link with his death but concerned the manner in which the arrest was effected, including in particular the level of physical force and violence used by the arresting police officers). If the judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation is read carefully, it cannot be said that the circumstances of the arrest, regarding not only the cause of death as such but also the manner of effecting the arrest in its non-lethal aspects, remained unclarified or unaddressed as a result of that Court\u2019s procedural treatment of the case. This is not to say that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation is above criticism or that the dissenting opinion of the President of the three-judge panel on the Supreme Court of Cassation, which is mentioned with apparent approval in the judgment (see, for example, paragraphs 144 and 163), lacks merit in terms of its differing reading of the requirements of Bulgarian criminal procedural law. The point is merely that, to my mind, the seriousness of procedural shortcomings capable of giving rise to a violation of the procedural aspect of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention is simply not present on the facts of the case as far as the treatment of the case by the Supreme Court of Cassation is concerned.",

The Court should therefore be circumspect before jumping to conclusions of violation of Articles 2 and 3. Although the initial stages of the investigation are characterised by the judgment as having suffered from flaws (see paragraph\u00a0139), this did not prevent the arresting police officers from being prosecuted and, at the level of the trial court and the first appellate court, of being convicted of murder. Articles 2 and 3 do not demand perfect or ideal investigations and prosecutions, and it will doubtless almost always be possible, with the benefit of hindsight, to identify some flaws or ways in which things could have been done more efficiently. In the present case, full trials and re-trials were conducted; and copious medical evidence was obtained. The ultimate outcome, and some of the procedural steps taken along the way, were not as the applicants would have wished; but that, without more, is insufficient to ground a finding of violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention.",

These \u201cserious concerns\u201d, however, on closer examination turn out to be based on rather weak argumentation. Common sense alone tells one that it is difficult to talk of a lack of proper planning or supervision in relation to an operation where five police officers carry out a ten-minute operation in a public street to arrest a suspect \u201cin line with the relevant rules [governing arrest]\u201d (to use the words of the Supreme Court of Cassation), without any recourse to firearms or vehicle-pursuit and where death of the arrestee has accidentally and unpredictably resulted from resort to the accepted, normally non-dangerous position for holding persons immediately on arrest. As the judgment of that Court makes crystal clear, no amount of prior planning or supervision during the arrest operation could have prevented the unforeseeable, freak accident that led to the death of the applicants\u2019 relative. The facts of the present case are in no way to be compared with those in the cases cited in the judgment as relevant authorities (namely Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, ECHR 2011 \u2013 which concerned the alleged killing of Iraqi nationals by members of the British armed forces in Iraq; McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, ECHR\u00a02001-III \u2013 where the police killed three suspected terrorists by firing over 100 rounds into the car in which the latter were travelling; and Av\u015far v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 25657/94, ECHR 2001-VII \u2013 where the applicant\u2019s brother was abducted and murdered by village guards).",

Nonetheless, on their own these two factors are not sufficient to entail a violation of the procedural aspect of Articles 2 and 3, given the overall way in which the investigation and the prosecution were in fact pursued. And in concentrating in the way that it does on the procedural treatment of the case by the Supreme Court of Cassation, the majority of the chamber has, I believe, strayed overly into the territory of interpretation of national law, which is a matter for the Bulgarian courts themselves, not this Court. In my opinion, such shortcomings in its procedural treatment of the case as can be put at the door of the Supreme Court of Cassation do not entail the seriousness required to give rise to a violation of the procedural requirements of Articles 2 and 3.",
