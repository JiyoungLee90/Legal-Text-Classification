It established that the applicant could rely on a right of residence under Article 7 of the Decision No. 1/80 of the EEC/Turkey Association Council of 19\u00a0September 1980 (see paragraph 30 below). He could hence only be expelled on the basis of a discretionary decision of the authority, requiring a current and concrete danger of further significant criminal offences. Against this background, the reasons provided for the justification of the expulsion order were not sufficient. In this context the Court of Appeal referred, in particular, to the fact that the applicant had at the time not yet undergone inpatient therapy, which he was willing to do.

After initial, rather frequent visits by J. and their common daughter in prison, contact became rather infrequent after J. gave birth to a second child by a different father. The fact that the applicant was about to finish secondary school (see paragraph 14 above) did not justify a more positive prognosis. Since he lacked the necessary vocational training, his prospects of finding a job were still rather slim. The authorities had correctly taken account of the applicant\u2019s interests, of the fact that he had been born in Germany and that he had family in Germany, in particular his daughter and his sister. Making explicit reference to Article 8 of the Convention and the Court\u2019s case-law, the Administrative Court established that the reasons at the heart of the expulsion were sufficient to justify it, even though the expulsion might cause hardship for the daughter, who did not live with the applicant. The applicant\u2019s interests were sufficiently taken into account by limiting the reentry ban and he could, moreover, apply for a further reduction of the reentry ban, if the relevant facts were to change.",

At the oral hearing, he had also conceded that his fluency had improved since 2005. Moreover, the applicant was familiar with Turkish living conditions, since he had visited Turkey twice as a child. His grandfather had shown a rather traditional attitude and he had, in order to improve his Turkish skills, spent a lot of time with family since 2005.

Article\u00a014 of that Decision guarantees that section 7 is to be applied, subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. In substance, the German courts, referring to the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, take these provisions to allow for the expulsion of a person, who can rely on a right of residence under Article\u00a07 of the Decision, only on the condition that the conduct of that person poses a current and concrete danger to a basic interest of Germany and if the expulsion is necessary in order to secure that interest (compare Federal Administrative Court, no. 1 VR 3/18, decision of 22 May 2018).",

The prison sentences bear testimony to the seriousness of the offences. The Court has held on previous occasions that it understands \u2013 in view of the devastating effects drugs have on people\u2019s lives \u2013 why the authorities show great firmness to those who actively contribute to the spread of this scourge (see, among others, Salem v.\u00a0Denmark, no. 77036/11, \u00a7 66, 1 December 2016; Savasci v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a045971/08, \u00a7 27, 19 March 2013). The applicant committed at least a substantial part of his offences as a criminally responsible adult. This, as well as the nature and the gravity of the offences, rules out their assessment as mere examples of juvenile delinquency (Kaya\u00a0v. Germany, no. 31753/02, \u00a7 62, 28 June 2007). Finally, it has to be taken into account that the applicant continued to commit criminal offences even though his expulsion had already been ordered for the first time in 2002 and the relevant decision had only been quashed by the Court of Appeal on 14 January 2005 (compare Trabelsi v. Germany, no.\u00a041548/06,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a058, 13 October 2011). Against this background, the domestic authorities\u2019 conclusion that the applicant\u2019s criminal offences were particularly serious cannot be put into question.",

While he has not reoffended since, it has to be noted that he spent a considerable part of that time in prison. The domestic authorities considered that he had been granted several chances to adapt his conduct before and failed to make use of them, even when positive developments such as a relationship and the birth of his daughter could have triggered a turnaround, and that there had been a pattern in his life of criminal offences, sanctions, rehabilitation and rather short periods of improved conduct prior to the commission of further criminal offences. They concluded that his conduct since 2009, which included his completion of secondary education and the tackling of his psychological problems and his polysubstance dependence, did not allow for the conclusion that there was no longer a risk of his reoffending. The Court does not consider this finding unreasonable.",

Their relationship was limited during the applicant\u2019s imprisonment and therapy. The domestic authorities considered that the daughter lived with her mother, who had exercised sole custody rights since the child\u2019s birth, and concluded that the mother is the central figure in the child\u2019s life. While the applicant is involved in her upbringing, and his deportation from Germany would certainly have an impact on his daughter, there is no reason why the applicant and his daughter cannot continue their relationship via different means of communication, and the applicant has not shown that it would be impossible for his daughter to visit him, at least together with her mother, in Turkey. Neither has he substantiated that the child\u2019s interests were otherwise adversely affected by his expulsion. Moreover, the re-entry ban is limited to five years and he may apply to be allowed entry for compelling reasons and for short periods of time (see paragraph 31 above).",

In this respect, the Court does not doubt that the applicant has strong ties to Germany (Kaya, cited above, \u00a7 64). The domestic authorities also emphasised, however, that the applicant lacked a more sustainable integration in his host country, in particular with regard to a lack of vocational training, the fact that he has never worked and has essentially lived on social benefits, and likely has little prospect of finding a job in the future. In this connection, the Court reiterates that not even a right to naturalisation as such hinders an expulsion (ibid.).",

The Court, albeit concurring with this assessment, takes note of the fact that the applicant has visited Turkey only twice, as a child. With regard to the alleged damage to his health which might be caused by returning to his home country, which also has to be taken into account when weighing the applicant\u2019s private life (compare Bensaid v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a044599/98, \u00a7 48, ECHR 2001I), the Court acknowledges that the applicant suffers from trauma and that he prefers ongoing treatment in a familiar environment. However, he has failed to substantiate why he could not continue treatment in Turkey or why the expulsion would significantly increase the risk of further trauma.",

Moreover, having regard to the gravity of the drug-related criminal offences committed by the applicant, and considering the sovereignty of member States to control and regulate the residence of aliens on their territory, the Court finds that the interference was supported by relevant and sufficient reasons, and was proportionate in that a fair balance was struck between the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private and family life, on the one hand, and the prevention of disorder or crime, on the other hand. In these circumstances the Court concludes that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to private and family life as protected under Article\u00a08\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention was justified under Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",
