That was attested, firstly, by the record of the child\u2019s placement in State care and, secondly, by the judgment of the Lille tribunal de grande instance, which noted that the applicant had had at least two lengthy interviews with the social services, during which she had been told about the conditions and effects of anonymous registration of the birth. Although she had not had access to an official interpreter, which was not required by French law, she had been assisted by English-speaking staff during the interviews. Furthermore, in his submissions to the Court of Appeal, the prefect of the d\u00e9partement of Nord had referred to the observation by the social services that the applicant \u201chad difficulty in accepting the idea that her daughter would not be placed with adoptive parents immediately after leaving the maternity ward but would be placed temporarily in a foster home or a nursery for two months. In that connection, it was explained to her at length that the purpose of this procedure was to ensure the best possible preparation for the planned adoption, and also to comply with the statutory two-month time-limit for withdrawing consent, which in her case would expire on 20 April 2002.\u201d",

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves. The boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In particular, in both instances regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the competing interests; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Keegan v. Ireland, judgment of 26 May 1994, Series A no. 290, p. 19, \u00a7 49; Odi\u00e8vre, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040; and Evans v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a06339/05, \u00a7\u00a075, ECHR 2007-...). The Contracting States will usually enjoy a wide margin of appreciation if the public authorities are required to strike a balance between competing private and public interests or Convention rights. This applies all the more where there is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it\u00a0(see Evans, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 77-81).",
