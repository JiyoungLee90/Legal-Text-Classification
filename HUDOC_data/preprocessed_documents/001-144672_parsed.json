The Ombudsman noted that only involuntary confinement was subject to judicial supervision and that even this type of hospitalisation was under-regulated. Furthermore, the implementation of judicial supervision gave rise to doubts as to its effectiveness; the Ombudsman observed that in all the confinement cases under his consideration the courts had decided in accordance with medical opinion and therefore no more than confirmed the decisions made by hospitals or doctors. In the Ombudsman\u2019s opinion, judicial supervision served to protect the medical staff instead of the confined individuals.",

The Ombudsman noted that during his visit to the Idrija Psychiatric Hospital its director had explained that the open ward admitted patients who could be trusted not to escape, although they were in the hospital against their will. In this regard, the Ombudsman pointed out that the position of patients who were placed in open wards, but were not free in terms of deciding whether to leave the hospital whenever they wished or to refuse treatment was \u2013 at the very least \u2013 very similar to involuntary confinement in closed wards and that therefore this type of hospitalisation ought to be subject to the same statutory regulation as confinement in closed wards.",

Firstly, as to her confinement in the Idrija Psychiatric Hospital and in the closed ward of the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital, they pointed out that she had been released from there before she lodged her application before the Court. They therefore took the view that as any alleged breaches of the Convention arising from the involuntary confinement and medical treatment had been terminated upon the applicant\u2019s release, she could have only claimed damages in respect of a violation of her personality rights. In the Government\u2019s opinion, the applicant should have therefore brought an action against the State for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage caused by the State authorities under Article 179 of the Code of Obligations. According to the Government, any unlawful conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute a violation of an individual\u2019s personality rights. In support of their submissions, they cited a number of decisions adopted by the domestic courts showing that the State had been found by the domestic courts to be liable for damages caused by its employees in the course of their employment and exercise of their functions. Moreover, as regards specifically infringements of personal liberty resulting from psychiatric confinement and medical treatment, the Government relied on the four domestic decisions outlined in paragraphs 67-70 above to conclude that the courts regularly awarded compensation to individuals in positions comparable to that of the applicant.",

The Government emphasised that the applicant had twice been informed of this possibility by the Ljubljana Higher Court (see paragraphs 41 and 50 above).

She would thus have been required to prove all four elements of the State\u2019s liability, the unlawfulness of her confinement, the existence of damage, the causal link, and negligence or fault on the part of the State in order to obtain compensation. Further, the applicant submitted that by the time her claim had become time-barred, no compensation had been awarded or paid by the State in relation to the involuntary confinement in any other case.

Russia, no. 21519/02, \u00a7 151, 5 February 2009; Schwabe and M.G. v. Germany, nos. 8080/08 and 8577/08, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2011 (extracts); and Raudevs v. Latvia, no. 24086/03, \u00a7 62, 17 December 2013). Paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Convention covers the former and paragraph 5 of Article 5 the latter. The same is true of the relationship between the right to be informed promptly of the reasons for the deprivation of liberty under Article 5 \u00a7 2 and the right to compensation. Moreover, being a remedy of purely compensatory nature, a civil action for damages could not have secured the applicant\u2019s release if her confinement was unlawful, as required by Article 5\u00a0\u00a7 4 (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 February 1987, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 114, and, more recently, Aden Ahmed v. Malta, no. 55352/12, \u00a7 114, 23\u00a0July 2013 and the references cited therein). For the same reason, it could not have led to the termination of the applicant\u2019s medical treatment. Accordingly, the Court considers that a civil action for damages has no bearing on the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7 1-4 and Article 8.",

The Court has already dismissed a similar Government\u2019s objection in the context of prison conditions, considering that the absence of any case-law indicated the uncertainty of requests for the termination of an infringement of personality rights in practice (see \u0160trucl and others v. Slovenia, nos. 5903/10, 6003/10 and 6544/10, \u00a7\u00a7 126-127, 20 October 2011, and Mandi\u0107 and Jovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Slovenia, nos. 5774/10 and 5985/10, \u00a7\u00a7 113-114, 20 October 2011, and the references cited therein). It is true, as pointed out by the Government, that in the present case the applicant was advised by the Ljubljana Higher Court to use this remedy to obtain her release from the open ward. However, such advice cannot in itself imply that the remedy at issue would have effectively addressed her complaints. Having regard to the fact that her predicament required prompt judicial review, and that the request under Article 134 of the Code of Obligations does not appear to be subject to any time-limits, the Court considers that more persuasive evidence would be required in order to conclude that the remedy in question was appropriate and effective in the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case. The Government having submitted no domestic case-law showing how the remedy operated in practice, the Court considers that its finding in \u0160trucl and others and Mandi\u0107 and Jovi\u0107 applies also in the circumstances of the present case. Furthermore, as regards the possibility of injunctive relief, the Court considers that, given the Ljubljana Local Court\u2019s view that no legal basis existed for an interlocutory order for the protection of the applicant\u2019s personality rights, there is nothing to show that she could have had more success if her application had been based on the Enforcement and Securing of Civil Claims Act instead of the Non-Contentious Civil Procedure Act.",

Also, her clothes had only been returned to her ten days after she had been transferred (see paragraph 30 above). Relying on the two judgments cited in the previous paragraph, the applicant pointed to the psychiatric hospitals\u2019 practice of keeping patients in their hospital pyjamas in order to prevent them from leaving the hospital. Further, as to her weekend outings, the applicant maintained that she had only been granted weekend leave if her father had offered to take her home and supervise her medication, which she had been required to take throughout the period spent in the open ward of the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital.

Lastly, although the Ombudsman\u2019s Annual Report 2000 and the domestic case-law relied on by the applicant support her view that the regime applied in open wards may entail deprivation of a person\u2019s liberty, the Court considers that these documents alone, in the absence of a detailed substantiation of her own specific situation while in the open ward of the Idrija Psychiatric Hospital, do not serve as sufficient evidence that she was deprived of her liberty during the four-day period she spent there.",

First of all, the applicant\u2019s clothes were only returned to her ten days after she had been transferred to the open ward, and until then she wore hospital pyjamas. In this regard, while the Court is mindful of the Government\u2019s argument that no evidence was shown that the applicant had previously been denied a request for the return of her clothes, it observes that neither were the clothes returned to her without such a request. Moreover, while the applicant was able to leave the hospital grounds for shorter periods of time quite often in the later stages of her treatment in the open ward (see paragraph 30 above), she did not do so without seeking the express permission of the staff. It was not disputed by the Government that such permission had been required and within the staff\u2019s discretion. Neither did the Government dispute that the applicant\u2019s weekend outings had been conditional upon an arrangement with her father to take her home and supervise her medication. Lastly, it is noted that on at least one occasion, the applicant asked \u2013 and received \u2013 her psychiatrist\u2019s permission to withdraw some of her social assistance money. Thus, the Court observes that the general setting of control exercised by the hospital staff exceeded considerably the measures required to monitor the applicant\u2019s comings and goings. In this regard, the Court reiterates that the applicability of Article 5 does not depend solely on whether the applicant was held in a \u201clocked\u201d ward but whether the healthcare professionals treating her exercised complete and effective control and supervision over her care and movements (see H.L. v. the United Kingdom, no. 45508/99, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2004-IX).",

Although on 9 September 2005 the order was quashed for lack of reasoning as to the grounds for confinement, the applicant was not ordered to be released. Instead, the case was remitted to the local court which continued to examine the necessity of the applicant\u2019s confinement until 12\u00a0December 2005. The applicant stated in this regard that she could not have predicted the consequences of her possibly leaving the hospital, while the Government made no comment about this issue. The Court, observing that her placement in the open ward should have resulted in the termination of the involuntary confinement proceedings (see section 70 of the Non-Contentious Civil Procedure Act, paragraph 59 above; also see paragraph 41 above), agrees that this continuation of proceedings justifiably gave the applicant the impression that she was not allowed to leave the hospital, or that she might be brought back by force.",

Another forty-eight hours had to be added to this maximum thirty-day period, to allow for time to pass between an individual\u2019s involuntary admission and the notification to the competent court thereof. Already in 2003, this period for issuing the decision on confinement had been criticised by the Constitutional Court as possibly being too long (see paragraph 64 above).

The Court has already recognised that an inadequate legal framework allowing a hospital\u2019s healthcare professionals to assume full control of the liberty and treatment of a vulnerable individual solely on the basis of their own clinical assessments deprives an individual of sufficient protection against arbitrary deprivation of liberty (see H.L. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 121 and 124; and Storck, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 104-106).",

Moreover, it is true that the Court has accepted as reasonable certain intervals between the expiry of one order allowing for a deprivation of liberty and the issuing of a new one (see Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7 49; and Rutten v. the Netherlands, no. 32605/96,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a039-41, 24 July 2001). However, in the present case not even an initial assessment was conducted by the competent authority, the Idrija Local Court, of whether the deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty was justified in the circumstances of the case. Consequently, the applicant\u2019s twenty-eight day confinement in the closed ward, from the beginning and throughout, had no valid substantive legal basis. In this connection, the Court considers that while the applicant\u2019s mental condition might have justifiably been considered by the hospital staff to necessitate urgent hospitalisation, the initial decision made by them to confine her should have been replaced by a decision of the competent authority, that is, the local court, in the shortest possible time.",

As a consequence no assessment was ever made by the local court whether it had in fact been necessary to deprive the applicant of her liberty. The absence of such an assessment was all the more poignant because the measure of involuntary confinement appears to have entailed an automatic authorisation for medical treatment of the applicant, even against her will (see section 49 of the Health Services Act, paragraph 58 above). In this regard the Court considers that the sole fact that the measure of involuntary confinement had ceased to apply, should not have deprived the applicant from obtaining a decision of the competent authority as to whether the confinement had been necessary in the circumstances, given the gravity of the measure of psychiatric confinement (see, mutatis mutandis, Herz v. Germany, no. 44672/98, \u00a7 68, 12 June 2003).",

It was therefore acknowledged on the record that an element of coercion was in fact involved in her admission to the hospital.

In so far as consent was not even sought on account of the hospital having considered the applicant to lack the capacity to validly express her wishes (an argument was made to this effect in the context of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 2, see paragraph 141 below), her confinement should have automatically been regarded as involuntary by virtue of section 71(3) of the Non-Contentious Civil Procedure Act.",

It is noted that in the course of involuntary confinement proceedings, the applicant was transferred to the open ward on 3 September 2005 (see paragraph 29 above). Her stay in that ward was considered voluntary under domestic law (see paragraph 94 above) and should have resulted in the termination of involuntary confinement proceedings (see paragraph 41 above). However, after the initial order of confinement was quashed on 9 September 2005 for lack of grounds justifying the necessity of the applicant\u2019s confinement (see paragraph 31 above), the remitted proceedings continued for three more months, until 12 December 2005 (see paragraph 45 above), on the erroneous premise that the applicant was still confined in the closed ward. As with the earlier set of proceedings concerning the Idrija Psychiatric Hospital (see paragraph 127 above), the Court notes that these proceedings terminated without a decision on whether the statutory conditions for the applicant\u2019s confinement had been met. In this regard, it does not follow from the provisions of the Non-Contentious Civil Procedure Act or the Government\u2019s submissions that, after remittal, the Ljubljana Local Court was bound by any time-limit for making a new decision on confinement. In the absence of such a time-limit, the applicant was confined without a valid substantive legal basis or clear rules governing the maximum duration of this situation, which is incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and the protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7\u00a056, ECHR 2000III; and Je\u010dius v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2000IX).

However, the next day the applicant\u2019s attitude to hospitalisation evidently changed, which prompted the hospital to notify the Idrija Local Court that she was confined against her will. In this connection, it cannot be seen from the Government\u2019s submissions or the supporting documents that the applicant was informed of the reasons why she was to remain in the hospital. Neither does it appear that her court-appointed representative I.R.P. was provided with such information upon her appointment on 13 July 2005. This would imply that the reasons for the applicant\u2019s confinement were not communicated to her or the representative until the court hearing held on 15 July 2005 (see paragraph 10 above), four days after the hospital first considered her to be there against her will. In the context of the present case, this interval of four days must be regarded as falling outside the constraints of time imposed by the notion of promptness for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 2 (see Shamayev and Others v.

In this regard, the Court notes that in so far as the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital considered the applicant to lack capacity to understand her situation, it should have notified the competent court of the confinement and reasons for it within forty-eight hours, as provided by domestic law, and the latter should have promptly appointed a representative to act on her behalf and relayed the relevant information to him or her. However, the court was only notified of the applicant\u2019s confinement on 21 August 2005 (see paragraph 22 above), six days after she had been confined in the closed ward, and by the applicant herself. Again, there is no indication that either the applicant, her court-appointed representative P.C. or her chosen representative D.P. who visited her in the hospital on 19 August 2005 (see paragraph 20 above), were informed of the reasons for her confinement before the court hearing on 23 August 2005 (see paragraph 23 above), that is eight days after she had been confined in the closed ward. In the Court\u2019s opinion, this interval cannot be deemed compatible with the requirement of promptness. Moreover, the Court considers that in both sets of involuntary confinement proceedings the timing of the information on the reasons for confinement must have adversely affected the effectiveness of the applicant and her representatives\u2019 participation in the court hearings.",

Although the applicant appealed against the decision to terminate the proceedings, first before the Ljubljana Higher Court and then before the Supreme Court, arguing that it had not been shown that her confinement was justified and that, moreover, she was still being confined against her will in the open ward, her appeals were not examined on the merits, as she was considered by the domestic courts to have lost her legal interest on account of having regained her liberty. The applicant\u2019s subsequent constitutional complaint was rejected as belated, the court having held that the applicant should not have lodged an appeal on points of law, as such a remedy was inadmissible due to the lack of legal interest. Thus, once the applicant was no longer considered deprived of her liberty under domestic law, she was unable to obtain a decision on the lawfulness of her earlier confinement. In this regard, the Court reiterates that, even assuming that the applicant was no longer involuntarily confined, she would still be entitled to obtain a decision on the lawfulness of her earlier confinement (see Herz v.\u00a0Germany, cited above, \u00a7 68).",

While no additional evidence is required on the part of the claimant if a court order of confinement made in his or her regard has been quashed on account of procedural irregularities (see paragraphs 67 and 70 above), in other cases claimants are required to prove that the actions of the competent authorities have been contrary to the law. The Court thus considers that the applicant could have successfully claimed compensation for the procedural deficiencies committed with regard to her confinement in the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital, which were established by the Ljubljana Higher Court (see paragraphs 31 and 41 above). It follows from the domestic case-law that the applicant might have also been able to obtain compensation for her confinement in the open ward of the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital (see paragraph 70 above), which at the material time was not subject to any legal regulation.",

Furthermore, the Government took the view that the applicant had had effective remedies available for reviewing the lawfulness of the two periods of her involuntary confinement (see paragraph 151 above), although the proceedings were terminated upon her transfer to an open ward. As established by the Court, this practice of the domestic courts deprived the applicant of a judicial decision on the necessity of both periods of her confinement (see paragraphs 128 and 132 above), as well as of the possibility of appeal (see paragraphs 157, 159 and 160 above). Having regard to the fact that in the civil proceedings the applicant would have been required to prove that these deficiencies were unlawful in terms of domestic law, the Court considers that some evidence would have to be furnished that there in fact existed such a possibility for the applicant. In this connection it is however noted that the award of compensation in the judgments submitted by the Government was in no way based on any legislative shortcomings. The Court therefore concludes that the Government failed to show that the applicant\u2019s right to compensation was ensured with a sufficient degree of certainty with regard to the entire scope of the violations of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 established by the Court.",

Therefore, in both periods of her confinement in the closed wards the applicant received medical treatment without a decision of the competent authority (see Storck, cited above, \u00a7 152).
