The case originated in two applications (nos. 27929/10 and 52120/13) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Serbian nationals, Mr Sveto Purić (“the first applicant”) and R.B. (“the second applicant”), on 6 May 2010 and 17 June 2013 respectively. The Court decided of its own motion to grant the second applicant anonymity pursuant to Rule 47 § 4 of the Rules of Court.
The first applicant was represented by Mr R. Stepanović, a lawyer practising in Belgrade, while the second applicant was represented by Mr V. Juhas Đurić, a lawyer practising in Subotica. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their former Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 13 October 2016 notice of the complaints concerning Article 5 § 3 was given to the Government and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. Having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The facts of the case may be summarised as follows.
The applicant was born in 1954.
On 22 February 2007 the Smederevo District Court (Okružni sud u Smederevu) ordered the applicant’s detention on suspicion of bribery and the illegal possession of weapons and explosive materials. He was initially detained on the following grounds: (a) the risk he would obstruct the course of justice by exerting pressure on witnesses and/or his co-accused; and (b) the severity of the potential sentence and the nature of the alleged crime.
As from 11 September 2007 the applicant was detained on the sole grounds of the severity of the potential sentence and the nature of the alleged crime. In its reasoning the court relied on, inter alia, the fact that the criminal conduct had allegedly taken place over a prolonged period of time and that the applicant had been the dean of the Kragujevac Faculty of Law at the relevant time. The applicant repeatedly challenged his detention, but his appeals were dismissed by the Supreme Court on 18 September, 26 September, 25 October and 28 November 2007.
On 14 December 2007 the applicant was released from custody.
On 5 January 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal complaining that his detention in the period from 11 September to 14 December 2007 had not been justified.
On 22 December 2009 the Constitutional Court found no violation of the applicant’s right to liberty and security.
It appears that the criminal proceedings are still ongoing.
The facts of the case may be summarised as follows.
On 3 November 2011 the competent court ordered the applicant’s detention on suspicion of sexually abusing a child. He was initially detained on the following grounds: (a) the risk he would obstruct the course of justice by exerting pressure on witnesses and/or his co-accused; (b) the risk of reoffending; and (c) the severity of the potential sentence and the nature of the alleged crime.
The competent court extended the applicant’s detention on several occasions. Notably, in the period from 18 June to 17 August 2012 the applicant was detained, in accordance with a decision of 15 June 2012, on the sole grounds of the severity of the potential sentence and the nature of the alleged crime. In its reasoning the court relied on, inter alia, the age of the victim, the fact that the criminal conduct had allegedly taken place over a prolonged period of time, that the applicant had lived in the same household as the alleged victim and had allegedly also made threats against the victim. On 22 June 2012 the competent court upheld that decision.
On 17 August 2012 the applicant was found guilty of sexually abusing a child and sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment.
In the meantime, on 2 July 2012, the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal complaining that his detention in the period after 18 June 2012 had not been justified.
On 23 May 2013 the Constitutional Court found no violation of the applicant’s right to liberty and security.
