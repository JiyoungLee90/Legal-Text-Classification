France (no. 27058/05, 4 December 2008), which concerned the wearing of religious signs at school, the Court had occasion to elucidate the concept of secularism in France. It reiterated in that connection that the exercise of religious freedom in public society is directly linked to the principle of secularism. Arising out of a long French tradition, this principle has its origins in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, Article 10 of which provides that \u201c[n]o one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law\u201d. It also appears in the key Education Acts of 1882 and 1886, which introduced State primary education on a compulsory and secular basis. The real keystone of French secularism, however, is the Act of 9 December 1905, known as the Law on the separation between Church and State, which marked the end of a long conflict between the republicans, born of the French Revolution, and the Catholic Church. Section 1 provides: \u201cThe Republic shall ensure freedom of conscience. It shall guarantee free participation in religious worship, subject only to the restrictions laid down hereinafter in the interest of public order.\u201d The principle of separation is affirmed in section 2 of the Act: \u201cThe Republic may not recognise, pay stipends to or subsidise any religious denomination ...\u201d This \u201csecular pact\u201d entails a number of consequences both for public services and for users. It implies an acknowledgement of religious pluralism and State neutrality towards religions.",

Under this approach, assessment criteria would then be identified which, without reneging on the principle of neutrality, would lead to an arguably more pragmatic application of them, taking account of the nature of the duties performed (education, management functions) and the circumstances in which they are carried out (contact with the public, whether or not a uniform or regulation clothing is worn, the degree of vulnerability or sensitivity of users such as pupils or patients).\u201d",

The principle of the neutrality of public services required that employees could not wear any religious symbol, of any form, even if they did not engage in proselytism. In this connection they referred to the Court\u2019s case-law with regard to civil servants and their duty of discretion and choice of attire (specifically, Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, \u00a7 53, Series A no. 323, and Kurtulmu\u015f v. Turkey (dec.), no. 65500/01, ECHR 2006II). They emphasised the particular importance of the principle of neutrality in the circumstances of this case, where it was difficult to assess the impact that a particularly visible external sign could have on the freedom of conscience of fragile and impressionable patients. The Government added that certain patients had specifically refused to meet the applicant, and that this situation had created a general climate of tension and difficulties within the unit, requiring the applicant\u2019s colleagues and some social workers to handle sensitive situations. It was in the light of this general climate that the CASH had taken the contested decision, after reminding the applicant on several occasions of the duty of neutrality, and not on account of the latter\u2019s professional skills, which had always been acknowledged. The Government considered that the contested decision had complied with the requirement to weigh up the interests at stake; it had been the consequence of the applicant\u2019s refusal to comply with the rules applicable to every public employee, of which she had been perfectly aware, and not, as she alleged, on account of her religious beliefs. Lastly, although the applicant\u2019s wearing of the religious symbol had been accepted by the hospital until 2000, this factor did not, in the Government\u2019s view, render the contested interference unnecessary. They reiterated that \u201cthe fact that an existing rule is applied less rigorously because of a specific context does not mean that there is no justification for the rule or that it is no longer binding in law\u201d (citing Kurtulmu\u015f, cited above).",

In this connection, the Court notes that it transpires from the administrative courts\u2019 case-law that the neutrality of public services is an element of State secularism and that, since 1950, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat has asserted the \u201cduty of strict neutrality which is required from all [public] employees\u201d, particularly in the area of education (see paragraphs 26-27 above). Moreover, it notes that the Constitutional Council has emphasised that the principle of neutrality, the corollary of which is the principle of equality, is a fundamental principle of the public service (see paragraph 25 above).

It therefore accepts that, when she took up her post, the applicant could not have foreseen that the expression of her religious beliefs would be subject to restrictions. However, it considers that, from the date of publication of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat\u2019s Opinion of 3 May 2000, issued more than six\u00a0months before the decision not to renew her contract, the terms of which were brought to her attention by the hospital administration (see paragraph 8 above), these restrictions were set out with sufficient clarity for her to foresee that the refusal to remove her veil amounted to a fault leaving her liable to a disciplinary sanction. That Opinion, although responding to a specific question concerning the public education service, indicated that the principle of State secularism and the neutrality of public services applied to the public service as a whole. It stressed that employees must enjoy freedom of conscience, but that this freedom must be consistent, in its manner of expression, with the principle of neutrality of the relevant service, which precludes the wearing of a sign intended to indicate their adherence to a religion. In addition, it specifies that in the event of failure to comply with this obligation of neutrality the disciplinary consequences are to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the particular circumstances (see paragraph 26 above). The Court thus notes that the Opinion of 3 May 2000 clearly lays down the basis for the requirement of religious neutrality by public employees when carrying out their duties, having regard to the principles of secularism and neutrality, and meets the requirement as to the foreseeability and accessibility of \u201cthe law\u201d within the meaning of the Court\u2019s case-law.

Turkey, no. 41135/98, \u00a7 43, 23\u00a0February 2010). In the present case the purpose was to ensure respect for all of the religious beliefs and spiritual orientations held by the patients who were using the public service and were recipients of the requirement of neutrality imposed on the applicant, by guaranteeing them strict equality. The aim was also to ensure that these users enjoyed equal treatment, without distinction on the basis of religion. In this connection, the Court reiterates that it has found that an employer\u2019s policies to promote equality of opportunity or to avoid any discriminatory conduct vis-\u00e0-vis other persons pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the rights of others (see, mutatis mutandis, the cases of Ms Ladele and Mr McFarlane, in Eweida and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 105-06 and 109). It also reiterates that upholding the principle of secularism is an objective that is compatible with the values underlying the Convention (see Leyla \u015eahin, cited above, \u00a7 114). In those circumstances, the Court is of the view that the ban on the applicant manifesting her religious beliefs while carrying out her duties pursued the aim of protecting the \u201crights and freedoms of others\u201d and that this restriction did not necessarily need to be additionally justified by considerations of \u201cpublic safety\u201d or \u201cprotection of public order\u201d, which are set out in Article\u00a09 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

Thus, the State\u2019s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State\u2019s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed, and the Court considered that this duty requires the State to ensure mutual tolerance between opposing groups. Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (ibid., \u00a7 107).",

The Court emphasised that this would notably be the case when it came to regulating the wearing of religious symbols in educational institutions, especially in view of the diversity of the approaches taken by national authorities on the issue. Referring, inter alia, to the above-cited Dahlab case, the Court found that it was not possible to discern throughout Europe a uniform conception of the significance of religion in society, and that the meaning or impact of the public expression of a religious belief would differ according to time and context. It noted that rules in this sphere would consequently vary from one country to another according to national traditions and the requirements imposed by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others and to maintain public order. It concluded that the choice of the extent and form such regulations should take must inevitably be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it would depend on the specific domestic context (see Leyla \u015eahin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0109).",

Applying those principles, the Court noted that \u201cthe rules on dress apply equally to all public servants, irrespective of their functions or religious beliefs. As public servants act as representatives of the State when they perform their duties, the rules require their appearance to be neutral in order to preserve the principle of secularism and its corollary, the principle of a neutral public service. The rules on dress require public servants to refrain from wearing a head covering on work premises\u201d (see Kurtulmu\u015f, cited above). It accepted, having regard in particular to the importance of the principle of secularism, a fundamental principle of the Turkish State, that the ban on wearing the veil was \u201cjustified by imperatives pertaining to the principle of neutrality in the public service\u201d, and reiterated in this regard, referring to the above-cited judgment in Vogt, that it had \u201cin the past accepted that a democratic State may be entitled to require public servants to be loyal to the constitutional principles on which it is founded\u201d.",

However, as pointed out above (see paragraph\u00a056), consideration must be given to the national context of State-Church relations, which evolve over time in line with changes in society. Thus, the Court notes that France has reconciled the principle of the neutrality of the public authorities with religious freedom, thus determining the balance that the State must strike between the competing private and public interests or competing Convention rights (see paragraphs 21-28 above), and that this left the respondent State a large margin of appreciation (see Leyla \u015eahin, cited above, \u00a7 109, and Obst v. Germany, no. 425/03, \u00a7 42, 23 September 2010). Equally, the Court has already indicated that in the hospital environment the domestic authorities must be allowed a wide margin of appreciation, as hospital managers are better placed to take decisions in their establishments than a court, particularly an international court (see Eweida and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099).",

On this point, the Court notes that public employees in France enjoy the right to respect for their freedom of conscience, which entails, in particular, a ban on any faith-based discrimination in access to posts or in career development. This freedom is guaranteed, in particular, by section 6 of the Law of 13 July 1983 laying down the rights and duties of civil servants, and is to be reconciled with the requirements of the proper functioning of the service (see paragraph 25 above). However, they are prohibited from manifesting their religious beliefs while carrying out their duties (see paragraphs 25-26 above). Thus, the Opinion of 3 May 2000, cited above, clearly states that public employees\u2019 freedom of conscience must be reconciled, albeit solely in terms of how it is given expression, with the obligation of neutrality. The Court reiterates that the reason for this restriction lies in the principle of State secularism, which, according to the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat, \u201cconcerns the relations between the public authorities and private persons\u201d (see paragraph 28 above), and the principle of the neutrality of public services, a corollary of the principle of equality which governs the functioning of these services\u00a0and is intended to ensure respect for all beliefs.",

The principles of secularism and neutrality give expression to one of the rules governing the State\u2019s relations with religious bodies, a rule which implies impartiality towards all religious beliefs on the basis of respect for pluralism and diversity. The Court considers that the fact that the domestic courts attached greater weight to this principle and to the State\u2019s interests than to the applicant\u2019s interest in not limiting the expression of her religious beliefs does not give rise to an issue under the Convention (see paragraphs\u00a054-55 above).",

There is no indication in any text or decision by the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat that the impugned obligation of neutrality could be adjusted depending on the employee and his or her duties (see paragraphs 26 and 31 above). The Court is mindful that this is a strict obligation which has its roots in the traditional relationship between State secularism and freedom of conscience as this is set out in Article 1 of the Constitution (see paragraph 21 above). Under the French model, which it is not the Court\u2019s role to assess as such, the State\u2019s neutrality is incumbent on the employees representing it.

In this respect, the authorities usefully pointed out that the imposed requirement of neutrality was non-negotiable in view of her contact with patients (see paragraph 13 above). Moreover, in a passage which it would have been worth expanding on, they referred to difficulties in the relevant unit (see paragraph 8 above). For their part, the courts dealing with the case accepted, in essence, the French concept of the public service and the ostentatious nature of the veil, concluding that there had not been an excessive interference with the applicant\u2019s religious freedom. Thus, while the applicant\u2019s wearing of a religious symbol amounted to a culpable breach of her duty of neutrality, the impact of this attire on the exercise of her duties was taken into consideration in evaluating the seriousness of that fault and in deciding not to renew her contract. The Court notes that section\u00a029 of the Law of 13 July 1983 does not define the fault (see paragraph 41 above) and that the authorities have discretion in this area. It observes that they obtained witness statements before finding that they had sufficient information to bring disciplinary proceedings against the applicant (see paragraph 8 above).

In those cases, the Court\u2019s reasoning, when finding no violation or rejecting the complaints as manifestly ill-founded, was intimately linked to the role of education and teachers in society, the relative vulnerability of pupils and the impact or influence which religious symbols might have on the latter. In the case-law regarding pupils, the same concerns with the neutrality of State education and the need to protect susceptible and easily influenced pupils and students from pressure and proselytisation emerge. In only one of these cases (Kurtulmu\u015f) did the Court express itself in broader terms, not apparently limited to the specificities of the educational sector, when it found that the applicant teacher had chosen to become a civil servant and the dress code with which she did not wish to comply applied equally to all public servants, irrespective of their functions or religious beliefs.",

The 1983 Law laying down the rights and duties of civil servants (mentioned in paragraph 25 of the present judgment) appears vague and unspecific, as does the 1995 circular on the rights of patients. Only one relevant Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat decision predating the non-renewal date of the applicant\u2019s contract is relied on here and even then it predates it merely by a matter of months. The decision in that case concerned the wearing of religious symbols in educational establishments and simply included a one line obiter to the effect that there was no reason to distinguish between employees in the public service according to whether they were employed in education. However, in a previous Opinion of 1989, relied on by the applicant, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat had held that \u201cwearing signs in schools by which [pupils] manifest their affiliation to a particular religion is not in itself incompatible with the principle of secularism\u201d. According to this Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat Opinion, problems only arose due to the conditions in which the signs were worn and, in particular, if the signs were ostentatious or in some way demanding or constituted acts of pressure and provocation.",

Of course, as the Court has recognised, the meaning or impact of the public expression of a religious belief will differ according to time and context and the rules in this sphere will consequently vary from one country to another. However, the wider the margin of appreciation left to States, the more accessible and foreseeable the legal framework on which they rely should be. It is questionable whether this standard was met in 1999-2000 and the majority judgment could be read as assessing the requirement of lawfulness not with reference to the law as it stood then but with reference to the law as it stands now, following fifteen years of a wide and undoubtedly sensitive debate in French society.",

The majority judgment seeks to couch the member State\u2019s reliance on the principles of secularism and neutrality into the last legitimate aim exhaustively listed in Article 9 \u00a7 2, namely the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Again, it could be argued that the judgment simply applies the approach already developed by the Court under Article 9 in the sphere of education. However, as highlighted above, the principles of neutrality and secularism in those cases sought to protect the rights and freedoms of the pupils and students involved and were intimately linked to the values which educational establishments are intended to teach (see, inter alia, Dahlab, or Leyla \u015eahin, \u00a7 116, both cited above).

As regards the second applicant, the very concrete and legitimate aim of protecting health and safety on a hospital ward outweighed the individual right of that applicant to wear her cross (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 99-100). In the instant case, given the nature and context of the applicant\u2019s work in a psychiatric hospital, the Government could have relied on such a concrete, legitimate aim, expressly provided by Article 9 \u00a7 2.

Nevertheless, such recognition does not release the Court from the obligation under Article 9 \u00a7\u00a02 to establish whether the ban on wearing religious symbols to which the applicant was subject was necessary to secure compliance with those principles and, therefore, to meet a pressing social need. When it comes to the Chamber\u2019s assessment of proportionality (see below), it can be seen that the abstract nature of the principles relied on to defeat the right under Article 9 tended also to render abstract this assessment. The risk is therefore that any measure taken in the name of the principle of secularism-neutrality and which does not exceed a State\u2019s margin of appreciation \u2013 itself very wide because what are in issue are choices of society \u2013 will be Convention compatible.",

In Eweida and Others (\u00a7 83) the Court held, regarding the possibility of changing job, that the better approach in Article 9 cases would be to weigh that possibility in the overall balance when considering whether or not the restriction was proportionate rather than holding that such a possibility negated the existence of interference.

The thrust of the judgment is to the effect that the abstract principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 or secularism of the State requires a blanket prohibition on the wearing by a public official at work of any symbol denoting his or her religious belief. That abstract principle becomes in and of itself a \u201cpressing social need\u201d to justify the interference with a fundamental human right. The attempt to hedge the case and to limit its purport to the specific facts applicable to the applicant is, as pointed out by Judge O\u2019Leary, very weak and at times contradictory. The judgment proceeds from and rests on the false (and, I would add, very dangerous) premise, reflected in paragraph 64, that the users of public services cannot be guaranteed an impartial service if the public official serving them manifests in the slightest way his or her religious affiliation \u2013 even though quite often, from the very name of the official displayed on the desk or elsewhere, one can be reasonably certain of the religious affiliation of that official.",

A woman may wear a headscarf not to manifest a religious belief, or any belief for that matter, but for a variety of other reasons. The same can be said of a man wearing a full beard, or a person wearing a cross with a necklace. Requiring a public official to \u201cdisclose\u201d whether that item of clothing is a manifestation or otherwise of his or her religious belief does not sit well with the purported benefits enjoyed by public officials as mentioned in paragraph 66 of the judgment.",

A principle of constitutional law or a constitutional \u201ctradition\u201d may easily end up by being deified, thereby undermining every value underpinning the Convention. This judgment comes dangerously close to doing exactly that.",
