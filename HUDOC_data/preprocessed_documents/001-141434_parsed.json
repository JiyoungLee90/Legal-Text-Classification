It declared inadmissible the complaint concerning the lack of a public hearing, on the ground that no formal application to that effect had been lodged with the cantonal authorities. As regards the need for a fresh assessment by a neutral expert, it first noted that Article 45 of the Criminal Code did not require one, even though case-law had found it necessary in particular circumstances. In the present case, the Federal Court found that a fresh psychiatric assessment was not necessary, because the initial diagnosis had been confirmed in subsequent therapy reports and \u201cno change c[ould] be identified\u201d. It concluded that no other measure of sentence enforcement could be considered, with the result that the maintaining of the applicant\u2019s confinement was to be regarded as proportionate. As regards, lastly, the complaint about the refusal to grant the applicant legal aid, the Federal Court first observed that he had been able to use the remedies available to him. It then noted that Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention required scrutiny of the lawfulness of detention only at reasonable intervals, and that such intervals were longer with regard to persons of unsound mind, where circumstances only changed in the medium term. The last decision to have been taken by a court in the present case dated from 4\u00a0December 2002. At the time of the annual assessment by the prison administration in 2004, it had been found that the circumstances had clearly not changed since that decision.

No deprivation of liberty of a person considered to be of unsound mind may be deemed in conformity with Article 5 if it has been ordered without seeking the opinion of a medical expert. Any other approach falls short of the required protection against arbitrariness (see Filip v. Romania, no.\u00a041124/02, \u00a7 57, 14\u00a0December 2006, and Cristian Teodorescu v. Romania, no. 22883/05, \u00a7 67, 19 June 2012). As regards the qualifications of the medical expert in question, the Court considers in general that the national authorities are better placed than itself to evaluate them (see, mutatis mutandis, Sabeva v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 44290/07, \u00a7\u00a058, 10\u00a0June 2010; Witek v.\u00a0Poland, no. 13453/07, \u00a7\u00a046, 21\u00a0December\u00a02010; and Biziuk v.\u00a0Poland (no. 2), no. 24580/06, \u00a7\u00a047, 17\u00a0January\u00a02012), but it has previously observed, in certain specific cases, and in particular where the person confined had no history of mental disorders, that it was indispensable for the assessment to be carried out by a psychiatric expert (see Luberti v. Italy, 23 February 1984, \u00a7 29, Series A no.\u00a075; C.B. v. Romania, no.\u00a021207/03, \u00a7 56, 20 April 2010; and \u0164upa v. the Czech Republic, no. 39822/07, \u00a7 47, 26 May 2011).",

It is from this perspective that the finding of a violation of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7 4 must be seen. In fact, the Court has found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 in the present case on the ground that the national authorities did not have sufficient information for it to be established that the conditions for the applicant\u2019s discharge on probation were not satisfied. The District Court of Zurich ordered the applicant\u2019s confinement pursuant to Article 43 of the Criminal Code, as then in force. The applicant was not convicted, even though he had killed his wife, on account of his insanity. He was deprived of his liberty in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e). Consequently, the present case clearly differs from that of D\u00f6rr v. Germany ((dec.), no.\u00a02894/08, 22\u00a0January 2013), which concerned an applicant who had been convicted by a court and given a sentence combined with Sicherungsverwahrung (preventive detention), and which was decided on the basis of complaints under Article 5 \u00a7 1. The D\u00f6rr precedent does not apply in the present case, whatever one may think of the institution of Sicherungsverwahrung or of case-law which may be in conflict with the D\u00f6rr decision (see Herz v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a044672/98, \u00a7\u00a050, 12\u00a0June\u00a02003; Magalh\u00e3es Pereira v.\u00a0Portugal, no.\u00a044872/98, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2002I; and H.W. v.

In the present case, the applicant sought a fresh hearing before the Administrative Court only 8 months after being heard and without submitting the slightest new fact. A hearing would only have served the purpose of allowing the applicant, in person, to deny that he was ill and challenge the scientific validity of the medical assessments, as he had done in writing through his lawyer.

However, where the judicial authority had a sufficient body of evidence in order to assess the dangerousness of the individual concerned, the fact that the psychiatric assessment was not recent was a secondary consideration and not decisive. In the present case, the existence of a sufficient body of evidence is not in doubt. The Administrative Court based its decision on the opinion of three external medical practitioners, on a report by two internal experts and on the hearing of the applicant by the Directorate of Justice and Internal Affairs of the Canton of Zurich (see paragraph 5).",

The situation is different in the present case, where the applicant\u2019s detention had already been examined twice by an external expert and where there was nothing to suggest that the national authorities had breached the domestic law applicable at the time.",

For a number of reasons, I find it problematic, from a methodological standpoint, that it implicitly relies on those reports. First, they contain recommendations that can be characterised as soft law and not binding international obligations. Secondly, the documents to which the majority refer do not allow of the conclusion that in the present case the Administrative Court should have held a fresh hearing under Article 5 \u00a7 4. It is true that the CPT emphasised in its report to the Federal Council that, in order to satisfy the demands of certain patients, involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution should be reviewed at quite brief intervals (for example every three months). In parallel, however, the Committee also found that re-assessment once a year could be regarded as appropriate for long-term patients (Report to the Swiss Federal Council on the visit to Switzerland by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment from 5 to 15 February 2001, published 25 March 2002, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0187189). In addition, there is nothing in the CPT report to suggest that each re-assessment of the detention must be accompanied by a new psychiatric expert\u2019s report. But above all, the CPT\u2019s findings were made in the particular context of guardianship. They concerned the involuntary placement of individuals in a psychiatric institution and not, as here, the confinement of a dangerous criminal. Lastly, it should be noted that Switzerland took account of the CPT\u2019s recommendations in its comprehensive review of guardianship law (Commission d\u2019experts pour la r\u00e9vision totale du droit de la tutelle, Protection de l\u2019adulte, Rapport relatif \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision du code civil, Protection de l\u2019adulte, droit des personnes et droit de la filiation, June 2003, p. 112).",

As the majority rightly stated, \u201c[t]he Court cannot therefore find fault with the national authorities, retrospectively, and solely on the basis of that one further expert\u2019s assessment, for not having called into question the scientific quality of the consistent conclusions of the first two expert\u2019s assessments\u201d (see paragraph 62). What is important for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention is to ascertain whether the national authorities can be criticised for having acted arbitrarily in view of the information available at the time. If that is not the case, the Court should not intervene.",

The Court answers in the affirmative (paragraph 63), observing that the last independent psychiatrist\u2019s report dated back more than three years. In my view, such reasoning cannot be justified in the light of the margin of appreciation afforded to member States in such matters. It is clear from the comparative analysis that there is no consensus or uniform practice among Council of Europe member States as to the assessment on the basis of which the maintaining or discharge of a confinement measure is decided. On the contrary, in at least 15 of the 26 member States studied, the assessment is carried out by the staff responsible for treating the confined person and not by an external expert (see paragraph 34).",
