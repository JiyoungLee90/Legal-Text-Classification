The assessment of this level is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the gender, age and state of health of the victim (see Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a7 100-01, ECHR 2001-VIII). The standard of proof relied upon by the Court is that \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Av\u015far v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a025657/94, \u00a7\u00a0282, ECHR 2001VII (extracts)). Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. The Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny where the applicant raises an arguable ill-treatment complaint (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch\u00a0v. Austria, judgment of 4 December 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0336, \u00a7\u00a032, and Av\u015far\u00a0v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0283). However, it must also be sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of the case (see, for example, McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 28883/95, 4\u00a0April 2000).",

The authorities must also show that the necessary conditions were created for the prescribed treatment to be actually followed through (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116 and Holomiov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0117).",

In April 2005, just before his transfer to penitentiary no.\u00a081, he was found to be suffering from secondary neuritis of the left eye nerve, moderate left-side hemiparesis; cerebral asthenia, mnestic personality impairment, chronic bronchitis and chronic gastro-duodenitis, and assigned a \u201cthird category\u201d of invalidity. In December 2005, by the end of his stay in penitentiary no.\u00a081, the applicant was assigned the \u201csecond category\u201d of invalidity on account of aggravations of the above conditions. In these circumstances the Court cannot but mark that the applicant\u2019s state of health appears to have substantially deteriorated during the period of his detention.",

It notes, first of all, that the applicant was frequently examined by various medical professionals and prescribed treatment for various complaints. Although, as appears from the handwritten medical notes, this treatment was largely symptomatic and based on the administration of painkillers, sedatives and mild conservative medication, without any alternative submissions the Court is not in a position to decide whether the choice of treatment methods appropriately reflected the applicant\u2019s needs and whether he could have obtained better treatment in civil hospitals. Moreover, the Court notes that on several occasions the applicant was in fact examined by medical professionals practising outside the penitentiary system (see paragraphs\u00a025 and 39 above).",

On 13 June 2005 a neurology professor disagreed with that diagnosis and found that \u201cvague limitations of mobility\u201d in the applicant\u2019s left limbs did not meet the criteria of hemiparesis, without, however, indicating her final diagnosis and further recommendations. No attempts to reconcile the two approaches ensued, and, based on the professor\u2019s report, medical staff at penitentiary no.\u00a081 concluded that the applicant\u2019s neurological state was stable and he was exaggerating the extent to which he was in pain. At the same time, in November 2005 the applicant was again diagnosed with hemiparesis and in December 2005 assigned a second (more advanced) category of invalidity on account of aggravations in that and other conditions. In the light of the available materials, the Court is prepared to accept the applicant\u2019s contention that the authorities failed to provide the conditions for his prompt and proper diagnosis.",

In particular, although the applicant suffered from a broken rib upon his placement in SIZO no.\u00a030, the case-file contains no information whatsoever concerning his supervision and treatment on that account. Likewise, notwithstanding the fact that on 18\u00a0December\u00a02003 the applicant was officially recognised as suffering from haemorrhoids and chronic bronchitis, the Court has not been provided with any documents concerning treatment recommendations and supervision on account of bronchitis predating April 2004 or on account of haemorrhoids predating June\u00a02005 (see paragraphs 25 and 38 above).",

Even where such information can be found in these notes, it is largely limited to names of medication, without reference to doses, frequency and duration of treatment, information as to whether the treatment was actually administered as prescribed or any evaluation of its effectiveness. Although the majority of the applicant\u2019s conditions were assessed as chronic, follow-up recommendations for preventive treatment, even where present, are also mostly generic (for example, recommendation of an unspecified diet, see paragraph\u00a038 above). Whether this lack of information is due to insufficient recording or insufficient treatment, in the light of the available materials the Court is unable to conclude that the applicant\u2019s health care needs were comprehensively and thoroughly addressed and that the aggravation of his conditions was not attributable to the lack of care.",

Moreover, in so far as the applicant complained about the failure of the authorities to address properly his concerns about the pain in his back when walking to the cafeteria, the Court notes that according to official records the only arrangement made in this regard was an order to other inmates to drag the applicant to the cafeteria, which cannot be regarded as a means to provide him with qualified assistance addressing his mobility problems or to find a structural solution to the issue (see, among other authorities, Farbtuhs, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060).

The majority seems to accept the explanation provided by the domestic authorities (police and prosecutor) and the Government that recourse to physical force was necessary in restraining the applicant and was made necessary by the applicant\u2019s own conduct, or rather that it was not possible to establish that the applicant was ill-treated while in police custody and therefore the applicant has failed to make his case as required.

Slovenia, no. 29462/95, ECHR 200-XII) and Convention doctrine I would argue that the reasoning in end part of \u00a7 58 of the judgment which reads as follows \u201cAlthough, according to subsequent medical findings, the applicant could have suffered a head injury in 2003, in the absence of any materials shedding light on the relevant circumstances, including the period in which that injury could have been sustained, this allegation alone cannot raise a reasonable suspicion against the police officers\u201d , runs counter to our well established doctrinal principle. Namely that when a person is under the control of authorities (as in the case at hand) there is a strong presumption that the injuries alleged and established are attributable to the authorities and the burden of proof in that case shifts and it is for the authorities to show convincingly that they are not responsible for the alleged injuries. As it has been determined in the Ribitsch and Salman cases, in situations, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of person under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as lying with the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4\u00a0December 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 336 and Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000VII).",
