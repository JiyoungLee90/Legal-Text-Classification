The medical examination took place the following day and revealed that the applicant was suffering minor injuries and had bruises on his abdomen.

Furthermore, the Chamber, when finding that it cannot conclude \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d that the applicant's injuries were caused by the actions of a tax police officer (paragraph 57), seems to lay the burden of proof on the applicant and apply the \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d test in reverse. My understanding is that the burden lies in such situations on the respondent Government, which have to show \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d that the injuries were not caused by State agents. For me this has not been shown in this case. If it had been argued by the Government and found by the Chamber that no causal link between the visit to the police office and the injuries could convincingly be established, I would then have had some difficulty in making these arguments.",
