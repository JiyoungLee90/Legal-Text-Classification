He did not comply with the time-limit for the submission of his observations. The Court notes that his co-applicant in application no.\u00a010780/07 (the first applicant, Mr\u00a0Achilov) did receive the Court\u2019s correspondence, including the letters of 13\u00a0March 2012 in which all three applicants were requested to appoint a lawyer and to submit observations in reply to the Government\u2019s observations. It appears that Mr\u00a0Achilov did inform the other applicants of the communication procedure in application no. 10780/07. The Court also notes that in 2012 the second applicant did receive the Court\u2019s letters in another application pending before the Court (no.\u00a054004/07; see paragraph 2 above) sent to his residential address, and submitted observations in that case (see paragraph 101 below). In September 2012 a letter regarding application no.\u00a010780/07 was actually sent to that residential address but no reply was received (see paragraph 53 above). From 2012 onwards the second applicant maintained no correspondence with the Court in relation to application no.\u00a010780/07. It was only after the Court\u2019s letter in March 2019 that he expressed a continued interest in the case. Overall, even though as it now transpires the second applicant had been in a detention facility after February 2012, the Court is not satisfied that in 2012 the applicant was prevented from complying with the Court\u2019s procedure in respect of application no.\u00a010780/07. Thus the second applicant should have displayed diligence in pursuing his application before the Court, including by notifying the Court without delay of the changes to his correspondence address in respect of application no.\u00a010780/07 at the relevant times.",

Nor was it covered by sub-paragraph (b), since there is no allegation or evidence that he failed to comply with any lawful court order or to fulfil any obligation prescribed by law (see Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria, no. 65755/01, \u00a7 73, 22\u00a0May 2008, with further references). The Government have not specified any legal basis for any legal obligation on a suspect or witness to submit to an interview during a pre-investigation inquiry and, by implication, any legal obligation to remain at the disposal of the authorities for as long as necessary for this purpose (see, by contrast, Iliya Stefanov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a074). It remains unclear whether the applicant had the procedural status of a suspect or witness or another status.",

A person may be detained under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention in the context of criminal proceedings, for the purpose of bringing him or her before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence. The \u201creasonableness\u201d of the suspicion on which deprivation of liberty must be based forms an essential part of the safeguard laid down in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c). Having a reasonable suspicion presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence. What may be regarded as reasonable will, however, depend on all the circumstances. Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c) of the Convention does not presuppose that the investigating authorities have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges at the time of arrest. The purpose of questioning during detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) is to further the criminal investigation by confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicion grounding the arrest. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC], no. 72508/13, \u00a7\u00a0184, 28\u00a0November 2017).",

Thus, it is not unreasonable that the police found it necessary also to interview the applicant in relation to this. However, it was (and remains) unclear what specific offence under the Criminal Code was in issue. The Court also notes that the summonses referred to Article 73 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which concerns the list of circumstances that need to be established in criminal proceedings.

Thus, irrespective of the validity of the applicant\u2019s prosecution in relation to certain aspects of his actual conduct, which he did not claim was part of his expression protected by Article 10 of the Convention and which the appeal court did not confirm as factually established, the Court is not satisfied that it was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d to prosecute the applicant in relation to his placard.

However, the Court is not satisfied that all the relevant facts were properly established in the course of the various sets of domestic proceedings and subjected to a thorough assessment in order to ascertain whether the termination of the demonstration (or of the applicant\u2019s participation therein) was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, in particular on account of any valid reasons going beyond the mere illegality of the demonstration (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0461), for instance in pursuance of the protection of the \u201crights of others\u201d and public safety.

Similarly, the Court considers that his prosecution under Article 20.1 of the CAO in relation to his subsequent conduct in the premises of the prosecutor\u2019s office was not related to the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly during the demonstration, which is the thrust of the complaint before the Court (compare with Taranenko v. Russia, no.\u00a019554/05, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, 15 May 2014). By contrast, his prosecution under Article\u00a020.2 of the CAO and the fine of RUB 1,000 imposed on him for staging the demonstration at an \u201cunsuitable venue\u201d did constitute an \u201cinterference\u201d under Article 10 of the Convention. However, the applicant has not adduced any particular argument pertaining to this conviction. For its part, the Court notes that it had a legal basis in section 8 of the Public Events Act and Article\u00a020.2 of the CAO. The applicant raised no arguments relating to the proportionality of the \u201cinterference\u201d, in particular in view of the low amount of the fine (see, in a similar context, Muchnik and Mordovin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 49-50).
