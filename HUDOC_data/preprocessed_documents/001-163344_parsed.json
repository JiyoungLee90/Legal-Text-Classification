The changes aimed at improving existing domestic standards in the light of Article 12 of the aforementioned Convention, which specifies that States should recognise that people with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life, and therefore States should take appropriate measures to provide them with access to the support they may require in exercising their legal capacity.",

As a result, those with psychiatric illnesses, owing to which they could not always make decisions in their best interests, would be exposed to the most restrictive measure \u2013 full incapacitation. Even if a person could partially understand or control his actions, limiting his legal capacity by only allowing him to act in certain areas of life was not permitted by law. However, limited legal capacity could be established in respect of people who abused narcotic or psychotropic substances or alcohol (Articles 2.10 and 2.11 of the Civil Code, see paragraph 33 above).",

The existing law also lacked a means of guaranteeing that, after the person was declared incapacitated, his or her earlier wishes would be taken into account.

Moreover, there was no legal requirement for a court to review an incapacity decision if none of the people who could initiate incapacity proceedings had not asked for a review for a long time.

As a result, he enjoyed the rights of an interested party, including the right to be duly informed of the time and place of any hearing. The fact that the incapacitation case was heard in the absence of D.L. \u2013 who did not open the door to anyone and thus did not accept correspondence \u2013 was assessed by the Supreme Court as a violation of her right to be duly informed of the time and place of hearing. It also found that by failing to hear the person concerned and without making sure that she had been aware of the proceedings, the first-instance court had breached the principle of equality of arms and her right to appeal against the incapacity decision, because it had not been served on her. The Supreme Court also referred to Principle no. 13 of Recommendation No. R(99)4 by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (see paragraph 68 below), stating that a person has the right to be heard in any proceedings which could affect his legal capacity. This procedural guarantee should be applicable to the fullest extent possible, at the same time bearing in mind the requirements of Article\u00a06 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In this regard, the Supreme Court also referred to the Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that mental illness could result in appropriate restrictions of a person\u2019s right to a fair hearing. However, such measures should not affect the very essence of that right (the Supreme Court relied on Winterwerp v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, \u00a7\u00a060, Series A no. 33, and Lac\u00e1rcel Men\u00e9ndez v.

Very weighty reasons therefore had to be given for incapacitation (the Supreme Court referred to Matter v. Slovakia, no. 31534/96, \u00a7\u00a068, 5\u00a0July 1999). It drew attention to the fact that different degrees of incapacity may exist, and that it may vary from time to time. Full restriction of legal capacity should therefore not be an unavoidable result when protecting the rights of the mentally disabled. The Supreme Court established two criteria to be observed: medical, the mental illness or disorder, recognised by a forensic psychiatric examination report and legal, the inability to understand and control one\u2019s actions because of the mental illness. Both criteria were essential and of equal importance to each case regarding someone\u2019s incapacitation. The Supreme Court emphasised that the question of establishing incapacity could not be examined in a purely formalistic way, simply following the medical criteria established in the expert\u2019s conclusion and considering it to be sufficient grounds for finding someone incapable (the Supreme Court relied on Shtukaturov v. Russia, no. 44009/05, ECHR\u00a02008). Moreover, the medical expert report as to the mental capacity of the person did not bind the court.",

Legal status could only be reviewed on the initiative of the person\u2019s guardian or others, but not on the initiative of the incapacitated person. For that reason, fairness of the incapacitation proceedings was crucial. The Supreme Court also observed that under Article 464 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a person whose incapacitation was at issue should be present at the hearing where his incapacitation is being decided, unless medical experts have deemed his participation impossible because of his or her state of mind.",

In the circumstances of the case, the legally incapacitated person first appealed against the first-instance court\u2019s decision to incapacitate her. Later she withdrew her appeal, an application which the appellate court had quickly accepted. The Supreme Court found that without holding a hearing and examining whether the plaintiff truly wished to terminate the court proceedings (and with information that she actually objected to her incapacitation), the appellate court had failed to take into account the importance of the issue at stake for her, and had thus breached her right to a fair hearing and the principle that priority must be given to the protection of the rights of the vulnerable.

However, he had only lodged his application with the Court on 28 March 2008, nearly a year and two months later. The Government admitted that they did not have information to determine if or when the applicant had received the decision regarding his incapacitation. It could only be presumed that his mother, later appointed as his guardian, had informed him of that decision. In any case, it was completely clear that the applicant had found out about the decision on 9\u00a0March 2007, as he had referred to it himself in his request to be provided with legal aid on 26 November 2008 (see paragraph 24 above). On the basis of an extract from the applicant\u2019s medical records (see paragraph 22 above), the Government argued that on 15 March 2007 the treating doctor had given him a copy of the \u0160iauliai District Court\u2019s decision of 13\u00a0March 2007, and in the later decision it had been clearly indicated that he had been declared legally incapable by the Akmen\u0117 District Court on 31\u00a0January 2007. For the Government, the sixmonth time-limit had therefore started running from at least 15 March 2007. They also noted the applicant\u2019s letter to the Akmen\u0117 District Court, in which he had stated that he had seen the prosecutor\u2019s request to have him declared incapacitated (see paragraph 18 above). The applicant, however, had not taken any action for nearly a year and a half, within either the domestic system or the international system. The Government were also of the view that the alleged violation of the applicant\u2019s rights could not be considered to be of a continuous nature.",

Nor had he given any valid reasons why any of those time-limits had been missed. It was therefore reasonable for the Legal Aid Service to have concluded that the appeal against the decision to incapacitate him had had no prospects. The Government also deemed it appropriate to note that in his request for legal aid the applicant had asked the Legal Aid Service to appeal against the aforementioned incapacity decision and had requested that the court extend the missed time-limit for lodging an appeal. However, he had not requested a reopening of the civil proceedings (atnaujinti proces\u0105) regarding his legal incapacity, which was a different legal avenue (see paragraph 67 above). Lastly, he had not challenged before the administrative courts the Legal Aid Service\u2019s refusal to assist him either.",

It considers, however, that in many cases the fact that an individual has to be placed under guardianship because he lacks the ability to administer his affairs does not mean that he is incapable of expressing a view on his situation. In such cases, it is essential that the person concerned should have access to court and the opportunity to be heard either in person or, where necessary, through some form of representation. Mental illness may entail restricting or modifying the manner of exercise of such a right, but it cannot justify impairing the very essence of the right, except in very exceptional circumstances, such as those mentioned above. Indeed, special procedural safeguards may prove called for in order to protect the interests of persons who, on account of their mental health issues, are not fully capable of acting for themselves (see D.D. v. Lithuania, cited above, \u00a7 118).",

Moreover, the Court accepts that the applicant should have learned about the incapacitation proceedings on at least 30 January 2007, when, in his words, he had found the prosecutor\u2019s request for his incapacitation (see paragraph 18 above). Be that as it may, the Akmen\u0117 District Court ruled on the issue already the following day, and there is nothing to indicate that the applicant\u2019s written plea of 5\u00a0February 2007 received any reaction from the court.

Furthermore, the Court notes that the applicant played a double role in the proceedings: he was an interested party, and, at the same time, the main object of the court\u2019s examination. His participation was therefore necessary, not only to enable him to present his own case, but also to allow the judge to have at least brief visual contact with him, and preferably question him to form a personal opinion about his mental capacity (see Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7 72). Given that the potential finding of the applicant being of unsound mind was, by its very nature, largely based on his personality, his statements would have been an important part of his presentation of his case (see D.D. v.

However, and without doubting their good intentions, in the Court\u2019s opinion their presence did not make the proceedings truly adversarial. Indeed, whilst by law the prosecutor was performing the function of defending the public interest, there was no one at the court hearing who could, on the applicant\u2019s behalf, rebut the arguments or conclusions by his mother or the prosecutor. For the Court, taking into account the principle of procedural fairness (see Principle 7 in paragraph 68 above), it would have been appropriate for Akmen\u0117 District social services to pay more attention to the merits of the applicant\u2019s case. However, their involvement was restricted to a simple indication of the word \u201cagree\u201d in their response to the prosecutors\u2019 request, as sent to the Akmen\u0117 District Court (see paragraph 14 above), without providing a more elaborate or comprehensive response. In this connection, the Court also draws particular attention to the new Lithuanian legislation which requires social workers to provide what appears to be a very specific conclusion as to the person\u2019s capacity or incapacity to act in particular areas (see paragraph 55 above). The Court also notes that after legislative changes in 2015 the State [of Mind] of Incapacitated Persons\u2019 Review Commission, which has a very specific role of monitoring people with disabilities in order to protect their rights, was brought into Lithuanian legislation (see paragraph 52 above), thus making the current legal background substantially different from that which existed in 2007, when the applicant\u2019s case was decided by the Akmen\u0117 District Court. The lack of any meaningful involvement on the part of social services in the applicant\u2019s case, especially in view of the clear European standards that in 2007 already existed and that prompted amendments to Lithuanian legislation in order to rectify the shortcomings of the legislation applicable at the material time (see paragraphs 44, 68 and 69 above), leads the Court to conclude that his interests at the Akmen\u0117 District Court were not represented to make the proceedings fair in any form.",

Lithuania, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0120). Furthermore, that medical expert report to the effect that the applicant could not take care of himself appears to be based on an account by the applicant\u2019s mother, without there being any proof that those circumstances had been verified by the State or municipal authorities themselves. Similarly, the Court observes that the Akmen\u0117 District Court did not call anyone else as a witness so that more light could be shed on the applicant\u2019s state of health (see paragraph 62 above).",

It also considers that the principle that particular attention must be given to the protection of the rights of the vulnerable extends to appeal proceedings. The Lithuanian Supreme Court clearly shared the view that rights of persons with disabilities had to be guaranteed at all stages of court proceedings (see paragraph 65 above). The Court has also held that the right to request that a court review a declaration of incapacity is one of the most important rights for the person concerned (see K\u0119dzior v.

Accordingly, he may not be blamed for not appealing against that decision within thirty days, or for asking to extend the time-limit for appeal within six months of the date the incapacity decision was adopted. In this connection, it is also relevant that for the period of 9 March to 22 June 2007 the applicant was in the \u0160iauliai Psychiatric Hospital, where, this not having been disputed by the Government, he had no access to a lawyer. Against this background, and whilst accepting that by the time the applicant contacted the Legal Aid Service on 26 November 2008 the time-limits of thirty days and six months had already expired, the Court can only hold that the Legal Aid Service\u2019s response was purely formalistic and limited to the question of time-limits which, in their view, the applicant had to observe (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above; also see paragraph 73 above regarding the Government\u2019s suggestion about another legal avenue theoretically available to the applicant).",

Accordingly, and given the complexity of the legal issues at stake, the Court cannot share the Government\u2019s view that in his plea to the Legal Aid Service the applicant should have specified the request to reopen civil proceedings as the appropriate legal avenue, whereas in fact he only asked to extend the time-limit to lodge an appeal against the 31\u00a0January 2007 decision (see paragraphs 24 and 73 above). To require him to have such an understanding of the law would be plainly disproportionate. The Court also is mindful of the fact that at the material time the applicant, once declared incapacitated, had no legal standing and thus could not bring any court action himself, including against the Legal Aid Service. In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court dismisses the Government\u2019s preliminary objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies (see paragraph 73 above).",

An incapacitated person had to rely on the good will of others, but not on objective factors such as improvement of health.

At this juncture, the Court considers that where a measure of protection is necessary it should be proportionate to the degree of capacity of the person concerned and tailored to his individual circumstances and needs (see Principle 6 of Recommendation No.\u00a0R(99)4, paragraph 68\u00a0above). Contrary to this standard, Lithuanian legislation did not provide for a tailor-made response. The Court thus finds that the guardianship regime was not geared to the applicant\u2019s individual case but entailed restrictions automatically imposed on anyone who had been declared incapable by a court. This conclusion is further confirmed by the latest legislative changes and, in particular, the explanatory memorandum by the Ministry of Justice, wherein the flaws of the former legal regulation were pointed. Partial incapacity was thus introduced to Lithuanian legislation on 1\u00a0January 2016 (see paragraphs 44 et seq. above).",

The reason for this approach, which questions certain classifications per se, is that such groups were historically subject to prejudice with lasting consequences, resulting in their social exclusion. Such prejudice could entail legislative stereotyping which prohibits the individualised evaluation of their capacities and needs. In the past, the Court has identified a number of such vulnerable groups that suffered different treatment, persons with mental disabilities being one of them (see Alajos Kiss v. Hungary, no. 38832/06, \u00a7 42, 20 May 2010, and Kiyutin\u00a0v. Russia, no. 2700/10, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2011).",

Indeed, the applicant\u2019s incapacitation, which applied for an indefinite period, at the material time could not have been challenged other than by his guardian, on whose initiative the applicant was incapacitated, a care institution, whose involvement in the applicant\u2019s case the Court has already found to be lacking (see paragraph 98 above), or a public prosecutor. The Court has already held, in respect of partially incapacitated individuals, that given the trends emerging in national legislation and the relevant international instruments, Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention must be interpreted as guaranteeing a person, in principle, direct access to a court to seek restoration of his or her legal capacity (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7 245). In the latter judgment the Court observed that eighteen of the twenty national legal systems studied in 2011 provided for direct access to the courts for any partially incapacitated individuals wishing to have their status reviewed. In seventeen States such access was open even to those declared fully incapable (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 95 and 243). This indicates that there is now a trend at European level towards granting legally incapacitated individuals direct access to the courts to seek restoration of their capacity. The Court has also had occasion to clarify that proceedings for restoration of legal capacity are directly decisive for the determination of \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d. It may also be appropriate in cases of this kind that the domestic authorities establish after a certain lapse of time whether such a measure continues to be justified. Re-examination is particularly justified if the person concerned requests it (see Matter, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 68).",
