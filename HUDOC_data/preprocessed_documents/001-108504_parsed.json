There are three main grounds for finding a violation of the right to freedom of religion in cases of conscientious objectors: first, a person\u2019s conscience or deeply and genuinely held religious or other beliefs constituting a conviction or belief of sufficient cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance to attract the guarantees of Article 9 (see Bayatyan, cited above, \u00a7 110); second, the fact that at the time the alleged events took place in Armenia the right to conscientious objection was recognised in State practice in Europe; and, third, that Armenia had pledged to enact the necessary legislation to implement that right at domestic level.",

The Court\u2019s answer is that even if the facts of the case arose before and during the transitional period for the enactment of the relevant domestic law on alternative service granted to Armenia upon its accession to the Council of Europe, the obligation to respect the right to freedom of religion of conscientious objectors applies from the moment the right itself is established in international law and the State concerned has ratified the Convention. This sheds an interesting light on the role of the Council of Europe and the political process of negotiating the entrance conditions for prospective member States of the organisation. Neither the Grand Chamber in the Bayatyan judgment nor the Chamber in this case have provided a clear solution to this. Instead, the dialogue of  with the Council of Europe has been one of the arguments considered by the Court as part of the balancing exercise between the rights of the applicants and the public interest.",

It seems to me that the European Court acts on the basis of an assumption that the applicant indeed holds genuine convictions as confirmed by all the procedures that he has gone through at domestic level and that, in the absence of any proper domestic assessment or arguments to the contrary from the Government, the Court has had to maintain that assumption. I can certainly agree that the Government did not submit any evidence to the contrary or, for that matter, any other relevant explanation. In my view, there is still an unresolved question regarding the test and how it will be applied in practice in future cases.",
