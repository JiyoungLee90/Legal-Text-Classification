However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention.

The \u201cexpectation\u201d damages theory forms part of the breach-of-contract law specific to common-law legal systems and is applicable under certain conditions, the first of which is the existence of a contract concluded in a written form. The \u201cexpectation\u201d damages resulting from the breach of an orally concluded contract can be granted only where the defendant has agreed to them. Another condition is that \u201cexpectation\u201d damages must be foreseeable, so as to enable parties to a contract to identify the legal and financial consequences of the breach of their contractual obligations, to enable parties to decide what is more convenient to them \u2013 to continue to incur extra expense resulting from the fulfilment of their contractual obligations or to breach them and pay the other party the financial compensation provided for by the contract.

The goal is to put the injured party in the position he or she would have been in if the contract had been performed according to its terms [emphasis added].

Without answering this question we could not even speak about settling the merits of the case, quite apart from the Article 41 issues.

Prices for apartments situated in different districts of Kishivev, in different houses, new ones, old ones, etc. are generally accessible on the \u201cLARA\u201d Internet site (the organisation which issued the certificate concerning the rent for 1 sq. m. of the house in question). The average price for 1 sq. m. is approximately USD 350. We know the area of the apartment, so there would be no problem in calculating the price. On the other hand, the market price cannot be determined in exact terms, because it is formed as a compromise between demand and supply and is always a result of negotiations between a seller and a buyer. But, as a matter of fact the price is not so important in this particular situation, because the Chamber was required to rule on restitution of the property and the price could come into play only in a situation where, because of some extraordinary circumstances, such restitution was impossible.
