Nor could it be regarded as necessary for compliance with the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies within the meaning of Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. Lastly, the Court considered that any damages that the first applicant might have been able to recover against the seller of the flat might only be taken into account for the purposes of assessing the proportionality of the interference and, calculation of pecuniary damage if a violation of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention was found by the Court, and if just satisfaction was awarded under Article 41 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a062).",

Once the courts had established that the privatisation of the flat had been fraudulent, they had concluded automatically that the City of Moscow had had no intention of divesting itself of it. She further argued that the circumstances of her case bore close resemblance to those considered by the Court in the case of Gladysheva (cited above). As in that case, by repossessing the flat she had purchased, the authorities had placed an excessive burden on her. She had acquired the property in good faith and they had failed to ensure a fair balance between their decision to reclaim the property and the first applicant\u2019s interests. The first applicant further noted that the State bore responsibility for the fraudulent transactions in respect of the flat.

However, her losses had been caused by the fraudulent acts of other individuals and she could recover the damage by bringing a civil action for damages against the person(s) who had sold the flat to her. In the Government\u2019s opinion, the loss of the real property in such circumstances did not amount to a disproportionate burden for the first applicant, given that she and her daughters had not been evicted and continued to reside in the flat.

The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions or controlling their use. Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance, and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicant (see Former King of Greece and Others v.\u00a0Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2000-XII).",

It was also within the State\u2019s exclusive competence to legalise the transfer of the title to the flat through a registration procedure specifically aimed at providing extra security to the title holder. With so many regulatory authorities having granted clearance to the title to the flat, it was not for the first applicant, or any other third-party buyer of the flat, to assume the risk of ownership being revoked on account of defects which should have been eliminated in procedures specially designed to do so. The authorities\u2019 oversight could therefore not justify subsequent retribution against the first applicant (see Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7 79).",

In particular, it was incumbent on them to protect the interests of Ol., who had been undergoing compulsory inpatient treatment in a psychiatric institution since 2003, and also had had a right to reside in the flat as a tenant under a social housing agreement before having been fraudulently deprived of it. As established earlier, given that all the regulatory agencies sanctioned the transactions that resulted in Ol. forfeiting his tenancy rights, it would be unfair to correct that omission at the first applicant\u2019s expense.",

As regards the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s loss could be mitigated if she sued the sellers of the flat for damages, the Court accepts that this opportunity is open to her. However, in the particular circumstances of the case it is clear that the payment of damages could not be pushed back as far as the fraudulent party, because the criminal investigation, which has been pending since 2006, have not established the identity of the culprit. Given that the events in question took place in 2004, the chances of that culprit being found are virtually non-existent at this stage. The Government\u2019s argument can be only construed as suggestion that the applicant pass her excessive individual burden on to other bona fide buyers of the flat, and it is hard for the Court to see how that would improve the balance between the public interest and the need to protect individuals\u2019 rights.",

However, it was not for the first applicant to assume the risk of the title to the flat being revoked on account of the said omissions on the part of the authorities in procedures especially designed to prevent fraud in real-property transactions. The Court reiterates that mistakes or errors on the part of State authorities should serve to benefit the persons affected. In other words, the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova v. Russia, no. 15711/13, \u00a7\u00a049, 29 January 2015, with further references). The Court therefore concludes that the forfeiture of the title to the flat by the first applicant and its transfer to the City of Moscow, in the circumstances of the case, placed a disproportionate and excessive burden on her (compare, Gladysheva, cited, above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a077-83).",

Thus, the first applicant would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which she would have been had there not been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (compare, Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106).

On the contrary, in the Supreme Court case quoted in paragraph 30 of the judgment the Supreme Court took into consideration the fact that the information concerning the fraud was available in accessible public records (in the list of missing persons). Only a domestic court (or the domestic legislature) is in the position to determine which public data collections can be relevant for such purposes.",

Article 53 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation reads: \u201cEveryone shall have the right to State compensation for damage caused by unlawful actions (inaction) of bodies of State authority and their officials.\u201d As the Government argued, applicant did in fact sue a number of State agencies, but those claims were dismissed because the parties failed to attend hearings and did not request that the hearing be held in their absence. Therefore, the application should have been rejected for non-exhaustion of remedies. This Government argument was simply not considered; the Court only deals with remedies against the final judgment and recourse against third (fraudulent) parties.",

The Court admits this special interest, but turns it to the applicant\u2019s advantage. The lack of protection of the interests of the particularly vulnerable person increases the State\u2019s responsibility, and therefore the applicant\u2019s interest must prevail against the public interest (to protect social housing) and the interest of the original tenant. But the alleged lack of State responsibility vis-\u00e0-vis the applicant does not diminish the public interest! When it comes to balancing the various interests, and contrary to the judgment (see paragraph 56), the burden on the applicant should not be considered as being imposed solely for the sake of the City of Moscow as the original owner. The City held that property for the use of a person who was in need of social housing. O.I.\u2019s private interest is not mentioned in the balancing exercise. The Court is content to state that it would be \u201cunfair\u201d\u2018 to correct O.I.\u2019s loss at the first applicant\u2019s expense. But even a conclusion of fairness needs reasons; fairness in law is not a matter of pure sentiment. If fairness is intuition, as it should not be in law, than the undeniable right of a particularly vulnerable person to social housing is perhaps more important on a human scale than the property title, which is not recognised in domestic law, of a person who acquired it from crooks.",
