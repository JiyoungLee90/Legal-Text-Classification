They relied in this respect on the Supreme Court's resolution and its construction of Article 258 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above). However, the Court would reiterate that, while the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself justify long periods of detention on remand (see, for instance, Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001). Having regard to the above, the Court cannot accept the position adopted by the judicial authorities in the present case, namely that the presumption referred to above would alone, after a certain lapse of time, justify the applicant's continued detention, without the need to indicate any concrete facts supporting the risk of obstruction of the proceedings.",

In this regard, the Court reiterates that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the alleged criminal activities of the applicant may be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings (see, G\u00f3rski v. , no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4 October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention (see, Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised criminal gangs, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high. Indeed, the Court notes that the applicant attempted to intimidate a witness (see paragraph 23 above). Furthermore, it accepts that certain delays during the trial were caused by the defendants' obstructiveness and the abuse of the rights of the defence (see paragraphs\u00a020-21 above).",

On many occasions he had challenged the trial court and requested that the case be sent back to the prosecution or transferred to another court. At the hearing held on 18 May 2005 the applicant had supported the request of another defendant to read all the documents indicated in the bill of indictment. That request had resulted in significant delay in the proceedings.",

The defendants' obstructiveness and the abuse of the rights of the defence were referred to expressly on a few occasions by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 20-21 above).
