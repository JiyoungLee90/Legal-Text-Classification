The Court notes further that the applicant agreed that the enforcement of the eviction order scheduled for 6 October 2000 be postponed until the end of the year 2000. However, such an agreement was obviously motivated by the applicant's expectation that the illegal occupants of her flat would vacate the flat of their own will which follows from the fact that on 15 January 2001 the applicant asked the Court to continue the proceedings. Even if the Court accepts the Government's assertion that on two more occasions, i.e., 14\u00a0November 2001 and 1 February 2002, the applicant's counsel agreed that the enforcement of the eviction order be postponed, he did so for only a limited period of time.
