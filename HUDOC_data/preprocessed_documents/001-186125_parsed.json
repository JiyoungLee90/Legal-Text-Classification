It also noted that according to the findings of the prosecutor\u2019s office, the applicant had been handcuffed on 19 July 2010 and there was no evidence that he had been released afterwards. In view of those findings, the Court of Appeal concluded that the applicant\u2019s allegations that he had been kept in detention from 19 to 22 July 2010 were credible and that that period of detention was to be deducted from his sentence. However, the Court of Appeal did not establish any causal link between that irregular detention and his confession. The Court of Appeal also held that the trial court had not erred in admitting the applicant\u2019s statement given during the pre-trial investigation, since the applicant\u2019s rights had been explained to him prior to questioning, a lawyer had been present and the applicant had not told him of any ill-treatment.",

On this latter point the Court has explained that where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim. In the absence of such explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government (ibid., \u00a7 83).",

It appears that no specialist evidence was proffered in support of that conclusion. Indeed, the very form in which the domestic investigation took place, the \u201cpre-investigation enquiries\u201d procedure, prevented the prosecutor from ordering a formal expert assessment on this point (see Yevgeniy Petrenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a055749/08, \u00a7\u00a7 67 and 68, 29 January 2015, and Grigoryan and Sergeyeva v. Ukraine, no. 63409/11, \u00a7\u00a7 61-63, 28\u00a0March 2017). It is not clear why the prosecutor apparently did not even attempt to put that question to the medical expert he did interview (see\u00a0paragraph 29 above). Moreover, in his decision the prosecutor accepted that the applicant had been released on 19 July and re-arrested on 22 July 2010, a conclusion which was hardly credible for the reasons stated by the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 32 above). The fact that the prosecutor was willing to accept without criticism the police officers\u2019 contradictory statements on that point demonstrates a lack of thoroughness in his approach to the investigation in general (see Kaverzin v.

Starting on 3 September 2010 (see paragraph 16 above) and subsequently throughout the proceedings the applicant maintained that he had intended to set on fire an empty summer cottage, which would rule out a murder conviction. However, in convicting him the courts relied on statements he had made in the early stages of the investigation to the effect that he had been aware that the house, and more precisely the room where he had thrown the fire bomb, had been occupied. The applicant\u2019s statement, on 22 July 2010, that he had selected the room in which to throw the firebomb precisely because it had appeared to be occupied (see paragraph 11 above) appears to have been of particular importance in that respect.",
