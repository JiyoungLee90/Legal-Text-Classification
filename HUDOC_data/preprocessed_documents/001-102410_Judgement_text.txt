The case originated in an application (no. 30713/05) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Galyna Marianivna Gerega (“the applicant”), on 26 July 2005.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 16 March 2010 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the court proceedings in the applicant’s case to the Government. In accordance with Protocol No. 14, the application was allocated to a Committee of three Judges.
The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in the Lviv Region.
In 1991 Mr A. (the applicant’s relative) lodged a claim with the Staryy Sambir Court against the applicant challenging her title to a house which she had inherited under her aunt’s will. In 1993, following the request of Mr A., the court discontinued the proceedings.
On 24 July 1997, following the request of the widow of Mr A. (who had died in the meantime), the same court re-opened the case under the newly-discovered circumstances procedure.
On 6 September 2000 the Galytskyy District Court of Lviv delivered a judgment in the case. On 18 December 2000 the Lviv Regional Court of Appeal quashed it and remitted the case for fresh consideration.
On 18 March 2003 the  invalidated a part of the will.
On 23 June 2003 and 15 November 2004 respectively the Lviv Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court upheld the above judgment. The applicant received the decision of 15 November 2004 on 29 January 2005.
Subsequently, the applicant unsuccessfully sought review of the case under the newly-discovered circumstances procedure.
According to the Government, in the course of the proceedings two hearings were adjourned upon the applicant’s requests, three hearings due to her failure to appear and three other hearings due to both parties’ failure to appear. The applicant disagreed. According to her, between 3 and 30 June 2000 she underwent in-patient treatment and thus could not attend one of the hearings referred to by the Government. Three hearings were adjourned due to the absence of the judge or upon the other party’s request.
