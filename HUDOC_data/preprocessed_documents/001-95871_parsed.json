Having regard to the provisions of Russian law on the service of court summons (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d above), the Court considers that the Government should have been in possession of such evidence. The failure on the Government's part to submit it without a satisfactory explanation gives rise to the drawing of inferences as to the ill-foundedness of their allegations. In such circumstances, the Court accepts the applicant's argument that the domestic authorities had failed to notify the applicant of the appeal hearing in such a way as to provide her with an opportunity to attend it and present her case effectively.",
