The\u00a0direct involvement of the Child Support Agency in the process and its powers of enforcement meant that the responsibility of the State was engaged.

The\u00a0Commissioner held that \u201ca gay relationship can be a family for the purpose of [A]rticle 8\u201d. He saw no reason, in the context of child support legislation, to distinguish between families according to the sexual orientation of the partners. The purpose of the regulations was to determine the financial obligation of the absent parent, a matter on which his or her sexual orientation should have no bearing. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s situation was within the ambit of the right to respect for family life. He\u00a0rejected, however, the applicant\u2019s argument that the situation also came within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Turning to Article 14, the Commissioner found that, in the context of child support payments, the applicant\u2019s situation was analogous to that of an absent parent living with a heterosexual partner, who, all other things being equal, would have been required to pay around GBP 14 per week instead of almost GBP 47. He\u00a0considered that the Government had not advanced any justification for treating the applicant differently and therefore ruled that the child support scheme violated the applicant\u2019s Convention right under Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 8. Concerning the remedy, he disagreed with the approach of the Appeals Tribunal. Instead, since the regulations defined the various terms used by the regulations \u201cunless the context otherwise requires\u201d, he considered that, with the entry into force of the Human Rights Act on 2 October 2000, the \u201ccontext\u201d now included the absent parent\u2019s Convention rights. Therefore, the definition of an unmarried couple (\u201ca man and a woman who are not married to each other but are living together as husband and wife\u201d) did not apply in this situation.",

By a judgment given on 15 October 2005, that court upheld the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Lord Justice Sedley considered that the applicant\u2019s previous family life (i.e. the relationship between herself, her former husband and her children) was not within the ambit of Article 8. As\u00a0for her relationship with her partner, he read the decision of the European Court in Mata Estevez v. Spain (dec.), no. 56501/00, ECHR\u00a02001VI as establishing that the question whether same-sex relationships fall within Article 8 is a matter of domestic law. Citing a number of domestic precedents which treated same-sex couples as no different from heterosexual couples in certain contexts, he considered that the applicant\u2019s relationship constituted family life for the purposes of the case. Any discrimination against the applicant on the grounds of her sexual orientation called for compelling and proportionate justification. He found that the child support scheme impinged in some significant degree on the family life of the applicant and her partner, bringing their situation within the ambit of Article 8. As the scheme discriminated against the applicant on grounds of her sexual orientation, Article 14 was engaged. He rejected the argument that the scheme came within the ambit of the applicant\u2019s private life, since the scheme did not set out to recognise the applicant\u2019s sexual orientation. Regarding Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, he considered it unnecessary to decide if it too was engaged, although he doubted that it was. He found that the Government had not provided any acceptable justification for the discrimination against the applicant. He rejected the arguments advanced on behalf of the Secretary of State about the difficulty of correcting a problem that was but one instance of a distinction applied throughout the wider social security system, observing that there was no doctrine of justification by the logistics of reform. As for a remedy, he considered that the appropriate course was to disapply (in effect delete) the definition in the regulations of an unmarried couple so as to eliminate the requirement of heterosexuality.",

He too rejected the argument that the situation came within the ambit of the applicant\u2019s private life, finding that this had not been interfered with. Regarding Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, he accepted that the situation came within the scope of that provision since a possession of the applicant\u2019s (money) was being taken away from her under rules that left her worse off than a person in a position identical to hers in all respects save for their sexual orientation.

Nor did the situation come within the ambit of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her private life. Though her relationship with her partner was an aspect of her private life, the applicant had not been penalised on account of it. Her real complaint was that she was unable to take advantage of a benefit that was available to a category of absent parents since she did not come within that category. As regards Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, he found that this provision was not engaged. The child support scheme was concerned with the allocation of assets to discharge an existing obligation. To hold that any situation in which there was a net adverse financial impact on an individual constituted a prima facie deprivation of possessions would be an unacceptably broad interpretation. There would be almost no limit to the circumstances in which that provision would be sufficiently engaged for the purposes of Article 14.",

Some measures were so intrusive that they plainly failed to respect an individual\u2019s private life, whereas less serious interferences would not merely not breach Article 8, they would not fall within its ambit at all. He further noted that the case-law concerning alleged discrimination in relation to the family life limb of Article 8 had concerned measures very closely connected to family life. He was prepared to assume that the applicant, her new partner and their children from their previous marriages should be regarded as a family for the purposes of Article 8. He also accepted that the regulations, inasmuch as they sought to strike a fair balance between the demands arising out of the raising of children and the running of the new household, were intended in a general sort of way to be a positive measure promoting family life. However, the link between them and respect for the applicant\u2019s family life was too tenuous to bring the situation within the ambit of the family life limb of Article 8. The link to respect for the applicant\u2019s private life was even more remote, in his view. As regards Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, he considered that the obligation to pay maintenance was very different to expropriation and therefore did not come within the ambit of this provision.",

It could therefore be said that this feature of the scheme was one of the modalities of the exercise of the right to respect for family life. This would be sufficient to bring the situation within the ambit of Article 8. He then considered the position of same-sex couples. In certain contexts, domestic case-law had established that a same-sex couple was as much capable of constituting a family as a heterosexual couple. In the context of Article 8 of the Convention, however, the concept of \u201cfamily life\u201d could only have one proper interpretation for all of the Contracting States. The Strasbourg case-law did not yet recognise that the guarantee of respect for family life applied to same-sex relationships and there was no good reason for the courts of the  to depart from that position. He rejected the argument that the situation came within the ambit of respect for private life. The statutory formulae set out to respect the new family life of an absent parent who had entered into a heterosexual relationship, and not the private life of each party to that relationship. The\u00a0statutory scheme was therefore not one of the modalities of the exercise of the guarantee of the right to respect for private life. The nature of the discrimination alleged was not sufficient to engage that provision; otherwise, every case of discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation would be within the ambit of Article 8. He further observed that the applicant had not pointed to any significant impact on her lifestyle. As\u00a0regards Article 1 of Protocol No.1, he found that the statutory scheme was far outside this provision\u2019s scope.

As the applicant\u2019s appeal related to a period shortly after that decision (13 August 2001-18 February 2002), her relationship with her partner could not be regarded as a type of family life within the meaning of Article 8. He added that he had little doubt that the Strasbourg Court would see the position in 2006 as having changed very considerably, and that if the issue were to arise before it again, the applicant\u2019s relationship could very well be regarded as involving family life for the purpose of Article 8. Great change had taken place across Europe in the intervening time, of which any court would take most careful account. There was no basis for criticising the  for delay either in reviewing the relevant laws or in moving to amend them in light of such review. Although from a moral viewpoint discrimination against same-sex couples had never been justified, it was the legal position that was at issue. Until quite recently neither the  nor the domestic courts would have viewed such relationships as involving family life. It followed that discrimination between these and heterosexual couples did not contravene Article 14 taken with Article 8. In relation to the applicant\u2019s private life, he observed that the regulations were not directed at her private life. Any link between them would be as tenuous in the extreme. Regarding Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, he considered it artificial to view child support payments as a deprivation of the absent parent\u2019s possessions. The mere fact that there was a net adverse financial impact for the applicant was insufficient. While the scheme was undoubtedly introduced in pursuit of a legitimate social policy, there was no element of expropriation about it. The\u00a0complaint did not fall within the ambit of Article 1, therefore Article 14 was not engaged.",

She found that the child support scheme, which was one aspect of the State\u2019s support for family life, clearly fell within the ambit of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her family life with her children. The scheme was the State\u2019s way of enforcing a parent\u2019s duty to support their children, which was an obligation in both private and public law. There were many ways that the operation of the scheme could impact upon that family life. It\u00a0did not have to have so severe an impact as to breach Article 8, but she considered it clear that the scheme fell within the reach of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for family life with her children. She observed that if, for example, the scheme treated absent mothers differently to absent fathers, this would be sufficient to engage Article 14. The lack of respect manifested by the scheme for the applicant\u2019s relationship did not have to reach such a level of severity as to constitute a breach of Article 8 for Article 14 to come into play. Although the Convention case-law had not yet recognised the relationship between two adult homosexuals as a form of family life within the meaning of Article 8, in this case the applicant and her partner enjoyed family life when their children were with them, and this did not cease when they were apart from them. She further considered that the situation also came within the ambit of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her private life. It was therefore unnecessary to inquire whether Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was engaged.",

It was now recognised that there was no objective justification. While it had been taken for granted that the protection of the institution of marriage could justify less favourable treatment of the unmarried, it still had to be shown that in order to achieve that aim it was necessary to exclude same-sex couples. This had not been shown. With the Civil Partnership Act, the  had moved ahead of many other European States, but this was not an objective justification for not doing so sooner. Racial and sex discrimination had always been wrong, long before this was recognised in law. In the area of gender, the historical and systematic character of discrimination against women could justify some continuing small adjustments in their favour in the benefits system. But this could not apply to sexual orientation \u2013 it would mean relying on historical disadvantage and exclusion to justify continued disadvantage and exclusion of the excluded group. It was to be welcomed that Parliament had legislated in this area, but that did not make right what had been done before. She concluded that the applicant had suffered discrimination in the enjoyment of the Convention right to respect for private and family life, and approved the remedy suggested by the Appeals Tribunal.",

Until 1 November 2008, the system was administered by the Child Support Agency (\u201cthe CSA\u201d), which was part of the Department for Work and Pensions. All the relevant duties, powers and discretions were thus conferred on the Secretary of State responsible for this government department. The calculation of a parent\u2019s child maintenance obligation is determined by Section 11 of and Schedule 1 to the 1991 Act, and by the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 SI 1992/1815 (the \u201cMASC regulations\u201d), which have been subject to frequent and extensive amendment.

The non-resident parent\u2019s liability depends primarily on his or her assessable income, which is net income less exempt income (para 5 of Schedule 1 to the 1991 Act). There are complex provisions for determining net income (Regulation 7 of and Schedules 1 and 2 to the Regulations) and exempt income, which includes an amount in respect of housing costs (Regulations 9, 14, 15, 16 and 18 of and Schedule 3 to the Regulations). The higher the exempt income the smaller the maintenance assessment will be in respect of any particular level of assessable income. There is also a further mechanism (described by the Child Support Commissioner as a kind of long stop) securing that the non-resident parent\u2019s disposable income does not fall below the level of his or her protected income (para 6 of Schedule 1 to the Act and Regulations 11 and 12 of the Regulations).",

Thus the true differential was GBP 25.18 and not the GBP 33 mentioned in the judgments of the domestic courts.",

The success of her appeal to the Appeals Tribunal meant that she and her partner were treated as an unmarried couple for the purpose of calculating housing costs. This however brought the applicant within the scope of Regulation 27 of the Departure Direction Regulations. Her former husband duly applied to the Secretary of State, on 27 March 2003, for a departure direction. In a decision of 25 April 2003, the Secretary of State took the view that it would be just and equitable to attribute 51% of the applicant\u2019s housing costs to her partner. The effect of this was to bring the applicant\u2019s maintenance assessment up to GBP 49.56, i.e. slightly higher than the original figure, with effect from 13 August 2001 (see \u00a7 6). Therefore, the difference in treatment of which the applicant complained had not ultimately made any material difference to her. The Government sought to amplify this point by providing four hypothetical examples showing that at different points in time between 2001 and 2003 the making of a departure direction would in each case negative the financial advantage of having a same-sex relationship recognised. This fact had been noted during the domestic proceedings, but the parties had agreed that it should be disregarded in order to enable the point of principle to be determined (speech of Lord Walker, at paragraph 46). In the Government\u2019s view, however, the significance of the departure direction was highly relevant in the context of Article 34 of the Convention.",

The applicant further argued that the notion of victim under Article 34 of the Convention was without reference to detriment, prejudice or damage. This was a matter for consideration under Article 41, in the event of the Court holding that there had been a violation of Convention rights. Even supposing that the material disadvantage in her case had ultimately been reduced \u2013 which she did not concede \u2013 she argued that the basis for her complaint was that the child support system offended her dignity by ignoring a most important and intimate aspect of her private life and personality.

France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III). The Court considers that during the period at issue the applicant was directly affected by the MASC regulations and therefore has victim status within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. Although the financial consequences of the alleged discrimination were neutralised by the subsequent departure direction, the applicant\u2019s complaint is essentially one of principle, i.e. that the State discriminated against her on the basis of her sexual orientation by failing to recognise the relationship she entered into after her divorce when setting the level of child maintenance she was required to pay. The importance of this issue of principle is amply demonstrated by the care with which it was examined by four levels of jurisdiction. Moreover, as Sedley LJ stated in his judgment, the departure direction is a palliative but not a cure. The Court would not be justified in rejecting the applicant\u2019s case on a ground that the superior domestic courts, with the agreement of the parties, chose to disregard. It therefore dismisses the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.",

If the equality guarantee of Article 14 was to be practical and effective, that difference should be real and significant. In view of the importance of equality as a fundamental principle of democracy, it was appropriate to give Article 14 an expansive meaning, and to construe \u201cambit\u201d broadly, as it was the cornerstone of the protective scope of the provision. States were required simply to justify differences in treatment as between classes of persons that were based on one or more of the protected grounds.

She refuted the Government\u2019s assumption that there had to be significant interference or impairment with a right in order to satisfy the ambit test.

Differential treatment of a person on this ground by a public authority, causing them prejudice, demonstrated a lack of respect for an important component of their private life. The MASC regulations demonstrated respect for the family life of the new household of the absent parent, as long as they had entered into a relationship with a person of the opposite sex. By excluding same-sex relations, the MASC regulations sent a clear message that these were less worthy of respect and dignity than heterosexual relations. This was a matter that fell within the ambit of private life. The\u00a0Petrovic judgment was relevant in this respect, since, as here, the point was not that the authorities had interfered with the applicant\u2019s family life, or had failed in a positive obligation, but that the means chosen by the public authorities to show respect for family and private life brought the case within the ambit of Article 8. The applicant drew attention to the fact that in that case the Court had not specified the amount of the parental leave allowance, nor had it stated how exactly the applicant\u2019s family life had been affected. Instead it had assumed that there had been some impact on the organisation of family life. In her case, there was both an exclusionary rule and actual evidence of disadvantage, which the House of Lords had put at about 33GBP per week, a non-negligible sum. Accordingly, if the situation in Petrovic attracted Article 14, it would be incorrect to reach the opposite conclusion in her case.",

She argued that by simple analogy differential treatment related to a person\u2019s sexual orientation will almost always engage Article 14 and require the State to provide clear and cogent justification. The centrality of sexual orientation to the concept of private life was not dependent on either the extent of any interference or the severity of the consequences of such interference. The approach taken by the majority of the House of Lords was therefore incorrect.

If, as established in the case-law of the Court, business relations came within the scope of Article 8, then it was beyond argument that the applicant\u2019s relationship with her partner did so too. It would be an unattractive conclusion if the Convention afforded heightened protection to an individual because of their sexual orientation but excluded from the very wide scope of the protection of Article 8 the relationship that was the natural consequence of that orientation. The treatment of the applicant disclosed a lack of respect for her right to develop and establish a relationship with her partner. It placed financial obstacles in the way of same-sex couples.

In its Mata Estevez decision, the Court had left the issue of whether same-sex relations constituted \u201cfamily life\u201d for States to determine within their margin of appreciation. Such relations did not necessarily fall within the scope of that concept, but they did not necessarily fall outside either. The material scope of Article 8 in this respect was therefore a matter of domestic law. The  courts had already and repeatedly affirmed that same-sex relationships could amount to family life, and so the House of Lords should not have relied on the Mata Estevez case to decline to recognise the applicant\u2019s relationship. Moreover, the margin of appreciation accorded to States in that case had been significantly narrowed by the Court\u2019s judgment in Karner v. Austria, no. 40016/98, ECHR 2003IX. That judgment had not been limited to the right to respect for one\u2019s home, but contained a general statement of principle in relation to equality as between persons of heterosexual and homosexual orientation in relation to Convention rights. This was affirmed by the judgment in E.B. v. France [GC], no. 43546/02, ECHR 2008..., in which the Court had not indicated whether it treated the situation as coming within the ambit of that applicant\u2019s private or family life; the applicant submitted that the circumstances in that case clearly related to both. Accordingly, Mata\u00a0Estevez could no longer be regarded as offering good guidance to the Court\u2019s approach either to the concept of family life, or to lesbian and gay equality more generally. In the applicant\u2019s view, this trend in the Court\u2019s recent case-law mirrored the trend that could be observed in the laws of many  and other States around the world. The international consensus in this area was now sufficiently clear to include same-sex relationships in the concept of family life in Article 8. The failure to take account of the income and expenses of the applicant\u2019s partner necessarily affected the way in which her family life with her partner was arranged or organised. It affected that family unit by reducing, in a discriminatory way, the disposable income available to it.",

In order for Article 14 to apply, it must be shown that the specific factual context in which the allegation of discrimination arises was within the ambit of one of the substantive rights of the Convention. The intended limited scope of Article 14 of the Convention stood in contrast to that of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a012, which the  had not ratified. If the criteria for the applicability of Article 14 were to be loosened and widened, it would occupy more and more of the area intended to be covered by the other provision. Instead, Article 14 should be kept within boundaries of application closely associated with and bearing directly upon the operation of other Convention rights. The Government contended that the approach taken by Lords Walker, Bingham and Nicholls to the applicability of Article\u00a014 was consistent with the  jurisprudence, and was now accepted by the domestic courts as providing a practical framework for determining when a given situation came within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention. While the applicant had likened her situation to that at issue in the case of Petrovic v. Austria (27 March 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998II), hers was quite different. In Petrovic, the Court had found that the parental leave allowance necessarily affected the way in which family life was organised, as it allowed one parent to stay at home to look after the children (\u00a7 27). In contrast, the application of the formula in the MASC regulations was not intended to deter the applicant from pursuing her relationship, nor did it have that effect. The mere fact that liability to contribute towards the cost of her children\u2019s upbringing might have some effect on the financial situation of her new household was insufficient. Otherwise any financial liability, or benefit, would be deemed as coming within the ambit of the family life aspect of Article 8. Since the Convention did not confer a right to full protection of private or family life against all interference, but a right to respect for private or family life, it followed that a significant threshold of intrusion had to be crossed before there could be an interference that called for justification under Article 8 \u00a7 2. The\u00a0Government drew a comparison with a number of cases in which applicants who had lost their employment had complained of interferences with their right to respect for private life: Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, ECHR 1999VI; Sidabras and D\u017eiautas v. , nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, ECHR 2004VIII; Rainys and Gasparavi\u010dius v. Lithuania, nos. 70665/01 and 74345/01, 7\u00a0April 2005. In each of these cases, the applicants had been able to point to additional restrictions or intrusions. This strongly suggested that the merely incidental effect of the MASC regulations on the finances of the applicant\u2019s household was not sufficient to bring the situation within the scope or ambit of Article 8. The facts of this case were very remote from any identifiable impact on the applicant\u2019s family life.",

The implication of these arguments would be that any difference in treatment referable in any way to sexual orientation would engage Article 14 even in the absence of a link to substantive Convention rights. The correct approach was to have regard to the real factual implications of the circumstances of each given case and take account of how remote the facts were from the core value of the substantive right at issue. Here there was no discernible impact on the applicant\u2019s private life. She was effectively inviting the Court to dispense with any ambit threshold and establish a free-standing prohibition on discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.",

The applicant could not claim a retrospective declaration from the Court relating to a period when there clearly was little consensus in Europe over the official recognition of same-sex relationships. Even assuming the contrary, the Government reiterated that the differential level of payment at issue in this case had no identifiable impact, let alone direct impact, on the applicant\u2019s relationship such as would be necessary to bring her case within the ambit of Article 8.

This would seriously undermine the role of Article 14 in eliminating otherwise unacceptable discrimination in Contracting States. If the protection afforded by Article 14 was to be practical and effective, then the gateway into that provision should be set broadly, requiring the State to justify the alleged discriminatory treatment. Otherwise, Article 14 would be deprived of much of its purpose. It referred to the Court\u2019s broad approach to the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the case of Stec and Others v. the  (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, ECHR 2005X. A narrow approach would have left the applicant in Gaygusuz v. Austria, 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV without redress. Taking a broad approach to ambit need not alter the ultimate result of the case, as the State might succeed in persuading the Court that the difference in treatment did not constitute discrimination. The purpose of Article 14 would be achieved in all such cases by the State being obliged to justify the situation and the Court\u2019s scrutiny of the reasons put forward.",

Similarly, in the E.B.\u00a0case the Court had found that while Article 8 was silent on adoption, the fact that French law recognised a right to apply for authorisation to adopt was sufficient to bring the situation within the general scope of private life. There should be no doubt that the MASC regulations, which aimed to ensure parental responsibility for the financial maintenance of children, formed one of the modalities of the exercise of respect for family life. The fact that it concerned the financial rather than the emotional aspect did not prevent it from having a direct impact on family life. For the purpose of the ambit question, it was irrelevant which family unit was considered; the critical point was the aim of the MASC regulations. By\u00a0focusing on the actual impact of these on the applicant, the approach of Lords Bingham and Walker was not in accordance with the relevant caselaw of the Court and inconsistent with the need to give practical and real effect to Article 14. Its only relevance was to the issue of justification. To include it in the question of ambit was to materially restrict the scope of Article 14.",

Given the Court\u2019s strong stance against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, it necessarily followed that the Court should accept in principle that a same-sex relationship is no less capable of constituting family life than a heterosexual relationship. Whether this was the case in practice would depend on the facts of the case, with the same relevant considerations applying to both types of relationship. Such an approach was necessary if the Convention was to be interpreted consistently. Although the Court had not accepted the point in the Mata Estevez case, in the Karner case it did extend the protection of Article 8 to a same-sex relationship, albeit under the \u201chome\u201d limb of that provision. To uphold the Mata Estevez decision would give rise to a wholly inconsistent and unprincipled distinction between housing provision and the most fundamental of human relationships, i.e. family life. Furthermore, in that decision the Court had noted that there was little common ground among the Contracting States at that point in time with respect to the recognition of homosexual relationships. Since then, however, there had been a clear and welldocumented movement across Europe towards such recognition.

The application of Article\u00a014 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention. It is necessary but it is also sufficient for the facts of the case to fall \u201cwithin the ambit\u201d of one or more of the Convention Articles (see among many other authorities Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, \u00a7 58, 29 April 2008).

Regarding the former, the Commission observed that the second sentence of that provisions was \u201cprimarily concerned with formal expropriation of assets for a public purpose, and not with the regulation of rights between persons under private law unless the State lays hands - or authorises a third party to lay hands - on a particular piece of property for a purpose which is to serve the public interest\u201d. It\u00a0therefore doubted that there had been a deprivation of property. However, in light of the State\u2019s active role in the process, and the fact that Mr\u00a0Burrows\u2019 former wife was required to seek child support from him or lose her entitlement to social security benefits, it assumed that there had been an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. In that regard, the Commission observed that the legislation in question was a practical expression of a policy relating to the economic responsibilities of parents who did not have custody of their children and compelled an absent parent to pay money to the parent with such custody. It\u00a0was an example of legislation governing private law relations between individuals, which determined the effects of these relations with respect to property and in some cases, compelled a person to surrender a possession to another. The Commission went on to declare inadmissible the complaint of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 read on its own, on the grounds that the interference with the applicant\u2019s possessions was not disproportionate to the legitimate aim served.",

The\u00a0Government had not been able to point to any legitimate aim served by the different treatment of same-sex couples. The reasoning of the majority in the House of Lords did not constitute an objective justification for the purposes of the Convention. The fact that it took much time and effort to draft, discuss and implement the Civil Partnership Act could not justify the previous discriminatory situation. The applicant also criticised the Government\u2019s reliance on the Mata Estevez decision. In her view, this had been superseded by the Court\u2019s judgment in Karner, which should be treated as a statement of general principle applicable to any comparisons between heterosexual and homosexual couples in analogous circumstances. Moreover, as that case arose out of a judgment of the Austrian Supreme Court of 1996, and since the Court did not attach any temporal limitation to the effects of its reasoning, it followed that equal treatment should have been secured as of that date. The applicant rejected the Government\u2019s argument that she could not complain of just one element of the child support system. Such an argument was repugnant to any modern equality law paradigm. The mere fact that, at the relevant time, the situation of heterosexual couples was subject to different principles did not explain why no comparison between the two groups was possible. Rather, the difference existed because of discrimination, and so could not be relied upon by the Government to defeat the applicant\u2019s claim.",

In the first place, it argued that the situation of same-sex couples at the material time had not been analogous to that of heterosexual couples since the child support legislation and the wider legislative regime for social security benefits treated the groups according to fundamentally different principles for all purposes. This entailed both beneficial and detrimental effects for the two groups. It was therefore artificial and inappropriate for the applicant to isolate just one element of a much wider interlocking set of rules governing entitlement to a variety of State benefits. In many respects, the situation before the entry into force of the Civil Partnership Act had been advantageous for same-sex couples. To properly assess the applicant\u2019s situation, it would be necessary to take account of the entirety of the benefits and burdens in the system as a whole. But as soon as the wider perspective was adopted, the applicant could no longer be regarded as being in a comparable or analogous situation for the purpose of analysis under Article 14. If the applicant\u2019s arguments were to be accepted, it would follow that heterosexual couples would be able in turn to complain of any provision of the child support and State welfare system that treated them less favourably than the members of a same-sex couple. This would create a \u201cratchet effect\u201d whereby in the end everyone would have to be assessed on the best possible basis that anyone might have at any stage in the calculation. This would lead to a situation where everyone would receive every available benefit, and any burden would be disregarded altogether.",

Furthermore, there was at the relevant time, as the Court had said in the Mata Estevez case, a wide margin of appreciation for States regarding whether and how to afford formal recognition of same-sex relationships. There had been a progression in attitudes to same-sex couples in recent years in society and in European and domestic law. As had been acknowledged in the House of Lords, though, the whole issue of the recognition of same-sex relationships called for a wider consideration of how the disparate legal regimes should be amended. This culminated in the Civil Partnership Act, which introduced comprehensive and thoroughgoing reform, addressing the myriad of issues raised by the decision to recognise same-sex relationships in the . In the Government\u2019s view, this initiative had not been required by the Convention. While there was gathering momentum across Europe on this issue, it was still within the margin of appreciation of States when the  introduced the relevant reforms. Even though it was not the first  to do so, it could not be said that it had lagged behind other Contracting States. It\u00a0remained the case that most of these either provided a less comprehensive set of rights to same-sex couples, or did not recognise them at all. The scale of the change provided justification for the transitional period of one year between the adoption of the Act and its entry into force, during which time the necessary practical arrangements were made. There was a strong public interest in an orderly transition in relation to complex legal and administrative regimes. The Government concluded that the House of Lords had correctly held that the operation of the detailed child support rules prior to the coming into force of the Civil Partnership Act was objectively justified, and that the difference in treatment of which the applicant complained was within the United Kingdom\u2019s margin of appreciation.",

Such a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it lacks reasonable and objective justification, that is to say it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. There is a margin of appreciation for States in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment, and this margin is usually wide when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy (see most recently Carson and Others v. the  [GC], no. 42184/05, \u00a7\u00a061, 16 March 2010). However, where the complaint is one of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, the margin of appreciation of Contracting States is narrow (Karner, \u00a7 41, Kozak v. Poland, no.\u00a013102/02, \u00a7 92, 2 March 2010). The State must be able to point to particularly convincing and weighty reasons to justify such a difference in treatment (E.B., \u00a7\u00a091).",
