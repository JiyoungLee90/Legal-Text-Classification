Austria, op. cit., \u00a7 43; Pobornikoff v. Austria, no. 28501/95, \u00a7 32, 3.10.2000). This is in particular the case where the examination of the appeal not only involves an assessment of the accused\u2019s character and state of mind at the time of the offence but also of his motive for the offence and evaluations of this kind were to play a significant role for the outcome of these proceedings (Kremzow judgment, op. cit., \u00a7 67).",

The points raised by the applicant in his appeal could have been dealt with adequately by the Court of Appeal on the basis of the submissions made by the applicant\u2019s lawyer at the hearing and the case file before that court. The state of intoxication of the applicant at the time when he had committed the offence had been the object of an expert\u2019s report dealing with the effects of alcohol and medicines and it cannot be seen how the applicant\u2019s personal presence in addition to that of his lawyer would be necessary in duly considering this element. As regards the applicant\u2019s further argument \u2013 his neglected education and difficult childhood \u2013 the Court finds that this is essentially historical information and it cannot be seen how the applicant\u2019s presence would be of use. There is nothing to show that in the proceedings at issue the Court of Appeal had to evaluate the applicant\u2019s personality, his character, his motives for committing the offence, or his dangerousness. The Court therefore finds that Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) has been respected in the proceedings before the Vienna Court of Appeal.",
