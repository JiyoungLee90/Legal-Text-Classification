The evoking of historical events in which the Bulgarian people fought for the protection of its national interests [and] for the restoration of the Bulgarian State is puzzling in the context of an activity which is to be carried out against this same State. It is not clear how an association may be a \u2018successor\u2019 of \u2018fighters fallen victim\u2019 but probably the applicants wanted to underscore that they intend to lead a \u2018national liberation struggle\u2019 on the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria through uprisings, which process is expected to lead to victims. Read this way, clause 1 of the articles raises serious doubts as to the peaceful means for the achievement of the goals of the association declared in clause 7. Clause 2(1) of the articles recognises the territorial integrity of the country, its laws and Constitution, but under a condition: \u2018if they are consistent with the international law and the international agreements on human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rights of minorities\u2019. The reservations relating to respect for the territorial integrity of the country continue in clause 2(2) of the articles, which introduces the concept of modification of the borders through \u2018negotiations\u2019. The association\u2019s goal \u2013 to achieve a modification of the borders of Bulgaria through taking of territory away \u2013 is clearly spelled out in clause 3 of the articles, which indicates that [Ilinden] \u2018expresses and defends the civil, political, national and social and economic rights of Macedonians living on Macedonian land under Bulgarian occupation (jurisdiction) and of the Macedonians living in Bulgaria\u2019. The use of the term \u2018occupation\u2019 indicates that, according to the applicants, the  includes forcibly annexed \u2018Macedonian\u2019 lands, for the liberation of which they will lead a \u2018national liberation struggle\u2019. This idea is underscored in several other provisions of the articles. Thus, clause 4 speaks of protection against Bulgarian \u2018assimilation\u2019 through cultural autonomy of Pirin , which takes as a given that the population there is not Bulgarian, clause 5 [speaks of] \u2018taking the Macedonians out\u2019 of the state of [being subjected to] \u2018discrimination and assimilation\u2019 by the .",

That citizens should be able to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned. Certainly States have a right to satisfy themselves that an association\u2019s aim and activities are in conformity with the rules laid down in legislation, but they must do so in a manner compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions (see Sidiropoulos and Others, cited above, pp. 161415, \u00a7 40).",

For pluralism is also built on the genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs, artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others, cited above, \u00a7 92).",

On the other hand, Article 43 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution of 1991 and section 2 of the Meetings and Marches Act of 1990 expressly provide that anyone, including associations, may organise meetings, marches and assemblies (see paragraphs 25 and 28 above).",

Expressing separatist views and demanding territorial changes in speeches, demonstrations, or program documents does not amount per se to a threat to a country\u2019s territorial integrity and national security (see, mutatis mutandis, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, \u00a7 97; Freedom and Democracy Party (\u00d6ZDEP) v.

It is true that the style of Ilinden\u2019s articles was virulent and the criticism of the Bulgarian authorities\u2019 actions was acerbic, as demonstrated by, inter alia, the use of the words \u201cState terrorism\u201d and \u201cgenocide\u201d (see paragraph 15 above).

Austria, judgment of 19 December 1989, Series A no. 169, p.\u00a024, \u00a7 41; and Kokkinakis v. Greece, judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260A, p. 18, \u00a7 35). The case concerns, as pointed out in paragraph 30 of the judgment, solely the refusal to register Ilinden in 199899, not the earlier refusal to do so in 199091, or the subsequent one in 200204. The Court is likewise not called upon to rule in the present proceedings on the various interactions between Ilinden and the authorities throughout the years (see paragraph 31 of the judgment). The narrow issue before the Court today is thus not whether the interferences with the freedoms of assembly and association of Ilinden and its members and supporters are in principle acceptable, but whether the refusal to register the association in 199899 was justified, regard being had to the motivation of the national courts. Therefore, the fact that the interferences with the applicant association\u2019s Article 11 rights have been considered problematic in other instances should not prejudge the outcome of this case.",

Indeed, Ilinden\u2019s articles of association astound with the harshness of the language used (see paragraph 15 of the judgment). Bearing in mind that the national authorities \u2013 in the case at hand, the first-instance court \u2013 are better placed to make such specific assessments of fact, their holding that the wording of the articles of the association was suggestive of a risk of violence does not appear unreasonable. In this connection, account should be taken of the fact that Ilinden\u2019s members and supporters had on a number of previous (and, for that matter, subsequent) occasions had clashes with opponents. These incidents were to a considerable extent caused by the provocativeness of the organisation\u2019s separatist statements and threats against the country\u2019s territorial integrity. Conversely, the lack of any identification of a risk of violence was one of the main reasons why in a recent case it was concluded that the dissolution of a political party had been in breach of Article 11 (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and Others, cited above, \u00a7 60). Due weight should also be given to the local sensitivities which exist in the Pirin region and the resulting need for heightened vigilance of the authorities.",
