The burden of proof is on the respondent Government, who could, however, rebut that presumption by demonstrating that there were factors capable of adequately compensating for the scarce allocation of personal space. The strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 will normally be capable of being rebutted only if the following factors are cumulatively met: (1) the reductions in the required minimum personal space of 3 sq. m are short, occasional and minor; (2) such reductions are accompanied by sufficient freedom of movement outside the cell and adequate out-of-cell activities; and (3) the applicant is confined in what is, when viewed generally, an appropriate detention facility, and there are no other aggravating aspects of the conditions of his or her detention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 137-38).",

The Court notes at the outset that although the Government contested the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning the conditions of his detention at that facility, they failed to submit any evidence in support of their submissions or provide any details regarding the particular conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention. As regards the two reports referred to by the Government, the Court notes that neither of them examined specifically the conditions of detention at Nubarashen Remand Prison. The only comment in that respect found in the CPT\u2019s report suggested that some detainees may have experienced a lack of outdoor activities (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). At the same time, the Court cannot overlook the CPT\u2019s findings concerning the overall conditions of detention at Nubarashen Remand Prison following its periodic visit in 2015, which were found to have remained the same since the CPT\u2019s periodic visit in 2010 and raised numerous problems (see paragraph 41 above). The Court is mindful of the fact that both periodic visits took place after the circumstances of the present case. However, there is nothing to suggest that the conditions of detention at that facility were significantly different during the period when the applicant was detained there, namely in 2008. In such circumstances, the Court has no reason to doubt the applicant\u2019s allegations and will proceed with its examination on the basis of them.",

In any event, it is evident that the personal space available to him must have been at worst 2.5 sq. m and at best 3.57 sq. m. Even assuming that it was the latter, it would still have been below 4 sq. m and therefore amounts to a weighty factor in the Court\u2019s assessment. It is true that the applicant\u2019s stay in cell no. 9 was rather short and amounted to only one day. However, having regard to other aspects of the physical conditions of detention in the cell, including the alleged lack of natural light and fresh air, and the unsanitary situation in the cell, the Court is of the opinion that cumulatively the conditions in cell no. 9 reached the threshold required for a finding of a violation of Article 3.",

It is true that the applicant failed to specify the frequency and duration of such periods. However, the Court takes note of the applicant\u2019s allegation about the lack of an individual sleeping place during that period, which \u2013 in addition to being a problem in itself \u2013 also suggests that, given the number of beds, there were at least nine inmates in the cell at any given time, leaving the applicant with no more than about 2.77 sq. m of personal space.

It does not consider, however, that in the present case the decision in question was sufficiently reasoned. In particular, firstly, it is not clear on what grounds the Court of Appeal concluded that the applicant had deliberately misled the investigating authority about his identity and that his real identity had been discovered only on 3 March 2008, when the record of the applicant\u2019s arrest drawn up on 2 March 2008 contained both his official name and the name by which, as the applicant alleged, he always introduced himself. No explanation was provided as to this fact, including the discrepancy between the information contained in the record of the applicant\u2019s arrest and the note drawn up by the investigator on 3 March 2008. Furthermore, the Court notes that neither the investigator nor the trial court relied on that fact when substantiating the need to keep the applicant in detention (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above). The Court of Appeal took its decision on the basis of the appeal lodged by the applicant, who argued that the trial court had provided no reasons for his detention (see paragraph 15 above). The Court of Appeal failed to address any of the arguments raised by the applicant and instead reasoned the need to keep him in detention by stating that he had provided false information about his identity. There is nothing to suggest that that ground for detention was the subject of examination before the Court of Appeal and it appears that the court reached the relevant finding on the basis of the case file. By doing so, the Court of Appeal denied the applicant the possibility of objecting to that ground for detention, including by submitting the arguments which he raised before this Court. Thus, having regard to the overall circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case and the reasons provided, the Court considers that the domestic courts failed to provide relevant and sufficient reasons for their decisions to impose and extend the applicant\u2019s detention.",
