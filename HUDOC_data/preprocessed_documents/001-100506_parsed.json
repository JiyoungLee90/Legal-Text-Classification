From a combination of video recordings and mobile telephone records for M.H.'s telephone, the Crown contended that the applicant could be seen making certain calls.

Officer M was a member of the investigating team of police officers which had conducted the inquiry into the applicant's case.

Such directions are conventionally given by judges at the outset of the trial. They will have been foreshadowed before that by the instruction given to jurors on attending court. They are always repeated at later stages of the trial and they are invariably endorsed at time of separation, if that necessity arises. Quite apart from that, some jurors need transport for various reasons; sometimes, but not always, of security. Drivers who are not operating under a bailiff's oath, hotel staff where appropriate, and many others have dealings with jurors who are in retirement. Once again, the system proceeds on the basis that the jurors treat their task conscientiously and can be trusted to obey the oath that they have taken and not to allow any possibility of extraneous influence to compromise the integrity of their discussions as a group of 12. The experience of trial judges up and down the country demonstrates that in all but a tiny handful of cases that trust is well placed.

If, therefore, there were in this case an unacceptable risk of compromise to the integrity of the jury's discussions, the modern practice as to the separation of juries during retirement would not necessarily save it. What the modern practice does, however, is to demonstrate the recognition of the fact that the safeguard of the integrity of the jury system lies in the respect that jurors have for the serious oath that they have taken, reinforced by the directions and warnings that they are given by trial judges, rather than in requiring formal rules attempting to insulate them from contact with the outside world.\u201d",

The\u00a0breadth of close circuit television coverage in places public and private is nowadays so extensive that juries are more and more presented with evidence of this kind. They also have recorded evidence very often in cases of recorded surveillance. There are other examples, of course, as well. It seems to us that it should be regarded as the plain duty of any party, Crown or defence, which is proposing to rely on such recorded evidence to ensure that there is provided equipment not only to play the recording in court, but also such as the jury can use in its retiring room during its retirement. They must, we are quite satisfied, as jurors be entitled to review precisely the same material as has been put in evidence in court. The judge in this case, we are satisfied, was absolutely right not to permit them to be given a substitute poorer quality VHS recording. If the necessary equipment can be provided in any particular court by agreement as to compatibility of machinery between parties and the court, then so much the better. The ultimate responsibility, however, for the presentation of evidence lies not with the court, but with the parties seeking to adduce it. It is not desirable that equipment should be provided which can only be used in open court, because although it may turn out to be possible to proceed as was done here on the second day of viewing, that will often not be possible, and in many courts the courtroom will by then be in use in the next trial. If in the last resort it really is the case that the recorded material simply is incapable of being played on any machinery which the jury can take into the retiring room -- and we take leave to doubt that that will ever be so with a little forethought -- then we think that the normal course should be followed and in that exceptional case any replaying for the jury during retirement ought to take place in open court.\u201d",

Accordingly, the investigating officers associated with family members outside the court room and as the jury were brought from their refreshment area in the building they would be unable to avoid noticing the association. The true position was that the jury were well aware that Officer M was a member of a dedicated investigation team which was tasked with investigating the offence which formed the subject of the charge against the applicant. The applicant argued that it was a matter of chance which officer actually presented evidence to the jury, all members of the team being actively involved in the detection work and the presentation of the case for the prosecution. The applicant therefore disputed that Officer M's significance to the prosecution was minimal. He insisted that the officer was an integral part of the prosecution team, noting the findings of the Court of Appeal as to the fact that he was a member of the team which had assembled the evidence against the applicant, taken the statements and no doubt planned the investigation (see paragraph 27 above).",

In the applicant's contention, this was a clear statement of the judge's view that he was not going to alter the course of the trial as he was of the view that the procedure he had conceived was appropriate.

The same holds true in respect of jurors (see Sander v. the , no. 34129/96, \u00a7 25, ECHR 2000V). In the present case, it was not disputed that there was no evidence of actual or subjective bias on the part of one or more jurors. The Court further observes that the Court of Appeal found that in the circumstances of the present case, any further inquiry of the jurors as to what had happened while they viewed the CCTV footage in the presence of Officer M would not be proper (see paragraph 28 above). The Court has previously acknowledged that the rule governing the secrecy of jury deliberations is a crucial and legitimate feature of English trial law which serves to reinforce the jury's role as the ultimate arbiter of fact and to guarantee open and frank deliberations among jurors on the evidence which they have heard (see Gregory, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044; and Miah v. the United Kingdom, no. 37401/97, Commission decision of 1 July 1998, unreported).",

It follows therefore that the Court must examine whether in the circumstances there were sufficient guarantees to exclude any objectively justified or legitimate doubts as to the impartiality of the jury bearing in mind that the misgivings of the accused, although important, cannot be decisive for its determination (see Kleyn and Others v.\u00a0the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98, 39651/98, 43147/98 and 46664/99, \u00a7\u00a0194, ECHR 2003VI; Gregory, cited above, \u00a7 45; and Sander, cited above, \u00a7 27).",

In light of this finding, it is not necessary for the Court to consider the question of post-retirement contact with a non-jury member who was not associated with the prosecution.

The judge further instructed the jury that other than discussing among themselves what they wished to see, any discussion of the case was to take place in the jury room (see paragraph 15 above). The Court considers that the effect of the direction was to leave the jury in no doubt as to the purely technical role of Officer M and the impropriety of engaging in any discussion with him, other than to indicate what parts of the footage to play. There was nothing in the circumstances of the case to suggest that the jury could not be relied upon to follow the judge's instructions and the trial judge was therefore entitled to assume that the jury would follow the directions he had given.",

While no inquiries could be made into whether inappropriate communication had occurred, it is clear from Lord\u00a0Carswell's opinion in R v. Smith, R v.

The same consideration applies to judges and lay judges alike. The relevance of this is therefore questionable since, regardless of whether a judge or a juror is concerned, direct contact with a witness for the prosecution behind locked doors in the absence of the defence must always be considered irregular and improper.",

Fourthly, I emphasise that when assessing whether the applicant's fear of possible bias on the part of the jurors is justified, the nature of the role of the jury as the triers of facts must be borne in mind. In other words the jurors are \u201cjudges\u201d of the facts of the case. The jury, as with a judge, is obliged to reach an independent judgment on the evidence. The essential idea is that the jury is impartial and arrives at its verdict on the basis of an independent consideration of the evidence which has been given in court. It\u00a0would certainly give rise to justified fears of impartiality if a judge in a criminal case, after the evidence was heard, relied on the technical assistance of a member of the police investigation team as well as a witness for the prosecution to help him to review the main evidence in the case in the absence of the defence team.",

He was also a witness for the prosecution. While his role may have been primarily technical and his statements uncontroversial, the fact remains that he was a part of the prosecution and actively participated in the investigation and presentation of the case. For this reason alone a fair minded and objective observer would be justified in fearing that there was a real risk that the jury lacked impartiality.",

He was, in the absence of the trial judge and counsel for the defence, entrusted with the task of assisting the jurors in reviewing one of the most important pieces of evidence. Furthermore, the relevance of the communication that took place is not insignificant. In that context it should be pointed out that the mere identification of the parts of the video footage in which the jurors were interested is in itself a form of communication which potentially was capable of revealing the jurors' thoughts on the evidence and their deliberations as they identified those parts of the evidence in which they were particularly interested. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that the very presence of officer M in the \u201cjury room\u201d may unwittingly have inhibited or influenced the jurors. Thus, I find that M's role was not as insignificant as implied by the majority and that this situation certainly gives rise, from an objective point of view, to justified fears that the jury may have come under an improper and extraneous influence.",

The Court of Appeal found that there was no doubt\u00a0that all concerned consented to the\u00a0presence of\u00a0officer M. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal clearly stated that the proposed course of action ought not to be followed in the future \u201cwith or without the consent of the parties\u201d. \u00a0This is not surprising since nobody can waive his right to a fair trial. It is this Court's function to ensure that the domestic courts comply with the State's Convention obligations under Article 6 which establishes the unqualified fundamental right of every person to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal.",
