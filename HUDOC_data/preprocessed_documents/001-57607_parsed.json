On this point the Court found that the proceedings before a magistrate in regard to vagrants prescribed by Belgian law did not by themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) and that a remedy before a court should therefore have been open to the applicants by which the lawfulness of their detention might be determined (paragraphs 74-80 of the reasoning).

In the present cases, the Court rightly remarked that it was not necessary to refrain from taking a decision until the applicants had applied for compensation to a Belgian court (see paragraph 20 in fine of the judgment). However, the relevant part of the judgment does not state whether the Court drew this conclusion merely from the twofold fact that in the three cases before it restitutio in integrum was impossible (paragraph 20) and that no pecuniary loss or moral damage could be found (paragraph 24) or whether it considered generally that Article 50 (art. 50), in referring to the internal law of the State in question, covers only the cases in which restitutio in integrum is possible and those where it is excluded by the very nature of the violation.

This duty is therefore not limited to putting an end to the violation: it also extends to making good the damage suffered by the applicants. Although the duty to make good the damage resulting from an injury which has been established by the decision of an international court derives from general international law, it was necessary to confer expressly upon the Court, by a clause in the European Convention on Human Rights, jurisdiction to grant satisfaction to the person injured. Since the applicant is not party to the proceedings before the Court, the object of those proceedings, strictly speaking, is not the damage suffered by him but the violation of the Convention alleged against the respondent State.

The Court\u2019s jurisdiction extends to every kind of damage caused by the violation. This conclusion is based both on the very wording of Article 50 (art. 50), which is broader than that of the corresponding clauses in the above-mentioned treaties and on the special nature of the Convention, which is designed to ensure the protection of the individual (see, mutatis mutandis, the Wemhoff judgment of 27 June 1968, p. 23).",
