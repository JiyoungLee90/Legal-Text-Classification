Nevertheless, the courts had examined the question when considering the lawfulness of the model and they had assessed the respective roles of the officer, the co-defendant and applicant. In its decision of 14 October 2003, the Supreme Court had made a thorough assessment of the applicant's arguments.

Moreover, only part of the Criminal Conduct Simulation Model was withheld from the defence, pursuant to the Law on State and Service Secrets, namely the operational information about M.'s prior involvement in drug dealing and the written request by the police to the Prosecutor General for its authorisation.

Nevertheless, during the execution of the\u00a0model, the police officers uncovered the persons committing crimes, including the applicant \n(see paragraphs 20 and 22 above).\u00a0Even if the undercover agent V. had no direct contacts with the applicant,\u00a0it was foreseeable for the police that in the execution of the model M.\u00a0was likely to contact other people to participate in the crime\u00a0because of the\u00a0associational nature of\u00a0drug-related crimes.\u00a0Moreover, the applicant\u00a0and M. were considered by the national courts as accomplices in the same crime,\u00a0in which they acted with the same goal and for\u00a0which\u00a0both were convicted\u00a0in the same criminal proceedings using the evidence\u00a0obtained in execution of the\u00a0model. The significant sum of money offered by V. to the applicant's accomplice M. then represented an inducement to produce narcotics also in respect of the applicant, as the subsequent activities of the applicant and his accomplice M. were in part determined by the conduct of the police officer. The first instance court recognised the decisive role played\u00a0by the police in respect of both\u00a0of the accomplices\u00a0in\u00a0inciting the commission of the crime (see paragraph 16 above).\u00a0In the Court's view,\u00a0these elements extended the role of the police beyond that of undercover agents to that of \"agents provocateurs\". They did not merely \"join\" an on-going\u00a0offence; in the circumstances\u00a0of the present case, they instigated it also in respect of the applicant (see Malininas, \u00a7 37). Furthermore, the Court notes that\u00a0the domestic courts when convicting the applicant and his accomplice M. did not make any distinction as regards the fact\u00a0that the model was authorised only in respect of M.",

The Government contended that M. had a previous criminal record, but the documents submitted by the parties show that there were no clear indications about his prior involvement in drug dealing \n(see paragraph 38 above). No testimony was presented at the trial to show the co-defendants' prior involvement in this illegal trade. Moreover, the officers had no data about the applicant's involvement in drug dealing or about his prior knowledge of M.'s illegal activity before the moment the police officers initiated their operation. In particular, it appears that the criminal conduct simulation model available to the trial court was not fully disclosed to the applicant, particularly regarding suspicions about the \nco-defendants' previous conduct (paragraphs 13, 22 and 32 above). This relevant evidence was thus not put openly before the trial court or tested in an adversarial manner. It follows that the applicant's plea of incitement was not adequately addressed by the domestic courts.",

Among such factors is the demonstrated familiarity of a person with the drug market; such as knowledge of prices of different drugs, as well as an ability to obtain drugs at short notice (See Bannikova v. , no. 18757/06, \u00a7 42, 4 November 2010, and Shannon v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 67537/01, ECHR\u00a02004-IV). A strong indication of Mr\u00a0Malininas' primary involvement in drug dealings was his apparent familiarity with the drug market, when approached by the police agent, as he was already well informed about prices of psychotropic drugs, as well as about possible suppliers of such drugs, in particular Mr Lalas, the applicant in the case at hand.

It is hardly conceivable that someone, to whom the world of drug trade was unknown before, would be able push through a deal of this magnitude so quickly. This is enough to show that the applicant was clearly predisposed to commit a drug offence before the Model was implemented against Mr\u00a0Malininas.",

It is furthermore not disputed that the undercover police agents never at any time contacted the applicant directly, but they only had contact with Mr\u00a0Malininas. Under these circumstances it is of less relevance whether the applicant himself was predisposed to commit drug offences before the police officers approached Mr Malininas. The stark reality is that the applicant, without any direct incitement or pressure from the police agent, agreed to supply Mr Malininas, who was just another private individual, with large quantities of illegal drugs.",
