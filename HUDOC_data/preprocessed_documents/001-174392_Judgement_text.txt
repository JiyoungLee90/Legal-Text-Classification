The case originated in four applications (nos. 11736/09, 592/11, 47028/11 and 49731/11) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Turkish nationals, whose details are set out in the appendix.
The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
The applications were communicated to the Government.
Following their respective marriages, the applicants had to take their husbands’ surnames pursuant to the Civil Code. On various dates, they initiated proceedings before the first instance courts seeking permission to use only their maiden names. Their requests were rejected on the ground that according to Article 187 of the Civil Code, married women had to bear their husbands’ name throughout their marriage and were not permitted to use their maiden name alone. The details of the applications appear in the attached table.
“Everyone has the right to life and to protect and develop his/her physical and spiritual existence.”
“Married women shall bear their husband’s name. However, they can make a written declaration to the Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths on signing the marriage deed or at the Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths after the marriage, if they wish to keep their maiden name in front of their surname ...”
Following the enactment of Article 187 of the Civil Code, three Family Courts raised an objection with the Constitutional Court, arguing that the provision was unconstitutional. In a decision of 10 March 2011 (E. 2009/85, K. 2011/49), the Constitutional Court dismissed the objection.
On 19 December 2013, 6 March 2014 and 16 April 2015 respectively; the Constitutional Court delivered three decisions on three individual applications which concerned the inability of the applicants to bear solely their maiden name following their marriage (Applications nos. 2013/2187, 2013/4439 and 2014/5836). Referring to the Court’s judgments in the cases of Ünal Tekeli v. Turkey (no. 29865/96, ECHR 2004X (extracts)), Leventoğlu Abdulkadiroğlu v. Turkey (no. 7971/07, 28 May 2013), Tuncer Güneş v. Turkey (no. 26268/08, 3 September 2013) and Tanbay Tüten v. Turkey (no. 38249/09, 10 December 2013), the Constitutional Court held that Article 187 of the Civil Code was in contradiction with the Convention. Recalling that pursuant to Article 90 of the Constitution, international treaties that were duly in force were legally binding and that in case of a conflict between the domestic law and the Convention and its Protocols, the latter should take precedence over domestic law, the Constitutional Court held that the fact that a married woman could not solely bear her maiden name constituted a breach of Article 17 of the Constitution.
Based on the decisions of the Constitutional Court, on 30 October 2015 the Joint Civil Chambers of the Court of Cassation revised its case-law and concluded that a married woman could solely bear her maiden name.
Article 187 of the Civil Code still remains in force.
