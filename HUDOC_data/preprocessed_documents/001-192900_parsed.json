Thus, [the applicant\u2019s] detention from 19 February to 29 April 2004 had been lawful ... The court was correct to dismiss the argument that, receiving no extension decision, the head of the remand centre should have released [the applicant] after 19\u00a0February 2004 ... Article 255 \u00a7 2 of the CCrP provides that the detention pending trial should not exceed six months, except for situations listed in paragraph 3 ... Thereafter, the relevant court can extend detention in cases relating to serious and particularly serious offences ... Thus, given that the criminal case was submitted for trial before the Syktyvkar Town Court and taking note of the decision of 21 April 2004 (in the part relating to the dismissal of the application for release), this decision should be de facto considered as a decision to extend [the applicant\u2019s] detention within the time-limits mentioned in Article 255 of the CCrP ...\u201d",

Namely, he had asked, to no avail, the criminal court in his case to issue a special ruling (\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) under Article 226 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Later on, in 2012, he had lodged a complaint with the prosecutor\u2019s office and had then challenged its decision on judicial review (see paragraph 38 above). Lastly, he had brought civil proceedings against the remand centre on account of its allegedly unlawful failure to release him and on account of the non-pecuniary damage caused by that failure to release him (see paragraph 39 above). This course of action had had a reasonable prospect of success since under the Custody Act the head of the remand centre had had a clear obligation to release him, not having been served with any court decision authorising or extending the applicant\u2019s detention on remand. The applicant had obtained a decision on the merits of this claim.",

Portugal [GC], no. 56080/13, \u00a7\u00a7 130-32, 19 December 2017). It follows that if an applicant has recourse to a remedy which is doomed to fail from the outset, the decision on that appeal cannot be taken into account for the calculation of the six-month period (ibid; see also Jeronovi\u010ds v.\u00a0Latvia [GC], no. 44898/10, \u00a7 75, 5 July 2016). However, for example, the six-month timelimit can be considered as dating from the decision resulting from the use of an extraordinary remedy (because it was not directly accessible, for instance) where, as a matter of fact, the relevant court did accept the case for examination and had the opportunity to set aside the impugned judgment, if necessary, and to remit the case to the lower court, and therefore to remedy the situation complained of by the applicant (see \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a022479/93, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, ECHR 1999VI; see also Raichinov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a047579/99, 1 February 2005).",

There has been no suggestion, and there is no indication, that the proceedings had no prospects of success or could not afford redress. Thus, in the particular circumstances of the case they should be taken account as regards the applicants\u2019 compliance with the six-month rule under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

On 18 February 2004 the prosecuting authorities completed their pre-trial investigation and submitted the case for trial. It was then only on 10 March 2004 that the Town Court took a fresh decision extending the applicant\u2019s detention. Subsequently, his claim for compensation on account of the lack of any valid judicial decision for the period from 20 February to 10 March 2004 was dismissed. The courts considered that during that period the case against the first applicant had been pending before the trial court and that his continued detention had thus been lawful. As to Mr Leonov\u2019s complaint about his detention from 20 February until 29 April 2004, the Court notes that following expiry of a detention order on 19 February 2004, it does not follow from the available material that his detention was lawfully extended until at least 21 April 2004 when the Ukhtinskiy Town Court of the Komi Republic authorised his detention pending investigation.

There is nothing to indicate that the impugned part of the publication (in which the applicant was presented as a \u201cmember of a gang\u201d) constituted a verbatim reproduction of (or an otherwise direct quotation from) any part of that official information. In other words, even accepting that the impugned wording might give the impression of an affirmative statement in relation to the applicant\u2019s guilt in respect of the charge of membership of a criminal community, the available material does not confirm that it is the State that should be held responsible under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 2 on this account.

The Court observes that this line of argument was not part of the applicant\u2019s defamation case against the newspaper, as raised under Articles\u00a0152 and 152.1 of the Civil Code and as finally determined in December 2011. It has not been submitted that Russian law afforded the applicant any particular remedy in this context or that he used it. The Court has no reason to consider that the raising of this matter during a criminal trial and during an appeal against conviction was a relevant or effective remedy in this context. The present complaint was raised in May 2012, while the event complained of occurred on 18 January 2008. Accordingly, the above proceedings thus being irrelevant in the present case for the purpose of the six-month rule, the this complaint has been introduced out of time and must be rejected, in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and\u00a04 of the Convention.",

In cases of the type being examined here, what is at issue is not an act by the State but the alleged inadequacy of the protection afforded by the domestic courts to the applicants\u2019 private life. While the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private or family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even within the sphere of relations of individuals between themselves (see Von\u00a0Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2012). That also applies to the protection of a person\u2019s picture against abuse by others (ibid).",

With regard to cases in which a violation of the rights guaranteed under Article 8 is asserted and the alleged interference with those rights originates in an expression, the Court has already found that the protection granted by the State should be understood as one taking into consideration its obligations under Article 10 of the Convention. In cases concerning an article published in a newspaper, the protection of private life has to be balanced against, inter alia, the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article\u00a010 of the Convention (see W\u0119grzynowski and Smolczewski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 56-58, 16 July 2013, with further references). As a matter of principle, the rights guaranteed by these provisions deserve equal respect and the outcome should not, in principle, vary according to whether the complaint is brought with reference to Article 10 or Article 8 of the Convention. Accordingly, the margin of appreciation should in principle be matching whichever Article is cited (see Axel Springer AG v.\u00a0Germany\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7 87, 7\u00a0February 2012, and Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 106). Where a balancing exercise between those two rights has been undertaken by the national authorities, in line with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts. In other words, there will usually be a wide margin of appreciation afforded by the Court if the State is required to strike a balance between competing private interests or competing Convention rights (for a recent statement on the applicable approach, see F\u00fcrst-Pfeifer v. Austria, nos.\u00a033677/10 and 52340/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04042, 17 May 2016).",

More recently, it applied that approach to information given orally by a public prosecutor in charge of the prosecuting authorities\u2019 relations with the press, thereby constituting a sufficient factual basis for an article that was \u201cbased\u201d on this information (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7 105).",

The Court notes that the national courts justified the publication of the photograph by citing the exception to the statutory rule of consent, stating that it was in the public interest for the photograph to be disseminated. The courts stated that the dissemination of the photograph could serve to aid the gathering of further information and prompt eyewitnesses to the crimes bring investigated (or to further crimes) to come forward.

It is uncontested that the impugned article contributed to \u201ca debate of general interest\u201d. As already mentioned above, the public does, in principle, have an interest in being informed, and in being able to inform itself, about criminal proceedings, while strictly observing the\u00a0presumption of innocence. The degree of that interest will vary, however, as it may evolve during the course of the proceedings according to various factors, such as how well the person in question is known, the circumstances of the case and any further developments arising during the proceedings (see Verlagsgruppe News GmbH, cited above, \u00a7 42). In that connection, the Court has stated that especially at the early stage of criminal proceedings the disclosure of a suspect\u2019s identity may be particularly problematic and that national courts may take measures to protect him or her against \u201ctrial by media\u201d and to give effect to the\u00a0presumption of innocence\u00a0(ibid.).

Finland, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a7 66-72, 10\u00a0February 2009, in which the article in question concerned an ordinary individual but where the court nevertheless found that the order to pay compensation for the damage caused by publishing her name and picture within the context of a report on an issue of general interest had not been \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention). The methods by which the information had been obtained were not in dispute between the parties. The information was provided by a public authority and it has not been contested that this course of action was lawful.\u00a0As regards the form of the article at issue, the Court notes that the language used was neither offensive nor provocative. Moreover, the claimant was not the focus of the article; rather, the focus was on other people who had been recently arrested. The Court cannot therefore find that the disclosure of the claimant\u2019s identity amounted to \u201ctrial by media\u201d. It could not be discounted that the impugned article had some repercussions on his \u201cprivate life\u201d. In so far as the thrust of the claim relating to an affront to his reputation or honour was based on allegations of fresh (that is to say recently discovered) criminal conduct, it could be admitted that the fact that the applicant was serving a final prison sentence had some, albeit limited, relevance in this specific regard.",

However, the Court observes that the contested statement was preceded by a paragraph explaining that the recently arrested people were \u201caccused\u201d (in its ordinary rather than its legal meaning) of a criminal offence under Article 210 of the Criminal Code. The article also had an introductory phrase mentioning that the persons in question were \u201caccused\u201d of running a criminal community. At one point the article mentioned that the arrestees were suspects. Reading the article as a whole it could be reasonably understood that the applicant was at the time merely suspected of a criminal offence relating to membership of a criminal gang and its arguably unlawful activities. Lastly, the Court agrees with the domestic courts that the journalist relied in good faith on the official source in so far as the article was based on the content of official information (see the case-law cited in paragraph 109 above).",

The Court decided not to examine the applicants\u2019 argument, under the substantive limb of Article 2, to the effect that their close family members had been unlawfully killed. It observed that a civil action was pending, and the issue of the lawfulness or otherwise of the deaths as well as the establishment of the material facts could be determined in the course of the civil proceedings.

The majority stressed that the applicants obtained a first decision from the domestic courts (within the civil proceedings) that the detention in question had been lawful. They concluded therefore that \u201cthere has been no suggestion, and there is no indication that the proceedings had no prospects of success or could not afford redress.\u201d",
