In circumstances where the domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction examined and dismissed the applicants\u2019 ill-treatment complaints, basing their conclusions on the assistant prosecutor\u2019s findings, it is not apparent that a challenge to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s decision through the avenue of a separate criminal procedure before the same courts would have been any more successful, or would have been decided on the basis of any other issues. By raising, before the trial and appeal courts, a complaint about the ill-treatment and the authorities\u2019 failure to investigate, the applicants provided the domestic authorities with the opportunity to put right the alleged violation.",

The Court has already noted in previous cases that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7\u00a096, ECHR 1999V). In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see Salman v.  [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0114, ECHR 2000VII). According to the Court\u2019s consistent approach, treatment is considered \u201cinhuman\u201d if it is premeditated, applied for hours at a stretch and causes either actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering. It is deemed to be \u201cdegrading\u201d if it is such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 92). The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a violation of Article 3 (see, for example, Peers v.\u00a0Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 2001-III, and Kalashnikov v.

It has never been argued that the applicants had resisted arrest, had attempted to escape or had not complied with lawful orders from the police officers. Furthermore, there is no indication that at any point during their arrest or subsequent detention at the police station they threatened the police officers, for example by openly carrying a weapon or by attacking them (see, by contrast, Necdet Bulut v.

Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0107 et seq., and Assenov and Others v.

In the present case on 16 and 18 September 2000 the hospital administration notified the authorities that the applicants had applied for medical assistance (see paragraph 12 above) alleging ill-treatment by the police. The applicants subsequently brought their allegations of ill-treatment to the attention of the authorities by filing a complaint with the Kuntsevo district prosecutor (see paragraph 11 above). According to the Government, the Kuntsevo district prosecutor\u2019s office launched its inquiry in November 2000, that is, almost two months after the alleged beating. The Court notes with regret that this delay may have resulted in the loss of opportunities for collecting evidence of the alleged ill-treatment. For instance, in the period immediately following the events in question no attempts were made to conduct an expert medical examination of the applicants. The Court reiterates in this connection that proper medical examinations are an essential safeguard against ill-treatment. The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and been allocated a mandate which is broad in scope (see Akko\u00e7 v. Turkey, nos.\u00a022947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7\u00a055 and \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000X). In the instant case, the Court observes that a delay in requesting an expert opinion led, among other things, to inconclusive findings by the forensic medical expert (see paragraph 12 above).",

Firstly, no evaluation was carried out with respect to the quantity and nature of the applicants\u2019 injuries.\u00a0In delivering his decision the assistant prosecutor limited himself to a restatement of the hospital reports which listed the injuries sustained by the applicants and to a selective reiteration of the expert findings in respect of the first applicant. The Court finds it striking that the assistant prosecutor omitted to order a forensic examination of the second applicant or at least to take statements from the hospital doctors attending the applicants (see paragraph 12 above). The Court also considers it extraordinary that the assistant prosecutor did not attempt to examine the medical evidence before him and to draw conclusions on that basis. In this connection the Court is concerned that the lack of any \u201cobjective\u201d evidence \u2013 which medical reports could have provided \u2013 was subsequently relied on by the assistant prosecutor as a ground for his decision not to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers (see paragraph 12 above).",

It is apparent from the decision submitted to the Court that the investigator based his conclusions mainly on the testimonies given by the police officers involved in the incident. Although excerpts from the applicants\u2019 testimonies were included in the decision not to institute criminal proceedings, the investigator did not consider those testimonies to be credible, apparently, because they reflected personal opinions and constituted an accusatory tactic by the applicants. However, the investigator did accept the police officers\u2019 testimonies as credible, despite the fact that their statements could have constituted defence tactics and have been aimed at damaging the applicants\u2019 credibility. In the Court\u2019s view, the prosecution inquiry applied different standards when assessing the testimonies, as those given by the applicants were deemed to be subjective, but not those given by the police officers. The credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned, as the prosecution investigation was supposed to establish whether the officers were liable on the basis of disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a046317/99, \u00a7\u00a099, 23\u00a0February 2006).",

It transpires from the assistant prosecutor\u2019s decision of 22 January 2001 that the applicants were not given an opportunity to identify and confront the police officers who had allegedly taken part in the beatings. It is apparent from the decision of 22 January 2001 that the assistant prosecutor based his conclusions solely on the testimonies given by certain police officers who had been assigned to the applicants\u2019 criminal case or who had taken part in the applicants\u2019 arrest. The assistant prosecutor accepted too readily their denial that force had been used against the applicants.\u00a0The Court further considers that while the assistant prosecutor may not have been provided with the names of individuals who could have seen the applicants at the police station, he could have been expected to take steps of his own initiative to identify possible eyewitnesses. Furthermore, he took no meaningful steps to determine the identity of other police officers who had been involved in questioning the applicants in the police station or to search the premises where the applicants had allegedly been ill-treated. The Court therefore finds that the assistant prosecutor\u2019s failure to look for corroborating evidence and his deferential attitude to the police officers must be considered to be a particularly serious shortcoming in the investigation (see Ayd\u0131n v. Turkey, judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports 1997VI, \u00a7\u00a0106).",

As regards the appeal against the conviction, the Court notes that the scope of the review exercised by the Moscow City Court was limited to the merits of the criminal charge against the applicants. In those proceedings the City Court had no competence to examine, or to afford redress for, alleged breaches of the Convention provisions which had occurred at the stage of the determination of detention matters (see Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a062936/00, 9 December 2004).",

The Court accepts that the applicants suffered humiliation and distress on account of the torture inflicted on them. In addition, they did not benefit from an adequate and effective investigation of their complaints about the ill-treatment. In these circumstances, it considers that the applicants\u2019 suffering and frustration cannot be compensated for by a mere finding of a violation.

Germany [GC], no.\u00a030943/96, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2003-VIII). The Court is mindful of the fact that the first applicant was represented by a lawyer in the domestic proceedings, which involved complex issues, inter alia the complaint about the police brutality, and required qualified legal advice. The Court further observes that in 2002 the applicants issued the lawyers from the International Protection Centre in  with authority to represent their interests in the proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights. The counsel acted as the applicants\u2019 representatives throughout the procedure. It is clear from the length and detail of the pleadings submitted by the applicants that a great deal of work was carried out on their behalf. Having regard to the documents submitted and the rates for the lawyers\u2019 work, the Court is satisfied that these rates are reasonable. However, the Court considers that a reduction should be applied to the amount claimed in respect of legal fees on account of the fact that some of the applicants\u2019 complaints were declared inadmissible. Having regard to the materials in its possession, the Court awards EUR 140 to the first applicant for his legal representation in the domestic proceedings and EUR 3,500 to the two applicants jointly in respect of costs and expenses incurred before the Court, together with any tax that may be chargeable to them.",
