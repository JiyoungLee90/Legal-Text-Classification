In so doing, it must determine whether the reasons purporting to justify any measures taken with regard to an applicant\u2019s enjoyment of his right to respect for family life are relevant and sufficient (see, amongst other authorities, Olsson v.\u00a0Sweden, 24\u00a0March 1988, \u00a7\u00a068, Series A no.\u00a0130, and Wojciech Nowak v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a011118/06, \u00a7\u00a045, 8\u00a0June 2010).",

This applies not only to cases dealing with the compulsory taking of children into public care and the implementation of care measures (see, inter alia, Olsson v.\u00a0Sweden (no.\u00a02), 27\u00a0November 1992, \u00a7\u00a090, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0250), but also to cases where contact and residence disputes concerning children arise between parents and/or other members of the children\u2019s family (see, for example, Hokkanen v.\u00a0Finland, 23\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7\u00a055, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0299).",

The key consideration is whether those authorities have taken all such necessary steps to facilitate contact as can reasonably be demanded in the particular circumstances of each case (see, mutatis mutandis, Hokkanen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058). Other important factors to be taken into account in proceedings concerning children are that time takes on a particular significance, as there is always a danger that any procedural delay will result in the de facto determination of the issue before the court and that the decisionmaking procedure should provide the requisite protection of parental interests (see W.\u00a0v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 8\u00a0July 1987, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a062-64, Series A no.\u00a0121, and P\u0142aza v. Poland, no. 18830/07, \u00a7 74, 25 January 2011). In relation to the State\u2019s obligation to take positive measures, the Court has held that in cases concerning the implementation of the contact rights of one of the parents, Article 8 includes a parent\u2019s right to the taking of measures with a view to his being reunited with his child and an obligation on the national authorities to facilitate such reunion, in so far as the interest of the child dictates that everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, if and when appropriate, to \u201crebuild\u201d the family; the State\u2019s obligation is not one of result, but one of means (see, among other authorities, Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania, no. 31679/96, \u00a7\u00a094, ECHR\u00a02000I; Nuutinen v.
