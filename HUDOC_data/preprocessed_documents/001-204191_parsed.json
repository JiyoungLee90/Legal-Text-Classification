This implies an obligation on the authorities to provide detainees with the medical care necessary to safeguard their life (see Ta\u00efs v.

A sharp deterioration in a person\u2019s state of health in detention facilities inevitably raises serious doubts as to the adequacy of medical treatment there. Thus, where a detainee dies as a result of a health problem, the State must offer a reasonable explanation as to the cause of death and the treatment administered to the person concerned prior to his or her death (see Makharadze and Sikharulidze, cited above \u00a7\u00a7 71-72, and the cases cited therein).",

In this regard the Government submitted that since J.F. had died after his detention had been revoked the responsibility of State could not be engaged (see paragraph 54 above). The Court observes that at the time of his admission to prison J.F. was in a generally good condition (see paragraph 8 above). However, on his release he was in intensive care, on circulatory and respiratory support and his medical prognosis was uncertain (see paragraph 13 above). He died several days later and the applicants alleged that absence of proper medical care in detention had led to his death (see paragraph 49 above). Moreover, while the domestic authorities found that the applicants had not proven a causal link between the allegedly inadequate medical care in detention and J.F.\u2019s death they confirmed that the acts of medical staff in prison had fallen under the State\u2019s liability in tort (see paragraph 25 above).",

However, the Court does not consider the waiting period of five days for an X-ray examination to be exceptionally long. It notes in that regard that, under the relevant domestic provisions, a detainee should undergo an X-ray examination within fourteen days of arriving at prison (see paragraph 35 above). There is no information in the medical records to suggest that J.F. had submitted any complaints about his health before the date of his examination. Consequently, in the circumstances of the present case, it does not appear that the Xray examination should have been carried out earlier. Moreover, as established by the domestic courts it had not been demonstrated that an earlier Xray examination would have enabled detection of the aneurysm (see paragraph\u00a025 above).",

Subsequently, on 14 January 2009 he was examined by a prison doctor, who noted that his condition had not changed (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above). However, the following day, when J.F.\u2019s condition worsened, he was immediately transferred, firstly to the emergency department of the Clinical Hospital in order to undergo examinations and then to a specialist hospital  the Institute of Cardiology in Anin (see paragraph 12 above). The material in the case file contains nothing to indicate that J.F. himself asked for his transfer to be expedited, or that there were any objective reasons to do so. There is no basis to conclude that the doctors misjudged or disregarded the extent of the deterioration in his health. In his opinion of 30\u00a0January 2013, the expert concluded that, given the incomplete medical records, it was not possible to establish whether J.F.\u2019s transfer to the emergency department had resulted from a sudden deterioration of his health or from the analysis of the chest X-ray carried out on 12 January 2009 (see paragraph 18 above). In view of the above, the Court cannot speculate as to whether an earlier transfer to a civilian hospital would have prevented J.F.\u2019s death.",

The choice of means for ensuring the positive obligations under the Convention is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State\u2019s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues for ensuring Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means. However, for this obligation to be satisfied, such proceedings must not only exist in theory but also operate effectively in practice (see, Calvelli and Ciglio, cited above, \u00a7 51; Byrzykowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a011562/05, \u00a7 105, 27 June 2006, and Lopes de Sousa Fernandes, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a021216 with further references).",
