The authority concluded that she posed a danger to public safety. In such a case her personal circumstances, namely her long stay in Germany and her residence status, were secondary. She was neither economically integrated nor sufficiently able to communicate in German, which was an obstacle to her therapy. She only had limited contacts with her former husband and her son and she was still familiar with the Pakistani culture.

It upheld the decision that the applicant could be deported, on the grounds of the serious offence committed by her, lack of awareness of her own condition and given that a high probability of reoffending therefore existed. Moreover, she was not integrated into German society, especially due to her lack of German language skills. Article 8 of the Convention was not applicable as the applicant had no significant family relationships. The domestic court noted that, in principle, in Pakistan basic medical care for psychiatric patients existed in big cities like Lahore and that the applicant could afford treatment, including medication, as she would be receiving a small pension in the amount of around 250 euros (EUR). The domestic court recognised that family members in Pakistan had explicitly ruled out that they would take her in, when asked by the German Embassy. However, the domestic court thought it conceivable that the applicant\u2019s relatives would help her with organising the required treatment if she were to provide them with small sums in euros in return. Furthermore, the applicant did not hold a visible position within the Ahmadiyya religion, so there would be no specific danger for her in that regard.",

Furthermore, she did not submit specific details of possible persecution on religious grounds. The Court takes note that family members in Pakistan had stated that they would refuse to take the applicant in or visit her in a psychiatric institution. The Court therefore accepts that there appear to be no strong family ties but it maintains that it does not appear impossible that contacts with the family in Pakistan could be pursued and ultimately strengthened (see Trabelsi, cited above, \u00a7 63).",

As far as the applicant\u2019s specific state of health is concerned, the Court notes that in principle, medical treatment for her condition would be available in Pakistan. The Court is aware of problems she might face in obtaining the necessary care without the help of relatives or an outside carer. It further notes that she will receive a pension in euros which, considering its corresponding value in Pakistan, might open up the possibility of obtaining further assistance. Eventually, a balance between the interests of all parties has to be struck.
