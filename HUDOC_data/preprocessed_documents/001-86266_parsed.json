As regards Mrs Khokhlova\u2019s claims for interest on monies unpaid, the Court notes that these claims are not supported by any relevant material which would enable the Court to determine the amounts claimed. Consequently, it rejects these claims (see e.g., Glova and Bregin v. , nos. 4292/04 and 4347/04, \u00a7\u00a029, 28 February 2006).",
