Georgia (dec.), 25491/04, 5 May 2009). That decision was not susceptible to appeal on points of law. The Court notes that the provision of domestic law referred to by the Government concerns the procedural right vis-a-vis the other party, namely the right to comment on an appeal. The wording of that provision does not suggest that the applicant was entitled to lodge comments on, or objections to, the court decision which was, moreover, not amenable to appeal on points of law as noted above. Furthermore, the Government have not provided any example of domestic jurisprudence in which a plea of unjustified extension of the time-limit for lodging an ordinary appeal had been successfully relied on in a situation comparable to that of the applicant. The Court therefore rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection on the ground of non-exhaustion.",

One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty (see Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR\u00a01999VII). Legal certainty presupposes respect for the principle of res judicata that is the principle of the finality of judgments. This principle underlines that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR\u00a02003IX).",
