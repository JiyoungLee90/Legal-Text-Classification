The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996VI, pp. 2275-76, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52; Akdivar and Others\u00a0v.

A civil court is unable to pursue any independent investigation and is not capable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings as to the identity of the perpetrators of fatal assaults, still less of attributing responsibility. Furthermore, a Contracting State\u2019s obligation under Articles\u00a02 and 13 of the Convention to conduct an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible in cases of fatal assaults might be rendered illusory if, in respect of complaints under those Articles, an applicant were to be required to pursue an action leading only to an award of damages (see Ya\u015fa v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 2\u00a0September 1998, Reports 1998VI, p.\u00a02431, \u00a7\u00a074, and Khashiyev and Akayeva v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a057942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0119-121, 24 February 2005).

Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, p. 1211, \u00a7 69; Aksoy, cited above, p. 2276, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54; and Tanr\u0131kulu v.

The situations where deprivation of life may be justified are exhaustive and must be narrowly interpreted. The use of force which may result in the deprivation of life must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a), (b) and (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims. In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0324, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a014650; Andronicou and Constantinou v.

The investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see O\u011fur, cited above, \u00a7\u00a088). In particular, there must be an implicit requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition (see Ya\u015fa, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102-04, and Mahmut Kaya v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022535/93, ECHR 2000-III, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0106-07). It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the next of kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see Shanaghan\u00a0v. the , no.\u00a037715/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a091-92, 4 May 2001).",

The Court further notes that the provisions of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to which the Government referred, do not preclude disclosure of the documents from a pending investigation file, but rather set out a procedure for and limits to such disclosure. The Government failed to specify the nature of the documents and the grounds on which they could not be disclosed (see, for similar conclusions, Mikheyev v. Russia, no.\u00a077617/01, \u00a7\u00a0104, 26 January 2006). The Court also notes that in a number of comparable cases that have been reviewed by or are pending before the Court, similar requests have been made to the Russian Government and the documents from the investigation files have been submitted without reference to Article 161 (see, for example, Khashiyev and Akayeva v.

However, its judgments are essentially declaratory in nature and, in general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (see, among other authorities, Scozzari and Giunta\u00a0v.

The Court further notes its above finding that in the present case the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in the early stages by the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to take essential investigative measures (see paragraphs 70, 71 and 74 above). It is therefore very doubtful that the situation existing before the breach could be restored.
