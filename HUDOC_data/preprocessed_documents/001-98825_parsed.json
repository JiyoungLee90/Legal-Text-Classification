The court based its findings on the statements of Mrs K. and medical evidence of injuries sustained by her. The court also referred to the testimonies of neighbours of the family and a report on V.G.'s personality of 9 August 2006 provided by his school that stated that he behaved aggressively, insulted and threatened the neighbours and on some occasions had beaten some of his schoolmates. The report of 9 August 2006 also mentioned that this aggressive attitude and lack of respect for others were hereditary traits and required treatment by specialists.

Based on these considerations the courts found that it was impossible for Mrs K. and V.G. to live as one family. As of the date of the court's judgment on annulment of adoption the applicant and Mrs K. were divorced and no longer constituted a family (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above). It appears therefore that the annulment of adoption by Mrs K. did not necessitate separation of the applicant and the boy.",

Instead, they laid the burden of proof on the applicant and required him to show the ability to influence and bring up the child properly in order for the adoption not to be annulled, regardless of the fact that both the applicant and the boy wished to remain a family (see paragraphs 15 and 17 above).",
