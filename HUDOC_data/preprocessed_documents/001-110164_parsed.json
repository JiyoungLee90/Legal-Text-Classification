However, it ruled that the applicant\u2019s complaint was compatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention, in so far as it related to Article 6 under its civil head. In the Chamber\u2019s view, the applicant could arguably maintain that, as a prisoner, he was entitled to be granted prison leave once he satisfied all the requirements laid down by the legislation. The Chamber further observed that the restrictions on the right to a court to which the applicant claimed to have been subjected in the context of his requests for prison leave related to a set of prisoners\u2019 rights which the Council of Europe had recognised by means of the European Prison Rules, adopted by the Committee of Ministers and clarified in three Recommendations. The Chamber therefore concluded that a dispute over \u201crights\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 could be said to have existed. As to whether the rights in question were \u201ccivil\u201d rights, it pointed out that the proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s various requests for prison leave had raised the issue of his interest in reorganising his professional and social life on his release from prison. In the Chamber\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s requests for prison leave had been motivated by his wish to attend classes with a view to obtaining diplomas in accounting and computer use and to complete certain administrative formalities with his bank and various institutions (including the renewal of his driving licence and his consular registration card). The Chamber considered that the restriction alleged by the applicant, in addition to its pecuniary implications, related to his personal rights, in view of the significance of his interest in resettling in society. It took the view that the applicant\u2019s social rehabilitation was crucial to the protection of his right to lead a private life and develop his social identity. It therefore concluded that the proceedings in question had related to a civil right.",

Since the minimum \u201cpunitive\u201d period \u2013 in other words, the period during which the applicant had to be kept in detention without being eligible for release \u2013 had expired on completion of one-third of his sentence (section 8), he could, from that point onwards, claim the right to be granted prison leave, although the Board could still take the view that the criteria of section 13 were not met. While the Government were right, in terms of section 13, to characterise the decision taken by the Board as \u201cdiscretionary\u201d, the existence of this power, which was legitimate with regard to the execution of sentences, was perfectly consistent with the principle of the rule of law provided it was subject to review.

The applicant concluded that once he had met the conditions listed in sections 7 and 8 of the 1986 Law, he had had, at least on arguable grounds, the right to have his request for prison leave considered in the light of the subjective criteria of section 13 of the Law. Hence, the discretionary power of the Prison Board in no sense ruled out the characterisation of the measure in question as a \u201cright\u201d (the applicant cited, mutatis mutandis, H. v.

It is apparent from the information provided to the Court that the 1986 Law and the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 19 January 1989 lay down the arrangements governing prison leave and the circumstances in which it may, where applicable, be granted. It is within this legal framework that the Prison Board, each time a request is submitted to it, examines the report prepared by a committee (the \u201cguidance committee\u201d) on the prisoner concerned. The Board takes into consideration the personality of the prisoner, his or her progress and the risk of a further offence, in order to assess whether he or she may be granted prison leave.

Otherwise, this issue would be determined differently in different member States in relation to the same measure. In addition, the Court has already accepted \u201cthat the mere fact that the wording of a legal provision affords an element of discretion does not in itself rule out the existence of a civil right\u201d (see Lambourdi\u00e8re v. France, no. 37387/97, \u00a7 24, 2 August 2000, and Camps v.  (dec.), no. 42401/98, 23 November 1999). Lastly, the prevailing views of experts in criminal law and criminology have changed radically regarding the purposes and functions of sentences. Prison leave is not a special favour, or a privilege, or a concession, or an indulgence; like any other arrangement for the execution of custodial sentences, it is a necessary measure in terms of preparing for and envisaging the prospect of the prisoner\u2019s release. If the measure proves a failure, it will not be renewed, and continued supervision and surveillance will thus remain possible. Accordingly, the fact that a post-sentencing measure is classified as a \u201cprivilege\u201d in domestic law is not sufficient, in our view, to deprive persons laying claim to it of the right to have their case heard in accordance with the principles enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention.",

What was at stake in the proceedings concerning his various requests for prison leave was therefore his interest in making new arrangements for his professional and social life on his release from prison, a matter falling within the sphere of personal rights. More specifically, the applicant\u2019s requests for prison leave in 2005 were intended to enable him to exercise outside prison his right of contact with his children, who were reluctant to visit him there. His other requests were made with a view to his professional and social reintegration, his aim being to prepare the ground for securing gainful employment, in particular with a view to paying compensation to the victim and settling his debts. The refusals by the Prison Board were directly decisive for the civil right in question.",

Where the first stages of the prisoner\u2019s return to the community depend on another person\u2019s good will (or lack of it), the entire resettlement plan can be thwarted.",

Sweden, 23 September 1982, \u00a7 81, Series A no. 52). The dispute may relate not only to the existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise (see, for example, Zander v. Sweden, 25 November 1993, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 279-B), and the outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 \u00a7 1 into play (see, for example, Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, 28 September 1995, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 327-A, and Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, \u00a7 56, Series A no. 294-B). In the present case it seems clear that a \u201cdispute\u201d arose when the Prison Board refused the various requests for prison leave based in particular on the applicant\u2019s plans for his reintegration into society and the workforce. That dispute, which was genuine and serious, related to the actual existence of a civil right, within the meaning of the Convention, asserted by the applicant. By applying to the administrative courts for judicial review, the applicant sought to have the case referred to the competent authority so that the latter could rule afresh on his requests for prison leave. The outcome of the proceedings before the administrative courts was therefore directly decisive for the right at stake.",

Belgium, 23 June 1981, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 43). However, for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 a tribunal need not be a court of law integrated within the standard judicial machinery. What is important to ensure compliance with Article 6 \u00a7 1 are the guarantees, both substantive and procedural, which are in place (see Rolf Gustafson v. Sweden, 1 July 1997, \u00a7 45, Reports 1997IV). Thus, a \u201ctribunal\u201d is characterised in the substantive sense of the term by its judicial function, that is to say, determining matters within its competence on the basis of rules of law and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner (see Argyrou and Others v. Greece, no. 10468/04, \u00a7 24, 15 January 2009). It must also satisfy a series of further requirements \u2013 independence, in particular of the executive; impartiality; duration of its members\u2019 terms of office; guarantees afforded by its procedure \u2013 several of which appear in the text of Article 6 \u00a7 1 itself (see Demicoli v. Malta, 27\u00a0August 1991, \u00a7 39, Series A no. 210). With that proviso, in the case before us the Prison Board could not in itself be said to satisfy the requirements of a \u201ctribunal\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

One of the problems here lies in the reasons given. As can be seen, the majority of the requests for prison leave were refused for the reason, in particular, that the applicant had not compensated the victim. This results in a vicious circle since, if the prisoner is unable to engage in gainful employment, the prospect of compensating the victim will become largely illusory. Of course, it is not for our Court to assess the merits of the reasons given, which is the task of the domestic court. However, and this is precisely the problem, the reasons given in the present case were brief in the extreme.",

In more general terms, the Attorney-General or his or her representative, who, according to the law, is the decision-making authority when it comes to the execution of sentences, clearly cannot be considered to be an independent and impartial judicial authority for the purposes of Article 6 (see, mutatis mutandis, Medvedyev and Others v.

Even assuming that the existence of such discretionary power is legitimate with regard to the execution of sentences, it cannot be consistent with the principle of the rule of law unless it is subject to review. Where there is no such review, the power becomes arbitrary.",

Accordingly, the impugned decisions, given their nature, could not be the subject of an application to the administrative courts. This hints at the need to have a specific post-sentencing judge or court, as is fortunately the case today in many countries. In the present case, the lack of any decision on the merits of the application meant that the administrative courts\u2019 review of the Prison Board\u2019s decisions was deprived of any effect (see, mutatis mutandis, Enea, \u00a7 82, and Ganci, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30, both cited above).",
