Therefore, although under domestic law the High Administrative Court was not required to hold an oral hearing (see paragraph 14 above), according to the well-established case-law of the Court, the applicant was in principle entitled to one. Only exceptional circumstances could have justified dispensing with a hearing (compare Stallinger and Kuso v.

Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 21 and 74, ECHR 2007II). The Government, on the other hand, argued that the applicant had not contested the main allegation in the case, namely the lack of authorisation to climb that particular excavator at the time of the accident (see paragraph 9 above). For that reason, in the Government\u2019s view, a hearing would not have contributed to establishing facts relevant to the merits of the case. Rather, it would have only delayed the proceedings (see\u00a0paragraphs 29 and 30 above).",

The plausibility of that explanation was not verified by the domestic authorities (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above). In the Court\u2019s opinion, that disputed aspect of the case can be said to have been relevant to the outcome of the proceedings, especially in view of the fact that the employer itself stated in the proceedings before the Fund that the applicant was a qualified engineer and that if he had had to enter the excavator for any reason, he should have known how to do it (see paragraph 9 above). The Court therefore dismisses the Government\u2019s argument that the relevant facts in the instant case were uncontested and sufficiently and clearly established and concludes that there were no exceptional circumstances which justified dispensing with an oral hearing in the administrative proceedings at issue (see likewise Mitkova, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-64, and Mirovni In\u0161titut, \u00a7\u00a7 42-45, both cited above).",
