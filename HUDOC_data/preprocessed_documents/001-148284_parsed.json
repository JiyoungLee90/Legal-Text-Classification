He was locked up in such circumstances for twenty-two hours a day. In the winter the heating in the cell was not sufficient and in the summer it was too hot, so that the prisoners, who were allowed to take a shower only once a week, smelt unbearable. The hygiene conditions were poor, as inmates were not provided with sufficient cleaning products and some also smoked in the cell. In addition, food in the canteen often went bad because the refrigerators did not work well. There was only one toilet in the cell, which was not sufficient for eight persons. The applicant therefore had to use a bottle or some other means instead of using the toilet, because the drugs he had been taking for high blood pressure meant that he needed to use the toilet frequently. That caused laughter and mocking among the other prisoners. Moreover, he was distanced from his family. At the beginning, he was allowed only a tenminute telephone call with his family per week; later, he had the right to only a fifteen-minute call per week.",

Originally conceived as prisons (zatvori) for remand prisoners and persons serving sentences of up to six months\u2019 duration, 50 percent of the population now held in these establishments are convicted prisoners serving sentences of up to five years.

In this respect, the Committee takes note of the efforts invested by the Ministry of Justice since 2007 in elaborating a legal framework and putting into place a probation system at the national level, which includes the possibility for State Prosecutors, Courts and Probation Offices to enlarge the scope and number of persons subject to alternative measures such as community work and protected supervision.

Moreover, after his transfer to Pula Prison, his contact with his family had become very difficult because he had not been given sufficient time to communicate with them and it had been very difficult for them to travel to Pula. Furthermore, his well-being had been put at risk during the transfer and admission to Pula Prison, because the transfer had been organised on a hot summer\u2019s day and on his arrival at Pula Prison he had not been examined by a doctor because his medical records had still been in Zadar Prison.

The applicant was confined in those conditions for twenty-two hours a day (compare Longin, cited above, \u00a7 60).

In the Government\u2019s view, the fact that the Code of Criminal Procedure had required that, during appeal proceedings, the case file be forwarded to the State Attorney\u2019s Office at the level immediately above the one representing the prosecution in the proceedings at issue had essentially benefited the accused, since this had allowed the higher State Attorney\u2019s Office to supervise the work of the lower office and, if necessary, to withdraw the opinion. The State Attorney\u2019s Office had not been obliged under domestic law to submit an opinion at all, but it was normally expected that the case file would be returned to the court accompanied by a letter. In the present case, the letter from the State Attorney\u2019s Office of the Republic of Croatia had simply proposed that the appeal lodged by the defence be dismissed. The Supreme Court had relied on nothing which had been adduced from the evidence before the first-instance court and had remained within the boundaries of the applicant\u2019s appeal. Thus the submission of the State Attorney\u2019s Office of the Republic of Croatia had not strengthened the position of the prosecution.",

[T]he principle of equality of arms is one feature of the wider concept of a fair trial, which also includes the fundamental right that criminal proceedings should be adversarial. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment on them (see Brandstetter v. Austria, 28\u00a0August 1991, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67, Series A no. 211; Milatov\u00e1 and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0Czech Republic, no. 61811/00, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2005V; and, a fortiori, Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 35376/97, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45, 3 March 2000; and OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia, no. 14902/04, \u00a7\u00a0538, 20\u00a0September 2011). Therefore, it is even possible that a procedural situation which does not place a party at any disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his or her opponent still represents a violation of the right to adversarial proceedings if the party concerned did not have an opportunity to have knowledge of, and comment on, all evidence adduced or observations filed, with a view to influencing the court\u2019s decision (see Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-46; and Grega\u010devi\u0107 v.

It is therefore unfair for the prosecution to make submissions to a court without the knowledge of the defence (see Bulut v.
