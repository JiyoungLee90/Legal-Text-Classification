In these circumstances, any subsequent developments in the criminal proceedings against him would not have affected the core of the matter underlying his complaint under the Convention, because some period of his detention had already taken place. Accordingly, the Court is unable to find that a lack of information about further extensions of the applicant\u2019s detention and his second conviction could have had a decisive influence on its judgment, or could have prevented it from ruling on the case (see Neumeister v.\u00a0Austria, 27 June 1968, p. 34, \u00a7 7, Series A no. 8; Kalinin v.
