The trial court had taken account of the fact that B. and E., previously unknown to each other, had consistently asserted that the defendant had beaten the victim's head against the pavement more than once. Their statements had been corroborated by the conclusions of the forensic medical examination, and the fact that the victim N. had injuries to his face which, as the expert report confirmed, could not have been caused solely by falling and could have occurred before the fracture of the parietal bones. The City Court held that in those circumstances the judgment had been correctly based on the statements by B. and E., which were corroborated by the expert's conclusions.",

In view of the combination of these factors, the court had reasonably considered that there was good reason for her not to appear in court.

Thus, the District Court strongly relied on the testimonies of Ms\u00a0B., the victim's wife, given at the hearing. In principle, it is not for this Court to decide whether or not Ms\u00a0B. had had a \u201cvested interest\u201d in the outcome of the case, as the applicant suggested. In the domestic courts' view Ms\u00a0B.'s testimony was credible. That finding was subjective but not arbitrary, so the Court sees no reason to disagree with it. Further, the domestic courts also referred to certain circumstantial evidence, which, although indirectly, confirmed the account of the incident proposed by the prosecution. In sum, the Court considers that Ms E.'s absence at the trial did not affect significantly the overall fairness of the proceedings.",

According to the record of the hearing of 19\u00a0November 2001, the applicant and his lawyer were asked by the court if they considered it possible to begin the examination of the case in the absence of that witness. They explicitly stated that they had no objections. The court read out the statements given by E. on 6 July 2000 during the preliminary investigation. No questions or additions followed from the applicant and his lawyer. At the end of the same hearing the judge solicited the opinions of the applicant and his lawyer regarding the possibility of concluding the examination of the case in E.'s absence. They expressly answered that they had no objections. Having heard evidence from the victim and the prosecutor, the court ordered that the examination of the case be completed. The applicant and his lawyer made no comments in response. The court then proceeded to the pleadings. The Court notes that the applicant does not dispute the authenticity of the above record of the hearing of 19\u00a0November 2001.
