In particular, the applicant has not shown how the lack of legal aid deprived him of a fair trial and breached his right to effectively present his case in violation of that provision (see, amongst other authorities, McVicar v. the , no. 46311/99, ECHR 2002III and Harrison v. United Kingdom, no.\u00a011790/85, Commission decision of 9\u00a0November 1987). The Court further points out that in civil action, no.\u00a01056/94 the judgments on both levels of jurisdiction were in the applicant's favour (see paragraphs 20 and 30 above).
