The case originated in an application (no. 6164/05) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Viktoriya Petrivna Kripak (“the applicant”), on 2 February 2005.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 26 November 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
In their observations the Government requested the Chamber to relinquish jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber pursuant to Article 30 of the Convention. In particular, they challenged applicability of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the present case. The Court recalls that it has already examined similar issues and gave a judgment on them (see, for instance, Zubko and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 3955/04, 5622/04, 8538/04 and 11418/04, ECHR 2006... (extracts), Voytenko v. Ukraine, no. 18966/02, 29 June 2004 and Bagriy and Krivanich v. Ukraine, nos. 12023/04 and 12096/04, 9 November 2006). It finds therefore no reason to depart from its established case-law or to relinquish the Chamber’s jurisdiction to the Grand Chamber in this particular case.
