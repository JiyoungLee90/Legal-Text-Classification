The Court therefore does not consider that the delay has brought about any significant repercussions for the investigation under review (see and compare Drozd v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 12174/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a064 et seq., 30 July 2009).",

The investigative authorities, however, did not conduct a full-fledged investigation but rather limited their response to a formal inquiry held under Article\u00a097 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 41 and 43 above), which, in addition, suffered from the shortcomings set out below.",

Similarly, there was conflicting medical evidence as regards the possible time when the applicant\u2019s injuries were inflicted. The main purpose of the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry was therefore to eliminate these discrepancies, first and foremost by taking additional pieces of evidence (for example, testimonies by incidental witnesses, if any, additional forensic examination, etc.). While the investigating authorities may not have been provided with the names of individuals who could have seen the applicant at the police station and might have witnessed his alleged ill-treatment, they were expected to take steps on their own initiative to identify possible witnesses. However, it is not apparent from the respective prosecutor\u2019s decision that she ever attempted to do that. Nor is it apparent that a facetoface confrontation was held between the applicant and the State officers concerned. Instead, the prosecutor took into account only the statements made by the State officers concerned. The Court therefore finds that the investigating authorities\u2019 failure to seek corroborating evidence and their deferential attitude to the police officers must be regarded as a particularly serious shortcoming in the investigation (see Antipenkov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a033470/03, \u00a7\u00a070, 15 October 2009).",

The remainder of evidence on which the prosecutor relied (namely, the reports of 29\u00a0December 2001 and 12 June 2002) had little value, if any, as it concerned periods after 15 September 2001 (the date on which the applicant was officially arrested and detained), that is to say three weeks after the events in question. Lastly, the Court points out that the applicant\u2019s version of events was not even summarised in the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 20 June 2002 not to institute criminal proceedings. This constitutes a selective approach in the assessment of evidence by the investigating authorities, which the Court has already criticised in previous judgments (see Lotarev v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 29447/04, \u00a7 90, 8 April 2010).",

Moreover, in its decision of 27\u00a0February 2004 to maintain the applicant\u2019s detention \u2013 which according to the Government was final, despite the possibility of appeal mentioned in the decision\u2019s operative part \u2013 the District Court did not address any of the points raised by the defence lawyer in his request. In the Court\u2019s opinion, by ignoring those arguments altogether \u2013 despite the fact that they were specific, pertinent and important \u2013 the District Court fell short of its obligation under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention to review the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention (see Svershov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a035231/02, \u00a7\u00a071, 27\u00a0November 2008, and Sergey\u00a0Volosyuk v. Ukraine, no.\u00a01291/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054-59, 12\u00a0March 2009).",
