Having regard to his duty of confidence towards the applicant\u2019s companion, he would only have been under such an obligation if this could be regarded as the only possibility of preventing the applicant\u2019s infection. This had not been the case, as the physician had consistently advised the applicant\u2019s companion to take the necessary steps to prevent infection and could reasonably believe that the latter would follow his advice.

Contrary to the Regional Court\u2019s opinion, the Court of Appeal considered that the physician had misconceived his duty of care owed towards the applicant in his position as family physician and overestimated his duty of confidence owed towards her companion. As laid down in section 34 of the Criminal Code (see Relevant domestic law below) a physician\u2019s duty of confidence owed towards a patient had to be restricted or even given up if a superior value was at stake. By not informing the applicant about the fatal threat to her health, he had committed an error in treatment. The court considered, however, that the physician had not disregarded medical standards in a blindfold way, but had only overestimated his duty of confidence while balancing the different interests. It followed that his behaviour could not be qualified as a gross error in treatment which, according to the established case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, would have entailed a reversal of the burden of proof as to the causality of the error in treatment and the first applicant\u2019s HIV-positive status. Referring to the written opinion submitted by the court-appointed expert in the first-instance proceedings, the Court of Appeal considered that the applicant had not been able to prove that she had contracted the virus after January 1993, when the physician himself had been informed that her companion was HIV-positive. According to the expert\u2019s opinion, it was more likely that she had already become \nHIV-positive before January 1993. The Court of Appeal further considered that there was no doubt about the expert\u2019s high competence. The expert opinion was well reasoned and took into account relevant scientific publications. Under these circumstances, the Court of Appeal did not find it necessary to hear further expert opinion as requested by the applicant.",

A gross error in treatment is generally assumed if the physician clearly breaches \nwell-established medical rules or assured medical knowledge, and has committed an error which does not appear to be comprehensible from an objective point of view, as a physician must absolutely not commit such an error (see Federal Court of Justice, 26 November 1991, no. VI ZR 389/90, and 4 October 1994, no. VI ZR 205/963). The existence of a gross error has been accepted in cases where a physician had not discovered a serious disease (meningitis) in spite of unambiguous symptoms (see Stuttgart Court of Appeal, 31 October 1996, no. 14 U 52/95, or Oldenburg Court of Appeal, 20 February 1996, no. 5 U 146/95) or had failed to order undoubtedly necessary medical examinations or treatments (Federal Court of Justice, \n29 March 1988, no.

I consider this approach incorrect because the areas of protection of the two articles under discussion are different. The present case in substance falls to be examined rather under Article 8 in my view, more specifically under the positive obligation to protect private life.",

Had there been clear rules and practice for balancing conflicting interests for the doctors the family physician could have avoided an error in interpretation of his duty. It could also have led him to give adequate information and instructions to the partner at the due time, avoiding unnecessary doubts and maybe even accusations. This would certainly have given the applicant clear grounds to determine her private, including her intimate, life, and take necessary precautions. The applicant was left in uncertainty for more than two years (from 21 January 1993 to March 1995 - see paragraph 9). It seems to me that this situation of dangerous uncertainty in which the applicant was left amounted to an unjustified interference in her private life.",
