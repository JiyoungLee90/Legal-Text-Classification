Following those judgments by the Court, the two applicants remained in detention pending trial proceedings against them until their conviction on 18\u00a0December 2017. In December\u00a02017, which is within six months from the final order authorising the extension of their detention on remand, the applicants lodged the present applications with the Court (for further details see the appended table below).",
