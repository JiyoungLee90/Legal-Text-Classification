By declaring the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible simply because a fresh decision extending his detention had meanwhile been adopted, the Constitutional Court did not satisfy the requirement \u201cthat the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford applicants a realistic possibility of using the remedy\u201d (see Pe\u0161a v.
