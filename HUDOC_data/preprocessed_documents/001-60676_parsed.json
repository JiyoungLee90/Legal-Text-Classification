Nevertheless, a State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. It follows from the independence of the legal profession from the State that the conduct of the defence is essentially a matter between the defendant and his counsel, whether appointed under a legal-aid scheme or privately financed. The competent national authorities are required under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) to intervene only if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or sufficiently brought to their attention in some other way (see Daud, cited above, pp. 749-50, \u00a7 38).",

The Court emphasises in passing that the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment quashing the decision given by the judge of the Sintra District Court on 12 September 1995 had no practical impact on the applicant\u2019s situation, since the Supreme Court later took the view that the content of the appeal lodged by the applicant himself could not \u201caffect or influence the course of the proceedings\u201d or the finality of his conviction (see paragraph 37 above).",

It should be pointed out that Portuguese legislation itself permits judges in civil cases to issue such an invitation without it ever being suggested that this implies some loss of independence for members of the legal profession or an infringement of the principle of equality of arms and without there being in that respect the slightest difference between a lawyer appointed by the court under the legal-aid scheme and a lawyer freely chosen. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court recently held to be unconstitutional those provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 and the provisions of similar legislation relating to summary offences \u2013 which required the relevant courts to dismiss appeals out of hand without any prior invitation to the appellant to rectify or add to his pleading in this type of case.

Nor can the applicant claim reimbursement of all his costs before the Convention institutions. The Court points out in that connection that in its decision of 5\u00a0July 2001 it declared the great majority of the applicant\u2019s complaints inadmissible. It therefore considers it reasonable to award EUR 11,000 under this head, plus any amount that may be chargeable in value-added tax, less the EUR 880 already granted by the Council of Europe in legal aid.",
