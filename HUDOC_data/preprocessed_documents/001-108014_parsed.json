The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see as a recent authority Znaykin v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 37538/05, \u00a7 47, 7 October 2010). The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved in any treatment or punishment must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. In accordance with this provision the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see as a recent authority Kharchenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a040107/02, \u00a7 51, 10 February 2011).",
