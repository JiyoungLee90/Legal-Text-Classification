The Court concludes accordingly that in the national authorities\u2019 view the applicant\u2019s case was complex enough to require the assistance of a professional lawyer. In view of the seriousness of the charges against the applicant and the severity of the sentence to which he was liable, the Court sees no reason to disagree with the Russian authorities.",

Of course, it is not always possible for the State to facilitate such a relationship: there are inherent time and place constraints for the meetings between the detained person and his lawyer. Moreover, in exceptional circumstances the State may restrict confidential contacts with defence counsel for a person in detention (see Kempers v. Austria (dec.), no. 21842/03, 27 February 1997, or Lanz v. , no. 24430/94, \u00a7 52, 31 January 2002). Nevertheless, any limitation on relations between clients and lawyers, whether inherent or express, should not thwart the effective legal assistance to which a defendant is entitled. Notwithstanding possible difficulties or restrictions, such is the importance attached to the rights of the defence that the right to effective legal assistance must be respected in all circumstances (see Sakhnovskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102).",
