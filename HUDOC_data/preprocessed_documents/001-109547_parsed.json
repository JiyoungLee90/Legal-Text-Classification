At the same time, the Court considers it necessary to distinguish the depositions made by Mr O. and Mr R. from those made by Mr B. and Mr Sh.. It reiterates that, unlike Mr B. and Mr Sh., who testified both as defendants during the criminal proceedings against them and as witnesses in the course of the pre-trial investigation against the applicant, Mr O. and Mr R. were only questioned as co-accused in the criminal case against them (see paragraphs 6 and 19 above). Mr O.\u2019s death and Mr R.\u2019s escape made their questioning or confrontation with the applicant at a later stage impossible. In this respect, the Court reiterates that a higher degree of scrutiny should be applied to the assessment of statements by co-accused, because the position in which accomplices find themselves while testifying is different from that of ordinary witnesses. They do not testify under oath, that is, without any affirmation of the truth of their statements which could render them punishable for perjury for wilfully making untrue statements. The Court has already held on a number of occasions that for the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention to be respected on account of the admissibility of a guilty plea by a co-accused, such a plea should only be admitted to establish the fact of the commission of a crime by the person making the plea, and not the other defendant, and a judge should make it clear that the guilty plea by itself does not prove that the defendant was involved in that crime (see, for instance, Vladimir Romanov v. , no.\u00a041461/02, \u00a7 102, 24 July 2008, with further references). The Court, therefore, considers that neither Mr O. nor Mr R. was a material witness whose evidence was crucial for the applicant\u2019s conviction. Given this finding, it does not consider it necessary to look any further into the reasons for their absence from the trial and the applicant\u2019s inability to confront them. Having regard to the evidential value of the witnesses\u2019 statements and material evidence, the Court considers that the depositions made by Mr B. and Mr Sh. during the pre-trial investigation and read out by the Town Court constituted virtually the sole direct and objective evidence on which the courts\u2019 findings of the applicant\u2019s guilt were based.",

In this respect, the Court reiterates that the applicant took part in confrontation interviews with Mr B. and Mr Sh. during the pre-trial investigation which, according to the Government, dispensed the  from the obligation to obtain their attendance (see paragraph 19 above).",

The Court has consistently held that the evidence must be produced \u201clive\u201d before the body called upon to assess the case and determine the facts.

In particular, in the case of Melnikov v.  (no. 23610/03, \u00a7\u00a7 79-81, 14 January 2010) the Court held that a confrontation interview conducted, in the absence of defence counsel, by an investigator who did not meet the requirements of independence and impartiality, and had a large discretionary power to block questions during the confrontation could not in the circumstances be considered an appropriate substitute for the examination of the witness in open court. The Court has also held that the appearance of a key witness before the trial court was of crucial importance to enable it to make an effective assessment of his demeanour and of the reliability of his deposition (ibid, \u00a7\u00a7 79-81, with further references). The Court abides by this finding in the present case. It observes that the Government did not allege that the applicant benefited from legal assistance during the confrontation interviews. The Court does not doubt that the domestic courts undertook a careful examination of Mr B.\u2019s and Mr\u00a0Sh.\u2019s written statements and gave the applicant an opportunity to contest them at the trial, but this can scarcely be regarded as a proper substitute for a personal observation of the leading witnesses giving oral evidence (see Bocos-Cuesta v. the , no. 54789/00, \u00a7 71, 10\u00a0November 2005). The present conclusion is even more salient in a situation when one of the leading witnesses had already been held liable for lying under oath (see paragraph 29 above) and there was a possibility that the witnesses had been intimidated into maintaining the statements they made on earlier occasions (see paragraph 26 above). The Court, therefore, is unconvinced that the applicant\u2019s participation in the pre-trial confrontation interview with Mr Sh. and Mr B. could have been, on its own, taken by the Town Court as a circumstance relieving it of the responsibility to hear those two witnesses in person.",

It commenced the review with an examination of the reasons invoked as an exception and determined whether they had actually existed and whether they had been subject to thorough examination by the national authorities. The Court then considered whether the restrictions on the defence rights had been kept to a very minimum, and whether they had been strictly necessary in order to satisfy a legitimate aim. The final step in the Court\u2019s review was an examination of whether the shortcomings in safeguarding the rights of the defence were adequately compensated for (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 152).",

The Court, however, observes that at least on two occasions in January and February 2003 Mr Sh. informed the Town Court of his whereabouts, noting that a difficult financial situation and business matters precluded his attending the trial (see paragraph 20 above). There is no indication that the  responded to the information from Mr Sh. in any other way than by sending new summonses to him. As to Mr B.\u2019s attendance, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the  issued orders urging the bailiff\u2019s office to ensure his presence at the trial, including by escorting him to the hearings. The Court, however, is unable to find any evidence confirming the Government\u2019s argument that Mr B. had left the Sverdlovsk Region on matters of business. The case-file materials presented by the Government do not provide any information as to the reasons for Mr B.\u2019s failure to attend, or to what actions, if any, the bailiffs\u2019 office took to obtain his attendance. At the same time, the Court is particularly mindful of the \u2019s reliance, in its orders of 11 April and 19 May 2003, on the assumption that the summonses had reached Mr B.

While keeping in mind the domestic courts\u2019 obligation to secure the proper conduct of the trial and avoid undue delays in the criminal proceedings, the Court does not consider that a stay in the proceedings for the purpose of obtaining the witnesses\u2019 testimony, or at least clarifying the issue of their appearance at the trial, in which the applicant stood accused of a very serious offence and risked a long term of imprisonment, would have constituted an insuperable hindrance to the expediency of the proceedings at hand (see Vladimir Romanov, cited above, \u00a7 104, with further references, and, most recently, Krivoshapkin v. , no. 42224/02, \u00a7 60, 27\u00a0January 2011).

Italy, 12 February 1985, \u00a7 27, Series\u00a0A no. 89). However, in respect of non-criminal matters there is no\u00a0absolute right to be present at one\u2019s trial, except in respect of a limited category of cases, such as those where the character and lifestyle of the person concerned is directly relevant to the subject matter of the case, or where the decision involves the person\u2019s conduct (see, for example, Kabwe and Chungu v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 29647/08 and\u00a033269/08, 2\u00a0February 2010).",

Russia, no.\u00a072701/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a019 et seq., 15\u00a0March 2005; Groshev v. Russia, no.\u00a069889/01, \u00a7\u00a7 27 et seq., 20\u00a0October 2005; and Mokrushina v. Russia, no. 23377/02, 5\u00a0October 2006). It also found a violation of Article 6 in a number of cases where Russian courts refused leave to appear in court to imprisoned applicants who had wished to make oral submissions on their civil claims. For instance, in the case of Kovalev v. Russia (no.\u00a078145/01, \u00a7\u00a037, 10\u00a0May 2007), despite the fact that the applicant was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim of ill-treatment by the police had been largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been \u201can important part of the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of the case and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings\u201d. In the case of Khuzhin and Others v. Russia (no. 13470/02, \u00a7\u00a7 53 et seq., 23\u00a0October 2008) the Court found that, by refusing to ensure that the imprisoned applicants could attend hearings, and by failing to consider other legal means of ensuring their effective participation in defamation proceedings, the Russian courts had violated the principle of equality of arms. A similar conclusion was reached by the Court in other cases against Russia where the authorities had failed to secure imprisoned applicants\u2019 appearance before the civil courts examining their complaints about the conditions of their detention (see, for instance, Shilbergs v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a020075/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0107-113, 17 December 2009; Artyomov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a014146/02, \u00a7\u00a7 204-208, 27\u00a0May 2010; and Roman Karasev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a030251/03, \u00a7\u00a7 65-70, 25\u00a0November 2010). In the cases cited above, the Court consistently held that given the nature of the applicants\u2019 claims, which were, to a significant extent, based on their personal experience, the effective, proper and satisfactory presentation of the case could have only been secured by the applicants\u2019 personal participation in the hearings. The applicants\u2019 testimony pertaining to the facts of the case, of which only they themselves had first-hand knowledge, would have constituted an indispensable part of the plaintiffs\u2019 presentation of the case.",

However, as in the previous cases concerning the attendance of civil hearings by imprisoned applicants, the Court attributes particular importance to the nature of the dispute to which the applicant was a party. The Court reiterates that the proceedings at hand concerned the termination of parental rights and required assessment by the domestic courts of the very special legal and factual relationship which exists between a parent and a child. The Court considers that before taking a decision to permanently sever that special relationship, the courts should have heard evidence from the applicant in person. The applicant\u2019s defence was, to a major extent, based on his personal experience. In this situation, the Court is not convinced that the representative\u2019s appearance before the courts secured an effective, proper and satisfactory presentation of the applicant\u2019s case. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s testimony describing his relationship with the child, which only he himself had first-hand knowledge of, would have constituted an indispensable part of his presentation of the case (see Kovalev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037).
