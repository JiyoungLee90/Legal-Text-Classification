While neither the Government nor the applicant have specified a particular form of that censorship, it appears that the aforementioned letters were, at least, opened up and read in the applicant's absence, to be later put and classified in his prison file (also see the Court's judgment of \n24 February 2005 in the Jankauskas v. Lithuania case cited above, \u00a7 20). There was thus an interference with the applicant's right to respect for his correspondence under Article 8 paragraph 1 of the Convention, which can only be justified if the conditions of the second paragraph of the provision are met. In particular, such interference must be \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, pursue a legitimate aim and be necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve that aim (see the Court's judgment of 24 July 2001 in the Vala\u0161inas case cited above, ECHR 2001-VIII, \u00a7 128).",

As regards the necessity of the interference, it is to be noted that the censorship was carried out at the stage of pre-trial investigation in the context of two sets of criminal proceedings for robbery and blackmail. While certain forms of censorship of some letters to or from the applicant's acquaintances - especially his correspondence with previous convicts or persons of dangerous character - may have been justified in order to protect the witnesses or victims in the impugned criminal cases, censorship of other private correspondence - especially that with his wife - may have unjustly divulged certain elements of his personal or family life. The interference that occurred in the present case may have thus been justified, but required a more specific justification (cf., mutatis mutandis, Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, \u00a7\u00a7 99-105). However, the Government have not explained why the control of the 121 letters was indispensable. Indeed, even the form of censorship as allowed by the decisions of the prosecutor of 19 November 2001 and 7 February 2003 (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above) - be it opening up, reading, stopping, withholding or another form of control - was not specified, effectively amounting to a carte blanche for the authorities to have an excessive hold on the applicant's communication with the outside world (cf., mutatis mutandis, the Jankauskas judgment cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 21-23). The Court further recalls its case-law requiring certain qualities in such laws as are here concerned (cf., inter alia, Calogero Diana v. Italy, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, p. 1775, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33; Domenichini v. Italy, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, \u00a7\u00a7 29-33; Petra v. Romania, judgment of 3 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, \u00a7\u00a7 37-40). Specifically it notes the need for the national law authorising such measures to be drafted with precision, and for regular review of censorship orders as to their nature and length. The Court notes the lack of such statutory provisions herein.",
