Referring to the far-reaching effects of disappearances on a society as a whole, he supported the proposal of the Presidential Council for Civil Society Institutions and Human Rights for creating an interdepartmental federal commission to determine the fate of persons who have gone missing during the entire period of counter-terrorism operations in the North Caucasus. The Commissioner further emphasised the importance of the systematic application in practice of rules against the wearing of masks or non-standard uniforms without badges as well as against the use of unmarked vehicles in the course of investigative activities. He also encouraged a wide spread dissemination of all reports of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment among all stakeholders and reiterated the principle that evidence obtained through ill-treatment or other unlawful means should be treated as inadmissible in criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 48 et seq. of the report).",

Despite these measures of a systemic, legislative and regulatory nature, the information gathered during the visit had led the Commissioner to conclude that the situation remained essentially unchanged in practice since his previous visit in September 2009. He emphasised the importance of effective investigations of possible violations by State actors of the right to life and the prohibition against torture and ill-treatment and called on the Russian leadership to deliver the unequivocal message that impunity would no longer be tolerated to help in creating the requisite determination on the part of the investigators concerned (see paragraphs 65 et seq. of the report).",

However,  saw a decrease in violence from the previous year. Government personnel, rebels and criminal elements continued also to engage in abductions in the North Caucasus. Officials and observers disagreed on the number of victims. Human rights groups believed the number of abductions was under-reported due to the reluctance of victims\u2019 relatives to complain to the authorities for fear of reprisals. According to a report on the website Caucasian Knot, during the year approximately fifty people were kidnapped or unlawfully detained by armed parties in the North Caucasus, and only sixteen were freed. Allegedly, there was no accountability for government forces involved in abductions. There were continued reports that abductions were followed by beatings or torture to extract confessions and that abductions were conducted for political reasons. Security forces under the command of Chechen President Kadyrov allegedly played a significant role in abductions, either on their own initiative or in joint operations with federal forces. Human rights groups reported these forces were frequently suspected of being responsible for disappearances and abductions, including those of family members of rebel commanders and fighters.",

Those most at risk belonged to the following groups: NGO and human rights activists; victims, their lawyers, witnesses and their families; journalists; government opponents and returnees from abroad and their relatives. The report noted that returnees from abroad were generally immediately detained, questioned about their stay abroad and sometimes tortured. The questioning did not necessarily stop after their release from detention. Returnees and their relatives had to expect arbitrary detention at any time.

It will do so by assessing the issue in the light of all material placed before it, or, if necessary, material obtained proprio motu (see H.L.R. v.

It is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 129). The mere possibility of ill-treatment on account of an unsettled situation in the receiving country does not in itself give rise to a breach of Article 3, and where the sources available to the Court describe a general situation, an applicant\u2019s specific allegations in a particular case require corroboration by other evidence (see again Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 131, with references to further settled case-law of the Court).",

The guiding principles in order to examine whether the measure was necessary in a democratic society have been established by the Court as follows (see Boultif, cited above, \u00a7 48, and \u00dcner, cited above, \u00a7 58): in assessing the relevant criteria in such a case, the Court will consider the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the applicant, the length of the applicant\u2019s stay in the country from which he is going to be expelled, the time elapsed since the offence was committed and the applicant\u2019s conduct during that period, the nationalities of the various persons concerned, the applicant\u2019s family situation, such as the length of the marriage, and other factors expressing the effectiveness of a couple\u2019s family life, whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time when he or she entered into a family relationship, whether there are children in the marriage and if so their age, and also the seriousness of the difficulties which the spouse is likely to encounter in the country of origin. Furthermore, the Court will examine the best interests and well-being of the children, in particular the seriousness of the difficulties which the children of the applicant are likely to encounter in the country to which the applicant is to be expelled, and the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the host country and with the country of destination.",

Some two years later, in March 2008, he was again convicted of partly attempted and partly actual aggravated bodily harm and sentenced to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment. The partial suspension and probation order in respect of his former conviction was itself suspended, and the applicant served both sentences. Earlier, in 2005, the applicant had also been convicted of attempted theft and sentenced to two weeks\u2019 imprisonment, suspended with probation. The Court thus acknowledges that the measure taken by the Austrian authorities was based on serious offences committed by the applicant. However, the Court also notes that the applicant was released from prison in August 2009 and went back to live with his family. In the approximately two and a half years since the applicant\u2019s release, no further criminal investigations have been initiated against him and there have been no further convictions.",
