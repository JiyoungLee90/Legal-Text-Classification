In doing so the statutory time-limits (see paragraph 21 above) were not always strictly observed. However, the protracted character of the proceedings resulted only partly from the failure of those authorities to give their decisions in due time. In the Court\u2019s view, the main cause of the delay was rather a deficiency in the procedural system allowing for repeated remittals mandated by incomplete findings of fact (see, mutatis mutandis, Wierciszewska v. Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7 46, 25 November 2003). Since an appeal and an action for failure to respond are neither designated for remedying that deficiency nor capable of doing so, the Court is unable to conclude that their use would, in the circumstances of the present case, increase the effectiveness of a constitutional complaint. As the constitutional complaint alone cannot be considered an effective remedy for the length of administrative proceedings (see paragraph 34 above), it follows that the applicant cannot be expected to have lodged such a complaint, and that the Government\u2019s objection must therefore be dismissed.",
