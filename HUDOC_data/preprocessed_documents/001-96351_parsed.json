They argued that the criminal proceedings had been particularly complex in view of the remoteness of the events (the murder took place in 1989), the large number of victims and defendants (seven and three respectively) and the large number of documents in the case file (twenty-nine volumes). The Government also asserted that the studying of the case documents by the defendants' legal counsel, including the applicant's lawyer, and repeated applications put forward by the defence in the course of the court's proceedings had somewhat impeded the examination of the case.",

The studying of the case documents had taken only twenty-one days out of the ten-month trial. The applications of the defence had been decided by the trial court very quickly.

Moreover, in the Court's view, the complexity of the case does not suffice, in itself, to account for the length of the proceedings and regard should be had to the other factors (see Golovkin v.
