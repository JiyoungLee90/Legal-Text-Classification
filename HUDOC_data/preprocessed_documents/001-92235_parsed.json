It was further noted that other members of the gang had not yet been arrested. There was therefore a serious risk of collusion and suppression of evidence.

Evidence given by certain witnesses, who were to remain anonymous pursuant to Article\u00a0164 (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1969, had unequivocally demonstrated that the applicant was a member of that gang. Hence, charges in respect of criminal offences punishable under Article\u00a0276 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Criminal Code had to be laid against him.",

Having regard to the evidence given by anonymous witness no.\u00a02, and in particular in the light of the statements given by other witnesses, including anonymous witnesses, and having also regard to various documents and the results of the inspection of a car, the court concluded that the charges against the applicant were justified.

However, as stated above, while this element is to be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 and may justify a longer period of detention than in a case concerning an individual offender, a member of an organised criminal gang is entitled to the protection against unreasonably lengthy detention afforded by this provision (see paragraphs 33, 35 and 38 above). As in other numerous similar detention cases, the authorities did not justify the applicant\u2019s continued detention by relevant and sufficient reasons (see paragraph 36 above). Moreover, as demonstrated by the ever increasing number of judgments in which the Court has found Poland to be in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of applicants involved in organised crime, the present case is by no means an isolated example of the imposition of unjustifiably lengthy detention but a confirmation of a practice found to be contrary to the Convention (see, among many other examples, Celejewski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, 4\u00a0May 2006; K\u0105kol v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a03994/03, 6\u00a0September 2007; Malikowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a015154/03, 16\u00a0October 2007). Consequently, the Court sees no reason to diverge from its findings made in Kauczor as to the existence of a structural problem and the need for the Polish State to adopt measures to remedy the situation (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-62 ).",
