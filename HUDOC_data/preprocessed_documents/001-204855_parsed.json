When they had been about five hundred metres from the \u201cChermenskiy Krug\u201d checkpoint, their taxi had been stopped by a traffic police officer. Several UAZ vehicles and a VAZ vehicle with other officers had also been at the side of the road. The officer had asked for their identity documents and then for Ms Yelkhoroyeva to get out. He had taken her to the VAZ car, where she had spoken with someone through the window, then another officer, in camouflage uniform and balaclava, had put her in that car and it had driven off. After that, the taxi driver had asked one of the remaining officers where Ms Yelkhoroyeva had been taken. He had been told to wait in the taxi for her at the checkpoint. After waiting at the checkpoint for about twenty minutes, Ms B. had taken another taxi and gone home to Ingushetia, whereas the taxi driver and Ms\u00a0L.E. had gone to North Ossetia to report the abduction to the police.",

Russia, no. 11059/12, 12 July 2016 and Alikhanovy v. Russia, no. 17054/06, 28 August 2018, and for the abduction of a woman by State agents at a checkpoint Dzhalilov v.

From the very beginning of the investigation the applicant and his relatives consistently alleged that Ms Yelkhoroyeva had been abducted at the checkpoint by State agents, most probably FSB\u00a0officers, and then taken to Magas, Ingushetia. However, the investigators took no steps to question the FSB officers from Magas or to take any steps to verify whether she could have been detained on those premises, as alleged by the applicants. Moreover, the eyewitnesses to the abduction, Ms\u00a0B. and Mr G., who provided important evidence, were not questioned until almost three and seven months after the abduction respectively (see paragraphs 20 and 26 above), and the officers who had manned the checkpoint located in the vicinity of the crime scene only eight months after the events in question (see paragraph 29 above). Such significant delays in taking basic steps to verify the witness statements show the investigators\u2019 inability to take timely and effective steps to solve the crime, which is confirmed by their superiors\u2019 criticisms pointing out those failures (see paragraph 34 above). The documents submitted also show that the investigators failed to provide the applicant with information on the progress of the investigation (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above).",
