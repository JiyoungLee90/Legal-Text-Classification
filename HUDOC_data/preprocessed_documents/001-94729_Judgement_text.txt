The case originated in an application (no. 17597/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by six Turkish nationals, Ms Zeynep Fırat, Mr Ahmet Fırat, Ms Hanım Fırat, Mr Ömer Fırat, Mr Osman Fırat and Ms Ayşe Özdemir (Fırat) (“the applicants”), on 28 April 2003.
The applicants were represented by Mr M. Birlik, a lawyer practising in Şanlıurfa. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 14 September 2007 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants were born in 1926, 1959, 1951, 1962, 1963 and 1966 respectively and live in Gaziantep.
In 1999 the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources expropriated five plots of land belonging to the applicants (plots nos. 501, 561, 562, 606 and 608) in the Aşağıçardak village in Nizip for the construction of the Birecik Dam.
Following the applicants' requests for increased compensation, the Nizip Civil Court of First Instance awarded them additional compensation plus interest at the statutory rate. The applicants appealed and the Court of Cassation upheld the judgments of the first instance court.
In November and December 2002 the administration made partial payments to the applicants in additional compensation. On 31 May 2007 the Ministry made further payments to discharge their outstanding debts. The details regarding the proceedings and payments are indicated in the table below:
