The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), \n\u00a7 12, 26 October 1984). The Court finds that this principle also applies in the present cases, having regard to the violation found. It therefore considers that the Government must secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the outstanding judgments which will also lead to the retroactive payment to the applicants of the differences in pension calculated according to the procedures set forth by the national legislation (see Mustea\u0163\u0103 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 42).",
