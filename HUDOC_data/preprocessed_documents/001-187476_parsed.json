In assessing whether or not there was a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d, the Court uses three criteria, commonly known as the \u201cEngel criteria\u201d. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Sergey Zolotukhin v Russia, [GC], no. 14939/03, \u00a7\u00a053, ECHR\u00a02009). The Court has in a number of cases reached the conclusion that fines for contempt of a court in the context of processing of cases before domestic courts did not amount a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d (see, for example, Ravnsborg v. Sweden, 23 March 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 30-36, Series A no.\u00a0283B; Putz v\u00a0Austria, 22 February 1996, \u00a7 33, Reports 1996I; Schreiber and Boetsch v.\u00a0France (dec.), no.\u00a058751/00, ECHR 2003XII; Toyaksi and Others v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a043569/08, 20 October 2010; Zugic v. Croatia, no. 3699/08, 31 May 2011, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063-71). The fact that a fine imposed is significant does not in itself imply that an offence can be qualified as a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d (see Brown v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), no. 38644/97, 24 November 1998). However, in a case where a short prison sentence was imposed for contempt of court, the Court has reached the conclusion that the offence amounted to a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2005XIII; Zaicevs v. Latvia, no. 65022/01, \u00a7\u00a7 31-36, 31 July 2007). Likewise, in a case where a substantial fine was imposed and the applicant risked imprisonment in default without a guarantee of a hearing, the Court also concluded that the offence amounted to a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d (see T. v. Austria, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a061-67). Turning to the present case, the Court notes that the Criminal Procedures Act sets out the rules on the imposition of fines and no maximum amount for court fines is stipulated in the Act. The Court also notes that the fines imposed were substantial. Furthermore, the Supreme Court concluded that the fine imposed on the applicants had amounted to a criminal penalty (see paragraph 27 above). This finding by the Supreme Court was not disputed between the parties, who agreed that the fines imposed amounted to a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d. Therefore, and in particular having regard to the first Engel criterion, the legal classification of the offence under national law, the Court sees no reason to disagree with the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the applicants\u2019 offence should be considered to have been based on a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d within the meaning of the criminal limb of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, which is therefore applicable in the present case.",

The Court considers that the same applies to the applicants\u2019 complaint based on Article\u00a06 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see paragraphs 43 and 46 above) as it, in substance, is also directed at the lack of fairness encompassed by their conviction in absentia by the District Court and the subsequent alleged failure by the Supreme Court to remedy the procedural flaws at first instance.

Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a019867/12, \u00a7\u00a083, 11 July 2017).",

The Court agrees and recalls that the trial commenced anew on 4 November 2013 after the appointment of new defence counsel by the trial judge, and by a judgment of 12\u00a0December 2013 the applicants were fined (see paragraph 16 above). It is undisputed, as also stated by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 28 above), that they were neither summoned to appear before the District Court nor made aware of the District Court\u2019s intention to impose fines on them on the basis of the CPA. Therefore, the Court will proceed with examining whether the appeal proceedings before the Supreme Court provided the applicants with a remedy in the form of a fresh factual and legal determination of the criminal charge against them in accordance with the general principle described above (see paragraphs 6162 above). Before proceeding with its examination, the Court finally considers it necessary to observe that in the judgment in De Cubber v Belgium (cited above, \u00a7 33), relied on by the applicants (see paragraph 41 above), the Court found that a fundamental defect involving the actual composition of the national court, a matter relating to the internal organisation of the judicial system, was such that the court of appeal was not in a position to cure such a defect in the proceedings on appeal. In contrast, the present case is limited to defects in the conduct of proceedings before the District Court and is thus not of such a nature as to call into question the Supreme Court\u2019s ability to remedy the defects on appeal, albeit subject to the requirements of the general principles in the Court\u2019s case-law described above (see paragraphs 61-63).",

In this regard the Court recalls its case-law to the effect that where the domestic courts are called upon to interpret a provision of criminal law to a particular set of facts for the first time, an interpretation of the scope of the offence which is consistent with the essence of the offence must, as a rule, be considered foreseeable (Jorgic v. Germany, no. 74613/01, \u00a7\u00a0109, ECHR\u00a02007-III).",

Although it would be the normal sequence of events that a defence counsel would be performing his or her function at the point in time when the fine would be imposed, the wording of the provision does not exclude the imposition of a fine on a defence counsel who has been replaced, resigned or been relieved of his or her duties. Hence, the Court does not consider that the interpretation given to the provision by the national courts contravened the very essence of the offence in question. Therefore, and taking account of the wording of the provision in question (Section\u00a0223 (1) (a) and (b) of the CPA), the Court does not find there to be adequate grounds to call into question the Supreme Court\u2019s finding that the provisions in question constituted an adequate legal basis for the imposition of the fines. It follows that the Court does not accept the applicants\u2019 claim that the provisions, as applied by the Supreme Court to the particular facts of the case which were elaborated in detail in the judgment of the court, lacked foreseeability within the meaning of Article 7 of the Convention. In this light, the lack of an explicit answer in the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment to the applicants\u2019 arguments based on the principle of legality in criminal cases does not suffice for the Court to come to a different conclusion.",

Moreover, the Court recalls its consistent case-law to the effect that Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see paragraph 89 above). It follows that the mere fact that a provision of domestic law does not stipulate the maximum amount which may be imposed in the form of a fine does not, as such, run counter to the requirements of Article 7 of the Convention. \u00a0Moreover, although it is undisputed that the fines imposed on the applicants were substantially higher than previously imposed fines under Section 223, the Court recalls that it is also clear from the observations of the parties, as described above, that the present case was the first of its kind and one in which the Supreme Court considered that the nature and gravity of the applicants\u2019 actions warranted the imposition of fines which were higher than imposed in other prior cases with different facts. Therefore, the Court finds that, in the light of the conclusions of the Supreme Court, the amount of the fines in question was consistent with the essence of the offence and could have been reasonably foreseen by the applicants.",

States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system, and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see, among other authorities, Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v.

It normally requires also that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at the international level should have been aired before those same courts, at least in substance, and in compliance with the formal requirements and timelimits laid down in domestic law (see, among other authorities, Azinas v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2004-III, and Nicklinson and\u00a0Lamb v. the United Kingdom\u00a0(dec.), nos.\u00a0 and , \u00a7\u00a089, 23\u00a0June 2015).",

In so far as there exists, at national level, a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, the argument of a violation of the Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used. If the complaint presented before the Court has not been put, either explicitly or in substance, to the national courts when it could have been raised in the exercise of a remedy available to the applicant, the national legal order has been denied the opportunity to address the Convention issue which the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies is intended to give it. It is not sufficient that the applicant may have exercised, unsuccessfully, another remedy which could have overturned the impugned measure on other grounds not connected with the complaint of violation of a Convention right. It is the Convention complaint which must have been aired at national level for there to have been exhaustion of \u201ceffective remedies\u201d. It would be contrary to the subsidiary character of the Convention machinery if an applicant, ignoring a possible Convention argument, could rely on some other ground before the national authorities for challenging an impugned measure, but then lodge an application before the Court on the basis of the Convention argument (see among others, Azinas, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Nicklinson and Lamb, cited above, \u00a7 90).",

Furthermore, according to the applicants\u2019 oral pleadings before the Supreme Court, they argued that the decision to impose fines according to domestic law was an ex proprio motu decision by the trial court deciding the case, without the case parties\u2019 involvement, which could not be quashed and referred back for a retrial (see paragraph 24 above). They further submitted that, according to the domestic provisions on the imposition of court fines and under Article 6 of the Convention, a retrial could not be legitimate (see paragraph\u00a024 above).",

As is directly stated in the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment, their claims on appeal were, as relevant here, limited to seeking primarily the annulment of the District Court\u2019s imposition of the court fines and, on a subsidiary basis, the reduction of the amount of the fines, were the Supreme Court to reject their primary claim. In other words, irrespective of whether the CPA provided the possibility for the Supreme Court to quash the District Court judgment as to the imposition of the court fines and order a retrial on that issue, the applicants did not claim on appeal that such a right derived independently from the Convention right to appeal in criminal cases. Therefore, as the case has been presented to the Court, it cannot be deduced from the judgment of the Supreme Court, or the accompanying documentation, that the applicants formulated their claims and grounds on appeal to the Supreme Court in such a way that they could be considered to have sufficiently invoked, in substance, their rights under Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention, which they raise now before the Court.",
