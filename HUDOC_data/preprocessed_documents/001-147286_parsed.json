Since the applicant had lodged her complaint on 30 April 2008, it would have been physically impossible to initiate proceedings on 1 May 2008 because of the large number of procedural steps that would have had to be taken (for example, a copy of the complaint would have had to be sent to the accused, the accused would have had to be informed about their rights, the applicant would have had to be informed about the time and the place of the hearing, and the accused and other persons would have had to be called to the hearing). The judge further noted that the police\u2019s decision not to initiate criminal proceedings was made on 21\u00a0January 2008, yet the applicant had waited for almost three months before lodging a request to initiate private prosecution proceedings. The decision had also explained that a refusal to initiate criminal proceedings did not preclude the applicant from lodging a civil claim in order to obtain compensation for the harm allegedly done. Finally it was remarked that the judge of the first-instance court had correctly held that the applicant had failed to specify which of the three paragraphs of section 130 of the Criminal Law formed the legal basis of her complaint. Under the Criminal Procedure Law, the judge of the first-instance court had a duty to establish whether the legal categorisation of the alleged crime was correct, since the accused had a right to know the exact content of the accusations against them.

Latvia, no. 17215/07, \u00a7 56, 2 July 2013). However, taking into account that it was the Liep\u0101ja police, which, having refused to initiate investigation concerning section 317 of the Criminal Law, explicitly informed the applicant of the possibility of pursuing a private prosecution in respect of the infliction of minor bodily injuries and the fact that private prosecution proceedings \u2013 had they been initiated \u2013 would have pursued essentially the same aims as criminal proceedings conducted by public prosecutors (that is to say, both procedures would have sought to determine the potential criminal liability of the two police officers), the Court is not persuaded that the applicant\u2019s attempt to institute private prosecution proceedings should be considered a misconceived application to a body or an institution which has no power or competence to offer effective redress for the applicant\u2019s complaints and thus held against the applicant (see Beiere v. Latvia, no. 30954/05, \u00a7\u00a038, 29 November 2011, with further references), which indeed would not interrupt the running of the six-month period. Therefore this period for the purposes of Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention is to be counted from the end of the applicant\u2019s attempt to institute private prosecution proceedings, that is, from 2\u00a0June 2008. The application was lodged with the Court on 1\u00a0December 2008 and the Government\u2019s objection as to the non-compliance with the six-month rule is therefore dismissed.",

In other words, when a remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Jasinskis v. Latvia, no.\u00a045744/08, \u00a7\u00a050, 21\u00a0December 2010). The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s \u201cessential grievance\u201d concerned the use of force against her. Her objective was to obtain a criminal investigation of the actions of the officers responsible and eventually to vindicate her rights. While achieving that objective might have been significantly more difficult in the course of privately prosecuted criminal proceedings which normally do not benefit from the extensive investigative powers of public prosecutors, the Court considers that the applicant cannot be put at a disadvantage for having chosen, in response to an explicit recommendation of the State police, to use an alternative remedy.",

The second objection offered by the applicant concerned the type of liability established by the Senate of the Supreme Court in the cases that the Government had submitted as examples. The cases in question had concerned strict liability due to using items causing increased risk (paaugstin\u0101tas b\u012bstam\u012bbas avots), more specifically firearms.

The Court has frequently held that its task is not to review the relevant legislation or practice in the abstract; it must as far as possible confine itself, without overlooking the general context, to examining the issues raised by the case before it (see The Holy Monasteries v\u00a0 Greece, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7\u00a055, Series A no. 301A).",

The Government furthermore submitted examples of domestic case-law in which comparable claims had been upheld by civil courts. The Court is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s attempts to distinguish the cases submitted by the Government from her situation. As the Government have correctly pointed out, the Senate of the Supreme Court has explicitly stated that a decision to discontinue criminal proceedings due to lack of corpus delicti exercises no prejudicial effect in civil proceedings. The applicant\u2019s argument that the cases invoked by the Government concerned strict liability of State officials is not accurate. One of the cases cited by the Government concerned the use of force by prison guards against a prisoner and did not concern strict liability. Hence the Court comes to the conclusion that the possibility of bringing civil proceedings against the Liep\u0101ja Municipal police and against individual police officers in order to obtain financial compensation for the alleged violation of Article\u00a03 existed in both theory and practice.
