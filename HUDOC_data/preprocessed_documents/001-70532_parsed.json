However, due to the inactivity of its court appointed members it was no\tt until March 2001 that the liquidation commission commenced to operate. The Government argues that the liquidation commission was a private-law body and thus the State cannot be held accountable for its actions or omissions.",

The State cannot absolve itself from responsibility ratione personae by delegating its obligations to private bodies or individuals (see, mutatis mutandis, Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25\u00a0March 1993, Series\u00a0A no. 247-C, p. 58, \u00a7 27). The undertakings given by a Contracting State under Article 1 of the Convention include, in addition to the duty to refrain from interfering with enjoyment of the rights and freedoms guaranteed, positive obligations to take appropriate steps to ensure respect for those rights and freedoms within its territory (see Z. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7\u00a073, ECHR\u00a02001V).",

It suffices to note that the body in question exercised certain State powers at least as regards the execution of court judgments. The Court notes in this respect that the fact that a State chooses a form of delegation in which some of its powers are exercised by another body cannot be decisive for the question of State responsibility ratione personae. In the Court\u2019s view, the exercise of State powers which affects Convention rights and freedoms raises an issue of State responsibility regardless of the form in which these powers happen to be exercised, be it for instance by a body whose activities are regulated by private law (see Wos v. Poland (dec.), no. 22860/02, ECHR 2005...).",

In the present case the domestic legislation, while formally putting the activity of the liquidation commission under the Court of Arbitration\u2019s supervision, provided no sanctions for its failure to act, depriving this safeguard of any practical value in the present case.",
