Therefore, the Court finds that his stay at the police station from 3.10 p.m. to 11.35\u00a0p.m. on 11\u00a0April 2005 amounted to a deprivation of liberty (compare Osypenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a04634/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-49, 9\u00a0November 2010).",

The fact that their arrests were not properly recorded is sufficient for the Court to hold that their detention on 20 June and 11 April 2005 respectively was contrary to the requirements implicit in Article 5 of the Convention for the proper recording of deprivations of liberty (see Venskut\u0117 v.

The domestic courts had taken into account that both applicants had been suspected of having committed serious crimes punishable by more than two years\u2019 imprisonment, had been unemployed and had had criminal records. As regards the first applicant, the Yelizovskiy District Court had noted in particular that he had been apprehended while driving a stolen car only three days after his release on parole following a conviction for a similar offence. As regards the second applicant, the Gus-Khrustalnyy Town Court had paid particular attention to the fact that he had been identified by the victim. The Government further indicated that the charges against both applicants had been brought within ten days of the detention orders being granted. Therefore, they had been remanded in custody in accordance with Articles 97, 99, 100 and 108 of the CCrP and Article\u00a05 of the Convention.",

As regards the second applicant, the domestic courts referred mainly to the fact that he had been identified by the victim and that not all of the perpetrators had yet been found. In both cases, the domestic courts also took into consideration that the applicants were unemployed and already had criminal records (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above).

The court clarified that that expression was meant to emphasise the particularity of a detained suspect\u2019s situation as opposed to that of an accused person, in the sense that a measure of restraint was to be automatically lifted if a suspect was not charged within the statutory tenday time-limit (see paragraph 21 above). The second applicant did not refer to any other case-law or example in which Article\u00a0100 of the CCrP had been applied differently. Reiterating that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among many other authorities, Gudelj v.

In the present case, the second applicant provided the Court with a copy of a contract for legal representation stipulating that a fee of EUR\u00a07,000 was to be paid to his three lawyers irrespective of the outcome of the proceedings before the Court.

Having regard to the documents submitted and the rates for the lawyers\u2019 work, the Court is satisfied that those rates are reasonable. However, the Court considers that a reduction should be applied to the amount claimed in respect of legal fees, on account of the fact that no violation was found in respect of one of the second applicant\u2019s complaints, and some other violations were acknowledged by the Government in a unilateral declaration accepted by the Court (see Vasiliy Vasilyev v.
