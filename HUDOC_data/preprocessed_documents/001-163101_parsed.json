Particular attention should be paid to individuals suffering from contagious diseases. No later than three days after the detainee\u2019s arrival at the detention facility, he or she should be given an in-depth medical examination, including an X-ray. During the in-depth examination a prison doctor should record the detainee\u2019s complaints, study his medical and personal history, log any injuries and recent tattoos, and schedule additional medical procedures if necessary.

The applicant therefore attempted to draw the authorities\u2019 attention to his state of health and the inappropriate, in his view, quality of the medical care he had been afforded in detention. This fact alone has on many occasions been sufficient for the Court to dismiss the Government\u2019s objection of non-exhaustion (see, for instance, Gurenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a041828/10, \u00a7\u00a078, 5\u00a0February 2013).",

Given the length of the treatment, its occasional interruptions and lack of clear signs of improvement in the applicant\u2019s condition for a significant period of time, there was a crucial necessity to perform the test. It was impossible to choose an appropriate treatment regimen for the applicant without testing him for drug resistance. The Court has already condemned delays in recommending and performing such a test in the initial stages of the diagnostic process (see Kushnir v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a042184/09, \u00a7\u00a0146, 11 December 2014; Makharadze and Sikharulidze v.
