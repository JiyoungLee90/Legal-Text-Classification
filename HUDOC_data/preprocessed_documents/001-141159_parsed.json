After finding a violation of the latter provision it rejected the Government\u2019s objection (\u00a7\u00a7 62 and 98-113).

For cell 2, containing five sleeping places, they stated that there were four to five prisoners held there. For cell 129, containing two sleeping places, they stated that the applicant was held there alone. As for cell 121, which contains six sleeping places, they stated that three prisoners were held there. The Court reiterates that the Government did not provide any official documents indicating the exact number of prisoners held in the cells in question during the applicant\u2019s detention. As already found in \u0160trucl and Others v. Slovenia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 21 to 32), Ljubljana prison was severely overcrowded, the official capacity being almost twice exceeded. Therefore, the Court finds it hard to accept that the beds placed in the respective cells were not always occupied, except for perhaps short periods, which, however, have not been identified by the Government (see \u0160trucl and Others v.

With regard to an applicant\u2019s Convention costs, the Court reiterates that it does not consider itself bound by domestic scales and practices, although it may derive some assistance from them (see, among many other authorities, Gaspari v. Slovenia, no. 21055/03, \u00a7 83, 21 July 2009, and Ba\u015fkaya and Ok\u00e7uo\u011flu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 23536/94 and\u00a024408/94, \u00a7 98, ECHR 1999-IV). In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and in particular the fact that the law firm representing the applicant has already been reimbursed in six other cases for preparation of submissions almost identical to the present ones (see Mandi\u0107 and Jovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 133-35, \u0160trucl and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 146-48 and Praznik, cited above \u00a7\u00a7 38-40), the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 500 to cover the costs of the proceedings before the Court.",
