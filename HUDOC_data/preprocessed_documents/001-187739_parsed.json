The investigators had identified and arrested eight alleged perpetrators. When questioned, all of them had denied the applicant\u2019s allegations. They had maintained their innocence in the applicant\u2019s presence. Neither the results of the genetic forensic examination nor the relevant mobile-telephone communications history had confirmed the applicant\u2019s allegations and the suspects had been released. In 2014, after the applicant had identified A.P. as another perpetrator, he had been questioned and had undergone a polygraph test, which had confirmed that A.P. had had sexual relations with the applicant. He had been charged with rape. However, once the genetic forensic expert examination had excluded the possibility of the sperm found on the wipe towels being A.P.\u2019s, the investigator had rightfully discontinued the criminal investigation against him. The Government furthermore pointed out that the applicant\u2019s behaviour had had an impact on the effectiveness of the investigation. She had only belatedly reported the alleged rape to the authorities. As a result, it had been impossible to find, collect and preserve traces of the crime. Nevertheless, the investigators had carried out a complete range of actions aimed at establishing the circumstances of the crime: they had (1)\u00a0commissioned a forensic medical examination to determine any possible traces of violence on the applicant\u2019s body; (2) inspected the crime scenes in the applicant\u2019s presence; (3) taken all necessary measures to collect physical evidence, (4) carried out other forensic examinations; (5) held a confrontation between the applicant and the alleged perpetrators; and (6)\u00a0obtained information concerning the history of mobile-telephone communications between the applicant and the alleged perpetrators. In the Government\u2019s opinion, there was nothing in the material contained in the case file to substantiate the applicant\u2019s allegation that the authorities had failed to comply with their positive obligations, as set out in Articles\u00a03 and\u00a08 of the Convention.",

In her opinion, the State had failed to discharge its positive obligation to investigate effectively her allegations of rape. Relying on her application form and the attachments thereto, the applicant pointed out the following omissions on the part of the investigators: (1) the authorities had failed to question T.Mus. (one of the alleged perpetrators), (2) they had not inspected all the mobile telephones of the alleged perpetrators; (3) they had not obtained the history of the mobile telephone communications between the applicant and the alleged perpetrators; (4) they had not examined the flash memory drives of the mobile telephones; (5) only eight out of the eleven alleged perpetrators had been arrested; (6) the investigators had collected information about the private life of the applicant\u2019s parents in order to discredit them; (7) they had not obtained or examined genetic material from all the alleged perpetrators; and (8) they had not identified or examined the cars that the alleged perpetrators had used. The investigation in her case had not been prompt. A fully-fledged criminal investigation had only been opened some five months after the authorities had been informed of the applicant\u2019s allegations. On numerous occasions the investigators\u2019 decisions to discontinue the investigation had been quashed by the courts after they had found that investigation to have been incomplete and perfunctory. However, no effort had been made by the investigators to comply with the courts\u2019 orders. As regards the video recording, the applicant considered the investigator\u2019s conclusion that she had performed oral sex voluntarily to be unsubstantiated and erroneous. She also pointed out that the authorities had ascribed paramount importance to the fact that the alleged perpetrators had denied her allegations and had considered that fact to constitute exculpatory evidence. The investigators had failed to attach any weight to her vulnerability, the applicant being a minor living in a community with certain cultural norms regarding the desired behaviour of women and girls. The applicant had been questioned by male investigators in the presence of male teachers. She had been forced to confront the alleged perpetrators. She had not been offered any trauma counselling or psychological assistance during the investigation or her questioning. The investigators had failed to employ a context-sensitive and gender-based approach. They had focused on the lack of physical injury rather than her lack of consent. The investigators had appeared to blame the applicant and to focus on her behaviour and that of her family.",

For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 77617/01, \u00a7\u00a0107 et seq., 26\u00a0January 2006, and Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, judgment of 28\u00a0October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 102 et seq.). In cases under Articles\u00a02 and\u00a03 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0133 et seq., ECHR 2000IV). Consideration has been given to the opening of investigations, delays in taking statements (see Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no.\u00a023531/94, \u00a7\u00a089, ECHR\u00a02000VI, and Tekin v. Turkey, 9\u00a0June 1998, \u00a7 67, Reports 1998IV) and the length of time taken for the initial investigation (see Indelicato v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a031143/96, \u00a7 37, 18 October 2001).",

Nevertheless, it appears from the material in the case file that the investigator\u2019s efforts during the initial inquiry, when time was of essence to secure the evidence effectively, were aimed at dismissing her case rather than establishing what had really happened. It appears that the initial inquiry lasted about a month. During that time the investigator questioned the applicant and some of the alleged perpetrators, examined the crime scenes and commissioned forensic examinations. Having examined the evidence collected, the investigator dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegations as unsubstantiated. In the next four months of the inquiry the investigator did nothing but repeatedly duplicate his original decision dismissing the applicant\u2019s complaint; each time the decision was quashed by the investigator\u2019s superior on account of the investigator\u2019s failure to complete the inquiry.",
