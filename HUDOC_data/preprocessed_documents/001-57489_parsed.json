The Government had already cited these various texts, in greater detail and together with other texts (Articles 269-276 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), in their observations of 9 July 1977 on the applications of Mr. Foti, Mr. Lentini and Mr. Cenerini; they had described these texts as being \"incitements\" to a rapid conclusion of judicial proceedings. In a supplementary memorial of March 1979, that is subsequent to the decision of 11 May 1978 on the admissibility of application no. 7913/77, and then at the hearings before the Commission on 12 December 1979, the Government claimed that Mr. Gulli, like Mr. Foti, Mr. Lentini and Mr. Cenerini (see paragraph 47 above), had applied to the Commission prematurely.",

It should be borne in mind that applicants are not always in a position to appreciate the legal scope of their grievances. The Commission did not of its own motion investigate the question of the length of the proceedings. Once the applicants had indicated the duration of the proceedings, the Commission was obliged to review its compatibility with the Convention. Had the Commission taken it upon itself to inquire into this matter of duration, it would have been carrying out an ex officio examination in excess of its jurisdiction, but, in the present circumstances, this cannot be said to have been the case.
