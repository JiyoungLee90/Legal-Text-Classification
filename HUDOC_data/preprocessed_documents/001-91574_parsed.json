Nevertheless, in cases where the cooperation with an expert proves necessary, it is the responsibility of the domestic courts to ensure that the proceedings are not excessively prolonged (see, among other authorities, Volkwein v. , no. 45181/99, \u00a7 39, 4 April 2002; and Martins Moreira v. Portugal, judgment of 26 October 1988, \u00a7 60, \nSeries A no. 143). In the instant case the Court observes that it took the  one month and three weeks to request the \nMedical Association to designate a new expert after the first expert had informed the court about his unavailability. Furthermore, the  waited some four months after the time-limit had elapsed for the submission of the (second) expert\u2019s report until it inquired of that expert as to the progress in his report. Instead of setting a short time-limit for the delivery of his report, it addressed further fruitless reminders to the expert until it set him a final time-limit of six weeks. Even after that time-limit elapsed on 10 June 2003 the  waited until 26 August 2003 until it finally discharged the second expert. As to the conduct of the proceedings regarding the third expert, the Court considers that a period of six months for the preparation of a report which necessitated no more than 28 working hours appears excessive in view of the particular circumstances of the instant case, notably the considerable time that had already elapsed before the third expert was commissioned. Under these circumstances the Court considers that the  failed to conduct the applicant\u2019s proceedings with the required diligence.",
