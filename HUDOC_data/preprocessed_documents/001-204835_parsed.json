The Constitutional Court held, in particular, that the requirement of foreseeability did not prevent the use of value or common terms, the meaning of which was understandable directly from the legal provision in question, from a combination of related legal provisions or through interpretation by the courts. When applying section 1 of the Suppression of Extremism Act, the courts had to take into account that the requisite element of that form of extremism was an explicit or implicit disrespect for the constitutional prohibition of incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord and of propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or their attitude to religion. To establish whether there was such disrespect, the courts had to take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, such as the form and content of the activity or information in question, its audience, purpose, social and political context and whether there was a real threat to public order arising from, among other things, calls to, or substantiation or justification of, unlawful infringements of constitutionally protected values. The Constitutional Court found that anti-extremism legislation did not permit restrictions to be imposed on the right to freedom of conscience, religion and speech on the sole ground that the activity or information did not conform to common views, established traditions and beliefs, or moral and religious preferences. Such restrictions would be contrary to the constitutional requirements of necessity, proportionality and fairness. The wording of section 1 of the Suppression of Extremism Act did not, therefore, allow for its unforeseeable interpretation or arbitrary application.",

This is reflected in the limitation by the recommendation 9 of the use of such measure to situations in which the hate speech concerned is intended or can reasonably be expected to incite acts of violence, intimidation, hostility or discrimination. There will, therefore, be a need to establish that there is plausible evidence either that such an intention exists or that there was an imminent likelihood of the acts concerned occurring. Moreover, where the use of hate speech involved the speeches or other conduct of individuals as opposed to more formal policy documents or pronouncements, there will also be a need to establish that these were imputable to party or organisation concerned and that they gave a clear picture as to the approach which it supported and advocated. This will most often be the case with the speeches and conduct of leading figures in a party or organisation.

However the current definition (\u201cstirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord\u201d) does not require violence as the reference to it has been removed. According to non-governmental reports, this has led in practice to severe anti extremism measures under the Extremism Law and/or the Criminal Code. The Venice Commission recalls that, as stated in its Report devoted to the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of religion, hate speech and incitement may not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR and justify criminal sanctions. The Commission notes that such a conduct is criminalized under Article\u00a0282 of the Russian Criminal Code and that, under Article 282.2, the use of violence or the threat of its use in committing this crime is an aggravating circumstance.",

While the applicants were not found guilty of any administrative or criminal offence under Russian law, their conduct was considered unlawful in a broader sense as potentially giving rise to what might be classified under Russian law as an \u201cextremist activity\u201d. The applicants were put on notice of that finding of unlawfulness and, as expressly indicated in the warnings, were required to act under the threat that a failure to do so could result in liability for an administrative offence (see also \u00a7\u00a7 54 and 55 of the Venice Commission\u2019s Opinion quoted in paragraph 46 above). In addition to the above \u201cinterference\u201d in relation to their previous conduct during the demonstration, the applicants were also confronted with a dilemma: either they complied with the warning and thus, in substance, refrained from further protests, or they refused to comply and faced prosecution (compare S.A.S. v. France, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0110).",

Turkey [GC], nos. 4149/04 and 41029/04, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2012 and cases cited therein). Article 34 of the Convention concerns not just the direct victim or victims of an alleged violation, but also any indirect victim to whom the violation would cause harm or who would have a valid and personal interest in seeing it brought to an end (see Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], nos.\u00a029381/09 and 32684/09, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2013 (extracts) and cases cited therein). As it happened, the second applicant was also the NCHR\u2019s chief officer. Her expressive conduct during the demonstration had laid the foundation for those documents to be issued. She then resigned from her post as chief officer of the NGO, in order to ensure compliance with the impugned order and to avoid the NGO\u2019s dissolution (see paragraph 31 above). Lastly, it is noted that under Russian law she also had the standing required to challenge those documents before the domestic courts. Thus, although the second applicant was not found personally liable or placed under a threat of any penalty, in the circumstances of the present case the caution and order procedures did amount to \u201cinterferences\u201d with her freedom of expression (compare with Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v.

In the present case the applicants\u2019 past conduct did not appear to have been classified as an \u201cextremist activity\u201d per se. Nor was it classified as a call to carry out such extremist activity. Instead, their conduct was considered as giving grounds for using the warning and caution procedures. In the absence of clear criteria, it appears to be difficult to distinguish between a criminal call to obstruct the activities of public authorities combined with (a threat of) violence, a slogan in the same vein, which might give rise to a warning, and a slogan that would not give rise to any liability under the antiextremism legislation. The resulting uncertainty adversely affected the foreseeability of the regulatory framework, while being conducive to creating a negative chilling effect on freedom of expression, and left too much discretion to the executive.",

Russia (nos. 57818/09 and 14 others, \u00a7 356, 7 February 2017), which also concerned the same type of judicial review procedure under Chapter 25 of the CCP. In particular, the Court made the following observations. The scope of the judicial review procedure was limited to examining the lawfulness of the impugned administrative act or measure. Under Chapter\u00a025 of the CCP, the sole relevant issue to be considered by the domestic courts was whether the contested act or measure was lawful. \u201cLawfulness\u201d was understood to refer to compliance with the rules that: (i)\u00a0the authority had to have the competence to make the contested decision or perform the contested act or omission; (ii) the relevant procedure laid down in law had to be complied with; and (iii) the contents of the decision, act or omission had to meet the requirements of law (ibid., \u00a7 280). The Supreme Court expressly stated that the courts had no competence to assess the reasonableness of the authorities\u2019 acts or decisions made within their discretionary powers. It followed that the courts were not required by law to examine the issue of \u201cnecessity in a democratic society\u201d, and in particular whether the contested decision answered a pressing social need and was proportionate to any legitimate aims pursued \u2013 principles which lie at the heart of the analysis of complaints relating to Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 356). The analysis of the judicial decisions made in the case of Lashmankin and Others showed that the courts had failed to recognise that the cases involved a conflict between the right to freedom of assembly and other legitimate interests and to perform a balancing exercise. The Court concluded that in practice Russian courts had not applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and had not applied the \u201cproportionality\u201d and \u201cnecessity in a democratic society\u201d tests (ibid., \u00a7 358).",

In this way, Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, is one particular aspect (see Nicolae Virgiliu T\u0103nase v. Romania [GC], no. 41720/13, \u00a7 192, 25 June 2019). The right of access to a court is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access, by its very nature, calls for regulation by the State, which enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in this regard. That being stated, those limitations must not restrict or reduce a person\u2019s access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired.\u00a0In addition, such limitations will not be compatible with Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 if they do not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (ibid.,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0195).",

The applicant distributed leaflets calling for a referendum on the purchase of fighter aircraft by the Austrian armed forces.

The applicants were prevented from carrying on distributing leaflets because they were disturbing the other citizens (and because a poster projecting above a rucksack was blocking the view of a number of spectators), not because of their ideas. During the event, \u201c[t]wo policemen informed the applicant and his friend that they were disturbing public order and instructed them to cease what could only be regarded as a demonstration.

The applicant, a lorry driver, was involved in a complete blockade of the motorway by heavy-goods vehicles in a \u201cgo-slow\u201d operation\u00a0in 2002. Seventeen motorists, including the applicant, took part in a traffic-slowing operation on a motorway, which involved driving along a predetermined route in a convoy, at slow speed, occupying several lanes, to slow down the traffic on the motorway. When three drivers at the front of the convoy, one of whom was the applicant, stopped their vehicles, completely blocking the road for other users, the police arrested them. The drivers concerned were summoned to appear in court for having obstructed the public highway by placing or attempting to place on it an object that obstructed vehicular traffic, or using or attempting to use any means to obstruct it \u2013 in the instant case by stopping their vehicles several times. The court acquitted the accused, but the public prosecutor appealed and the Court of Appeal set aside that judgment, found them guilty as charged and sentenced them each to a suspended term of three months\u2019 imprisonment together with a fine of 1,500 euros (EUR).

The interference had been \u201cprescribed by law\u201d and had pursued the legitimate aims of preventing disorder and protecting the rights and freedoms of others. As to whether it had been necessary in a democratic society, it was to be noted that no formal prior notice of the demonstration had been given as required by the relevant domestic law. However, the authorities had been aware of it and had also had the opportunity to take measures for the protection of safety and public order, for example by organising police protection and a police escort. So even if the demonstration had not been tolerated, at least it had not been prohibited. Moreover, the applicant had not been convicted of taking part in the demonstration as such, but for his particular conduct during the demonstration, namely blocking a motorway and thereby causing more of an obstruction than would normally be caused by exercising one\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly. It was indeed clear from the case file that while the demonstration was in progress, from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m., the traffic had been held up, but also that several total stoppages had been caused by drivers at the head of the convoy, including the applicant, stopping their vehicles. This complete blockage of the traffic had clearly gone beyond the mere inconvenience caused by any demonstration on the public highway. The police, whose task had been to protect safety and public order, had arrested the three demonstrators only in order to unblock the traffic, after the drivers had been warned several times not to stop their vehicles on the motorway and informed of the penalties they could incur. In that context and for several hours, the applicant had been able to exercise his right to freedom of peaceful assembly and the authorities had displayed the tolerance that should be shown towards such gatherings. The applicant\u2019s conviction and sentence had therefore not been disproportionate to the aims pursued.

The earlier Chamber judgment finished in a split vote, with four judges in favour of finding a violation of Article 11 and three judges dissenting. In April 2003 a group of farmers held a demonstration in front of the Seimas (the Lithuanian Parliament) building to protest about the situation in the agricultural sector with regard to a fall in wholesale prices for various agricultural products and the lack of subsidies for producing those products, demanding that the State take action. In principle, the farmers had a permit from Kalvarija municipality to hold a peaceful assembly in Kalvarija town. However, they blocked and demonstrated on streets not included in the permit and eventually drove tractors onto a major highway and stopped the traffic, entailing a number of consequences for citizens, other drivers and transporters of goods. The Supreme Court upheld the applicants\u2019 conviction for deliberately organising a riot with the aim of breaching public order, causing public violence or damaging property (see \u00a7\u00a033 of the Chamber judgment). The judgment stated that \u201cfor the Government, the interference had also been necessary for the prevention of disorder and for the protection of the rights of others, given that the applicants had been personally involved in committing unlawful actions during the demonstration\u201d (Chamber judgment, \u00a7 74). The four judges making up the majority applied a test of proportionality to the specific case, finding in favour of the farmers. They considered that the element of violence was clearly absent in the instant case (\u00a7\u00a082). According to this assessment, the penalty imposed on the five applicants was also a severe one. The applicants \u201chad to go through the ordeal of criminal proceedings, and, as a result of criminal conviction, were given a custodial sentence. Although the execution of the sentences was suspended for one year, the applicants were also ordered not to leave their places of residence for more than seven days without the authorities\u2019 prior approval, that restrictive measure having lasted for an entire year\u201d (\u00a7\u00a083).",

In the view of these judges, the law was completely foreseeable (\u00a7\u00a05).

It found that \u201cin sentencing the applicants for rioting, in relation to their behaviour from 21 to 23 May 2003 during the farmers\u2019 demonstrations, the Lithuanian authorities struck a fair balance between the legitimate aims of the \u2018prevention of disorder\u2019 and of the \u2018protection of the rights and freedoms of others\u2019 on the one hand, and the requirements of freedom of assembly on the other. They based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the facts and on reasons which were relevant\u00a0and sufficient. Thus, they did not overstep their margin of appreciation in relation to the subject matter\u201d (see \u00a7 182 of the Grand Chamber judgment). The Grand Chamber departed from the Chamber judgment and adopted a position more in line with the previous dissenting opinions. It considered that \u201cthe moving of the demonstrations from the authorised areas onto the highways was a clear violation of the condition stipulated in the permits\u201d (Grand Chamber judgment, \u00a7 165).\u00a0 In the Grand Chamber\u2019s view, the farmers\u2019 conduct could not attract the protection of Article 11 of the Convention. The Court found \u201cthat, even though the applicants had neither carried out acts of violence nor incited others to engage in such acts, the almost complete obstruction of three major highways in blatant disregard of police orders and of the needs and rights of the road users constituted conduct, which, even though less serious than recourse to physical violence, can be described as \u2018reprehensible\u2019\u201d (\u00a7 174).
