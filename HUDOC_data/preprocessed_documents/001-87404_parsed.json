France ((dec.), no.\u00a065831/01, ECHR 2003-IX). They pointed out that, where the right to freedom of expression had been relied on by applicants to justify the publication of texts that infringed the very spirit of the Convention and the essential values of democracy, the European Commission of Human Rights had had recourse to Article 17 of the Convention, either directly or indirectly, in rejecting their arguments and declaring their applications inadmissible (examples included J. Glimmerveen and J. Hagenbeek v. the Netherlands, nos. 8348/78 and 8406/78 (joined), Commission decision of 11 October 1979, Decisions and Reports (DR) 18, p. 187, and Pierre Marais v. France, no. 31159/96, Commission decision of 24 June 1996, DR\u00a086-A, p. 184.) In the Government\u2019s view, the Court subsequently confirmed that approach (see Lehideux and Isorni v. France, 23 September 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 47 and 53, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII). Moreover, they pointed out that, in a case concerning Article 11 (see W.P. and Others v. Poland (dec.), no. 42264/98, ECHR 2004-VII), the Court had observed that \u201cthe general purpose of Article 17 is to prevent totalitarian groups from exploiting in their own interests the principles enunciated by the Convention\u201d. Similar conclusions were reached in the cases of Norwood v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 23131/03, ECHR 2004-XI), and Witzsch v. Germany ((dec.), no. 7485/03, 13 December 2005).",
