What is the role of HR strategy? Do you have to employ HR professionals to create a HR strategy? Do you know how to link business objectives to HR strategy? We could say that this is a boring issue and these are boring questions, particularly at the beginning of the year, when every portal overwhelms us with articles like homework on this topic, in a partly false belief that creating such a strategy is connected to the beginning of the calendar year in every company. The subject is painfully topical, at the same time. This is only my opinion, not the result of a representative survey or international research carried out by British scientists. Simply, I think that some HR professionals should be taught as regards strategy that the connecting of business objectives and HR strategy is not clear in all organisations. (The reasons are various, but discussing them would use up my \u2018character limit\u2019 by itself, so I will not cover this issue.) We read often about problems regarding \u2018how HR could be a strategic partner\u2019. This approach is always surprising to me. It is rather like a \u2018learn Japanese in two weeks\u2019 course. Both learning Japanese and building strategic partnerships are the result of long-term processes. A responsible professional should not give the impression that one article or one blog entry, or concentrating for five minutes a day, is enough. The process itself cannot be done away with. A detailed knowledge of the organisational structure, the education system and recruiting policy is not enough. We have to be able to break away from the interests of our professional field if the interests of the organisation so require. We have to know the business, the market, our competitors, our service and our products. If someone complains that \u2018he is not taken seriously by the management\u2019, I always think about learning Japanese. None of this should be an aim in itself, but the result of hard professional work.. (I would point out that unfortunately we have met people whose cousins worked in a place where even this was unable to achieve the desired outcome.)\u201d",

The numbers indicate that in reality the only people who will benefit from this are those whose monthly earnings exceed HUF\u00a0300,000, excluding family allowances. This amount exceeds the current average income level by far. We can see in the enclosed table how net payments will change from 2011. The majority of companies plan to modify their remuneration policies and the level of wage increases, the latter being expected to fall in those jobs where tax change results in positive net income. The other thing that caused my thoughts to race is that tax is payable after rewards and bonuses, just as it is payable after salary. This may also mean that bonuses will gain in importance. Certainly, I have to say from a professional point of view that rewarding achievements by means other than fixed wages results in achievements and their fluctuation becoming more traceable. On the other hand, this trend runs counter to the professional efforts of recent years aimed at restricting the proportion of bonus payments and fixing remuneration systems in a more responsible manner.",

Accordingly, \u2018the employee may not exercise his or her right to freedom of expression by gravely infringing or jeopardising the employer\u2019s reputation and justified business and organisational interests\u2019. Furthermore, Article 103 \u00a7 3 of the former Labour Code, as well as Article\u00a08 \u00a7 4 of the current one, prohibits the publication of any information which the employee acquires through his or her employment and whose publication would have negative consequences for the employer or any third person. These general employment obligations may justify the restriction of employees\u2019 right to freedom of expression, even if it is exercised outside the workplace and working hours. ... Thus, in employment the right to freedom of expression may be subject to tighter restrictions and it does not protect material published by employees if the sole intention is to convey comments tarnishing their employer\u2019s dignity and business reputation or its market and commercial valuation, or to convey injurious comments concerning the employer\u2019s private or family life. The freedom does not extend to opinions that are published with the aim of destroying business or causing any other harm. Furthermore, an employee\u2019s opinions are not protected by the right to freedom of expression if their aim is to criticise, question or undermine the values and value-based policies of his or her employer. This also flows from the secrecy and duty of loyalty characterising employment relations, according to which the employee contributes effectively to the achievement of the employer\u2019s goals.

Having regard to the above, the Constitutional Court finds that the conduct complained of in the labour proceedings, the content of the website and the articles are mainly of a professional nature and do not disclose any public link which would enable the conduct to be characterised clearly as a discussion of matters of public interest. Therefore, the conduct complained of in the labour proceedings and the published articles are not protected by the right to freedom of expression enshrined in Article IX (1) of the Fundamental Law. Given that the conduct in question is not protected by the fundamental right to freedom of expression, its restriction is not to be assessed on the basis of the labour-law standards prohibiting the infringement of the employer\u2019s legitimate business interests.

It however also held that comments which lay within the applicant\u2019s sphere of employment in the civil service and which had been made pursuant to his official duties did not involve any statements or views in the context of a public debate and did not relate to freedom of expression (see Harabin v.

Germany, no. 28274/08, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 2011 (extracts), with further references). The responsibility of the authorities would be engaged if the facts complained of stemmed from a failure on their part to secure to the applicants the enjoyment of the right enshrined in Article 10 of the Convention. While the boundary between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under the Convention does not lend itself to precise definition, the applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar. In both contexts regard must be had in particular to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole, subject in any event to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State (see Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06 and 3 others, \u00a7\u00a7 60 and 62, ECHR 2011). The Court has also found that this margin of appreciation is essential in an area as fluctuating as that of commercial speech. It follows that, where commercial speech is concerned, the standards of scrutiny may be less severe (see, mutatis mutandis, Demuth v.\u00a0Switzerland, no. 38743/97, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, ECHR\u00a02002IX, and markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann v.\u00a0Germany, 20 November 1989, \u00a7\u00a033, Series A no. 165); and the margin of appreciation afforded to the national authorities is broad (see Ashby Donald and Others v.

The Court will therefore ascertain whether, in the present case, the Hungarian judicial authorities, in dismissing the applicant\u2019s claims, adequately secured his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 in the context of labour relations and balanced it against the employer\u2019s right to protection of its commercial interests.",

In other words, workplace-related free speech does not only protect comments that demonstrably contribute to a debate on a public matter. The Court cannot therefore agree with the finding of the Constitutional Court that comments made by an employee do not fall within the scope of protection of the right to freedom of expression on the grounds that they are of a professional nature and do not disclose any \u201cpublic link\u201d which would enable to clearly characterise them as part of a discussion on matters of public interest (see paragraph 19 above).",
