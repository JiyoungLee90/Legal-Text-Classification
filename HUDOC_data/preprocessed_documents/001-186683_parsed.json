The Court observes that the first-instance court\u2019s judgment does not contain any information as to the reasons why the applicants were found guilty of disseminating propaganda in support of the PKK. Besides, the first-instance court did not examine whether the text of the petition could be construed as encouraging violence, armed resistance or an uprising, or being capable of inciting to violence, which are essential elements to be taken into account. Hence, the Court considers that the reasons adduced by the national courts to justify the applicants\u2019 criminal conviction under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713 were not \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d for the purposes of Article 10 of the Convention.",
