The Senate would examine only those appeals on points of law which cited violations of the Criminal Law or fundamental violations of the Criminal Procedure Law (see paragraph 15 above). A judge rapporteur assessed whether an appeal on points of law complied with the above provisions and adopted a decision by a written resolution. This procedure initially derived from the Senate\u2019s jurisprudence, whereas from 1\u00a0July 2009 the procedure was codified in the Criminal Procedure Law (see paragraph 16 above).",

These complaints were duly examined by two court instances with full jurisdiction, and in its judgments the lower courts provided proper reasoning.
