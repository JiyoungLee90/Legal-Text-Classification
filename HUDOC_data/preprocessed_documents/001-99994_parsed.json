In Chapman (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94), the Court also observed that there could be said to be an emerging international consensus amongst the Contracting States of the Council of Europe, recognising the special needs of minorities and an obligation to protect their security, identity and lifestyle, not only for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of the minorities themselves, but also to preserve a cultural diversity of value to the whole community. Furthermore, discrimination on account of, inter alia, a person\u2019s ethnic origin is a form of racial discrimination. Racial discrimination is a particularly insidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy\u2019s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0145, ECHR 2005VII, and Timishev v. Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2005XII).

It is made clear in the conclusion to the book that it was an academic study which conducted a comparative analysis and focused on the history and socio-economic living conditions of the Roma people in . The Court observes that the author in fact referred to the biased portrayal of the Roma and gave examples of their stereotyped image. It is important to note that the passages referred to by the applicant were not the author\u2019s comments but examples of the perception of Roma people in Turkish society. However, the author sought to correct such prejudices and made it clear that the Roma people should be respected.

Admittedly there are differences between the two cases, but their common feature is that they both concern the question of prejudice against Roma people. In our view this is a particularly sensitive question as, in respect of a minority and highly vulnerable social group, prejudice is the breeding-ground of discrimination and exclusion.",

However, in our view there are still certain grey areas as regards the effect of this book. It was published by the Ministry of Culture which, according to the Government, was taking steps to promote Roma culture and tradition. With this in mind, we feel that the various passages from the book that have been identified by the applicant and that, in themselves, convey a series of highly discriminatory prejudices and stereotypes, should have given rise to serious explanation by the author, more forceful in tone than the work\u2019s concluding comments (see paragraph 19). Stereotypes are ready-made opinions that focus on peculiarities, and prejudices are preconceived ideas that lead to bias: they are dangerous because they reflect or even induce an implicit discrimination. In this connection, the fact that the author had not intended to insult or humiliate the Roma is not relevant. Lastly, it is difficult to accept that the offending passages, whose discriminatory nature is not in dispute, should not be regarded in isolation but in the context of the book as a whole. This contrasts with the Court\u2019s judgment in Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. , where it found that there had been no violation of Article 10 merely on the basis of three offending passages, without taking into account the general context of the novel in question.",

The fact that this dictionary was intended for pupils is of great significance in our view. Without denying that the entries in the dictionary are insulting and discriminatory against Gypsies, the Government argued that the words and expressions used were based on the historical and sociological reality and that there had been no intention to humiliate a particular ethnic group. The majority, for its part, found that there had been no discriminatory treatment on account of the fact that the terms were \u201cof a metaphorical nature\u201d. That explanation, in our opinion, certainly does not suffice to remove or lessen the seriously discriminatory character of the descriptions in question. On the contrary, recourse to such a form of rhetoric or figure of speech actually gives more weight to the prejudice. In a publication financed by the Ministry of Culture and intended for pupils, the national authorities had an obligation to take all measures to ensure respect for Roma identity and to avoid any stigmatisation.",

Thus, in its Resolution\u00a01740(2010) on the situation of Roma in Europe and relevant activities of the Council of Europe, adopted on 22 June 2010, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe urges all member States to \u201cpromote a positive image of diversity and address stereotypes and prejudices ... and develop policies and training programmes to combat anti-Roma prejudices\u00a0...\u201d. In its report of 26\u00a0February 2010 on the situation of Roma in Europe and relevant activities of the Council of Europe (doc. 12174), the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights recalls that the Roma \u201cconstitute the largest minority in Europe\u201d and that this minority, \u201ceven today, is still frequently rejected by the rest of the population because of deep-seated prejudices. Moreover, in these times of economic crisis, this highly vulnerable minority presents an easy target and is used as a scapegoat\u201d. In its Recommendation CM/Rec(2008)5 to member States on policies for Roma and/or Travellers in Europe, adopted on 20 February 2008, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe emphasises the role of the media and education in the persistence of anti-Roma prejudices and their potential to help overcome them.",
