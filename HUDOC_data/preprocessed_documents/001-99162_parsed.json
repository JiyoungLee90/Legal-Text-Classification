According to this new law, also known as the amnesty law, an accused who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more than ten years became entitled to conditional release after a reduction of ten years from his or her total sentence. The applicant was convicted under Articles\u00a0168 and 497 of the Criminal Code and sentenced to a total of twenty years' imprisonment, to which this partial amnesty would have applied. However, the applicant appealed. After his retrial, he was convicted under Article 146 of the Criminal Code, a provision which was excluded from the benefit of Law no. 4616. When the  delivered its new judgment on 24 January 2003, it noted that the acquired rights of the applicant had nevertheless been observed, as a lesser sentence had been imposed of sixteen years and eight months' imprisonment.",

However, as stated above, the domestic courts are in a better position to interpret domestic legislation, in particular laws relating to procedural matters, as in the present case. The Court takes note of the fact that the allegations of the applicant were thoroughly examined by the domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction and, in its judgment, the Istanbul State Security Court explicitly stated that the second judgment was more favourable to the applicant than the former, as he was finally sentenced to sixteen years and eight months' imprisonment instead of twenty years. Concerning the question of conditional release, the Court cannot substitute its own view for that of the domestic courts' findings in this specific case. \u00a0The Court finds that the applicant was able to submit his arguments\u00a0to the courts, which addressed those arguments in decisions which were duly reasoned and\u00a0disclose no elements of\u00a0arbitrariness (notably Puchol Oliver v.
