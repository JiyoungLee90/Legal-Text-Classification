According to the report, a special internal control team was formed, which identified all the police officers involved in the action. A total of 136 interviews were conducted, both with the police officers and with family members of some of the arrested persons, apparently including the father of the first applicant as well as the owner of the house in which the seventh applicant had been arrested. None of the two latter mentioned any force being used against the first and seventh applicants. The police officers involved denied all unlawful actions. The Special Prosecutor for Prevention of Organised Crime stated that none of the arrested persons had been tortured to her knowledge. The investigating judge stated that they had complained about torture and that their statements to that effect had been noted in the interrogation minutes. Medical reports issued in prison stated that the first, second and sixth applicants had no visible injuries, the fifth applicant had \u201cseveral scratches and suffusion\u201d and the seventh applicant \u201credness the size of 1 euro\u201d on his left shoulder. The report suggested that the injuries observed in respect of two other detainees arrested on the same occasion had been inflicted when these persons had confronted the police officers during the arrest, on which a special official record had been made. On the basis of such findings the Internal Control Division could not confirm that there were any grounds for establishing the involved officers\u2019 responsibility. However, it was decided that all the relevant documents should be submitted to the State Prosecutor for further consideration.",

In particular, it was established that in the period between mid-2004 and 9\u00a0September 2006 the first and second applicants, with two other co-accused, had met with some members of the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army (\u201cKLA\u201d) in the wider area of Podgorica, Kosovo, Albania and the USA, and created an association the aim of which was to undermine the constitutional order and security of Montenegro and create within Montenegro a territory with special status, inhabited by persons of Albanian ethnicity, contrary to the Montenegrin constitutional order. Subsequently, the third, sixth and seventh applicants had become members of this organisation. The fourth and fifth applicants were found guilty of illegal possession of weapons and explosives.",

The reasons why the search had been conducted without witnesses had to be noted in the search minutes (moraju se nazna\u010diti u zapisniku). One of the police officers who had conducted the search testified that it had been impossible to find two witnesses at the time as the search had been conducted early in the morning.

In this way, the court concluded, the seventh applicant had manifested his membership of the association and participation in its preparatory work. It was further found, on the basis of the same evidence, that on 1\u00a0September\u00a02006 the sixth and seventh applicants had been informed that the war in the relevant part of Montenegro should begin on 10\u00a0September\u00a02006, in which way the sixth applicant had manifested his membership of the association, as well as by accepting an invitation to go to the next meeting taking place in Skadar (Shkod\u00ebr, Albania). On 4\u00a0September 2006 several persons, including the sixth and seventh applicants, had met in Skadar and had agreed on how to carry out the planned acts. In particular, the seventh applicant had expressed his support, said he had been to Kosovo himself to explore the realisation of the plan (radi izvi\u0111anja mogu\u0107nosti realizacije plana), and wondered if their plans would affect Kosovo\u2019s independence. The meeting was concluded by another co-accused\u2019s statement that the Kosovo army would enter  \u201caround Saturday, that is on 9 September 2006, and [that] they want[ed] to do their job\u201d. The High Court concluded that the first applicant\u2019s defence during the pre-trial proceedings was in logical connection with the contents of his diary. This evidence was found to be further supported by a report on their border crossings, which data entirely coincided with the dates and times of border crossings mentioned in the first applicant\u2019s diary and his statement made at the police station. Lastly, both the statement and the diary were further supported by an official police report of 30 November 2006, which confirmed the existence of all the objects and places described in the diary.",

Consequently, States are exempted from answering for their acts before an international body until they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see, among many authorities, Akdivar and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV; and Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v.

The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 of the Convention requires that normal recourse should be had by an applicant only to remedies that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 66; Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2006II); it falls to the respondent State to establish that these various conditions are satisfied (see Selmouni v.

As there is nothing in the case file to suggest that the Supreme Court would have ruled any differently in respect of the sixth and seventh applicants, the Court considers that requiring them to use this remedy in such circumstances, would amount to excessive formalism and that therefore they did not have to exhaust this particular avenue of redress (see, mutatis mutandis, Laki\u0107evi\u0107 and Others v.
