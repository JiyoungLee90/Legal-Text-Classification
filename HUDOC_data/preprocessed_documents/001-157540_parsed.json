In particular, section III of the Regulation sets out the initial steps to be taken by medical personnel of a detention facility on the admission of a detainee. On arrival at a temporary detention facility, all detainees should be subjected to a preliminary medical examination before they are placed in a cell shared by other inmates. The aim of the examination is to identify individuals suffering from contagious diseases and those in need of urgent medical assistance. Particular attention should be paid to individuals suffering from contagious conditions. No later than three days after the detainee\u2019s arrival at the detention facility he or she should receive an indepth medical examination, including an X-ray. During the in-depth examination a prison doctor should register the detainee\u2019s complaints, study his medical and personal history, record any injuries and recent tattoos, and schedule additional medical procedures, if necessary.

They insisted that the first-stage osteoarthrosis of the knee and hip joints with which the applicant had been diagnosed could not cause unbearable pain. The pain was apparently due to the applicant\u2019s hepatitis C and prior drug addiction. His condition did not require placement in a specialised medical institution. All of the penal institutions in which the applicant had been detained had had the appropriate equipment and staff for the treatment of his diseases. During his detention, specialists from civil hospitals in the sphere of ophthalmology, cardiology and infectious diseases had been consulted on a number of occasions. At no point had the doctors detected any significant changes in his osteoarticular system inherent to polyarticular rheumatoid arthritis. The applicant\u2019s condition was currently satisfactory, and he was receiving the treatment prescribed to him in full. The Government concluded by stressing that the applicant had been provided with comprehensive medical care throughout his detention, in compliance with Article 3 of the Convention.",

With regard to his medical examination in 2010, he pointed out that the X-ray examination had not been followed up by other relevant tests, such as a rheumatoid-factor blood count, immunological examination and HLA blood test, susceptible to confirm or rule out Bechterew\u2019s disease. The applicant further claimed that he had not been seen by an orthopaedist or rheumatologist. Furthermore, when he had been diagnosed with diseases of the joints in December 2012, the doctors had failed to carry out X-ray examinations of his hips, ankles and elbows, despite his complaints of severe pain in those areas. In his opinion, the authorities had failed to take the necessary measures to ensure an accurate diagnosis at an early stage of the disease.",

It has found, in particular, that in deciding on a complaint concerning breaches of domestic regulations governing the provision of medical care to detainees, the prison authorities would not have a sufficiently independent standpoint to satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a035 of the Convention (see Koryak v. Russia, no. 24677/10, \u00a7\u00a079, 13\u00a0November 2012, and Dirdizov v. Russia, no. 41461/10, \u00a7\u00a075, 27\u00a0November 2012). The Court has also stressed that even though review by a supervising prosecutor played an important part in securing appropriate medical care in detention, a complaint to the supervising prosecutor fell short of the requirements of an effective remedy because of the procedural shortcomings that had been previously identified in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Koryak, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, cited above). Having assessed a civil claim for compensation under the tort provisions of the Civil Code, the Court considered that such a claim could not offer an applicant any redress other than a purely compensatory award and could not put an end to a situation where there was an ongoing violation, such as inadequate medical care (see Reshetnyak v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a056027/10, \u00a7\u00a7 65-73, 8\u00a0January 2013). Moreover, the Court found that such a remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, in particular because the award was conditional on the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities, which was extremely improbable in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed the application of a certain measure, for instance, certain conditions of detention or the level of medical treatment (see A.B. v. Russia, no. 1439/06, \u00a7\u00a096, 14\u00a0October 2010).",
