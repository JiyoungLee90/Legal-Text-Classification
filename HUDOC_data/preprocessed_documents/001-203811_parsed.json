They represent their electorate, draw attention to their preoccupations and defend their interests. Accordingly, interference with the freedom of expression of an opposition member of parliament, like the applicant, calls for the closest scrutiny (see Castells v.\u00a0Spain, 23\u00a0April 1992, \u00a7 42, Series A no.\u00a0236, and Jerusalem v. Austria, no.\u00a026958/95, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2001II).

His statement thus constituted a declaration of collective political responsibility rather than an accusation of specific criminal-law offences. As a form of political expression, it enjoyed a high level of protection under Article 10 of the Convention, since very strong reasons are required for justifying restrictions on political speech (see Morice v. France [GC], no.\u00a029369/10, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2015).

They failed to recognise that there was little scope under Article\u00a010 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention for restrictions on speech which, as the speech in the instant case, was political in nature. Nor did they attempt to perform a balancing exercise between the need to protect the plaintiff\u2019s reputation and the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression. Those failings call for the conclusion that the domestic courts did not \u201capply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010\u201d and failed to give relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the interference (see Terentyev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 25147/09, \u00a7 24, 26 January 2017).",

Turkey, no.\u00a035839/97, \u00a7\u00a059, 22 February 2005, and Gouveia Gomes Fernandes and Freitas e Costa v.\u00a0Portugal, no. 1529/08, \u00a7 54, 29\u00a0March 2011). An award of damages must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered (see Independent News and Media and Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited v. Ireland, no. 55120/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011013, ECHR\u00a02005V (extracts), and Tolstoy Miloslavsky v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, 13 July 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 48-51, Series A no.\u00a0316B). However, when making the pecuniary award against the applicant, the domestic courts failed to carry out a serious assessment of its proportionality in relation to the applicant\u2019s financial situation and resources (compare Kwiecie\u0144 v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a051744/99, \u00a7\u00a056, 9\u00a0January 2007). As to their justification for granting such a large amount in damages because the plaintiff was a politician and a well-known public figure, this position sits ill with the Conventioncompliant approach that prominent political figures, such as a member of parliament for the ruling party in the instant case, should be prepared to tolerate strongly worded criticism and may not claim the same level of protection as a private individual unknown to the public, especially when the statement did not concern their private life or intrude on their intimacy (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 40454/07, \u00a7\u00a7 84 and 123, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). In these circumstances, the Court finds that a high award of damages to Mr\u00a0Volodin did not pursue a \u201cpressing social need\u201d and was not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d (compare I\u00a0Avgi Publishing and Press Agency S.A. and Karis v.\u00a0Greece, no. 15909/06, \u00a7 35, 5 June 2008).",

The national courts, instead, made a literal interpretation of the statement of the applicant, who explicitly accused the plaintiff of six crimes. The Court has advised the domestic judges to close their eyes to what was actually said and to interpret the applicant\u2019s words in another way. Yes, it could have been a declaration of collective political responsibility, maybe at another time and in another place, but it is more important to consider how the public understood the statement.

The word \u201ccrime\u201d means one of the criminal-law offences and it cannot, in my view, be used as an exaggeration, a metaphor or a figurative, even virulent, expression of political responsibility. In turn, political responsibility means the public governance and/or consequences (not necessarily negative) of a government\u2019s public service. During the domestic proceedings the applicant emphasised that it had actually been a metaphor, and the judges did not accept that because of the concrete association with the word \u201ccrime\u201d. The applicant then explained that his speech (made at a meeting held to celebrate the anniversary of the Great October Revolution of 1917) had sought to publicly criticise the government for a violation of workers\u2019 rights resulting from an increase in prices, a drop in the quality of life and the unsatisfactory quality of the medical service. However, the applicant did not provide any evidence that the plaintiff (being a member of the federal parliament) had participated in any governmental decision. Instead, the applicant\u2019s lawyers believed that the burden to prove (that the plaintiff was not involved in anti-worker decisions) was shifted to the plaintiff. The explanation made by the applicant that his statement should be attributed to political responsibility, but not to crimes, was not accepted by the domestic court, which ordered the applicant to provide such explanation again to the public in order to refute his previous statement. The domestic court was mindful that the freedom of expression should be respected and it referred to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to the judgment in the case of Colombani and Others v.\u00a0France (no. 51279/99, 25 June 2002). The Court has instead concluded that such interpretation would be enough without additional explanation to the public; however, the public would still believe that the plaintiff was a criminal. Therefore, the interpretation made by the Court of the impugned statement has put the domestic courts in an uncomfortable position.",

These duties and responsibilities are liable to assume significance when there is a question of attacking the reputation of a named individual and infringing the \u201crights of others\u201d. Thus, \u201cspecial grounds are required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals\u201d. In the present case, the Court went beyond those limits saying that the form of political expression enjoyed a high level of protection under Article 10 of the Convention, since very strong reasons were required for justifying restrictions on political speech. In my view, the Court applied the general principles in the sense that the honour and dignity of a politician should be less protected than the honour and dignity of an ordinary person, and political expression enjoys a higher level of protection under Article 10.",

In the case of Morice (cited above, and see paragraph 16 of the judgment) the accusations made by the applicant had been based on his assessment of factual circumstances. In the case of Savva Terentyev v.\u00a0Russia (no. 10692/09, 28 August 2018) the applicant was convicted for inciting hatred and violence in respect of police officers; however, the Court explained that the applicant\u2019s comment was part of the debate, that it showed his emotional disapproval and rejection of what he saw as abuse of authority by the police. To the contrary, in the present case the applicant engaged in irresponsible hate speech against political opponents which was not based on any factual circumstances. That speech was presented by the Court as a discussion of the general political responsibility of the federal government. According to the judgment adopted by the majority, the plaintiff could be the subject of defamation and personal attack just because he is a politician and a member of the ruling party. Moreover, the plaintiff can hardly be said to be part of the government because in Russia the appointment of ministers is based on their management skills, rather than on their affiliation with the ruling party.",

In addition, I believe that such a form used by the applicant to criticise political opponents could be regarded as an action aimed at inciting hatred or enmity and it cannot be protected under Article 10. The Court\u2019s finding of a violation of Article 10 was based on the presumption that the domestic courts had failed to strike a balance between the need to protect the plaintiff\u2019s reputation and the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression. However, the Court cannot ignore the factual circumstances of the case which affect that balancing.

We are dealing with a case of defamation in civil law. Mr Volodin brought a civil suit against Mr Rashkin, the applicant, for defamation. What the plaintiff claimed in the civil courts was that Mr Rashkin had accused him of committing a crime. In my opinion, dissenting from the majority in the Chamber, the Russian domestic courts reached the right conclusion, in weighing up the conflicting rights, namely that the insult proffered by Mr Rashkin against Mr\u00a0Volodin was not covered by the protection of Article 10 of the Convention. In doing so, they applied the criteria of the Court\u2019s case-law. Now, the Court was called upon to scrutinise precisely the phrase related to this imputation of a crime. The applicant Mr Rashkin claimed that the Russian civil courts had not respected his freedom of expression and that the penalty he had received was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.",

The words were defamatory and insulting. They did not consist of any opinions which contributed to political pluralism or any criticism about ideas or different political approaches. They were expressed against a specific individual, calling him a criminal. Third, the potential to cause harm. They were directed at Mr Volodin and their impact was considerable, according to the Russian civil courts. The media covered that event and cited phrases from his speech.

He held a post of deputy in the Saratov City Council of People\u2019s Deputies of the Twenty-First Convocation for election constituency no. 176. Another important point is that the accusation against Mr\u00a0Volodin was not based on any real facts. The courts concluded that Mr\u00a0Rashkin had overstepped the limit of justified, rational and admissible political criticism by attributing to Mr\u00a0Volodin the commission of crimes. He had done so knowingly and with intent (even though, in the civil courts intent does not have to be proven). Weighing up the different factors, they stressed, inter alia, that the said insults were completely unnecessary for the sort of political criticism which could be justified in the context of political speech.

In the present case, we are talking about civil proceedings for defamation of a specific person, but I\u00a0wonder myself why the standards have to be different? Is it merely because the target is a person who is a politician? Moreover, what Mr\u00a0Rashkin was defending was to launch a new \u201cBolshevik Revolution\u201d. Even if this discourse is covered by political freedom \u2013 yet it was not the question brought to the Russian national civil courts and the Communist party is an official one \u2013 the Court has been criticised many times in academia for having two different standards of protection, one related to national-socialism and another related to the past soviet antidemocratic communist era. It is surprising that the Chamber has not taken into account any of the analysis of the context provided by the national judge Dmitry Dedov, who has better knowledge of the social and political context.",

I am prepared to admit that the quantum is high, but there have been similar cases in the Russian courts. A similar sanction was seen, for instance, in two Chamber cases against Portugal (even worse because they were criminal cases, with a prison sentence changed to a pecuniary sanction plus damages awarded to the victims; see Soares, cited above, and Almeida Leitao Bento Fernandes, cited above). Even in the latter case, the compensation to the persons harmed was of 53,000 euros. That was only for a novel with 100 copies. Moreover, although the situation was not related to politicians, I have cited these two cases in order to show that in many countries the quantum of civil liability related to defamation and the impugning of honour tends to be quite high.",

They were brilliant men, with pioneering minds and a clear view of the necessity of understanding between different political approaches, defending highquality political debate based upon a search for harmony and concord.
