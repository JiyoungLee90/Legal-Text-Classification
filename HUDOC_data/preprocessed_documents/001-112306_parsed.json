The honesty of his intention was also evident from the fact that he had provided the prison administration with a copy of his complaint. The Deputy Minister further noted that prisoners were entitled to make applications and complaints to public bodies and stressed that the disciplinary liability envisaged in the Enforcement of Sentences Act could not be used to restrict that right. Noting that the punishment of 29 January 2007 had been upheld by the court and had become final, the Deputy Minister considered that the applicant had understandably lost confidence in the administration of Belene Prison and that that risked jeopardising his reform, should he remain in that prison.",

Public servants, in particular, may need protection from offensive, abusive and defamatory attacks which are calculated to affect them in the performance of their duties and to damage public confidence in them and the office they hold (see Janowski v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no. 25716/94, \u00a7 33, ECHR 1999I, Bezymyannyy v.

In the context of prison discipline, however, regard must be had to the particular vulnerability of persons in custody and therefore the authorities must provide particularly solid justification when punishing prisoners for having made allegedly false accusations against the penitentiary authorities (see Yankov, cited above, \u00a7 134). In exercising its supervision, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts. In doing so, the Court must assess the interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the remarks held against the applicant and the context in which he made them. It must determine whether the interference in issue was \u201cproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued\u201d and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d (see, among many other authorities, Janowski v. Poland [GC], cited above, \u00a7 30, and Raichinov v. Bulgaria, no. 47579/99, \u00a7 47, 20 April 2006).",

They were made in a letter to the public prosecutor, who is competent to supervise penitentiary institutions and deal with such disputes. The Court notes that the applicant first tried to obtain information about the parcel from the prison administration but was told that no such parcel had arrived (see paragraph\u00a018 above). He then decided to write to the public prosecutor and ask him to investigate the matter. Thus, it appears that the applicant acted in the belief that the information disclosed in his letter was true. There is nothing to suggest that he did not act within the framework established by law for making such complaints or that he had other intentions than to have the alleged unlawful conduct of the prison authorities examined. The fact that he showed his letter to the prison officials also supports the finding that he acted in good faith (see paragraph 20 above). The Court is therefore not convinced that the interference at issue corresponded to any \u201cpressing social need\u201d (see Zakharov v. Russia, no. 14881/03, \u00a7 26, 5 October 2006).",

The Court considers that this fact is of crucial importance to its assessment of the proportionality of the interference. In his decision of 16 March 2007 the Deputy Minister of Justice stressed that the disciplinary liability of prisoners should not be used to restrict their right to petitions and complaints and considered that, by punishing the applicant, the authorities of Belene Prison had betrayed his confidence and jeopardised his correction (see paragraph 25 above). The Court subscribes to this view of the domestic authorities, which is also in line with the Recommendation of 11 January 2006 (Rec(2006)2) on the European Prison Rules (see paragraph 33 above). It considers that punishment for non-abusive complaints filed by prisoners could have a serious chilling effect and discourage them from reporting irregularities in prison.",

Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, 21\u00a0January 1999). It considers that the domestic court was entitled to rely on the assessment made by the director of the prison, which it found to have been reasoned, based on all relevant evidence and corroborated by the written statements of witnesses available in the file. It further notes that the applicant was heard by the domestic court and was able to submit, and indeed submitted, the arguments he considered relevant to the case (compare and contrast, G\u00fclmez, cited above, \u00a7 37). In the circumstances, the Court finds that the domestic court\u2019s failure to adjourn the hearing in order to obtain the testimony of Mr S. and to summon Mr K. did not affect the fairness of the trial. In particular, the applicant did not object to the continuation of the hearing without the testimony of Mr S. and did not substantiate the points on which he wished to have Mr K. heard.",

The outcome of the two sets of disciplinary proceedings turned on the simple question whether the applicant was responsible for two violent conflicts with his fellow inmate. The cases did not therefore present special features calling for the provision of legal assistance (see, mutatis mutandis, McVicar v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a046311/99, \u00a7 55, 7 May 2002, and, conversely, Airey v.
