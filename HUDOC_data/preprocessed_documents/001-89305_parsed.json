This was not so in the present case. Moreover, the total number and duration of postponements in Ciricosta were so extensive as to affect the duration of the proceedings seriously, while the Government submitted evidence of only several such postponements in the present case and these were not capable of affecting the overall length of the proceedings.

It is plain from the wording of Article 191 that no separate court action was required, and the applicant complained to various authorities, including courts, about the delays in enforcing the judgment and also submitted that there had been no need to accept the fourth court action for examination since the issue had already been decided by a final court judgment. This gave sufficient opportunities to the courts to take measures designed to speed up the proceedings, but they failed to do so. It follows that, despite the existence of legal provisions allowing the courts to take action, nothing was done in the applicant\u2019s case and he did not have at his disposal any means of accelerating the proceedings.
