Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, p. 1211, \u00a7 69, and Aksoy, cited above, p.\u00a02276, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).",

He submitted that besides the statement of his co-defendant the allegations of ill-treatment were supported by his detailed account of events set forth in his complaint to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which was dated 2 November 2001 and, on the same day, in the presence of the applicant\u2019s lawyer, handed to the investigator. Besides, the applicant\u2019s allegations were reflected in the trial record and in the grounds for his appeal against conviction. The applicant explained that the statement of Mr T. had been obtained as late as January 2003, because prior to then he had had no chance to ask his co-defendant for a description of the events in question. The applicant further argued that the Government\u2019s position was not supported by any evidence that would date back to the relevant time. In addition, certain potential evidence, such as the outpatient records of the detention facility where the applicant had been detained, had been destroyed shortly after the communication of the applicant\u2019s complaint to the Government (see paragraph 20 above).",
