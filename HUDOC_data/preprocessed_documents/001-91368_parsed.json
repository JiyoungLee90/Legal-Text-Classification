It found, in particular, that the materials relating to the applicant\u2019s first interrogation, in which he had confessed to the murder, were inadmissible as evidence, as he had been questioned as a witness in the absence of a lawyer, whose presence was obligatory in view of the gravity of the alleged offence. Furthermore, the court referred to the failure of the investigation to establish the facts concerning the drafting of the applicant\u2019s confession and the other circumstances of his arrest and initial interrogation, including the date. It noted, in particular, that the investigator had alleged that he had been unaware of the applicant\u2019s detention on 8 May 1999. According to him, the applicant had confessed on 10 May 1999. At the same time, several police officers had submitted that the investigative and prosecuting authorities had been fully aware of the applicant\u2019s arrest on 8 May 1999. The court also noted that the expert who had carried out the applicant\u2019s medical assessment had not made any findings concerning certain of his injuries, including the wrist injury and two abscesses that had been noted in various medical records. Moreover, the assessment had not been carried out by a panel of experts as required, but by a single expert.",

The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Labita v.

The Court further notes certain discrepancies between various records concerning the gravity of his injuries. It observes, however, that the results of the medical assessment of 24\u00a0December 2004 have remained undisputed at the domestic level and the Government have not put forward any arguments that would undermine their validity. In these circumstances, the Court finds it reasonable to base its analysis on the results of that assessment, according to which the applicant sustained several injuries cumulatively characterised as being of \u201cintermediate\u201d gravity.

Moreover, that account only explains the haematoma, while the circumstances in which the other injuries were sustained have not been clearly established after some nine years of inquiries. In particular, as noted in the Kyiv City Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 6\u00a0November\u00a02003, the investigation has not established clearly whether the applicant was first interrogated on 8\u00a0or\u00a010\u00a0May 1999, why he was not transferred to the IVS immediately after the decision on his detention, in what conditions he was held before his transfer to the IVS and whether he was provided with appropriate medical assistance during that period.",
