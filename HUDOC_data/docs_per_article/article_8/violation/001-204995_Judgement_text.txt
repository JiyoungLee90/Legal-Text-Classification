The applicant complained about the lack of any genuine prospect of his release and about the restrictions on his right to receive visits in prison from 2000 to 2014.
The applicant was born in 1980 and is serving a life sentence in Vinnytsya Prison no. 1. He had been granted legal aid and was represented by Ms Ganna Ovdiyenko, a lawyer practising in Kharkiv.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr Ivan Lishchyna.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 14 December 1999 the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court found the applicant guilty of several counts of aggravated murder and theft and sentenced him to the death penalty.
On 30 May 2000 the Supreme Court replaced the death penalty with life imprisonment and upheld the verdict in the remaining part.
During the period from 2000 to 2014, the applicant had ten short-term visits (lasting from one to four hours) from his mother, his sister and, on three occasions, a friend. During the meetings the applicant communicated with the visitors via a glass partition. Their conversations were listened to by a prison officer.
Legal provisions pertaining to life imprisonment and presidential clemency can be found in Petukhov v. Ukraine (no. 2) (no. 41216/13, §§ 7590, 12 March 2019).
Under the Correctional Labour Code of 1970 (repealed with effect from 1 January 2004), life prisoners had the right to one short-term visit every six months, conducted in the presence of a staff member of the prison (Article 39).
The Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences of 11 July 2003, which entered into force on 1 January 2004 and replaced the abovementioned Correctional Labour Code, kept that rule unchanged until 16 February 2010, when convicted prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment became entitled to one short-term visit every three months (Article 151).
A further summary of the legal provisions on visiting entitlement in prison applicable in Ukraine starting from 2003, and their evolution, can be found in Trosin v. Ukraine (no. 39758/05, §§ 26 and 29, 23 February 2012), and Bigun v. Ukraine ([Committee], no. 30315/10, §§ 15-19, 21 March 2019).
References to relevant texts of the Council of Europe and other international legal texts, as well as relevant excerpts from reports on life imprisonment by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), can be found in Petukhov (cited above, §§ 105-07).
The Council of Europe material pertaining to family visits to prisoners is quoted in Khoroshenko v. Russia ([GC], no. 41418/04, §§ 5867, ECHR 2015), while excerpts from relevant CPT reports are quoted in Bigun (cited above, § 22).
