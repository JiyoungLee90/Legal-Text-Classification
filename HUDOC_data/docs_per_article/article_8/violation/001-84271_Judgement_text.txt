The case originated in an application (no. 36161/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Janusz Jantar Jakubiak (“the applicant”), on 19 September 2005.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 15 February 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Łowicz.
The applicant was charged with armed robbery and, on an unspecified date, remanded in custody.
On 10 November 2005 the Rawa Mazowiecka District Court sentenced the applicant to eight years and six months’ imprisonment.
The applicant lodged an appeal.
On 5 May 2006 the Łódź  upheld the first-instance judgment and dismissed the appeal as manifestly ill-founded.
The applicant did not lodge a cassation appeal.
On 30 September 2005 the Court received a letter from the applicant. The envelope bore the stamp “Censored on 19 September 2005” (Ocenzurowano dnia 19.09.2005), an illegible signature and the stamp of the Rawa Mazowiecka District Court (Sąd Rejonowy Rawa Mazowiecka). The envelope was sealed with adhesive tape. The letter of 11 September 2005 which was in the envelope likewise bore the stamp: “Censored on 19 September 2005” and an illegible signature.
The relevant domestic law concerning the censorship of prisoners’ correspondence is set out in the Court’s judgment in the case of Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, §§ 33-39, 4 May 2006.
