The case concerns an Iranian transgender refugee whose application to have his name and sex marker officially changed was rejected because he did not have a Hungarian birth certificate. The applicant relied on Article 8 of the Convention.
The applicant was born in 1987 and lives in Budapest. The applicant was represented by Mr Cs. Tordai, a lawyer practising in Budapest.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr Z. Tallódi, Ministry of Justice.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The applicant was born female in Iran but, according to the applicant, identified as male from an early age. On 29 January 2018 he submitted to the Court the English translation of a medical opinion issued on 8 September 2013 by two Iranian medical experts which confirmed that he suffered from sexual dysfunction and a personality disorder.
In July 2015 the applicant applied for asylum in Hungary, maintaining that while he had been born female, he had always identified as male, a fact which had manifested itself through his wearing men’s clothes, working as a kickboxing trainer and being attracted to women.
On 14 December 2015 the asylum authority, considering that the applicant had been subjected to persecution in Iran due to his gender identity (transsexuality), recognised the applicant as a refugee.
On 6 March 2016 the applicant applied for a gender and name change to the Hungarian Immigration and Citizenship Office (“the Office”). He submitted that the official documents issued to him in Iran identified him as female, but that this did not match his real gender identity.
In its letter of 30 March 2016, the Office informed the applicant that gender reassignment was in principle registered by the Office of the Registrar of Births/Marriages/Deaths with jurisdiction over the petitioner’s place of birth, and that this was dependent upon the opinion of the Ministry of Human Resources. The birth data of refugees, however, continued to be registered by the relevant foreign authorities.
On 6 July 2016 the Office issued a formal rejection decision without examining the application on the merits, holding that it did not have jurisdiction to take any further action. Because the applicant’s birth had not been registered in Hungary, the application could not be forwarded to the relevant registrar. The applicant sought judicial review.
On 25 November 2016 the Budapest Administrative and Labour Court dismissed the case, upholding the conclusion of the Office as to the Hungarian administrative authorities’ lack of jurisdiction. It reiterated that the authorities processed Hungarian citizens’ applications for legal gender recognition according to the procedure developed in practice (see paragraph 14 below). It also emphasised that no formal decision on gender reassignment was delivered; the registration of the gender change in the birth register itself served as the decision. As a non-Hungarian citizen enjoying refugee status in Hungary, the applicant did not have a family register record in Hungary, so the practice followed in respect of Hungarian citizens could not be applied to his case. The court also referred to the fact that the applicant had failed to attach to his application the medical documentation required according to the otherwise applicable practice, in the absence of which recognition of the gender change was not possible.
On 17 February 2017 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Budapest Administrative and Labour Court’s decision, arguing, inter alia, that the register of personal data and residence addresses included data on name and gender and that the requested change could be registered therein. On 13 June 2017 the Constitutional Court declared his complaint admissible.
On 19 June 2018 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s constitutional complaint, holding that the adjudicating judge could not have decided differently within the existing legal framework since no statutory basis for changing the names of non-Hungarian citizens existed. The Constitutional Court held that the right to change one’s name was a fundamental one. This was even more the case when it came to changing name after gender reassignment, because of the inviolability of human identity and human dignity. Changing name following a change of gender fell within the ambit of the right to a name. In fact, changing name went hand in hand with changing gender, in so far as everyone was entitled to have a name that was aligned with his or her gender. The State was therefore obliged to adopt regulations that acknowledged gender reassignment and provided a discrimination-free opportunity to enter the resulting name change into the register. The complete lack of regulations excluded lawfully settled non-Hungarian citizens from the name-changing procedure, including those whose country of origin did not allow for such a procedure. The Constitutional Court considered that the legislative omission identified was disproportionately restrictive and unconstitutional. In its view, the legislator was under the obligation to find a different solution for petitioners without Hungarian birth certificates, for example by entering the change of name in other documents received from the Hungarian authorities. The Constitutional Court called upon Parliament to meet its legislative duty by 31 December 2018 and invited the applicant to resubmit his request.
The legislative change requested by the Constitutional Court has not yet been carried out.
At the material time, although Hungary did not have specific legislation on legal gender recognition, it was possible to change one’s documents on the basis of an informal practice. Applicants for legal gender recognition had to submit a medical expert opinion diagnosing transsexuality, recommending gender reassignment surgery – which was not in itself a prerequisite for the recognition – and excluding contraindications, together with an expert opinion of a clinical psychologist. The legal gender change was recognised in the registrar’s procedure (see paragraph 15 below) on the basis of an expert opinion issued by the Department for Healthcare and Public Health of the Ministry of Human Resources and notified to the civil registry.
Section 69/B(1) of Act no. I of 2010 on the registrar’s procedure provides that the register of personal identification data in the electronic family register contains, inter alia, the data subject’s surname and forename at birth and the subject’s gender, as well as any modification of these data.
Section 27 of the Decree of the Public Administration and Justice Minister no. 32/2014 (V. 19.) on detailed rules for performing the registrar’s duties, which was adopted on 19 May 2014, provides:
“The Central Office of the Registrar shall promptly notify the registrar keeping the register of births of the change of name in connection with gender reassignment in order to make the change in the birth register. The registering registrar shall enter the gender reassignment on the basis of the notification made by the Central Office of the Registrar.”
As of 1 January 2017 this provision was amended as follows:
“Within eight days upon receipt of the healthcare expert opinion supporting gender reassignment, the gender reassignment and the change of the forename made necessary by the foregoing shall be notified by the registry responsible for the change of name to the registrar keeping the register of births, for the purpose of entering them in the register. The registrar keeping the register of births shall enter the gender reassignment in the family register on the basis of the notification made by the registry responsible for the change of name, as the basic document, and the certified photocopy of the healthcare expert opinion.”
Government Decree no. 429/2017 (XII. 20.) on the detailed rules for performing the registrar’s duties, which was adopted on 20 December 2017, includes the same provision in its section 7.
