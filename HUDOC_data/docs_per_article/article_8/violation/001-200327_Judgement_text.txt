The case originated in an application (no. 3368/18) against the Republic of North Macedonia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Macedonian/citizen of the Republic of North Macedonia, Ms Valbone Oluri (“the applicant”), on 9 January 2018.
The applicant was represented by Mr N. Istochki, a lawyer practising in Resen. The Government of North Macedonia (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms D. Djonova.
On 11 October 2018 the Government were given notice of the application.
The applicant was born in 1988 and lives in Resen.
In December 2013 she entered into a non-marital partnership (вонбрачна заедница) with E. and moved into his house in the village of Zh. On 11 December 2014 she gave birth to a girl, A. (“the child”).
In March 2015 their cohabitation ended and the applicant moved back in with her parents in Resen, while A. stayed with her father and his parents.
Following a request by the applicant and after commissioning an expert report, on 20 July 2015 the Inter-Municipal Social Welfare Centre in P. (“the Centre”) granted custody of the child to the applicant, while E. was granted contact rights (“the 2015 decision”). The decision became final and enforceable on 8 August 2015.
On 4 September 2015 the applicant asked the Centre to enforce its decision.
On 10 September 2015 E. was summoned to the Centre, where he promised to make arrangements to hand over the child to the applicant. On 16 September 2015 he again attended the Centre and stated that he had no intention of handing over the child. He was sent a warning by the Centre the following day.
On 29 September 2015 and 8 November 2016 agents from the Centre visited E.’s home. On 18 November 2016 the applicant again requested that the Centre enforce the 2015 decision.
In a response dated 24 November 2016 the Centre informed the applicant that work on her case was ongoing and that they had initiated several sets of proceedings against E. The delays were attributable to the fact that she and E. were living in different municipalities, which meant that the Centre had to work in cooperation with the Social Welfare Centre in Resen. Lastly, the Centre stated that it was not entitled to enforce its decisions, since enforcement fell within the competence of the Ministry of Justice (Министерство за правда).
In response to two earlier requests by the applicant, on 17 February 2017 the Ministry of Justice informed her that the Centre was responsible for enforcing the 2015 decision.
On 10 March and 11 April 2017 the Centre ordered that E. be supervised in the exercise of his parental rights, and that he surrender the child to the applicant pursuant to the 2015 decision.
On 19 April 2017 agents from the Centre, in the presence of the applicant and assisted by the police, visited E.’s house with the aim of retrieving the child. E. refused to hand her over and later claimed that she had been ill that day. Another visit which took place on 10 May, without police presence, also proved fruitless.
Following a request by the applicant, on 13 July 2017 the Secretary General (Генерален секретар на Влада) informed her that it was the Centre’s duty to enforce its decisions.
On 18 July 2017 the applicant wrote to the Centre again, seeking enforcement of the 2015 decision. The Centre sent another warning to E.
Another unsuccessful visit by the Centre’s agents to E.’s house took place on 9 November 2017.
In the period 12 January to 9 May 2018 four meetings between the applicant and the child took place, some of them at the Centre. E. took and collected the child on every occasion. The meetings were subsequently discontinued at the request of the applicant (see paragraph 23 below).
Meanwhile, by a judgment of 8 November 2016 E. was convicted on two counts of child abduction (одземање на малолетник), following criminal complaints lodged by the applicant and the Centre. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, suspended on condition that he return the child to the applicant within two months. The judgment became final on 14 December 2016. On 2 March 2017 the applicant requested that the court revoke E.’s suspended sentence, given that he had failed to return the child. The sentence was revoked on 5 July 2017 and E. was ordered to serve it forthwith. The decision was upheld on appeal on 14 September 2017.
By a court decision of 2 February 2018 E. was exempted from serving his sentence under the general Amnesty Act (Закон за aмнестија, Official Gazette no.11/2018), which provided that all persons sentenced to six months or less be released from serving their sentence. That decision was made before E. started serving his sentence.
By a judgment of 12 March 2018 E. was again convicted of child abduction and given a six-month suspended prison sentence, following a fresh criminal complaint by the applicant. By the same judgment he was ordered to return the child. The judgment became final on 10 April 2018.
By a court decision of 6 March 2019 a request by the applicant to have E.’s suspended sentence revoked was denied. E. was also released from the obligation to return the child on the basis of a new expert report (see paragraph 23 below). That decision was upheld on appeal on 14 April 2019.
Following a request by E., on 21 November 2018 the Centre overturned the 2015 decision and gave him custody of the child, while the applicant was granted contact rights (“the 2018 decision”). The decision was based on a new expert report which established that E. and his family had been taking good care of the child. Partly on account of the lack of contact with the applicant, the child had not developed an emotional bond with her. Furthermore, at several meetings (see paragraph 18 above) it had been observed that the applicant was failing to show any affection towards the child, and further meetings had been discontinued at her request. A language barrier had also developed between the applicant and her child, in that the former spoke Macedonian and Turkish, but the latter only Albanian. Lastly, the Centre stated that, considering the child’s age, a sudden change of environment could have negative consequences. For all of those reasons it was decided that it would be in the best interests of the child to remain with her father. The decision became effective immediately and provided that any appeal against it would have no suspensive effect.
Following a remittal of the case, an appeal lodged by the applicant was dismissed by a second-instance commission. The proceedings are still pending.
Between 12 February and 15 March 2019 the applicant met with the child on four occasions at the Centre, in accordance with the terms of the 2018 decision.
