The present case concerns the failure by the domestic authorities to enforce a judgment granting the first applicant a residence order in respect of the second applicant and the absence of an effective domestic remedy in this regard. It raises issues under Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention.
THE FACTS
The applicants are mother and daughter. They were born in 1989 and 2012 respectively and live in the Chechen Republic and the Republic of Ingushetia respectively. They were represented by Ms V. Kogan and Mr E. Wesselink from the Stichting Russian Justice Initiative (“the SRJI”), an NGO based in Moscow.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr M. Galperin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 2 February 2012 the first applicant married R.F.
On 15 May 2012 the first applicant gave birth to their daughter, the second applicant.
In August 2012 the first applicant and R.F. separated. The second applicant continued to live with the first applicant.
In August 2014 R.F. abducted the second applicant.
On 23 September 2014 the marriage between the first applicant and R.F. was officially dissolved.
On 28 November 2014 the first applicant applied to the Sunzhenskiy District Court of the Republic of Ingushetia (“the District Court”) for a residence order in respect of the second applicant. In response, R.F. instituted proceedings for an order ruling that the child’s residence was to be with him.
On 9 February 2015 the District Court held that the child should reside with her mother, the first applicant. R.F.’s application for a residence order was dismissed. The judgment became final on 9 June 2015.
On 5 August 2015 bailiff Ye. from the Sunzhenskiy District Bailiffs’ Service in the Republic of Ingushetia opened enforcement proceedings in this connection.
On 21 August 2015 R.F. explained to bailiff Ch. that he was resident in the Chechen Republic and asked that the enforcement proceedings be referred to the Bailiffs’ Service in the Chechen Republic.
On 24 August 2015 bailiff Ch. from the Sunzhenskiy District Bailiffs’ Service instructed the Zavodskoy District Bailiffs’ Service in Grozny, the Chechen Republic, to establish R.F.’s place of residence.
On 27 August 2015 the enforcement proceedings were suspended pending attempts to ascertain R.F.’s residence in the Chechen Republic.
On 5 October 2015 bailiff K. from the Zavodskoy District Bailiffs’ Service in Grozny visited R.F.’s presumed place of residence in Grozny. It was established that R.F. was not living in the flat in question, which had been rented out to another person since 2012.
On 9 October 2015 bailiff Ch. from the Sunzhenskiy District Bailiffs’ Service visited R.F.’s presumed place of residence in the Republic of Ingushetia. The door was opened by R.F.’s mother, who explained that her son was living in Grozny.
On 7 December 2015 bailiff K. from the Zavodskoy District Bailiffs’ Service in Grozny obtained explanations from R.F., who again submitted that he was living in Grozny and was prepared to appear before a bailiff as soon as he was summoned.
On 9 December 2015 the enforcement proceedings in the Republic of Ingushetia were suspended, and on 30 December 2015 it was decided to refer them to the Zavodskoy District Bailiffs’ Service in Grozny.
On 16 February 2016 the enforcement proceedings were referred to the Zavodskoy District Bailiffs’ Service in Grozny.
On 16 March 2016 bailiff T. from the Zavodskoy District Bailiffs’ Service in Grozny again visited R.F.’s presumed place of residence in Grozny and established that he was not living there.
On 11 April 2016 an administrative fine of 1,000 Russian roubles (approximately 15 euros (EUR)) was imposed on R.F. for failure to comply with the judgment of 9 February 2015.
On 21 April 2016 bailiff T. from the Zavodskoy District Bailiffs’ Service in Grozny instituted a search for the second applicant.
On 3 June 2016 it was established that the second applicant was attending a kindergarten in the Republic of Ingushetia.
On 22 June 2016 it was decided to return the enforcement proceedings to the Sunzhenskiy District Bailiffs’ Service in the Republic of Ingushetia.
On 1 August 2016 the enforcement proceedings were returned to the Sunzhenskiy District Bailiffs’ Service in the Republic of Ingushetia.
On 9 August 2016 bailiff A. visited R.F.’s presumed place of residence in the Republic of Ingushetia. Nobody opened the door. The bailiff then visited R.F.’s workplace and spoke to him. R.F. stated that he worked in the Republic of Ingushetia and lived in the Chechen Republic, and that he did not intend to return the child to the first applicant.
On 5 October 2016 the enforcement proceedings were again returned to the Chechen Republic.
On 4 November 2016 the Bailiffs’ Service in Grozny refused to institute enforcement proceedings in respect of R.F. in the Chechen Republic.
On 13 December 2016 the enforcement file was sent back to the Sunzhenskiy District Bailiffs’ Service in the Republic of Ingushetia.
In the meantime, on 12 October 2016 the first applicant brought judicial proceedings to contest the lawfulness of the bailiffs’ actions.
On 22 November 2016 the District Court found the inaction of the Sunzhenskiy District Bailiffs’ Service to be unlawful and noted that the bailiffs’ actions were manifestly insufficient in terms of securing enforcement of the judgment of 9 February 2015, that the bailiffs’ demands had been of a limited and formal nature, and that long periods of inactivity had been attributable to the bailiffs. The bailiffs were required to remedy the above violations.
On 23 December 2016 the enforcement proceedings were referred to the Grozny Bailiffs’ Service in the Chechen Republic for the third time.
On 31 January 2017 the enforcement file was received by the Grozny Bailiffs’ Service.
However, on 27 February 2017 the enforcement proceedings were again referred to the Sunzhenskiy District Bailiffs’ Service in the Republic of Ingushetia.
To date the judgment of 9 February 2015 remains unenforced.
For the relevant provisions of domestic law, see Pakhomova v. Russia (no. 22935/11, §§ 91-112, 24 October 2013).
The Federal Law On Enforcement Proceedings of 2 October 2007 (“the Enforcement Proceedings Act 2007”) further provides that if a child in respect of whom a search has been instituted is found, the bailiff carrying out the search must immediately notify the childcare authority in the locality where the child is discovered and must take measures for the child to be transferred to the person (legal representative, guardian or trustee) indicated in the enforcement order. If immediate transfer of the child is not possible, the bailiff is to transfer the child to the childcare authority in the locality where the child is discovered and immediately inform the person concerned (section 65 § 14).
