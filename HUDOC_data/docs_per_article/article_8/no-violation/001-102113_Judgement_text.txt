The case originated in an application (no. 28708/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Slovenian nationals, Mr Andrej Trdan and Ć. (“the applicants”), on 15 June 2006. The President of the Chamber decided of his own motion to grant the second applicant anonymity pursuant to Rule 47 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicants were represented by Mr B. Verstovšek, a lawyer practising in Celje. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney-General.
On 24 June 2009 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants are father and son. The first applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Ribnica. The second applicant was born in 2005 and lives in .
The first applicant was in a relationship with S.Ć. The relationship ended four months before the second applicant was born. The first applicant acknowledged the child by signing a statement on paternity with the Ljubljana Administrative Unit (Upravna enota ). The second applicant's mother S.Ć. never gave her consent to the above-mentioned statement.
On 10 February 2006 the first applicant brought an action with the Ljubljana District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Ljubljani) for custody and determination of paternity. He also lodged a request for an interim measure ensuring him contact with his son pending the outcome of the main proceedings. Moreover, he requested the appointment of a special representative to represent the second applicant and to be exempted from paying court fees.
On 17 February 2006 the Ljubljana District Court issued a decision rejecting the request for an interim measure. The court stated that the question of paternity should be resolved before such measure could be applied. The first applicant appealed.
On 5 March 2006 and 5 April 2006 the first applicant lodged two requests for a hearing to be set and for the matter to be resolved promptly.
On 12 April 2006 the  (Višje sodišče v Ljubljani) issued a decision upholding the appeal and remitting the question of provisional contact arrangements for re-examination.
On 9 May 2006 the first applicant lodged a supervisory appeal (nadzorstvena pritožba) with the Ministry of Justice (Ministrstvo za pravosodje), complaining that the judge's work in the case was slow and ineffective.
On 10 May 2006 the first applicant lodged preliminary submissions and a reply to the counterclaim lodged by S.Ć. on 21 March 2006.
On 17 May 2006 Ljubljana District Court issued the first interim contact order allowing the first applicant to have contact with the second applicant once a week for two hours. The order was immediately enforceable, as appeals do not stay the enforcement of such orders.
Ć. lodged an objection.
On 24 May 2006 the Ljubljana Moste Polje Welfare Authority (Center za socialno delo  Moste Polje) issued a decision appointing a curator ad litem to represent the second applicant.
On 25 May 2006 the Ljubljana District Court sent a report to the Ministry regarding the progress in the case following the first applicant's supervisory appeal.
On 2 June 2006 the first applicant lodged an appeal against the order on provisional contact arrangements issued on 17 May 2006. He claimed that S.Ć. and her father had prevented him from visiting the second applicant and had threatened him with physical violence. He requested the first-instance court to modify the interim contact order concerning the enforcement by setting a fine in the event of non-compliance to ensure contact with the second applicant.
On 8 June 2006 the first applicant lodged a request for priority treatment, claiming that he had again been prevented from seeing the second applicant. He also lodged a complaint (ustna ovadba) with the police.
On 14 June 2006 Ljubljana District Court set a hearing for 5 July 2006. The first applicant requested that the hearing be set earlier.
On 15 June 2006 Ljubljana District Court issued a decision exempting the first applicant from paying court fees.
On 16 June 2006 the first applicant requested the hearing to be rescheduled, which was refused.
On 5 July 2006 the Ljubljana District Court held a hearing regarding provisional contact arrangements and the objection of S.Ć. to the order of 17 May 2006. The court issued a new contact order of its own motion pending the resolution of the case. The court allowed contact between father and son twice a week under the supervision of a social worker. It also set out a fine of 50,000 Slovenian tolars (SIT) (approx. 200 euros (EUR)) to be imposed in the event of non-compliance. On the same day a partial judgment was issued establishing that the first applicant was indeed the biological father of the second applicant. The parents also resolved the issue of alimony by signing a court settlement.
On 13 July 2006 the first applicant lodged an appeal challenging both interim contact orders (see paragraphs 12 and 20 above) by requesting more frequent contact.
On 6 September 2006  Higher Court quashed both appeals.
On 27 November 2006 the first applicant lodged a request for a new interim contact order, requesting more frequent contact.
On 6 December 2006 Ljubljana District Court rejected the first applicant's request and issued an order of its own motion, allowing contact under new terms. The court allowed contact twice a week without supervision and every other Saturday and fixed an arrangement for Christmas holidays. The court set a fine of SIT 50,000 (approx. EUR 200) in the event of non-compliance. S.Ć. lodged an objection.
On 4 and 5 January 2007 the first applicant lodged two requests with Ljubljana District Court for imposition of a penalty or use of physical force to enforce the order, since S.Ć was not respecting the interim contact order and was obstructing the applicant's visiting rights. The first applicant stated that the visits had been obstructed on nine occasions between 16 December 2006 and 2 January 2007. It transpires from the case-file that the second applicant was frequently ill between December 2006 and February 2007 and was hospitalized on 26 February 2007.

On 27 February 2007 Ljubljana District Court issued a decision appointing an expert in psychology in order to determine which party to the proceedings should be granted custody. On the same day, following an unsuccessful contact, the first applicant lodged a complaint with the police against S.Ć. accusing her of abduction of a minor. It transpires from the case-file that the first applicant lodged at least ten such complaints during the proceedings.
On 2 March 2007 Ljubljana District Court issued a decision, rejecting the first applicant's requests from 4 and 5 January 2007 as unsubstantiated. The court found that the contact visits had been obstructed or prevented mainly because of the child's illness, and that the first applicant had not made an attempt to reschedule as set out in the interim order. The first applicant appealed.
On 7 March 2007 the supervisory appeal was rejected as unfounded (see paragraph 26).
The second applicant was again hospitalized between 7 May 2007 and 10 May 2007.
On 9 May 2007  Higher Court issued a decision quashing the decision of 6 December 2006 (see paragraphs 24 and 27 above) and rejected the first applicant's request for a new interim contact order. The court found that despite the progressing relationship between father and son allowing contacts without supervision was premature and such changes should be done more gradually. The order of 5 July 2006 was now again in force.
On 25 May 2007 Ljubljana District Court received the expert's opinion.
On 31 May 2007 the first applicant lodged a new request for an interim contact order.

On 3 July 2008 a hearing was held and a new interim contact order was issued, setting a fine for non-compliance and further modifying contact arrangements. Both parties waived the right to appeal.
On 21 October 2008 S.Ć. lodged a preliminary submission requesting an additional expert opinion, whereby it could be established whether there had been physical violence against the second applicant by the first applicant. She had also informed the Welfare Authority about her concerns.
On 23 October 2008 the first applicant requested amendments to the new interim contact order.
On 4 November 2008 the first-instance court rejected both requests and found it unnecessary to change the contact arrangements. The court acknowledged that the relations between the parties presented a problem, since there had been frequent accusations of a criminal nature on both sides. Following the report by the Welfare Centre, the court assessed that the circumstances are not of such nature that the contact arrangements should be altered.
On 12 November 2008 a main hearing was held regarding custody. The first-instance court tried unsuccessfully to reach a settlement between the parties. The court also ordered the expert to supplement the opinion and establish whether there is any reason the contacts between father and son should not take place. A new interim contact order was issued setting new contact arrangements and a fine for non-compliance. S.Ć. appealed.
On 4 March 2009 a hearing was held at which the first applicant submitted a request for a new interim contact order. The court issued a new order slightly modifying the provisional contact arrangements until the next main hearing, fixed for 1 July 2009. Based on the supplemented expert opinion the court slightly extended the contacts. A fine in the event of non-compliance was set again.
On 1 July 2009 a hearing was held. Ljubljana District Court issued a judgment whereby the child was placed in the care of S.Ć. and contact arrangements were set. The first applicant stated that the contact visits had been carried out in line with the last interim decision.

On 14 December 2009  Higher Court rejected the appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment.
