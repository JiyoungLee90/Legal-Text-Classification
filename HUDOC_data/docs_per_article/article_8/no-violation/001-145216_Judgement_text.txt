.  The case originated in an application (no. 6717/08) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Marzena Ruszkowska (“the applicant”), on 1 February 2008.
.  The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Ms M. Gąsiorowska, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs J. Chrzanowska of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
.  The applicant complained that the facts of the case constituted discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8.
.  On 15 November 2010 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
.  The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Biała Podlaska.
.  The applicant and her husband, G.K., had two children, D. and K.
.  In March 2002 they formed a foster family for two brothers, D.K. and R.K. On 11 August 2002 the Biała Podlaska District Court appointed her and her husband as the siblings’ official foster parents.
.  In January 2003 they fostered three more children, siblings A.C., M.C. and T.C.
.  In June 2004 the family fostered two other children, sisters A.M. and S.M.
.  The applicant and her husband took care of nine children altogether, two biological and seven fostered.
.  In December 2004 G.K. suddenly died. The applicant subsequently applied for dissolution of the foster family. She submitted that she could not cope with the task of running a foster home for nine children on her own.
.  On 31 January 2005 the Biała Podlaska District Court issued an interim care order placing A.C., M.C. and T.C. with another foster family, run by Mr and Mrs P. The applicant was still responsible for the two K. brothers and the two M. sisters as their foster mother.
.  On 11 August 2005 the Biała Podlaska District Court moved the K. brothers to another foster family, run by Mrs W.
.  In April 2007 the foster family formed by the applicant was dissolved in respect of the two M. sisters.
.  In January 2008 the applicant married C.R., who did not adopt the applicant’s biological sons D. and K. . The applicant remains their sole legal guardian.
.  The applicant’s late husband G.K. was covered by an insurance scheme run by the Farmers’ Social Security Fund (Kasa Rolniczego Upezpieczenia Spolecznego – “the Fund”). His children were entitled to a survivors’ pension (renta rodzinna) under the scheme. The total amount of the pension payable to survivors was to be divided into equal parts among all eligible individuals – in G.K.’s case, all his children, both biological and fostered.
.  In January 2005 the applicant applied to the Fund for the survivors’ pension in respect of all nine children.
.  On 18 February 2005 the Fund decided that the M. sisters were not eligible for the pension, as less than a year had passed between the applicant’s late husband becoming their foster father and his death. The Fund further established that the remaining seven children – the applicant’s biological children, the two K. brothers and the three C. siblings − would be entitled to a pension of PLN 525.70 in total per month. The applicant, as their legal guardian, was appointed beneficiary of the pension.
.  On 22 February 2005 Mrs P. requested that the Fund grant a pension in respect of the C. siblings, who had by that time become part of the foster family she ran with her husband (see paragraph 12 above).
.  On 1 March 2005 the Fund issued a new decision revising the amount of the pension to be paid. The applicant’s two biological children and the two K. brothers fostered by her would be entitled to a monthly allowance of PLN 349.60 between them, four-sevenths of the total amount. The three C. siblings being raised by the P. family would be entitled to a monthly allowance of PLN 262.20 between them, three-sevenths of the total amount.
.  The applicant appealed against the decisions delivered by the Fund. She requested that the court amend its decision of 1 March 2005 and declare that the only individuals eligible were her husband’s biological children. She argued that the children formerly in her foster care had been placed with other families who provided for them and that they should not therefore be entitled to the survivors’ pension in respect of her late husband. She was of the view that the contested decision put her children in a disadvantageous situation in comparison with the foster children.
.  On 15 November 2005 the Lublin Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, but on 7 February 2007 the Lublin Court of Appeal quashed that judgment and remitted the case to the lower court for re-examination with the participation of the C. and K. siblings’ legal guardians.
.  On 16 May 2007 the Lublin Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal again. The court based its reasoning on the Farmers’ Social Insurance Act 1990 (Ustawa z 20 grudnia 1990 roku o ubezpieczeniu społecznym rolników – “the Act”). Under section 29 (2)(2) of that Act all children of the deceased, including foster children, were eligible for a survivors’ pension. Section 30 of the Act stated that all family members were eligible for a share of the pension, which was to be divided into equal parts, even where the eligible individuals were minors under the care of different guardians. The Regional Court stressed that the spirit of the Act was to treat all children equally in respect of the insurance benefits payable to them on the death of an insured person, irrespective of whether they were biological or foster children. The court found no grounds on which to quash or amend the contested decision.
.  On 18 December 2007 the Lublin Court of Appeal dismissed a further appeal by the applicant on the same grounds as the first. The court fully concurred with the reasoning of the first-instance court.
.  On an unspecified date the applicant wrote to the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy to complain about the decisions given in her case. She submitted that her biological children were being treated less favourably than the foster children in respect of their survivors’ pension. She received a response dated 14 February 2008. In that letter, the Director of the Family Benefits Department shared the applicant’s view that the legal provisions in force at that time were indeed unfavourable to biological children in situations where foster children had been moved to other families. The applicant was informed that the relevant legislative amendments were in progress.
.  According to the most recent relevant decision of the Fund, dated 14 June 2010, the total amount of the pension would from that date be divided into six parts, because T.C. had lost his entitlement having reached the age of majority. From that date onwards, the applicant’s biological children would receive two-sixths of the survivors’ pension. The remainder would be paid to the other children formerly in her and her late husband’s foster care.
.  The District Family Support Centre (PCPR) awarded the applicant the following amounts in financial support for the foster children:
for D.K. from 7 March 2002 until 11 August 2005 – 26,308.30 PLN and an additional 6 630,80 PLN for personal care of the child;
for R.K. from 7 March 2002 until 11 August 2005 – 26,308.30 PLN and an additional 6 630,80 PLN for personal care of the child;
for T.C. from 1 February 2003 until 31 January 2005 – 15,562.00 PLN and an additional 3 890,40 PLN for personal care of the child;
for M.C. from 1 February 2003 until 31 January 2005 – 15,562.00 PLN and an additional 3 890,40 PLN for personal care of the child;
for A.C. from 1 February 2003 until 31 January 2005 – 15,562.00 PLN and an additional 3 890,40 PLN for personal care of the child;
for A.M. from 14 June 2004 until 27 April 2007 – 22,248.06 PLN and an additional 4 557,00 PLN for personal care of the child;
for S.M. from 14 June 2004 until 27 April 2007 – 22,248.06 PLN, and an additional 4,557.00 PLN for personal care of the child.
.  Mr and Mrs P., the C. siblings’ foster parents, received:
for T.C. from 1 February 2005 until 31 July 2006 – 10,909.34 PLN and an additional 2,917.80 PLN for personal care of the child;
for M.C. from 1 February 2005 until 28 July 2010 – 39,627.52 PLN and an additional 10,796.87 PLN for personal care of the child;
for A.C. from 1 February 2005 until 28 July 2010 – 39,627.52 PLN and an additional 10,796.87 PLN for personal care of the child.
.  Mrs W., R.K. and D.K.’s foster mother, received:
for D.K. from 12 August 2005 until 17 January 2011 – 39,025.39 PLN and an additional 10,504.40 PLN for personal care of the child;
for R.K. from 12 August 2005 until 29 June 2009 – 28,285.83 PLN and an additional 7,539.80 PLN for personal care of the child.
.  Siblings T.C., M.C. and A.C. remained in Mr and Mrs P.’s foster family from 31 January 2005 until 26 June 2006 (T.C.) and 7 July 2010 (M.C. and A.C.). By a court decision of 26 June 2006, T.C. was placed in a Staterun children’s home. M.C. and A.C. remained with couple P.’s foster family until 7 July 2010 when the court restored their biological parents’ parental rights. M.C. and A.C. lived with them from that date onwards.
.  T.C. and M.C. stopped drawing their survivors’ pensions on 1 September 2009 and 1 November 2010 respectively.
.  Siblings R.K. and D.K. remained in Mrs W.’s foster family from 11 August 2005 until 29 June 2009 and 17 January 2011 respectively. That foster family ultimately ceased to exist because they had reached the age of majority. R.K. subsequently moved in with his biological mother. He stopped receiving his survivors’ pension on 1 August 2010. D.K. moved into college accommodation.
.  The applicant’s biological sons D.K. and K.K. were entitled to receive the survivors’ pension until 28 February 2012 and 31 July 2012 respectively. A.C. and D.K.’s entitlement expired on 31 August 2011.
.  Section 29 of the Social Insurance for Farmers Act 1990, entitled Survivors’ pension: Eligible persons, as applicable at the material time, read as follows:
“ The survivors’ pension is granted to the family members of a deceased:
(1)  a retired person or pensioner with an established right to a retirement or disability pension paid from the social insurance fund,
(2)  an insured person who, at the time of death, meets the conditions of eligibility for an agricultural retirement or disability pension by virtue of their incapacity for work; it is assumed that the person was totally incapable of working on a farm.
The following members of the deceased person’s family are eligible for a survivors’ pension:
(1)  the insured’s own children, the children of a second spouse and adopted children,
(2)  grandchildren, brothers, sisters and other children, including foster children, who have been fostered before reaching the age of 18,
(3)  the insured’s spouse (the widow or widower), and
(4)  the insured’s parents,
if they meet the conditions of eligibility for such a pension pursuant to the retirement provisions.”
.  Section 30 of that Act provides that the amount of survivors’ pension is to be calculated as follows:
“One survivors’ pension is granted to all eligible family members.
If one person is eligible for the survivors’ pension, the benefit is equal to 85% of the basic retirement pension, increased by:
(1)  50% of the surplus value – above the basic retirement pension – of the retirement or disability pension paid from the social security fund to individual farmers and their family members that the deceased person was eligible for at the time of death, or
(2)  50% of the contribution-related component of the agricultural retirement or disability pension that the deceased person was eligible for at the time of death by virtue of their incapacity for work.
The amount of the survivors’ pension, established according to the procedure provided for in paragraph 2, is increased by 5% for each successive eligible person.
The survivorship pension, calculated according to paragraphs 2 and 3, is increased by 10% if the death was caused by an accident at work on a farm or by an occupational disease. ...
The survivors’ pension cannot exceed the amount of the benefit that the deceased would have been eligible for, and it cannot be lower than the basic retirement pension. ...
The survivors’ pension shall be subject to apportionment into equal parts among all eligible individuals if:
(1)  underage persons eligible for the benefit are under the care of different persons,
(2)  a family member of the age of majority eligible for the benefit demands that it be divided, or
(3)  other circumstances pertain that justify the division of the benefit.”
