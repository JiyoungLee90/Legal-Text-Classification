The case originated in an application (no. 24199/07) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Ms Maria Lia Lukats (“the applicant”), on 2 May 2007.
The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged that the domestic mechanism providing for compensation for lost properties from provinces which were formerly part of Romania was not effective.
On 19 March 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Skokie, USA.
On 31 August 1998 the applicant lodged a request with the Bucharest Commission for Implementing Law no. 9/1998 (the County Commission) seeking compensation for assets owned by her ancestors and transferred to the Bulgarian State. On 29 April 2004 the County Commission issued a decision whereby the applicant was entitled to compensation of ROL 4,991,284,506 (approximately EUR 123,500 at the time).
Between 2005 and 2008 the applicant lodged several applications with the National Authority for Property Restitution (hereinafter “the National Authority”) and the President of Romania for payment of the compensation. On each occasion, the applicant was informed that her file was subject to ratification by the responsible authority for implementing Law no. 9/1998.
On 20 February 2009 the National Authority issued the ratification decision, confirming the applicant’s entitlement to RON 499,128.43 (approximately EUR 117,000 at the time). The decision mentioned that the payment would be made in two annual instalments, as provided for by the methodological rules for the implementation of the law, in force since 30 November 1998 and amended on 26 October 2007.
To date, the applicant has not received the compensation or any indication as to when such compensation would be paid.
For an overall description of the legal framework and of the domestic mechanisms created for the assessment of various types of restitution and compensation claims, see Maria Atanasiu and Others v. Romania, nos. 30767/05 and 33800/06, §§ 45-51, 12 October 2010. As mentioned in this pilot judgment, the Romanian State undertook via various international treaties signed at the relevant time the obligation to compensate former owners or their successors in title who lost buildings, land or crops abandoned on certain territories following border changes before and during the Second World War. The administrative procedure for obtaining compensation in respect of such property, provided for by Laws nos. 9/1998, 290/2003 and 393/2006 and coordinated by the National Authority, differed from that for immovable property nationalised by the communist regime, and the necessary funds came out of the State budget (see Maria Atanasiu and Others, cited above, § 51), as also presented succinctly below.
Law no. 9/1998 came into force on 14 March 1998 and was amended in 2004 and 2007; it established a compensatory mechanism for Romanian citizens whose immovable properties were confiscated without due compensation under the Treaty of Craiova, signed by Romania and Bulgaria on 7 September 1940 (see paragraph 38 below).
The mechanism referred essentially to pecuniary compensation or to the right to shares in State-run companies. The deadline for filing such claims was set in Article 4 § 1 at eighteen months from the entry into force of the law. This deadline was subsequently extended by Law no. 97/2005, for a period of twelve more months starting with the entry into force of the law on 21 April 2005 and then by Law no. 348/2006, for a period of eighteen more months, starting from the entry into force of the law on 28 July 2006.
The bodies in charge of implementing the said Law were the County Commissions established within each county (including Bucharest) under the authority of the Prefect, and the Central Commission for Implementing Law no. 9/1998.
Under Article 7 § 1, the County Commissions had responsibility for assessing and dealing with requests for compensation within a maximum of six months following the date of registration. The decisions of the County Commissions were communicated to the claimants and the Central Commission, and they could be challenged by the claimants before the Central Commission within fifteen days. The latter then had to ratify or reject such decisions within sixty days.
In their turn, the decisions adopted by the Central Commission could be challenged before the domestic courts.
The methodological rules issued for the implementation of Law no. 9/1998, in force since 30 November 1998, provided for, inter alia, a calculation method for the setting of the compensation. This amount was to be updated when payment was made, according to Articles 8, 21 and 27 of the rules, on the basis of the median salary index of the last trimester prior to the moment of the actual payment.
In its original version, Article 8 stipulated in its paragraph 3 that
“(3) Within sixty days of the deadline set out in Article 4 § 1, depending on the total amount of compensation to be granted, a Government Decision will set up payment by instalments, the amounts being adjusted for inflation. The instalments are not to be set for more than two consecutive years.”
This paragraph became paragraph 2 from 9 November 1999, and stated as follows:
“(2) ...when the compensation is paid in the year it was awarded it is granted in the amount validated by the Central Commission, and when it is paid the next year ... it is to be adjusted on the basis of the consumer price index. The payment is to be staggered over a maximum of two years.”
Government Decision no. 286/2004, in force since 22 March 2004, provided in its Article 5 that compensation validated by the Central Commission was to be paid in two annual instalments, namely 40% in the year of the payment and 60% the following year, this second instalment being adjusted for inflation as set out in Law no. 9/1998.
From 18 October 2004, when Government Decision no. 1643/2004 came into force, the responsibilities of the Central Commission were taken over by the Department for the Application of Law no. 9/1998, functioning within the Prime Minister’s Chancellery. The Department forwarded the ratification decisions adopted by the County Commissions for the approval of the Prime Minister’s Head of Chancellery. The Department was further entitled to make a proposal for adjustment of the compensation at the time of the ratification decision, in accordance with Law no. 9/1998.
These responsibilities were taken over by the National Authority with effect from the entry into force of Government Decision no. 361/2005, namely on 29 April 2005; this act was modified by Government Decision no. 240/2006 on 27 February 2006.
The methodological rules issued for the implementation of Law no. 9/1998, as amended on 26 October 2007 by Government Decision no. 1277/2007, set out in Article 38 § 1 that payment of compensation was to be made by the National Authority as the institution in charge of dealing with all claims lodged under the restitution laws adopted in Romania.
Law no. 290/2003, in force with certain amendments since 13 August 2003, provided for compensation for Romanian citizens whose immovable property located in the former provinces of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and Hertza, was confiscated without due compensation as a consequence of the state of war and the application of the Paris Peace Treaty signed by Romania with the Allied Powers on 10 February 1947.
The mechanism put in place by the law was similar to that described above in respect of Law no. 9/1998; in addition to the pecuniary compensation, the law provided for granting possession of plots of land equivalent to those that had been confiscated; the bodies in charge of implementing Law no. 290/2003 were the commissions established in accordance with Law no. 9/1998, following the same procedural steps as presented above in respect of the claims lodged under Law no. 9/1998.
The claimants were requested to lodge their applications no later than 1 May 2007.
A similar compensation mechanism was put into place by the State with effect from 18 February 2007, when Law no. 393/2006 came into force. The law concerned the granting of compensation to Romanian citizens for their lost property located in the previous Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, under, respectively, the Treaty of Belgrade signed between Romania and Yugoslavia on 24 November 1923, and the Convention between Romania and the above-mentioned Kingdom signed in Belgrade on 5 July 1924.
The County Commissions established pursuant to Law no. 9/1998 had jurisdiction to assess the claimants’ requests, which were to be lodged within eighteen months of the law’s entering into force. The Department for the application of Law no. 290/2003 within the National Authority acted in line with the procedures prescribed by Law no. 9/1998 and described above.
On 27 February 2013 the Government adopted an ordinance establishing the payment by instalments of compensation granted under Law no. 9/1998, as well as Law no. 290/2003 and Law no. 393/2006. According to the ordinance, the compensation was to be paid from 1 January 2014 by equal annual instalments over a period of ten years, while a single instalment could not be lower than RON 20,000.
The preamble to the ordinance mentioned that its adoption had been determined by difficulties encountered in the payment of compensation, especially in connection with the implications of such payments for the State budget.
However, when called to examine the constitutionality of this ordinance, the Romanian Constitutional Court held on 12 December 2013 that the measures adopted by the Government, namely to make payments by instalments over a ten-year period, were in breach of the Constitution, in so far as they placed an excessive and disproportionate burden on claimants entitled to receive compensation from the State. The deadline of ten years was also considered to be unreasonable, in consideration of the financial documents relied on by the Government, which documented the impact on the State budget for a period of five years only.
As a consequence of this decision, the ordinance was abrogated on 11 March 2014.
Adopted on 14 March 2014, EGO no. 10/2014 suspended for a period of six months the issue by the competent authorities of any decision on claims lodged under Law no. 9/1998 and Law no. 290/2003. The ordinance further suspended for the same period the voluntary payment of compensation already granted under Law no. 9/1998, Law no. 290/2003, and Law no. 393/2006.
Law no. 164/2014 concerning measures for the acceleration and finalisation of the process of resolving compensation claims lodged under Law no. 9/1998 and Law no. 290/2003 entered into force on 18 December 2014.
Article 2 states that the only compensatory measure possible was pecuniary compensation.
Article 3 defines the applicability of the law to all claims lodged in due time with the County Commissions and in respect of which no decision has been issued, or in respect of which a decision granting compensation has been issued but no payment has been made, as well as to those claims lodged under Law no. 9/1998 or Law no. 290/2003 that are currently pending before the domestic courts.
The law authorises the transfer of all powers of the Central Commission to the National Authority, who shall thus ratify or otherwise any decision taken by the County Commissions on claims lodged under Law no. 9/1998 and Law no. 290/2003. The National Authority is entitled to request further information and documents, from public institutions as well as from claimants, when such documents are missing or are not corroborated.
Decisions taken by the National Authority are subject to appeal before the administrative courts.
Article 10 of the law sets out the deadlines by which all payments should be made; it provides as follows:
“(1) Compensation awarded by decision of the County Commission, by order of the Prime Minister’s Head of Chancellery or by a decision of the National Authority for Property Restitution and issued before the entry into force of the present law, shall be paid in equal annual instalments over a period of five years, starting on 1 January 2015;
(2) compensation awarded following a decision adopted after the entry into force of the present law by the National Authority for Property Restitution, ratifying the County Commissions’ decisions issued before the entry into force of the present law, shall be paid in equal annual instalments over a period of five years following the year when the decisions were ratified;
(3) compensation granted by means of judgments that became final ... before the entry into force of the present law shall be paid in equal annual instalments over a period of five years, starting on 1 January 2015 ...
(6) the National Authority for Property Restitution shall issue a payment voucher for each annual instalment ...
(7) the amount of one annual instalment shall not be smaller than RON 20,000. If the compensation to be paid is lower than this amount, it shall be paid in full in one instalment only.”
Paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article refer essentially to the manner in which the compensation should be adjusted for inflation, on the basis of the consumer price index, from the moment the decision was issued until the entry into force of the law.
Article 12 sets out a 120-day deadline within which the claimants are to supplement their files with further documents, following a written request in that respect sent by the authority. This deadline may be extended once, for sixty more days, at the request of the claimant, if evidence shows that he/she has taken the necessary steps to obtain the necessary information.
Article 13 provides that the County Commissions are bound to issue a decision on the applicants’ claims within:
“a) nine months, if there are less than 500 files pending before them;
b) eighteen months, if the files pending before them are in the range of 501-1000;
c) thirty-six months if they have more than 1000 files pending before them.”
This deadline started running on 1 January 2015.
Article 14 stipulates that decisions issued by the County Commissions before the entry into force of the present law and already registered with the National Authority should be ratified or otherwise within eighteen months of the entry into force of the law. Decisions issued after the entry into force of the law should be ratified or otherwise by the National Authority within eighteen months of their registration with that authority.
The registration number and the number of files pending with the National Authority shall be published on its web page.
Article 15 gives claimants the opportunity to apply to the courts in the event that the above-mentioned deadlines are not complied with.
Article 17 of the law sets out several measures meant to increase the efficiency of the compensation procedures, providing, inter alia, for a temporary increase of the number of posts available at the National Authority.
The Treaty of Craiova was signed on 7 September 1940 by Romania and Bulgaria. Under the terms of this treaty, the signatory parties agreed on the border line that was to be established between the two countries, with particular reference to the territory between the Black Sea and the Danube River (the Cadrilater). Section III of the Treaty provided for a mandatory resettlement of Romanian citizens of Bulgarian ethnicity living in Tulcea and Constanţa Districts to Bulgaria, and the resettlement of ethnic Romanians living in Durostor and Caliacra Districts to Romania. Section V of Annex C of the Treaty stipulated that the Romanian State was in charge of compensating those Romanian citizens who, following the mandatory resettlement had to abandon their possessions in the rural areas which were transferred to Bulgaria.
