The case originated in an application (no. 8910/04) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Lyudmila Ivanovna Smirnova (“the applicant”), on 2 February 2004.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev and Mrs V. Milinchuk, the Representatives of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 25 October 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Shakhty, a town in Rostov Region.
In 1998–2001 the applicant’s father obtained seven judgment debts against his employer OAO Rostovugol, a joint-stock company managing coal mines in the Rostov Region. To enforce the judgments, bailiffs attached the company’s bank accounts, means of transport, and property, and audited the company’s cashow.
On 12 March 2002 the company’s shareholders voted for the company’s liquidation.
On 8 October 2002, the applicant’s father died, having signed away the judgment debts to the applicant. On 1 December 2003 the Shakhty Town Court acknowledged the applicant as a beneﬁciary of the judgment debts. This judgment became binding on 11 December 2003. Five judgment debts were paid on 6 April 2004, and two on 17 February 2005
On 9 March 2005 the company was declared bankrupt.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months.
