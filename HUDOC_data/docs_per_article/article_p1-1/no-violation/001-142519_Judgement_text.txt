The case originated in an application (no. 38388/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Roman Mikhaylovich Li (“the applicant”), on 20 July 2007.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 14 January 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Magadan.
On 28 January 2003 the Magadan City Court awarded 30,000 Russian roubles as compensation for unlawful conviction of the applicant. The decision of the court came into force on 16 February 2003.
The applicant obtained the respective writ of execution on 5 March 2003. In September 2007 the applicant sought in domestic courts issuance of a duplicate of the writ of execution which according to him had been stolen in 2004 from his office. On 13 September 2007 a national court refused to issue the duplicate because the term for submission of this document for the execution had expired under Article 14 of the Russian Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings.
On 27 September 2007 the applicant addressed the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation with a request to execute the judgment of 2003. The Ministry of Finance replied that the execution is not possible without submission of the writ of execution.
Article 242.1 § 1 of the Budget Code of the Russian Federation (No. 145-FZ of 31 July 1998) provides that enforcement of judicial decisions recovering funds from the budgetary system of the Russian Federation is held on the basis of the enforcement documents (writ of execution, court order) in accordance with the requirements set by domestic law regarding such documents and terms for their submission for execution.
Under Article 14 of the Russian Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings (No. 119-FZ of 21 July 1997) in force at the material time, writs of execution may be submitted for execution within three years as of the moment of the entrance into force of a court’s decision on the basis of which the respective write of execution was issued.
