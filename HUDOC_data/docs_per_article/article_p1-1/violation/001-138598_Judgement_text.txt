The case originated in five applications against the Republic of Azerbaijan lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by the following Azerbaijani nationals:
Mr Ramiz Valiyev, born in 1962, represented by Ms Gunel Abdurahimova, a lawyer practising in Azerbaijan (application no. 58265/09, lodged on 22 October 2009);
Mr Damir Mammadov, born in 1960, represented by Mr Ruslan Mustafazade, a lawyer practising in Azerbaijan (application no. 7526/10, lodged on 25 January 2010);
Ms Sevda Mammadova, born in 1968, represented by Ms Shafa Jamalzade, a lawyer practising in Azerbaijan (application no. 73346/10, lodged 25 November 2010);
Ms Leyla Abbasova, born in 1963 (application no. 7928/11, lodged 5 January 2011);
Ms Saadiya Aliyeva, born in 1985, represented by Ms Sevinj Aliyeva, a lawyer practising in Azerbaijan (application no. 16785/11, lodged 28 February 2011).
The Azerbaijani Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Ç. Asgarov.
On 5 May 2011 applications nos. 58265/09, 7526/10, 7928/11, 16785/11 and on 7 April 2011 application no. 73346/10 were communicated to the Government.
All of the applicants have either tenancy rights to their flats on the basis of occupancy vouchers (yaşayış sahəsi orderi) issued by the relevant executive authorities or ownership rights to them on the basis of an ownership certificate issued by the competent domestic authority (see Appendix - Table I).
In four of these cases, the applicants’ flats were unlawfully occupied by internally displaced persons (“IDPs”) from different regions of Azerbaijan under occupation by Armenian military forces following the Armenian Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, and in one case (application no. 7928/11) by a family of refugees from Armenia.
The applicants lodged separate civil actions before the domestic courts seeking the eviction of the IDPs from their flats.
On the dates indicated in the Appendix (Table I), the applicants’ claims were granted by various domestic courts, which ordered the eviction of the IDPs from their flats.
The respective judgments became final and enforceable. However, the IDP families refused to comply with those judgments and despite the applicants’ complaints to various authorities, the judgments were not enforced.
According to the Government’s letter of 17 May 2012, the judgments in the applicants’ favour in applications nos. 58265/09, 73346/10, 7928/11 and 16785/11 were enforced in April 2012.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Gulmammadova v.  (no. 38798/07, §§ 18-24, 22 April 2010).
