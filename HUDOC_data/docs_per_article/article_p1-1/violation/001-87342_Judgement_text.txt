The case originated in an application (no. 34679/03) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Sergey Ivanovich Belotserkovets (“the applicant”), on 25 September 2003.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev and Mrs V. Milinchuk, the Representatives of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 21 November 2006 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning non-enforcement of binding judgments to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Astrakhan.
As a victim of Chernobyl, the applicant is entitled to social beneﬁts. As the authorities had failed to provide the beneﬁts in full, the applicant brought four civil actions.
On 3 June 2003 the Kirovskiy District Court of Astrakhan awarded the applicant arrears, ﬁxed a new amount of periodic payments, and ordered that in future this amount should be adjusted for the cost of living. This judgment became binding on 1 August 2003, and was enforced in September–October 2003.
On 3 June 2004 the district court awarded the applicant arrears. This judgment became binding on 20 August 2004, and was enforced in January–July 2005.
On 30 August 2004 the district court ordered a local authority to provide the applicant with a decent at. This judgment became binding on 28 September 2004. From November 2004 to May 2005 the enforcement proceedings were stayed pending supervisory-review proceedings requested by the local authority. In October 2005 the local authority offered the applicant a at, but he refused it considering it too small to house his family. On a bailiff’s request, on 7 February 2006 the district court speciﬁed that the at was not meant for the applicant’s family members. In July 2006 the local authority offered the applicant another at, and on 28 September 2006 he accepted it.
On 24 October 2005 the district court awarded the applicant arrears and upgraded periodic payments. This judgment became binding on 7 November 2005, and was partly enforced in December 2005. In March–April 2006 the bailiff twice returned the writ of enforcement to the applicant, because the judgment had to be executed by the social authority directly. On the applicant’s request, on 6 February 2007 the Presidium of the  quashed the judgment on supervisory review and ordered a rehearing.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months. Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.
