The case originated in an application (no. 50346/07) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Dimitar Pavlov Yanakiev (“the applicant”), on 6 November 2007.
The applicant was represented by Ms V. Sedefova and Ms N. Sedefova, lawyers practising in Sofia. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms L. Gyurova, from the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant complained about the failure of the regional governor of Sofia region to implement a final judgment in his favour.
On 16 October 2013 the complaint concerning the failure to enforce a final domestic judgment was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Sofia.
In 1997 the Compensation for Owners of Nationalised Real Property Act (“the 1997 Compensation Law”) entered into force. It regulated the granting of compensation for property taken under several laws of a punitive or redistributive nature and which could not be returned physically.
On 27 November 1997 the applicant requested from the regional governor of Sofia region compensation for an apartment which had belonged to his ancestor at the time of its nationalisation in 1949. As he received no reply, at some point in 1998 the applicant challenged the governor’s silence in court. The Sofia City Court quashed the governor’s tacit refusal on 18 June 1999, finding that the applicant had to be compensated with “housing compensation bonds” (жилищни компенсаторни записи) as restitution was not possible. The applicant appealed, challenging the type of compensation awarded to him. On 9 April 2001 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court’s judgment and returned the case to it for the compensation amount to be determined.
Instead of ruling on the compensation, the Sofia City Court archived the case; it was only put back on the case roll on 5 July 2002 when the applicant complained.
The Sofia City Court, sitting in its administrative bench, delivered a decision on 19 July 2005. It determined that the amount of total compensation due in respect of the property in question was BGN 23,604, and that the regional governor was liable for costs. The court also ruled that the applicant was to receive compensation in the form of “housing compensation bonds”, in accordance with his share as an heir. The court went on to state that, as evidenced by the heirs certificate issued in 1994 and presented during the proceedings, the applicant and his brother were the two heirs of the owner of the confiscated property. Consequently, the applicant’s share of the inheritance stemmed directly from the law, which provided that the children of the deceased inherited in equal parts. The decision became enforceable on 6 September 2005.
On 26 June 2006 the applicant transmitted to the regional governor a copy of the final court decision of 19 July 2005, asking that it be enforced. He sent another request to that effect on 8 August 2006.
The deputy regional governor replied in writing on 14 February 2007 that the applicant needed to submit a certified copy of the court decision, as well as a certificate attesting to his status as heir and a declaration certified by a notary.
On 19 February 2007 the applicant submitted a certified copy of the court decision of 19 July 2005. He signalled that enforcement continued to be outstanding and emphasised that he had already submitted a certificate attesting to his status as heir to the regional governor, together with his initial request for compensation of 27 November 1997 (see paragraph 7 above). He also pointed out that it was clear from the judicial decision that the heirs in question were two – himself and a sibling of his; pursuant to section 5(1) of the Inheritance Act 1949 he was eligible to receive half of the inheritance and, therefore, half of the compensation awarded by the court. He sought clarification in respect of the declaration requested by the governor.
The deputy governor replied on 5 March 2007 that the declaration was necessary pursuant to section 5 of Ordinance No. 9 of 1998; the latter governed the conditions and order for the payment of experts included in the list under § 4 of the 1997 Compensation Law.
In the meantime, on 19 January 2007, the applicant requested to be issued with a writ of execution on the basis of the 19 July 2005 judgment and, more specifically, in respect of its part concerning the amount of compensation and his consequent share of it.
On 16 March 2007 he was issued with a writ of execution in respect of the compensation owed to him. On 30 March 2007 he asked the bailiff to start forced enforcement proceedings and to collect the related costs and expenses.
On 3 April 2007 the bailiff sent an invitation for voluntary compliance to the governor, signalling that a failure to act upon the 19 July 2005 decision attracted a pecuniary sanction.
The deputy regional governor replied on 20 April 2007 that the compensation proceedings had not been completed because of the applicant’s failure to submit the requested declaration certified by a notary (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). He also indicated that an original writ of execution was needed in order for his office to pay costs and expenses.
On 25 April 2007 the applicant wrote to the regional governor that the ordinance in question did not apply to his case, as it only concerned situations in which the administrative body itself was called upon to determine the compensation amount. In the applicant’s case that amount had been determined in court, which had also ruled that the applicant and his sibling were the only heirs, and the property had to be evenly split between the two of them.
The bailiff sent another letter to the regional governor on 27 April 2007, inviting him to enforce the court decision. He reiterated that the writ of execution had been issued following a final judicial decision which was binding in respect of the parties and in which the court had established all relevant facts as well as the compensation due to the applicant. The bailiff specified that the costs and expenses which the governor was requested to pay related to the enforcement proceedings, that a writ of execution was not necessary in order to claim or collect those expenses, and that they had increased with the passage of time. Finally, the bailiff reiterated that a weekly fine in the amount of BGN 200 would be imposed on the governor in the event of failure to enforce the court decision.
On 10 May 2007 the regional governor challenged in court the bailiff’s acts. He claimed that the lack of enforcement was caused entirely by the applicant’s refusal to submit the notary declaration. On 2 July 2007 the Sofia City Administrative Court held that the governor’s application for judicial review was inadmissible. The court found in particular that the bailiff’s invitations to the governor for voluntary compliance were not acts of forced enforcement and were not therefore subject to judicial review. This decision was confirmed by the Supreme Administrative Court on 21 December 2007 in a final decision.
As no further action by the regional governor followed, in March 2009 the applicant once again asked the bailiff to enforce the court decision of 19 July 2005. The bailiff wrote to the governor on 31 March 2009, requesting enforcement and with a reminder that failure to enforce could result in weekly fines of BGN 1,200 and in prosecution.
The deputy regional governor replied on 27 April 2009 that the compensation proceedings had not been completed because of the applicant’s failure to submit the requested declaration about his share of the inheritance in accordance with the Inheritance Act 1949. Two days later the regional governor himself fined the applicant BGN 1,000, to be applied weekly.
On 11 May 2009 the applicant challenged the fine in court. The Sofia City Administrative Court quashed the fine on 8 January 2010, finding that in this case the regional governor was not competent to impose fines as he was not an enforcement body but a debtor, and Mr Yanakiev was not a debtor but a creditor.
By a letter of 19 August 2013 the applicant’s lawyer informed the Court that the final court decision of 19 July 2005 remained unenforced.
According to the 1997 Compensation Law, refusal by a regional governor to determine compensation in lieu of restitution under this law are subject to judicial review within fourteen days of their notification to the interested party. When the court upholds a request for compensation under this law, it commissions an expert report and makes a definitive ruling on the request (section 6(6)).
Silence on the part of a regional governor who either fails to pronounce on requests for compensation or to approve the amount of compensation and the shares due, as determined by an expert report, is considered a tacit refusal (section 6(3) and (5)).
The regional governor has to maintain a record of the information she or he transmits to the Privatisation Agency under the Transactions with Compensation Instruments Act 2002, as well as of the certificates for compensatory instruments received and handed over to their owners (section 6(9)).
According to the Transactions with Compensation Instruments Act 2002, the regional governor has to transmit to the Privatisation Agency information about the compensatory instruments which have to be issued. The governor has to do this within seven days, counted from the day a final judgment is received in his or her office for action (section 5(1)).
The Privatisation Agency in turn sends the information about the compensatory instruments that need to be issued to the Central Register (section 5(3)). Within three days of receiving the information under section 5 above, the Central Register registers the compensatory instruments in the name of their owners (section 6(1)). Compensatory instruments are considered issued from the moment of their registration in the Central Register (section 6(2)). The Central Register issues to the regional governor a certificate, evidencing the registration of those instruments in the owners’ accounts (section 7(1)). On the day following the issue of those certificates, the Central Register sends the certificates to the regional governor via the Privatisation Agency (section 7(2)).
The Code of Administrative Procedure (the 2006 Code) was adopted in 2006 and is currently in force. According to Article 271 (1), the body responsible for supervising the forced enforcement of administrative decisions can be (1)  the administrative body which issued, or was obliged to issue, the administrative act upon which individuals or legal entities had to act, or (2)  the bailiff, where it was a public administrative body which had to act in order to implement an administrative decision.
Chapter IV regulates the procedure for forced enforcement where the body which has to implement a judgment is a public one. According to Article 290 of the 2006 Code, if an administrative body obliged by a court judgment to deliver a non-substitutable action fails to act, the bailiff can impose on the responsible official weekly fines of between BGN 50 and BGN 1200 for as long as the act remains uncompleted.
Chapter VI regulates the procedure for challenging the actions or failure to act by the bailiff in the context of forced enforcement (Article 294 of the 2006 Code). Those actions or failure to act can be challenged before the administrative courts (Article 296). A failure of the bailiff to act can be challenged as from the seventh day after the request for action was made to him or her; there is no upper limit on the period within which such a challenge could be brought in court. If the court declares an action or inaction unlawful, it orders the bailiff to carry out specific steps within a fixed time-frame (Article 298 (1)).
In a final judgment of 29 June 2012, the Pleven Administrative Court ordered, under Article 294 of the 2006 Code, a bailiff who had been called upon to enforce a final judgment to continually impose fines under Article 290 of the 2006 Code on the debtor – the municipal agricultural agency – until the latter enforced the judgment. The court ordered the bailiff to do so within a period of seven days (see реш. по а. д. № 447/2012, адм. съд Плевен от 29.06.2012 г.).
Also under Article 294 of the 2006 Code, in three final judgments, respectively of 3 July 2009 and 18 December 2009 by the Smolian Administrative Court, and of 26 March 2012 by the Sofia Administrative Court, the courts quashed bailiffs’ decisions to terminate enforcement proceedings and/or their refusals to open enforcement proceedings against administrative bodies or officials. The courts further ordered the bailiffs to proceed with the forced enforcement which concerned non-substitutable actions that the different officials owed on the basis of final administrative court decisions and had failed to carry out (see реш. № 70 по а. д. № 166/2009, адм. съд Смолян от 03.07.2009 г.; реш. № 179 по а. д. № 352/2009, адм. съд Смолян от 18.12.2012 г.; реш. № 1601 по а. д. № 6021/2010, адм. съд София от 26.03.2012 г.).
In four other final judgments – respectively of 11 January 2012 by the Sofia Administrative Court, of 8 January 2014 by the Smolian Administrative Court, of 9 January 2014 by the Pazardzhik Administrative Court and of 15 June 2015 by the Sofia Administrative Court – the courts dismissed under Article 294 of the 2006 Code the appeals of officials against fines, imposed on them by bailiffs under Article 290 of the 2006 Code for failure to enforce final judgments ordering the officials to carry out a specific non-substitutable action (see реш. № 187 по а. д. № 10030/2011, адм. съд София от 11.01.2012 г.; реш. № 5 по а. д. № 20137230700269/2013, адм. съд Смолян от 08.01.2014 г.; реш. № 2 по а. д. № 31/2014, адм. съд Пазарджик от 09.01.2014 г.; реш. № 4120 по а. д. № 5330/2015, адм. съд София от 15.06.2015 г.).
Section 1(1) of the State and Municipality Responsibility for Damage Act 1988 (the SMRDA) provides, with effect from July 2006, that the municipalities, and not only the State as was the case until then, are liable for damage caused to private individuals and legal entities as a result of unlawful decisions, acts or omissions by their own authorities or officials while discharging their administrative duties.
The domestic courts have sometimes accepted that public authorities could be responsible for damages under section 1 of the SMRDA in cases where they delay or fail to enforce a final judgment (see реш. № 7088 от 31.05.2010 г. по а. д. № 12358/2009, ВАС, confirming реш. № 1075 от 10.11.2008 г. по а. д. № 6339/2007, адм. съд София; see also реш. от 27.04.2009 г. по гр. д. № 71/2009, ОС Разград, in respect of situations where an administrative body had to comply with a final judgment ordering it to open privatisation proceedings). However, in other cases the courts awarded damages not as a result of the lack of enforcement of the judgment but because of the initial quashing of the unlawful administrative act by the court (see реш. № 8204 от 09.06.2011 г. на ВАС; реш. № 2 от 16.07.2010 на адм. съд Габрово; реш. № 782 от 20.12.2008 на адм. съд София област; реш. № 1365 от 10.05.2010 на адм. съд София град; реш. № 4529 от 30.03.2011 на ВАС, in respect of situations where medical commissions’ decisions have been quashed as unlawful). Yet, in a number of other cases the courts rejected such claims, finding that the responsibility of the authorities could not be engaged. The reasons were either that the applicants had omitted to use the enforcement procedure under Articles 290 and 294 of the Code (see реш. № 4730 от 15.08.2012 г. по а. д. № 9471/2010, адм. съд София), or because the authorities were only responsible for damage stemming from their actions or failure to act but not from their tacit refusal to issue an administrative act (see реш. № 1706 от 3.02.2011 г. по а. д. № 9953/2010, ВАC; опр. № 7877 oт 7.06.2013 г. по а. д. 7001/2013, ВАС), or – further still – because no damage could be established as a result of the refusal to provide information (see реш. № 7425 от 30.05.2011 г. на ВАС).
According to section 5(1) of the Inheritance Act, the children of the deceased inherit equal parts of his or her estate.
