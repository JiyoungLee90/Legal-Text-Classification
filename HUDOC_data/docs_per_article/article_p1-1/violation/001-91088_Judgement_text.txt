The case originated in an application (no. 27961/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Tony Booth (“the applicant”), on 25 October 2001.
The applicant was represented by Royds Rdw, solicitors in . The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, .
The applicant complained under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, because he was a man, he was denied social security benefits equivalent to those received by widows.
On 17 November 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning widows’ benefits. Subsequently, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in .
His wife died on 29 October 2000. They had no children from the marriage. His claim for widows’ benefits was made on 2 January 2001 and was rejected on 31 May 2001 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under  law.
The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court’s judgment in the case of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV.
