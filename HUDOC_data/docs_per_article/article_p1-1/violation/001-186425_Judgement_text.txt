The case originated in an application (no. 48616/14) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Franjo Josić (“the applicant”), on 17 June 2014.
The applicant was self-represented. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms B. Skalonjić
On 12 December 2016 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Tuzla.
By judgment of the Mostar Municipal Court of 18 June 2009, which became final on 16 December 2010, company R. was ordered to reinstate the applicant in his previous employment, as well as to pay him a total amount of 16,314 convertible marks (BAM), together with default interest calculated from 20 March 2007 until final payment. The respondent company was further ordered to pay the applicant BAM 2,641 in respect of legal costs, together with default interest calculated from 18 June 2009 until final payment. Lastly, the respondent company was ordered to cover all pension-related contributions in respect of the applicant between 1 January 2003 and 17 January 2007.
On 17 October 2011 the Municipal Court issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju) in this regard.
On 23 February 2012, upon the applicant’s request, the Municipal Court amended its decision of 17 October 2011 by changing the object of enforcement.
On 16 January 2012 the Municipal Court requested the respondent to indicate why it had not reinstated the applicant. On 23 January 2012 it fined the respondent in this connection.
On 1 February 2013 the Municipal Court joined the enforcement proceedings in the applicant’s case with an earlier enforcement procedure against the respondent.
On 25 June 2014 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina found a violation of the applicant’s right to enforcement within a reasonable time, and ordered the Municipal Court to urgently finalise the enforcement proceedings. The Constitutional Court considered this to be sufficient just satisfaction and rejected the applicant’s claim for non-pecuniary damage. The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant on 15 August 2014.
On 18 March 2015 the Municipal Court ordered the sale of the respondent’s property. On 27 April 2015 it transferred the respondent’s real estate to company H., the highest ranked judgment creditor. The applicant did not lodge an appeal against this decision.
On 29 March 2016 the Mostar Cantonal Court quashed the decision of the Municipal Court of 27 April 2015 and remitted the case for reconsideration.
According to the latest information provided by the parties on 28 July 2017, on that date the enforcement proceedings in the applicant’s case were still pending.
