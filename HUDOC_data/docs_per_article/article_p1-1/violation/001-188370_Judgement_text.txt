The case originated in three applications (nos. 34248/05, 46745/06 and 28424/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Russian nationals (“the applicants”) Mr A.Shapkin, Mr N. Ramazanov and Mr K. Kulnyev on 29 July 2005, 18 October 2006 and 17 May 2007 respectively.
In a judgment delivered on 15 March 2016, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention on account of the quashing by way of supervisory review proceedings of the judgments in the applicants’ favour.
On 19 September 2017 one of the applicants, Mr Shapkin, indicated that when reading the Bulletin of the European Court (Russian version) he found out about the delivery of a judgment in his case. The applicant indicated that except the initial letters sent in 2005, he had received no correspondence from the Court ever since in relation to these proceedings. Consequently, the applicant was deprived of an opportunity to respond to the Government’s observations. He requested revision of the judgment as regards the non-allocation of sums under Article 41 of the Convention.
On 7 November 2017 the Court decided to grant the request for revision under Rule 80 § 4 of the Rules of Court and communicate it to the Government, while inviting the applicant to submit his just satisfaction claims. Those observations were received on 24 January 2018 and 1 March 2018 respectively.
