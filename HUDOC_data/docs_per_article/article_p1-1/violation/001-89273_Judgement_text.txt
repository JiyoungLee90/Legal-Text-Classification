The case originated in an application (no. 43774/02) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Ms Olimpia-Maria Teodorescu (“the applicant”), on 18 November 2002.
The applicant died on 31 August 2004. On 12 June 2007, her son, 
Mr Mircea-Decebal-Nicolae Teodorescu, expressed his wish to pursue the application. For practical reasons, Ms Olimpia-Maria Teodorescu 
will continue to be called “the applicant” in this judgment, although 
Mr Mircea-Decebal-Nicolae Teodorescu is now to be regarded as such (see Dalban v.  [GC], no. 28114/95, § 1, ECHR 1999VI).
The applicant was represented by Mr S. Diaconescu, a lawyer practising in . The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu.
On 11 April 2007 the President of the Third Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility
The applicant was born in 1908 and lived in Sebeş.
In 1950, a house and 1,460 sq. m of appurtenant land situated in
On 24 July 1996 the applicant claimed compensation for the property under Law no. 112/1995. She states that she has not received any compensation.
On an unknown date the property was divided into several parts. It appears from the documents in the file that the property, made up of two constructions and appurtenant land, was divided into five apartments and two plots of appurtenant land of 1,058 sq. m and 116 sq. m respectively.
On 31 October, 15 November and 10 December 1996, and 3 February and 27 March 1997 the State sold the five apartments to the then tenants. It appears from the file that the two plots of appurtenant land were not made the object of a sale.
On 3 March 2000 the Cluj Court of Appeal by a final decision allowed the applicant’s action for annulment of the State’s title to property, acknowledged that the nationalisation of the building and of the 1,460 sq. m of land appurtenant to it had been unlawful and ordered restoration in the name of the applicant’s parents.
On 4 June 2001 the applicant requested the court to find that the sales by the State on 10 December 1996 and 3 February 1997 of apartments nos. 1 and 2 respectively, situated on Calea Turzii no. 28, were null and void. According to the applicant, she did not request the annulment of the sale of the other apartments, considering the action pointless in so far as the constant practice was to dismiss this kind of action.
On 4 September and on 27 November 2002 respectively the Cluj Court of Appeal by final decisions dismissed the two actions by the applicant to declare null and void the sales by the State. The court considered that the sales had complied with the provisions of Law no. 112/1995 and that the former tenants had made the purchase in good faith.
On 2 August 2001 the applicant made two different requests under the Law no. 10/2001 governing immovable property wrongfully seized by the State, seeking restitution in kind or compensation of the parts of her property situated in Cluj, Calea Turzii nos. 26 and 28 and of the appurtenant land.
On 12 June 2007 the Cluj-Napoca Town Council, by two decisions, proposed that the applicant be given compensation under Law no. 247/2005. The Town Council mentioned that the apartments and the land claimed in kind were in the possession of third parties.
So far, she has not received any compensation.
