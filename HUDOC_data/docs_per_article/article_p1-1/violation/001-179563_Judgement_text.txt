The case originated in an application (no. 50877/06) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Sergey Vladimirovich Sashchenko (“the applicant”), on 20 November 2006.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 18 May 2015 the complaint concerning non-enforcement of the domestic judicial decision in the applicant’ favour was communicated to the Government in accordance with the pilot judgment Burdov v. Russia (no. 2) (no. 33509/04, ECHR 2009), and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government later informed the Court that the non-enforcement of the judgment in the applicant’ favour was, inter alia, due to the applicant’ behaviour. The Court therefore decided to resume examination of the present application.
The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Nizhniy Novgorod.
On 25 October 2002 the Military Court of the Vladikavkaz Garrison (“the Military Court”) ordered, inter alia, the head of the respondent military institute to re-calculate the period of the applicant’s service, applying the favourable terms of such calculation for a specified period of service. The applicant was also awarded some additional allowances and payments for certain periods.
The judgment came into force on 5 November 2002.
On 3 March 2003 the Military Court issued a writ of execution. On 4 August 2003 the bailiffs’ service instituted the enforcement proceedings.
On 19 September 2003 the enforcement proceedings were terminated and the writ of execution was returned to the applicant, as the debt could not be recovered.
On 13 November 2003 the head of the respondent military institute issued Order No. 463 requiring to make payments in accordance with the judgment of 25 October 2002. However, no calculations or payments were made at that time.
On 4 February 2005 the applicant submitted the writ of execution to the Federal Treasury.
On 18 May 2005 the writ was returned to the applicant on the ground that the judgment obliged an official of an organisation to take certain actions rather than ordered to recover payments from a budgetary organisation. Thus, the writ of execution was to be submitted to the bailiffs’ service.
On an unspecified date in 2005 the applicant submitted the writ of execution to the bailiffs’ service.
On 14 April 2006 the writ of execution was returned to the applicant from the bailiffs’ service without enforcement. The bailiffs explained that for the applicant to be able to receive the payments under the judgment, he should obtain a writ of execution stating the sum of the debt to be recovered. After that, the writ could be submitted to the Federal Treasury for enforcement.
In 2005 in accordance with Order No. 463, the defendant military institute calculated the amounts due to the applicant as follows: the compensation for the supplementary ration for the period from October 1998 until March 2000 –11,341.85 Russian roubles (RUB); allowance for special regime of the service in 1998-2002 – RUB 2,720.1; and special allowance – RUB 327,000. In total: RUB 341,061.95.
