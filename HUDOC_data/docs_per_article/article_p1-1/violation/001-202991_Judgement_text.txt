The present case concerns the applicant’s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 regarding the domestic courts’ refusal to award her a social allowance, to which she was entitled under domestic law. The applicant also raised a related complaint under Article 13 of the Convention.
The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Bilgorod-Dnistrovskyy, Odessa Region. The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr Y. Boychenko, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg, France.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
From 1988 until 2006 the applicant was employed as a teacher in a State institution, a specialised child-care centre (“the centre”). Under Article 57 of the 1991 Education Act, as in force at the material time, she was entitled to seniority and recreation allowances. However, between 1997 and 2002 she did not receive those allowances.
On 3 December 2007 the applicant lodged a claim with the domestic courts against the centre and the regional department of the State Treasury
On 28 October 2010 the Bilgorod-Dnistrovskyy Town Court (“the Town Court”) partly allowed the claim, found that the applicant was entitled to the seniority and recreation allowances and that the centre was in arrears in respect of the sum due to her, and ordered it to pay her UAH 2,244.30 in arrears, UAH 4,336.17 (by way of an index-linked adjustment), and UAH 1,400 in legal costs. The court held that since the failure on the part of the centre to pay to the applicant the above arrears had been due to a lack of funding from the State budget, the centre was in turn entitled to lodge a claim with the courts for the recovery of the arrears in question from the State budget. The applicant’s claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damage was dismissed.
On 29 April 2011 the Odessa Regional Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) quashed the above judgment and dismissed the applicant’s claim. It found that (i) from 1988 until 2006 the applicant had worked in the centre, which under domestic law had dual status as a healthcare and an educational institution, and (ii) in 1997-2002 she had not received the allowances due to her under Article 57 of the Education Act; the resulting arrears owed to her amounted to UAH 2,244.30. It furthermore held that under the 2004 Act on the Restructuring of Indebtedness under Article 57 of the Education Act (“the 2004 Act”), payments provided for by Article 57 in respect of the relevant period were recognised as a debt to be paid by the State from the State budget. The arrears due to the applicant recovered from the centre by the Town Court had therefore constituted a debt to be paid from the State budget and not by the centre, which had not received the relevant funds from the budget. As regards the regional department of the State Treasury, the court found that it was not a proper defendant, suggesting that its authority did not extend to that of making the above-mentioned payments. Lastly, the court dismissed the part of the applicant’s claim relating to the index-linking of the arrears and the compensation for non-pecuniary damage, stating that such payments were not provided by the 2004 Act.
On 21 July 2011 the Higher Specialised Civil and Criminal Court declined to examine the merits of an appeal lodged by the applicant on points of law.
Article 57 of the 1991 Education Act (repealed on 5 September 2017) provided at the material time for a seniority allowance for teachers, depending on the length of employment, as well as a recreation allowance.
The applicant provided copies of decisions delivered by the Court of Appeal dated 12 February 2004 and 22 February 2011, by which it had upheld judgments given by the Town Court allowing the claims of two employees of the centre against it for the recovery of seniority and recreation allowance arrears due to them under Article 57 of the Education Act for periods between 1997 and 2003. The Court of Appeal held that the Education Act did not provide that the payment of the allowances under Article 57 was conditional on the availability of the relevant funds in the State budget and ordered the centre to make the payments to the claimants.
