In support of his claim to ownership, the applicant produced copies of the original title deeds and a cadastral plan on which his lands were marked in red. He specified that the plots of land described in paragraph 8 (a) and (k) above belonged to his father, who had transferred them to him on 10 April 1997 and 23 June 1995 respectively. Plot (a) was land which could be developed, located 150 metres from the road connecting  and Larnaca.
The applicant had been forced to leave his properties by reason of the 1974 Turkish invasion, his lands being located in the area which was under the occupation and overall control of the Turkish military authorities.

In December 1992 the applicant took part in a peaceful march to the Saint Epiphanios church, which was located in the occupied part of  in the vicinity of the Athienou village.

On 13 December 1992 the applicant and approximately 200 other persons left Athienou and reached the UN buffer zone, where they were stopped by the UN forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP). UNFICYP officials informed the applicant and the other demonstrators that in the absence of an authorisation from the Turkish-Cypriot authorities their security could not be guaranteed. The applicant and his fellow demonstrators had to abandon their plan to reach the Saint Epiphanios church.
