The case originated in an application (no. 31836/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Bulgarian nationals, Mrs Todorka Atanasova Kirova, Mr Atanas Hristov Kovachev and Mrs Kristina Hristova Kovacheva (“the applicants”), on 23 July 2004.
The applicants were represented by Mrs S. Margaritova-Vuchkova, a lawyer practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Dimova of the Ministry of Justice.
The first applicant alleged, in particular, that she had been deprived of her property in violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. The remaining applicants alleged violations of Article 8 of the Convention.
On 3 April 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
Zdravka Kalaydjieva, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the case. On 30 January 2009 the Government appointed in her stead Pavlina Panova as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1 of the Rules of the Court).
The applicants were born in 1953, 1975 and 1974 respectively and live in . The first applicant is the mother of the second and the third applicants.
In 1984 the first applicant bought from the  municipality a tworoom apartment of 61 square metres.
The apartment had been confiscated by the State from Mr S.M. who in 1983 had been convicted of espionage and treason and sentenced to imprisonment and confiscation of his property. In a judgment of 20 April 1990 the Supreme Court quashed Mr S.M.’s conviction finding that the courts had breached the relevant procedural rules.
In 1997 Mr S.M. brought rei vindicatio proceedings against the first applicant.
In a final judgment of 16 April 2004 the Supreme Court of Cassation allowed the claim. It found that the contract by virtue of which the first applicant had acquired the flat at issue in 1984 had not been signed by the mayor, as required by law, but by another official in the municipality. This rendered the first applicant’s title null and void ab initio. She could not have acquired the apartment through adverse possession either as prior to 1996 State property could not be acquired in this way. The apartment had therefore remained State-owned and the judgment of 20 April 1990 had had the effect of restoring Mr S.M.’s title over it.
In August 2004 the applicants, who all lived in the apartment, vacated it. The first and second applicants rented another apartment and moved in there.
In April 2004 they applied for the tenancy of a municipal apartment and in June 2007 were offered a two-room flat in the outskirts of the city. They refused the offer.
In May 2004 the first applicant applied to receive compensation bonds under the 1997 Law on Compensation for Owners of Nationalised Real Property. According to the latest information available to the Court, as of October 2008, the regional governor had not yet decided on the request.
These have been outlined in the Court’s judgment in the case of Velikovi and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 43278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01 and 194/02, 15 March 2007.
As regards compensation through housing bonds, it was provided for in the Law on Compensation for Owners of Nationalised Real Property of 1997 (“the Compensation Law”). By section 5(3) of this Law, persons who had lost their dwellings pursuant to section 7 of the Restitution Law could also receive such bonds.
Under Bulgarian civil law a contract which is null and void is deemed to have never given rise to any rights and obligations of the parties. There is no time limit for declaring a contract null and void.
Prior to 1996 State property could not be acquired through adverse possession.
A number of offences of a political character, including espionage and treason, committed prior to December 1989, were amnestied by virtue of the Amnesty Law. It provided also that any property confiscated from persons convicted for these offences was to be returned, provided that it was still owned by the State; where it had become private property, the interested persons were to receive monetary compensation or other property.
The Law on the Enforcement of Sentences 1969 provides that where a confiscation has been enforced and subsequently quashed, any property confiscated is to be returned (section 151); where it is not possible to return it, the interested persons are to receive its market value.
