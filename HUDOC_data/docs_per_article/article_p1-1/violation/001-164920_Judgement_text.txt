The case originated in two applications (nos. 21497/13 and 21907/13) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Radoslav Jovanović, on 13 March 2013.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Ms V. Rodić.
On 16 September 2014 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
