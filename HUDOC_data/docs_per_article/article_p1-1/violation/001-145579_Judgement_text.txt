The case originated in 31 applications against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Ukrainian and Russian (application no. 54769/08) nationals as well as companies based in Ukraine, Cyprus (application no. 23581/03) and Romania (application no. 22422/05). The details of the applicants are specified in the appended table (“the applicants”).
In application no. 34384/05 the applicant died in course of the proceedings before the Court. The next of kin of the applicant expressed the wish to maintain the application of their deceased family member.
In application no. 54769/08 one of the applicants, Ms Klavdiya Nikolayevna Galayda, died in course of the proceedings before the Court. No one expressed the wish to maintain her application.
In application no. 26330/09 a court decision was delivered in favour of the applicant’s deceased father in law. The applicant, providing documents in support, claims to be his lawful successor in title.
In application no. 30843/08 the court decisions were delivered in favour of the legal entity which was later liquidated. The applicant company, providing documents in support, claims to be its lawful successor in title.
On 10 April 2012 the Court, having accepted the unilateral declarations of the Government in applications nos. 23056/07 and 24245/10, decided to strike these applications out of its list of cases.
On various dates following the decision to strike out the applications nos. 23056/07 and 24245/10, the applicants informed the Court that Government had paid the compensation amount, but had failed to enforce the judgments of the domestic courts. In particular, in application no. 23056/07 the applicant complains of non-enforcement of the judgment of the Shevchenkivskyy District Court of Kyiv dated 4 February 2005 and in application no. 24245/10 the applicant complains of non-enforcement of the judgment of the Oleksandriya Court dated 22 October 2010.
The applicants requested, therefore, to restore their applications in the Court’s list of cases.
The applicants’ letters were sent to the respondent Government for comments.  In their replies the Government confirmed that the relevant judgments of the domestic courts remained unenforced. According to information provided by the Government in their letter dated 19 September 2013 and in view of the judgment of the Shevchenkivskyy District Court of Kyiv adopted on 9 July 2013 and annexed to that letter, the enforcement proceedings which were the subject matter of application no. 23056/07 were terminated on 17 April 2013 (decision fully enforced).
On 28 May 2013 (in application no. 23056/07) and on 17 December 2013 (in application no. 24245/10) the Court decided to grant the requests of the applicants and to restore the applications to the Court’s list of cases in accordance with Rule 43 § 5 of the Rules of Court.
The applications listed in the Appendix to the present judgment were communicated to the Government on various dates.
The Government were represented by their Agent.
The Cypriot and Romanian Governments, having been informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings in respect of the applicants in applications nos. 23581/03 (lodged by a legal entity registered in Cyprus) and 22422/05 (lodged by a legal entity registered in Romania), indicated that they did not wish to exercise that right.
On the dates set out in the appended table domestic courts delivered decisions according to which the applicants were entitled to various pecuniary amounts or to have certain actions taken in their favour. The decisions became final and enforceable. However, the applicants were unable to obtain the enforcement of the decisions in due time.
Some of the applicants also made submissions concerning factual and legal matters unrelated to the above non-enforcement issues.
