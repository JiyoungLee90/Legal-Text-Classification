The case originated in an application (no. 23785/07) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Slovak nationals, Ms Margita Bukovčanová (“the first applicant”), Mr Jozef Fedeleš (“the second applicant”), Ms Viera Šefčíková (“the third applicant”), and Mr Jozef Fedeleš junior (“the fourth applicant”), on 1 June 2007.
The applicants were represented by Mr R. Procházka, a lawyer practising in Bratislava. The Government of the Slovak Republic (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms. M. Pirošíková.
The applicants alleged that the rent-control scheme had imposed restrictions on their right to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
By a decision of 4 January 2012, the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicants and the Government each submitted further written observations (Rule 59 § 1) on the merits and just satisfaction, and replied in writing to each other’s observations.
The applicants were born in 1952, 1947, 1973 and 1980 respectively and live in Bratislava.
They are co-owners of a residential house located in the Bratislava-Staré Mesto municipality. The house was built in 1929 by their familial predecessors, who during the previous regime donated it to the State under circumstances that would later be accepted as constituting duress. The ownership of the house was restored to the first and second applicants on 10 December 1991 under special legislation on restitution. Consequently, each of them acquired a 4/12 share of the ownership of the house. The third and fourth applicants each acquired a 2/12 share of the ownership of the house on 25 January 1995 and 29 March 1999 respectively.
At the time the applicants acquired the ownership of the house five flats were inhabited by tenants with regulated rent. Under the relevant legislation this meant that (i) the applicants had to accept that their flats were occupied by these tenants, (ii) they could charge them no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the State, (iii) they could not unilaterally terminate the leases, and (iv) they could not sell the flats other than to the tenants (“the rent-control scheme”).
The rent-control scheme applies, or has applied, to the flats in question, as follows: a four-room flat with a surface area of 129 sq. m which had been subject to rent control until January 2006 (“the first flat”); a four-room flat with a surface area of 130 sq. m which had been subject to rent control until September 2008 (“the second flat”); a two-room flat with a surface area of 87 sq. m and two four-room flats measuring 126 sq. m each (“the third, fourth and fifth flats”), to which rent control still applies.
The monthly rent chargeable for the flats under the applicable legislation was equivalent to some 10 to 17.5 euros (EUR) between 1992 and 1999. After several increases in the regulated rent, in June 2007 the applicants were able to charge some EUR 73.5 monthly in respect of the two-room flat and approximately EUR 125 monthly in respect of the fourroom flats. According to the Government’s calculations the regulated rent reached EUR 236 and EUR 400 respectively in 2014.
The parties provided differing figures as to the market rent.
The applicants relied on data from the National Association of Real Estate Agencies (“the NAREA”) and claimed that the monthly market rent for comparable tworoom flats in the area reached around EUR 662 and for comparable fourroom flats some EUR 1,296 between 2004 and 2007.
The Government submitted an expert valuation according to which the monthly market rent for the applicants’ flats in 2010 amounted to EUR 561 and EUR 772 to EUR 797 respectively.
The relevant domestic law and practice governing the rent-control scheme in Slovakia and its historical background are set out in the case of Bittó and Others v. Slovakia ((merits), no. 30255/09, §§ 716, 3272, 28 January 2014).
On 15 September 2011, the Termination and Settlement of Tenancy (Certain Apartments) Act (“Law no. 260/2011”) came into force. It was enacted with a view to eliminating rent restrictions concerning individual owners.
Its provisions are applicable, in particular, to individual apartments whose rent has so far been regulated. In those cases, landlords were entitled to give notice of termination of a tenancy contract by 31 March 2012. Such termination of tenancy takes effect after a twelve-month notice period. However, if a tenant is exposed to material hardship, he or she will be able to continue to use the apartment with regulated rent, even after the expiry of the notice period, until a new tenancy contract with a municipality has been set up. Law no. 260/2011 further entitles landlords to increase the rent by 20% once a year until 2015.
Municipalities are obliged to provide a person exposed to material hardship with a municipal apartment with regulated rent. If a municipality does not comply with that obligation by 31 December 2016 in a given case, the landlord can claim the difference between the free-market rent and the regulated rent.
Law no. 150/2013 amends the earlier legislation on the Housing Development State Fund. It took effect on 1 January 2014. Among other things, with reference to Law no. 260/2011 it entitles owners of houses or flats which have been restored to their original owners to apply for a preferential loan for the purpose of modernisation of such buildings.
In Bittó and Others ((merits), cited above), the Court found that the application of the rent-control scheme in respect of the applicants’ property constituted a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. In the relevant part of its judgment under Article 46 of the Convention it held that:
“133. [Its] conclusion ... as regards the effects of the rent-control scheme on the applicants’ right to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions suggests that the violation found originated in a problem arising out of the state of the Slovakian legislation and practice, which has affected a number of flat owners to whom the rent-control scheme has applied .... The Court further notes that 13 other applications concerning the same issue are pending before it which concern some 170 persons.
It is true that measures have been taken with a view to gradually improving the situation of landlords. Thus, as a result of the introduction of Law no. 216/2011, the controlled rent could be increased by 20% every year as from the end of 2011. Where a municipality has not provided tenants exposed to material hardship with a dwelling by the end of 2016, the landlords will have the right to claim the difference between the free-market rent and the controlled rent ... Thus those measures provide for a complete elimination of the effects on flat owners of rent-control only as from 2017, and they do not address the situation existing prior to their adoption.
The Court considers that further measures should be taken in order to achieve compliance with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. To prevent future findings of infringement of that provision, the respondent State should introduce, as soon as possible, a specific and clearly regulated compensatory remedy in order to provide genuine effective relief for the breach found.”
Implementation of the judgment in Bittó and Others is still pending.
