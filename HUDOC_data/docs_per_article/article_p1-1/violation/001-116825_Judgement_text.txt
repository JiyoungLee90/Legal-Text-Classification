The case originated in an application (no. 34703/04) against the Russian Federation lodged on 10 August 2004 with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Russian nationals, Mr Aleksandr Ivanovich Fomin, Ms Tamara Ivanovna Fomina, Ms Tatyana Aleksandrovna Fomina, Ms Yulia Aleksandrovna Fomina (“the first”, “the second”, “the third” and “the fourth” applicant), who were born in 1938, 1946, 1970, and 1976 respectively, and live in Magnitogorsk, Chelyabinsk Region. On 30 March 2011 the Court received a power of attorney issued in the first applicant’s name by Ms Olga Aleksandrovna Fomina, born in 1976 (“the fifth applicant”), whose name was also mentioned in subsequent submissions. In the course of the proceedings before the Court, the third, fourth and fifth applicants got married and changed their names to Ms Tatyana Aleksandrovna Gnatyuk, Ms Yulia Aleksandrovna Minkina and Ms Olga Aleksandrovna Ilyina respectively.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyusknin, the Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
In particular the applicants alleged that their property rights had been violated on account of the failure of the State to redeem governmental bonds.
On 8 December 2010 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
On an unspecified date the first applicant bought 1982 State premium bonds (облигации Государственного внутреннего выигрышного займа 1982 года), which were issued by the USSR Government in 1982 in order to finance certain State programmes. It was stipulated at the time of issue that the bonds would be redeemed by 2004 at the latest.
In 1992, the Government of the Russian Federation acknowledged their succession in respect of the USSR’s obligations under the 1982 loan and suspended payments under the 1982 State premium bonds.
Subsequently, the first applicant converted all but forty-four 1982 State premium bonds into 235 1992 Russian bonds.
Between 1995 and 2000, a series of legislative and regulatory acts was enacted providing for the conversion of Soviet securities, including 1982 State premium bonds, into special Russian promissory notes. The Government were mandated to devise a procedure for the conversion and to fix the value of the promissory notes. Although regulations on the conversion were adopted in 2000, the actual conversion did not start and application of the regulations remained suspended.
The first applicant brought proceedings before the Ordzhonikidzevskiy District Court of Magnitogorsk, seeking redemption of his 1992 Russian bonds and affirmation that the forty-four 1982 State premium bonds had retained their purchase power.
On 28 March 2005 the court granted the claim in part, declaring that the 1982 bonds had retained their value and purchase power proportionate to the  currency exchange rate in 1990. The judgment entered into force.
The first applicant immediately brought proceedings before the Pravoberezhniy District Court of Magnitogorsk to recover the value of nine of his 1982 State bonds.
By a judgment of 17 May 2005 the court dismissed the claim, finding that the Government had not yet developed a conversion mechanism for the bonds. On 21 July 2005 the judgment was upheld on appeal by the .
At the present time the first applicant holds nine 1982 State premium bonds with a nominal value of 450 roubles.
On 20 June 1997 the Pravoberezhniy District Court of Magnitogorsk ordered the debtor, M., to repay the applicants 1,100,000 Russian roubles (RUB).
On 20 June 2003 the same court awarded the applicants interest on the unpaid debt in the amount of RUB 1,100,000.
Following the bailiff’s failure to recover the debt, in 2003 the applicants brought a civil claim against M., seeking determination of his share in a flat that he owned jointly with his spouse and child, and its seizure to enforce the court decisions.
On 21 October 2003 the Ordzhonikidzevskiy District Court of Magnitogorsk disallowed the claim on the ground that the flat was M.’s only housing and hence could not be seized for recovery of the debt.
By a decision of 19 February 2004 the  upheld the judgment on appeal.
