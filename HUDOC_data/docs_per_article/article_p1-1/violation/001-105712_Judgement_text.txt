The case originated in an application (no. 43590/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Ms Veska Dimitrova Stoycheva (“the applicant”), on 23 November 2004.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mrs S. Stefanova and Mr M. Ekimdzhiev, lawyers practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs R. Nikolova of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged that the authorities’ failure to enforce the final court judgment of 1997 restoring her property rights over a plot of land deprived her of her right to the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions. She relied on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 13 of the Convention.
On 11 December 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1). The application was subsequently assigned to the Fourth Section following the recomposition of the Court’s Sections on 1 February 2011.
The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in .
The applicant’s father owned one quarter of a plot of land with a total surface area of 2,184 square metres, situated in . In the period between 1954 and 1956 the plot was expropriated for public use. In 1956 the applicant’s father received, as compensation for the expropriation, a plot of land in the same area, which he sold in 1957 to a third person.
On 8 April 1992, after the entry into force of the Law on the Restitution of Property Expropriated under Building Planning Legislation (“the 1992 Law” – see paragraph 26 below), the applicant submitted a request to the mayor of Plovdiv (“the mayor”) for the revocation of the expropriation and the restitution of the expropriated property to her as an heir of the person from whom it had been expropriated.
The mayor dismissed her request, finding that the property could not be restored to the applicant as a bridge had been built over it.
The applicant appealed to the . In the course of the proceedings, in 1995, a court-appointed expert concluded that the public works for the purposes of which the property had been expropriated had affected only part of it, leaving 1,500 square metres that could be restored to the original owners. The expert opinion was accompanied by several plans.
In a judgment of 23 October 1997, the  set aside the expropriation order in respect of one quarter of 1,500 square metres of the property, within the specific boundaries marked on a plan provided by the above expert (“the 1995 plan”). This plan was an inseparable part of the court’s judgment. Neither party submitted a petition for review (cassation).
The court did not examine the issue of the compensation that the applicant’s father had received for the expropriation, nor was this issue raised by the municipality during the course of the proceedings or at any time after. It appears that the applicant did not return this compensation. It also appears that after the judgment of 23 October 1997 came into effect, the municipality never challenged, on that basis or on any other grounds, the applicant’s ownership of the one quarter of the plot of 1,500 square metres that had to be returned to her.
Subsequently, in January 1998, 1999 and 2000 the applicant filed several requests with the  municipality inviting the latter to execute the judgment of 1997 and, in particular, to register the returned property in the land register.
The municipality discovered that the 1995 plan did not correspond to the current urban plan and that it contained a number of technical errors. These defects made it technically impossible to register the returned property in the land register. Therefore, on 9 November 1999 the municipality requested that the  rectify these defects, which it apparently refused to do.
In September and November 2000 the municipality informed the applicant that a procedure for the modification of the land register under section 32(1)(2) of the Zone Plan Act had been started, but because of a number of technical errors in the 1995 plan, which the Regional Court had refused to rectify, it was impossible to issue an up-to-date plan. The applicant was advised to request the expert who prepared the 1995 plan to provide the information missing therein.
In a letter dated 26 July 2002 the municipality again informed the applicant that the property could not be registered in the land register because of the defects in the 1995 plan and advised her that registration might become possible if the boundaries of the property were determined and marked on the spot (да се заснемат на място материализирани грaници). In this connection, it was open to her to request the assistance of an enforcement judge.
Meanwhile, the applicant had requested the issuing of a writ for the execution of the judgment of 1997. Her request was rejected by both the  and the  in a final decision of 24 September 2002. The courts held that judgments in respect of restitution of properties were not subject to enforcement as their purpose was the transformation of a right (имат конститутивен ефект) and did not include an order to act. The 1992 Law did not provide for the enforcement of final decisions or judgments by an enforcement judge.
On 2 December 2002 the applicant requested the  to interpret its judgment of 1997 and to indicate a method for its execution. A hearing was scheduled for 14 April 2003. The outcome of these proceedings is not clear.
On 13 March 2003, upon the request of a co-owner of the plot at issue, the municipality instituted a procedure for the modification of the land register in order to register a new plot which appeared to be almost identical to the one which had been returned in part to the applicant in 1997.
On several occasions in February and May 2004 the applicant requested that the municipality mark the boundaries of her property on the spot (трасиране на имота) or issue a certificate (служебна бележка) to that effect. In reply, the municipality informed her that this was within the competence of the local land registry office and reminded her that the procedure for the entry of the property in the land register had not yet been completed.
Meanwhile, on 21 April 2004 the applicant filed an application in which she objected to the amendments to the land register and reiterated her request for the marking of the boundaries. On 20 May 2004 the municipality dismissed the applicant’s objection as she had not identified any procedural violations.
On 4 June 2004 the mayor gave his approval for the abovementioned amendment to the land register.
On 15 June 2004 the applicant appealed stating that she “did not agree with the proposed amendment” and reiterating her request for the marking of the property’s boundaries. The appeal was dismissed by the municipal authorities as no specific procedural breaches had been challenged.
On 19 August 2004 a deed establishing omissions or errors in the cadastral maps (акт за непълноти и грешки в кадастралния план) was issued, providing for the registration, pursuant to the mayor’s decision of 4 June 2004, of a new property in the land registry. In the deed, the applicant was listed as one of the co-owners of the property, along with three other individuals and the municipality. It is not clear whether this modification was carried out in accordance with the judgment of 1997 and the boundaries determined by the 1995 plan.
Relying on the deed of 19 August 2004, on 1 October 2004 the mayor approved the amendment to the land register. The applicant was informed that she could object within fourteen days. It is not clear whether she did so.
The parties have not informed the Court of any subsequent developments after 2004, despite its explicit request to that effect.
In 1992 the Law on the Restitution of Property Expropriated under Building Planning Legislation (Закон за възстановяване на собствеността върху някои отчуждени имоти по ЗТСУ, ЗПИНМ, ЗБНМ, ЗДИ и ЗС, “the 1992 Law”) was enacted. It provided for the restitution of expropriated property where no construction project had been effected and where certain other specific conditions had been met. The request for restitution had to be lodged with the mayor of the municipality, whose refusal could be appealed against to the . The mayor’s decision was binding on all State authorities (paragraph 1(2) of the additional provisions).
Owners who had received compensation at the time of expropriation were required to return the compensation in order for the restitution order to enter into force (section 6). In their practice, the domestic courts have held, however, that when deciding on the request for revocation of the expropriation, the administrative organs or courts are not obliged to rule on the question of whether the compensation received for the expropriation has been returned because the duty to do so flows directly from the law (Реш. № 239 от 17.03.1994 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 3585/1999 г.; Реш. № 5425 от 19.10.1999 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 3165/1999 г.). Therefore, the return of compensation was not a precondition for the revocation but, rather, a consequence of the revocation taking effect (Реш. № 9299 от 5.12.2001 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 4699/2001 г., to the contrary see Реш. № 3377 от 21.06.1999 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 2047/1999 г).
On the other hand, section 7(2) of the 1992 Law provided that if another property had been received as compensation for an expropriation and had subsequently been transferred to a third person, revocation of the expropriation could not be granted, unless the property received in compensation had been returned to the person requesting the expropriation, who could then return it to the State. In their practice, the domestic courts have held that where another property has been received as compensation for an expropriation and has then been sold to a third party and therefore cannot be returned to the State, revocation of an expropriation cannot be granted. An objection to this effect has often been raised by municipalities or prosecutors taking part in proceedings as third parties acting in the interest of the State (Реш. № 5231 от 12.10.1999 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 2890/1999 г.; Реш. № 3041 от 09.06.1999 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 1210/1999 г.). In one case, the Supreme Court of Cassation held that the issue of compensation under section 7(2) of the 1992 Law had to be examined proprio motu by the administrative authorities competent to revoke the expropriation and by the courts which dealt with appeals against refusals of revocation (Реш. № 674 от 08.02.2001 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 6979/2000 г.).
Bulgarian restitution legislation, including the 1992 Law, does not provide for any specific procedure for the execution of decisions or judgments returning expropriated property to its former owners.
Section 64(1) of the Municipal Property Act of 1996 provides that municipal properties which have been returned to their former owners and which no longer belong to the municipality should be struck out of the municipal property register (актови книги) and possession thereof passed to their former owner.
The land register is a land survey information system which consists of registers and cadastral maps.
At the relevant time the adoption and modification of the land register were governed by the Common Cadastre of the People’s Republic of Bulgaria Act of 1979 (“the CCPRBA”) and the Regulations on its implementation (“the Regulations”).
The CCPRBA and the Regulations provided that the land register should contain information, inter alia, about the boundaries, surface area and type of plots of land, any construction(s) on these plots and ownership rights over them. Most of this information had to be provided in the deeds and contracts concerning immovable property, such as notary deeds, sales contracts, etc. All of these deeds and contracts had to be accompanied by a plan issued by the regional land register service (section 34 of the Regulations). The state authorities and domestic courts were under an obligation to inform the land register officials, inter alia, of all changes in the ownership and the boundaries of private properties which had come to their knowledge. These changes had to be duly entered in the land registers and maps (sections 13 and 14 of the CCPRBA).
On 1 January 2001 the CCPRBA was replaced by the Cadastre and Property Register Act (“the CPRA”), which clarified and expanded the provisions in respect of the land register. Section 49b, in force since 2004, provides that for the issuance of notary deeds and other acts concerning the rights over immovable property a plan, namely, a copy taken from the cadastral maps is necessary. The same is provided in section 2(3) of Ordinance No. 3 of 28 April 2005 (Наредба № 3 от 28.04.2005 г. за съдържанието, създаването и поддържането на кадастралната карта и кадастралните регистри), which governs the keeping of the cadastral maps and registers.
Under section 32 of the Building Planning Act (“the BPA”) (Закон за териториално селищното устройство), in force between 1973 and 2001, amendments to the different zone plans could be made, inter alia, in cases of errors and omissions in these plans (section 32(4)) and in cases of errors and omissions in the cadastral maps (section 32(2)). In the latter case, both the zone plan and the cadastral maps were to be amended. After the entry into force of the CCPRBA in 2001, this procedure was governed by section 53 of that Act. Section 32 was superseded by section 134(2) of the new Building Planning Act of 2001, which retained the possibility of amendments to the zone plan in cases of errors and omissions. Where the latter were contained in the cadastral maps, they had to be amended first under the procedure set out in section 53 of the CCPRBA.
The relevant provisions and domestic courts’ practice in connection with actions for damages under the State Responsibility for Damage Act (the Act’s title having been amended later to State and Municipalities’ Responsibility for Damage Act (SMRDA)) have been summarised in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Lyubomir Popov v. Bulgaria, no. 69855/01, §§ 96-99, 7 January 2010; Naydenov v. Bulgaria, no. 17353/03, §§ 43-47, 26 November 2009; and Mutishev and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 18967/03, §§ 93-96, 3 December 2009.
