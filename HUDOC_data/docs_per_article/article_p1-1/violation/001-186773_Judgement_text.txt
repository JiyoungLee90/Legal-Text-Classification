The case originated in seven applications (nos. 4954/15, 7294/15, 7311/15, 7356/15, 7419/15, 7434/15 and 10758/15) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by seven citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Mujo Zahirović, Ms Nedžvija Mandara, Mr Miralem Mustajbegović, Mr Nihad Hrnjica, Mr Zijad Džugum, Ms Đevada Hodžić and Mr Fadil Pandžo (“the applicants”), between 13 January 2015 and 23 February 2015.
The applicants were represented by Ms H. Kapetan, a lawyer practising in Travnik. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms B. Skalonjić.
The applicants complained of the non-enforcement of final domestic judgments in their favour.
On 7 September 2016 the Government were given notice of the applications.
The applicants were born in 1968, 1960, 1966, 1962, 1959, 1955 and 1954, respectively, and live in Novi Travnik and Bugojno, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
By seven judgments of the Travnik Municipal Court and the Bugojno Municipal Court, of 19 January 2007, 15 May 2008, 19 January 2006, 28 October 2011, 2 February 2009, 1 September 2009 and 9 April 2004, respectively, the applicants’ employers, two companies manufacturing weapons and military technology, were ordered to pay them various sums in respect of unpaid work-related benefits together with default interest at the statutory rate and legal costs. The judgments became final on 24 August 2007, 15 May 2008, 19 January 2006, 26 November 2011, 20 August 2009, 13 October 2009 and 13 April 2005, respectively.
The applicants’ winding-up petitions were rejected on 27 May 2010 and 14 February 2011, respectively, because the Federal Ministry of Energy had refused authorisation (see paragraph 14 below). Consequently, in accordance with the 2003 Insolvency Act, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina became liable for the debts of the applicants’ employers (see paragraph 14 below).
The Sarajevo Municipal Court issued enforcement orders on 9 November 2011, 21 February 2012, 17 April 2012, 25 April 2012, 5 July 2012, 27 March 2012 and 9 August 2012, respectively, in which the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was designated as a debtor. They were transferred to the competent bank and were listed among the charges in the federal budget.
On several occasions thereafter the bank informed the competent courts that the enforcement was not possible because the budgetary funds intended for that purpose had already been spent.
The applicants complained of the non-enforcement to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Constitutional Court”).
On 17 March 2015 (decision no. AP 2892/13) the Constitutional Court found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in the applicants’ cases on account of the prolonged non-enforcement of the final judgments in their favour. It ordered the government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to take the necessary steps in order to secure the payment of its debt arising from the final judgments within a reasonable time. Although the applicants submitted a claim for non-pecuniary damages, the Constitutional Court did not award any compensation.
On the following dates in 2017 the final judgments in the applicants’ favour were fully enforced:
on 10 January 2017 in respect of Mr Mujo Zahirović;
on 9 January 2017 in respect of Ms Nedžvija Mandara;
on 13 April 2017 in respect of Mr Miralem Mustajbegović;
on 17 January 2017 in respect of Mr Nihad Hrnjica;
on 11 January 2017 in respect of Mr Zijad Džugum;
on 17 January 2017 in respect of Ms Đevada Hodžić; and
on 13 April 2017 in respect of Mr Fadil Pandžo.
The 2003 Enforcement Procedure Act (Zakon o izvršnom postupku, Official Gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“OG FBH”), nos. 32/03, 52/03, 33/06, 39/06, 39/09, 35/12 and 46/16) provides for the limitation of enforcement of final judgments against the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the cantons: these will be enforced only within the amount of funds provided for that purpose in the federal and cantonal budgets which cannot be lower than 0,3% of the total budget (section 138 (3) and (6)). The enforcement will be carried out in a chronological order according to the time the judgments became final. The statutory prescription period does not apply to these claims (section 138 (5)).
Section 5 of the 2003 Insolvency Act (Zakon o stečajnom postupku, OG FBH, nos. 29/03, 32/04, 42/06 and 4/17), provides that a winding-up order may be made against the manufacturers of weapons and military technology with the authorisation of the Ministry of Energy only. If the Ministry refuses authorisation the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina becomes liable for the debts of the company.
