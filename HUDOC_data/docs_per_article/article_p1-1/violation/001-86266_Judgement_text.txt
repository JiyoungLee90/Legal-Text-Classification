The case originated in an application (no. 26862/03) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Semen Yegorovich Khokhlov (“the applicant”), on 18 July 2003. He died on 15 July 2005, in the course of the proceedings. His widow Mrs Favziya Khokhlova wished to pursue the application before the Court. For reasons of convenience, Mr Khokhlov will continue to be referred to as “the applicant” in this judgment.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mrs Valeria Lutkovska and Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 15 March 2005 and on 22 November 2006 the Court decided to communicate to the Government the complaint under Article 6 § 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the non-enforcement of the final judgments given in the applicant’s favour. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1936 and lived in Novogrodivka.
On 2 April 1999 the Novogrodivka City Court awarded the applicant UAH 1,753 in salary arrears and compensation for delay in payment of salary against the Novogrodivska coal-mine (a State-owned enterprise).
The applicant was unsuccessful in the proceedings against the State Bailiff Service for in respect of its allegedly unlawful inactivity.
On 24 February 2004 the Novogrodivka City Department of the State Bailiffs’ Service informed the applicant that the Novogrodivska coal-mine had been replaced by the Selydivvugillya State Company in the enforcement proceedings.
As of 26 October 2004, the applicant had received UAH 1,530 out of the total award of UAH 1,753.
In August 2005 Mrs Khokhlova informed the Court that after the case had been communicated to the respondent Government she had received the remainder of the sum.
