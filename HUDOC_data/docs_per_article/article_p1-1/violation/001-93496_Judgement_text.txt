The case originated in 20 applications (nos. 11093/07, 14558/07, 19660/07, 30166/07, 46736/07, 52681/07, 52985/07, 10633/08, 10652/08, 12694/08, 15437/08, 16691/08, 19447/07, 19457/08, 20857/08, 20872/08, 22546/08, 25820/08, 25839/08 and 25845/08) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by the Israeli nationals (“the applicants”) whose names and the dates of their applications to the Court appear in the appended table.
All the applicants, with the exception of Ms Gorfunkel, were represented before the Court by Mr R.A. Zarbeyev, a lawyer practising in . Ms Gorfunkel was represented by Mr N. Glazychev, a lawyer practising in the Pskov Region. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the  at the Court.
The applicants complained, inter alia, of the quashing in supervisory-review proceedings of binding and enforceable judgments delivered in their favour between 2005 and 2007.
On 19 May 2008 the President of the First Section decided to communicate these complaints to the respondent Government. It was also decided in all the cases to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants' names and other details are indicated in the appended table.
The applicants emigrated to Israel from the  in the 1980s and 1990s and obtained Israeli nationality. Before immigration they had been receiving old-age pensions from the Soviet authorities. However, once the applicants left the USSR, the payments were discontinued in accordance with the  pension law applicable at the material time. As they left the  prior to its collapse, they were not entitled to a pension under the new Russian legislation.
In early 2000 the applicants unsuccessfully applied to the regional departments of the Pension Fund of the  (“the Pension Fund”) for the payment of their pensions to be restored. On unspecified dates they brought civil proceedings against the Pension Fund requesting restoration of the payment of their pensions.
By the final judgments listed in the appended table the applicants' claims were allowed and the Pension Fund was ordered to restore pension payments.
In their judgments the courts found, inter alia, that although the pensions had initially been awarded in accordance with the USSR legislation, the latter was also applicable in the . The courts interpreted the relevant legal provisions in the light of the  judgment of 15 June 1998, considering that the pension payments should be restored regardless of the date or place of emigration from the .
The Pension Fund restored the payments in ten cases (see § 43 below).
On 17 June 2005 the Pension Fund, in a letter numbered ГВ2115/6390, asked the Supreme Court of the  to provide an explanation of the issue. It based the request on the fact that courts of different regions had different attitudes towards the problem. Thus, it noted that in Moscow, the Moscow Region and in most of the other regions the courts rejected claims for payment of pensions to emigrant pensioners whose pensions had been awarded in accordance with the legislation of the . At the same time, the courts in , in the Samara Region, in the Kaluga Region and in the Yaroslavl Region awarded such payment.
Subsequently the Pension Fund, as a party to the proceedings in the present case, lodged requests with the competent regional courts for supervisory review of the final judgments in the applicants' favour. The Presidia of the regional courts granted the requests, quashed the judgments and dismissed the applicants' claims.
The Presidia found that according to the relevant  legislation, under which the pensions had been awarded, there was no possibility to continue the payments to the applicants, as they had left the country. According to their interpretation of the Ruling of the Constitutional Court of 15 June 1998, the payments were to be restored only if the pensions had been awarded in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation, not the . The Presidia accordingly concluded that there was no basis under the domestic law for the payments to be awarded to the applicants.
The relevant data on the Presidia decisions is listed below.
