The case originated in two applications (nos. 24042/09 and 3159/10) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a company incorporated under Moldovan law, Cereale Flor S.A., and a Moldovan national, Ms Snejana Roșca (“the applicants”), on 22 April and 22 December 2009 respectively.
The applicant company Cereale Flor S.A. was represented by Mr V. Zamă and the applicant Ms Roșca was represented by Mr V. Râhlea, both lawyers practising in Chișinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Apostol.
The applicants complained of the wrongful quashing of final judgments in their favour. They relied on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. Ms Roșca also complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that a judgment in her favour had not been enforced and that proceedings conducted in her absence had been unfair.
On 21 January 2011 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicant company is a joint-stock company incorporated under Moldovan law. Ms Roșca was born in 1984 and lives in Chișinău.
On 23 February 2000 the Economic District Court ordered the applicant company to pay another company, E., 1,908,145 Moldovan lei (MDL) (equivalent to 152,190 euros (EUR)). The court issued a writ of enforcement.
On 14 July 2005 E. sought to restart the time-limit for the enforcement of the judgment dated 23 February 2000, arguing that it had been unable to initiate enforcement proceedings within the three-year statutory period because the bailiff had lost the original writ of enforcement.
On 2 May 2006 the Economic Court of Appeal, by a final judgment, dismissed E.’s application as being ill-founded, noting that a duplicate of the writ had been issued in 2003.
On 17 December 2008 the Economic Court of Appeal upheld an application by E. for a revision of the judgment, quashed the decision of 2 May 2006 and allowed the statutory time-limit to run anew. The court did not reply to the applicant company’s contention that the application was timebarred.
After communication, E. initiated enforcement proceedings and the applicant company paid MDL 294,405.37 (equivalent to EUR 18,400).
On 28 February 2007 the Ciocana District Court acknowledged the applicant’s entitlement, as a young family, to a plot of land for construction purposes. The court ordered the Tohatin local administration to grant the applicant ownership of such a plot of land. As there was no appeal, the judgment became final on 20 March 2007.
The applicant sought enforcement of the judgment of 28 February 2007, but to no avail.
On 11 February 2009 the Tohatin local administration lodged an application for a revision of the judgment, arguing that the applicant had not qualified as a young family because her husband had died in 2006 and she had therefore lost her entitlement to any land.
On 22 April 2009 the Ciocana District Court dismissed the application for revision, finding that the applicant had requested the plot of land in 2005. Her husband’s death had not qualified as a new circumstance because the local administration had been aware of that matter at the time of the proceedings. The local administration appealed.
On 24 June 2009, in the applicant’s absence, the Chișinău Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, quashed the decision of 22 April 2009 and upheld the application for revision. It also quashed the Ciocana District Court’s judgment of 28 February 2007 and delivered a new judgment on the merits that dismissed her claims as unsubstantiated.
The relevant domestic law concerning the revision of a final judgment is set out in Popov v. Moldova (no. 2) (no. 19960/04, §§ 2729, 6 December 2005) and Jomiru and Creţu v. Moldova, (no. 28430/06, §§ 2627, 17 April 2012).
Law no. 87, which created a new remedy to address complaints of unreasonable length of proceedings, entered into force on 1 July 2011. Further details of the law are set out in the Court’s decision in Balan v. Moldova ((dec.), no. 44746/08, 24 January 2012).
Under Article 11 of the Moldovan Land Code, local administrations may grant young families ownership of plots of land for construction from 0.04 to 0.12 ha.
In accordance with Article 449 (h) of the Moldovan Civil Procedure Code a party may apply to reopen proceedings if the European Court of Human Rights has found a violation of his or her rights which may be redressed, at least partially, by quashing the judgment delivered by the domestic courts.
