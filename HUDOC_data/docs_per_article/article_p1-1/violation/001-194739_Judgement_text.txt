The case originated in seven applications (nos. 3249/12, 11204/12, 23589/13, 53686/13, 54020/13, 60850/13 and 48673/14) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by ten Russian nationals and one legal entity established in Russia. Their details and the dates of their applications to the Court appear below in Appendix.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 18 May 2015 the complaints concerning delayed enforcement as well as insufficiency of compensation for that were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the applications nos. 3249/12, 11204/12, 23589/13, 53686/13, 60850/13, 48673/14 were declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The personal details of the applicants appear in the Appendix.
The applicants obtained final court judgments in their favour, according to which different State authorities were ordered to pay them lump sums or monthly payments. The court decisions were not promptly enforced. The applicants sought compensation for delayed enforcement under the Compensation Act. Their claims for compensation were granted and the judgments were fully enforced. The respective information about the judgments in the applicants’ favour and their enforcement, courts decisions concerning the compensation awards and respective sums are indicated in the appended table.
Federal Law № 68-ФЗ “On Compensation for Violation of the Right to a Trial within a Reasonable Time or the Right to Enforcement of a Judgment within a Reasonable Time” of 30 April 2010 (in force as of 4 May 2010) provides that in case of a violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time or of the right to enforcement of a final judgment, the Russian citizens are entitled to seek compensation of the non-pecuniary damage.
