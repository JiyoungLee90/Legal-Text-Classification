The case originated in two applications (nos. 2294/17 and 48691/17) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by forty-seven natural and legal persons on 28 December 2016 and 29 June 2017, respectively. The particulars of the applicants appear in Appendices 1 – 2.
The applicants were represented by Mr J. Brichta a lawyer practising in Bratislava. The Government of the Slovak Republic (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Pirošíková.
The applicants complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, both alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention, about restrictions which the rules governing rent control imposed on their right to peacefully enjoy their possessions.
The applications were communicated to the Government on 16 January 2018.
The applicants are owners of residential buildings or apartments which were subject to the rent-control scheme. Under the relevant legislation they were obliged to let their flats to tenants while charging no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the State. The legislation precluded them from unilaterally terminating the leases or selling the flats in question to anyone other than the respective tenants. The particulars of the flats affected by the rent control and its duration are set out in Appendices 3 and 4 (columns A - F).
The situation of the applicants is structurally and contextually the same as that of the applicants in Bittó and Others v. Slovakia (no. 30255/09, 28 January 2014 (merits) and 7 July 2015 (just satisfaction)), and subsequently decided cases concerning the rent-control scheme in Slovakia (see Krahulec v. Slovakia, no. 19294/07; Bukovčanová and Others v. Slovakia, no. 23785/07; Rudolfer v. Slovakia, no. 38082/07, 5 July 2016; Riedel and Others v. Slovakia, nos. 44218/07, 54831/07, 33176/08, 47150/08; and Mečiar and Others v. Slovakia, no. 62864/09, 10 January 2017; Matuschka and Others v. Slovakia [Committee], nos. 33076/10, 14383/11, Balan and Others v. Slovakia [Committee], nos. 51414/11, 46098/12, and Bajzík and Others v. Slovakia [Committee], nos. 46609/13, 9892/14, 27 June 2017, Drahoš and Others v. Slovakia [Committee], nos. 47922/14 and 7 others, 9 January 2018).
The relevant domestic law and practice governing the rent-control scheme in Slovakia and its historical background are set out in the Court’s judgment in the case of Bittó and Others, ((merits), cited above, §§ 7‑16 and 32‑72).
On 15 September 2011, the Termination and Settlement of Tenancy (Certain Apartments) Act (Law no. 260/2011) came into force; this legislation was enacted with a view to ending the rent-control scheme by 31 December 2016. The owners of apartments whose rent had been regulated were entitled to give notice by 31 March 2012 of the termination of a tenancy contract. Such termination of tenancy took effect after a twelve-month notice period. However, if a tenant was exposed to material hardship and applied for a substitute flat with the municipality, he or she would be able to continue to use the apartment while still paying a regulated rent, even after the expiry of the notice period, until a new tenancy contract with a municipality had been set up. Municipalities were obliged to provide a person exposed to material hardship with a municipal apartment at a regulated rent. If a municipality did not comply with that obligation by 31 December 2016, the landlord could claim from the municipality the difference between the free-market rent and the regulated rent.
