The case originated in an application (no. 48704/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Bulgarian nationals, Mr Iliya Atanasov Tonov, Ms Vatka Markova Udvareva and Ms Pena Marinova Karalakova (“the applicants”), on 12 October 2007.
The applicants were represented by Mr N. Runevski, a lawyer practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms R. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 6 December 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1975, 1930 and 1927 respectively. Mr Iliya Atanasov Tonov and Ms Vatka Markova Udvareva live in  and Ms Pena Marinova Karalakova lives in Tryavna.
In 1968 the second applicant, Ms Udvareva, and her husband bought from the Sofia municipality a flat of 97 square metres, which had become State property by virtue of the nationalisations carried out by the communist regime in  after 1947.
On 18 March 1998, following a renewal of the time-limit to bring an action under section 7 of the Restitution Law, the pre-nationalisation owner of the flat brought such an action against Ms Udvareva and her husband, seeking to establish that their title was null and void.
While the proceedings were pending, Ms Udvareva’s husband deceased. His grandson, Mr Iliya Atanasov Tonov – the first applicant, inherited his share of the flat. Thus, after that Ms Tonov and Ms Udvareva owned one half of the flat each. Accordingly, Mr Tonov also joined the civil proceedings.
The proceedings ended by a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 23 April 2007. The domestic courts found that Ms Udvareva and Mr Tonov’s title was null and void ab initio: the flat’s sale in 1968 had been flawed because a document related to it had not been signed by the municipality official with whom the relevant power had been vested.
On an unspecified date Ms Udvareva, who was at the time living alone in the flat, vacated it.
On 20 September 2007 Ms Udvareva and Mr Tonov requested to receive compensation bonds. However, their request was dismissed as it had not been made within two months following the Supreme Court of Cassation’s final judgment of 23 April 2007, as provided for under domestic law.
The relevant background facts, domestic law and practice have been summarised in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Velikovi and Others v. Bulgaria (nos. 43278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01, and 194/02, 15 March 2007) and Tsonkovi v. Bulgaria (no. 27213/04, §§ 14-15, 2 July 2009).
