The case originated in two applications against the Republics of Albania and Italy lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) as follows: application no. 35720/04, Vrioni, on 8 April 1999; application no. 42832/06, Vrioni and Others, on 15 August 2006.
The applicants were represented by Ms L. Sula and Ms. E. Qirjako, lawyers practising in Tirana. The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their then Agent, Ms S. Meneri.
The applicants alleged that there had been violations of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and Article 13 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
On 9 February 2006 and 8 January 2007 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of application no. 35720/04 and application no. 42832/06 respectively to the Government of Albania. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
The applicants and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 § 1).
Mr Shahin Vrioni, the applicant in application no. 35720/04, is an Albanian national who was born in 1925 and lives in . Mr Gherardo La Francesca, Mr Dario La Francesca and Mr Oliver Vrioni, the applicants in application no. 42832/06, are Albanian and Italian nationals who were born in 1946, 1950 and 1974 respectively and live in Italy. Mr Shahin Vrioni represented himself and the other applicants in the domestic courts’ proceedings.
On 18 March 1996 and 14 December 1999 the Commission recognised the applicants’ title to two plots of land measuring 1,100 sq. m. and 537 sq. m. respectively. The Commission held that it was impossible for the applicants to have the whole original plot of land allocated to them. It decided to restore to the applicants a vacant plot of land (një truall i lirë) measuring 1,456 sq. m., which was situated within the occupied grounds of the Italian Embassy, and ordered the authorities to pay compensation in respect of a plot of land measuring 181 sq. m. Moreover, it ordered that the applicants’ title to the property be entered in the Tirana Property Register.
The applicants were also issued with two certificates of property registration by the Registry Office: registration no. 4373, dated 1 June 1996, and registration no. 420, dated 28 December 1999.
On an unspecified date in 1996, having regard to the fact that, according to the note verbale of 1991, the Italian Embassy had title to one of the buildings only, but not to the occupied plot of land, the applicants requested the Embassy to return their property which it was occupying without title.
On 27 November 1996 the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, having regard to the applicants’ property claims to the plot of land adjacent to the Embassy’s buildings, offered mediation to the Italian Embassy with a view to entering into civil agreements with the applicants.
On 16 August 1997 the Italian Embassy in Albania, in reply to the applicants’ request for recovery of their property, informed them that their property claims to the plot of land situated within its premises had to be settled with the Albanian authorities.
On 1 October 1997, following a request by the applicants, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed them that by virtue of the note verbale exchanges of 1991 the Italian Embassy in  had full ownership of the buildings and adjacent land. Moreover, it referred the applicants to the Albanian authorities as competent to determine any claims for compensation that the applicants might submit.
On 29 January 1999 the Court of Appeal, re-examining the case, found that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs could not be held liable in this connection and designated the Italian Embassy, which was occupying the applicants’ property without title, as the liable entity in relation to the property. It quashed the District Court’s judgment of 2 May 1997 and remitted the case to the same court for fresh consideration.
On 20 June 2000 the District Court dismissed the applicants’ grounds of appeal, finding that the Commission’s decisions of 18 March 1996 and 14 December 1999 had been unlawful, as they were in breach of section 4 of the Property Act.
The District Court found that the applicants’ disputed plot of land, even though there were no buildings on it, constituted an integral part of the Italian Embassy’s premises. Thus, the District Court declared null and void the Commission’s decisions and held that the applicants were entitled to receive compensation for the original properties in one of the forms laid down in section 16 of the Property Act.
