The case originated in an application (no. 63756/09) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Albanian national, Mr Jorgji Themeli (“the applicant”), on 5 November 2009.
The applicant was represented by Ms E. Kokona, a lawyer practising in Tirana. The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms L. Mandia of the State Advocate’s Office.
On 11 July 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Tirana.
Further to the applicant’s dismissal in 2003, on 19 January 2004 the Tirana District Court ordered his employer, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy (“the Ministry”), to pay his salary throughout the period he remained unemployed. That decision became final on 2 February 2007, following the Supreme Court’s rejection of the employer’s appeal.
On 10 February 2005 an enforcement writ was issued.
From 1 January 2006 to 31 January 2007 the applicant was regularly paid monthly salaries as a result of the inclusion of his name on the employer’s waiting lists, no salaries having been paid for the period between 2003 and 2006.
On 2 February 2009 the bailiff decided to discontinue the enforcement on the grounds that the outstanding amount had been paid. The applicant challenged the bailiff’s decision.
On 30 April 2010 the Tirana District Court found in the applicant’s favour and ordered the bailiff to continue the enforcement proceedings. It ruled that the employer had paid the applicant the sum of 2,065,101 Albanian leks (“ALL”) out of a total of ALL 2,887,500 due to him for the period between 2003 and 2006.
On 30 June 2011, following the bailiff’s appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld that decision.
On 18 January 2012 the Ministry ordered the payment of the outstanding amount.
On 8 March 2012 the applicant’s debt judgment was fully enforced.
