The case originated in an application (no. 23596/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Valeriy Lukyanovich Sukhorukov (“the applicant”), on 4 June 2004.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mrs V. Milinchuk, the Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 23 May 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3). The Government objected to the application of Article 29 § 3, but the Court dismissed this objection.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Ust-Labinsk, a town in the Krasnodar Region.
On 31 March 1999 the Ust-Labinskiy District Court awarded the applicant 2,000 Russian roubles against a local welfare authority for a delayed payment of social benefits. This judgment became binding on 6 May 1999, but has not been enforced to date.
On 1 June 1999 the applicant submitted enforcement papers to bailiffs, and on 29 June 1999 the bailiffs passed the papers to the Treasury. In December 2001 the Treasury returned the papers to the applicant, because in the meantime the procedure of enforcement had changed.
To vindicate his right to a timely enforcement of the judgment, the applicant sued bailiffs for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. On 16 August 2002 the District Court rejected this claim, having found that the bailiffs had done everything they should have done to enforce the judgment.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months. Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.
