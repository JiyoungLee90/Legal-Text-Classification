The case originated in an application (no. 38082/07) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovak national, Mr Tomáš Rudolfer (“the applicant”), on 20 August 2007.
The applicant was represented by Mr R. Procházka, a lawyer practising in Bratislava. The Government of the Slovak Republic (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Pirošíková.
The applicant alleged that the rent-control scheme had imposed restrictions on his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions, in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
By a decision of 4 January 2012 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant and the Government each submitted further written observations (Rule 59 § 1) on the merits and just satisfaction, and replied in writing to each other’s observations.
The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Bratislava.
The applicant’s parents built a house in Bratislava-Ružinov in 1937. In the second half of the 1950s they were compelled to donate the house to the State. On 31 July 1992 it was restored to the applicant’s mother (a three-quarters share) and the applicant (a one-quarter share) under the special legislation on restitution. Since 30 September 1996 the applicant has been its sole owner.
At the time of its restitution to the applicant and his mother, the house comprised nine flats subject to rent control. One flat has a surface area of 30 sq. m and the remaining eight measure 70 sq. m each. Under the relevant legislation (i) the applicant had to accept that his flats were occupied by the tenants, (ii) he could charge them no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the State, (iii) he could not unilaterally terminate the leases, and (iv) he could not sell the flats to anyone other than the tenants (“the rent-control scheme”).
In 1996 and 2000 two of the bigger flats became vacant, as a result of which the rentcontrol scheme ceased to apply to them. The rent control ceased to apply in respect of another two 70 sq. m flats in January 2008 and November 2012 respectively. Currently, five flats are under the rent control regime.
Under the applicable legislation, between 1992 and 1999 the maximum permissible monthly rent chargeable for the flats was equivalent of some 3 to 8 euros (EUR). After several increases in the regulated rent, in 2007 the applicant could charge some EUR 35 for the smaller flat and EUR 65 for each of the larger ones.
The parties provided differing figures as to the market rent:
The applicant relied on data from the National Association of Real Estate Agencies (“NAREA”) and claimed that in 2007 the monthly market rent for similar flats with a surface area of 70 sq. m reached EUR 553 and for flats measuring 30 sq. m some EUR 375.
The Government submitted an expert valuation according to which the monthly market rent for the applicant’s flats in 2010 amounted to EUR 330 and EUR 160.50 respectively.
The relevant domestic law and practice governing the rent-control scheme in Slovakia and its historical background are set out in the case of Bittó and Others v. Slovakia ((merits), no. 30255/09, §§ 716, 3272, 28 January 2014).
On 15 September 2011, the Termination and Settlement of Tenancy (Certain Apartments) Act (“Law no. 260/2011”) came into force. It was enacted with a view to eliminating rent restrictions concerning individual owners.
Its provisions are applicable, in particular, to individual apartments whose rent has so far been regulated. In those cases, landlords were entitled to give notice of termination of a tenancy contract by 31 March 2012. Such termination of tenancy takes effect after a twelve-month notice period. However, if a tenant is exposed to material hardship, he or she will be able to continue to use the apartment with regulated rent, even after the expiry of the notice period, until a new tenancy contract with a municipality has been set up. Law no. 260/2011 further entitles landlords to increase the rent by 20% once a year until 2015.
Municipalities are obliged to provide a person exposed to material hardship with a municipal apartment with regulated rent. If a municipality does not comply with that obligation by 31 December 2016 in a given case, the landlord can claim the difference between the free market rent and the regulated rent.
Law no. 150/2013 amends the earlier legislation on the Housing Development State Fund. It took effect on 1 January 2014. Among other things, with reference to Law no. 260/2011 it entitles owners of houses or flats which have been restored to their original owners to apply for preferential loans for the purpose of modernisation of such buildings.
In Bittó and Others ((merits), cited above), the Court found that the application of the rent-control scheme in respect of the applicants’ property constituted a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. In the relevant part of its judgment under Article 46 of the Convention it held that:
“133. [Its] conclusion ... as regards the effects of the rent-control scheme on the applicants’ right to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions suggests that the violation found originated in a problem arising out of the state of the Slovakian legislation and practice, which has affected a number of flat owners to whom the rent-control scheme has applied .... The Court further notes that 13 other applications concerning the same issue are pending before it which concern some 170 persons.
It is true that measures have been taken with a view to gradually improving the situation of landlords. Thus, as a result of the introduction of Law no. 216/2011, the controlled rent could be increased by 20% every year as from the end of 2011. Where a municipality has not provided tenants exposed to material hardship with a dwelling by the end of 2016, the landlords will have the right to claim the difference between the free-market rent and the controlled rent ... Thus those measures provide for a complete elimination of the effects on flat owners of rent-control only as from 2017, and they do not address the situation existing prior to their adoption.
The Court considers that further measures should be taken in order to achieve compliance with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. To prevent future findings of infringement of that provision, the respondent State should introduce, as soon as possible, a specific and clearly regulated compensatory remedy in order to provide genuine effective relief for the breach found.”
Implementation of the judgment in Bittó and Others is still pending.
