By a letter of 18 April 2003, the ZRCC informed the applicant that, as he had failed to lodge a request to be recognised as a creditor during the bankruptcy proceedings in the case (April 1997 – July 2002), he could not claim to be a creditor and could not therefore seek to have the friendly settlement declared unlawful.

It also declared unlawful the failure of the bailiffs to enforce the judgment for a lengthy period (four years and nine months) and found the applicant’s complaints to be substantiated.

He had lodged his complaints only on 6 September 2002 as he could not read the documents supplied to him by the bailiffs, which were allegedly of a very poor quality. He has not given the Court any further information as to the outcome of these proceedings.
