The case originated in an application (no. 14298/06) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by six Ukrainian nationals, Ms Yefrosyniya Semenivna Bilokin, Ms Olena Oleksandrivna Shebitko, Mr Anatoliy Ivanovich Shebitko, Mr Petro Ivanovich Shebitko, Mr Sergiy Ivanovich Maksymenko and Ms Nataliya Dmytrivna Maksymenko, on 17 March 2006.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Yuriy Zaytsev.
On 29 April 2008 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
Ms Yefrosyniya Semenivna Bilokin was born in 1925, Ms Olena Oleksandrivna Shebitko in 1972, Mr Anatoliy Ivanovych Shebitko in 1973, Mr Petro Ivanovych Shebitko in 1967, Mr Sergiy Ivanovych Maksymenko in 1965 and Ms Nataliya Dmytrivna Maksymenko in 1963. All the applicants live in Sudiyivka, Poltava Region.
On 26 July 2001 the  (“the ”) allowed the applicants’ claim against the collective enterprise and ordered the latter to return to all of them certain agricultural equipment worth 13,382 Ukrainian hryvnyas (UAH). It also awarded them UAH 180 in compensation for legal expenses.
On 17 October 2001 the  changed the manner of enforcement of the judgment at the applicants’ request and ordered the debtor to pay them UAH 13,382 instead of providing them with the equipment corresponding to that amount. To secure the claim the court decided to seize the equipment at issue.
On 9 November 2001 enforcement proceedings were instituted.
In April 2002 the Bailiffs’ Service seized the debtor’s equipment.
On an unspecified date the judgment was enforced in part, an amount of UAH 2,000 being paid to the applicants (each of them received UAH 333).
No further steps seem to have been taken for the enforcement of the judgment.
The applicants complained to the  that the Bailiffs’ Service was taking no action.
On 21 November 2002 the  found their complaint substantiated and ordered the Bailiffs’ Service to speed up the sale of the seized property.
In 2004 the applicants introduced a claim for damages against the Bailiffs’ Service at the Zhovtnevyy District Court,  (“the District Court”).
On 5 August 2004 the District Court found for the applicants and ordered the Bailiffs’ Service to pay them jointly UAH 11,562 as the remaining amount of the award made by the 26 July 2001 judgment, and UAH 1,000 each in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The judgment was not appealed against and became final. It remains unenforced for lack of funds.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-19, 27 July 2004).
