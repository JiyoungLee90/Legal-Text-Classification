The case originated in an application (no. 19255/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Sait Işık (“the applicant”), on 17 January 2002. The applicant was represented by Ms A. Aslan, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent. On 22 January 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1917 and lives in Eğil.
On 3 April 1997 the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources expropriated 6 plots of land (plots nos. 546, 529, 503, 507, 527 and 523) belonging to the applicant in the Kale district of Eğil in Diyarbakır. A committee of experts assessed the value of the land and the sum fixed thereby was paid to the applicant on 19 November 1997.
On 8 December 1997 the applicant lodged a case with the Eğil Civil Court, requesting additional compensation. The first-instance court decided to deal separately with parcel no. 523 due to the different nature of that parcel.
On 6 December 1999 the Eğil Civil Court awarded the applicant additional compensation of 501,377,750 Turkish liras (TRL) plus interest at a rate of 30% from 8 December 1997 to 1 January 1998, and a rate of 50% from 1 January 1998 onwards.
On 9 October 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the court of first instance.
On 13 June 2001 the administration paid the applicant TRL 1,586,220,000 in additional compensation together with interest.
On 17 May 2000 the Eğil Civil Court awarded the applicant additional compensation of TRL 11,267,083,000 plus interest at the statutory rate, running from 18 February 1998.
On 12 February 2001 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.
On 27 November 2001 the administration paid the applicant TRL 35,240,270,000 in additional compensation together with interest.
