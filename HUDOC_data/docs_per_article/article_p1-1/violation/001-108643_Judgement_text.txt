The case originated in an application (no. 33422/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Vladimir Alekseyevich Lavrov (“the applicant”), on 3 October 2003.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented first by Ms V. Milinchuk and then by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representatives of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 3 May 2007 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.
In accordance with the pilot judgment Burdov v.  (no. 2) (no. 33509/04, 15 January 2009), this application was adjourned pending its resolution at the domestic level.
The Government later informed the Court that enforcement of the domestic judgment in the applicant’s favour was impossible as the applicant was obstructing the enforcement and requested the Court to strike out the application out of its list of cases. The Court therefore decided to resume examination of the present case.
The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Shchekino, Tula Region.
The applicant retired from military service in 1993 and became entitled to obtain a permanent housing funded by the State. Following the State’s failure to comply with this obligation voluntarily, on 19 October 1998 the Shchekinskiy District Court of the Tula Region (“the District Court”) granted the applicant’s action against the Tula Regional Administration and awarded him 143,100 Russian roubles (RUB) for purchasing a flat.
On 2 March 1999 the  supplemented the judgment of 19 October 1998, noting that the judgment award should be paid from the federal funds.
Enforcement proceedings were instituted and the applicant submitted a writ of execution to the Tula Regional Department of the Federal Treasury.
On 7 March 2002 the applicant received a letter from the Tula Regional Department of the Ministry of Justice informing him that the judgment of 19 October 1998, as amended on 2 March 1999, could not be enforced because the Tula Regional Administration did not have the necessary funds to do it. He received a number of similar letters in 2003 and 2004.
Following communication of the applicant’s case and its subsequent remittal to the Government for resolution in accordance with the Burdov (no. 2) pilot judgment cited above, the Ministry of Finance of  applied to the trial court seeking modification of the method and order of enforcement of the judgment. Its request was granted on 6 September 2010 by the District Court which ordered that the Ministry of Finance credit RUB 143,100 to the account of the Tula Regional Administration, which should in turn pay this amount to the applicant.
By a decision of 18 November 2010 the  upheld that judgment on appeal.
The applicant lodged a new claim to the court seeking increase of the original award to cover the inflation losses and compensation of nonpecuniary damage inflicted as a result of lengthy non-enforcement of the judgment.
On 27 October 2010 the Tsentralniy District Court of Tula relied on Article 1069 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Russia and awarded the applicant RUB 1,601,208 instead of the original amount to cover pecuniary damage. It also rejected the rest of his claim.
However, by a decision of 23 December 2010 the  reversed the first-instance judgment. The appeal court found that Article 1069 was inapplicable to the applicant’s case and noted that the situation rather warranted application of Article 208 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides for index-linking of the original awards. At the same time, the  relied on the Compensation Act (Law No. 68-ФЗ of 30 April 2010) and awarded the applicant RUB 50,000 (approximately 1,200 euros (EUR)) for nonpecuniary damage resulted from lengthy non-enforcement. It is not clear whether the applicant has been paid this amount.
By a letter of 28 February 2011 the Tula Regional Administration requested that the applicant communicate his bank account details to enable payment of the original award constituting RUB 143,100. To date the applicant has refused to comply with this request arguing that the original award had depreciated and was no longer sufficient to purchase a flat.
The judgment of 19 October 1998, as amended on 2 March 1999, remains unenforced.
Pursuant to Article 1069 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a State agency or a State official shall be liable to a citizen for damage caused by their unlawful actions or failure to act.
Article 208 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for “indexation” of judicial awards: the court which made the award may upgrade it upon a party’s request in line with the increase in the official retail price index until the date of effective payment. Default interest and other compensation for pecuniary damage may in addition be recovered from the debtor for noncompliance with a monetary obligation and use of another person’s funds (Article 395 of the Civil Code).
Federal Law № 68-ФЗ “On Compensation for Violation of the Right to a Trial within a Reasonable Time or the Right to Enforcement of a Judgment within a Reasonable Time” of 30 April 2010 (in force as of 4 May 2010) provides that in case of a violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time or of the right to enforcement of a final judgment, the Russian citizens are entitled to seek compensation of the non-pecuniary damage.
