The case originated in an application (no. 23304/05) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Polina Aleksandrovna Konovalova (“the applicant”), on 13 April 2005.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicant complains of the lengthy non-enforcement of a judgment in her favour.
On 1 October 2009 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Murmansk.
The applicant sued the local office of the Pension Fund, claiming that her monthly pension had been miscalculated.
On 12 September 2003 the Pervomayskiy District Court of Murmansk granted her claim and ordered that the pension due to the applicant be recalculated and increased. No appeal was lodged against that judgment and on 23 September 2003 it became final and enforceable.
On 11 August 2005 the Pervomayskiy District Court of Murmansk quashed the judgment of 12 September 2003 and reopened the proceedings after an application by the respondent authority on the grounds that new circumstances had come to light.
On 23 August 2005 the same court rejected the applicant’s pension recalculation claim.
