The case originated in an application (no. 30475/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by SA Moldovahidromaş.
In a judgment delivered on 27 February 2007 (“the principal judgment”), the Court held there had been a violation of the applicant company’s rights provided by Article 6 § 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see Moldovahidromaş v. , no. 30475/03, 27 February 2007).
Under Article 41 of the Convention the applicant sought just satisfaction in the amount of 7,233,040 euros (EUR).
Since the question of the application of Article 41 of the Convention was not ready for decision as regards the applicant’s claim for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, the Court reserved it and invited the Government and the applicant to submit, within three months, their written observations on that issue and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach.
The applicant is a Moldovan incorporated company based in Chişinău.
Moldovahidromaş (M.) was a State-owned company which owned a subsidiary Hidrotehnica (H.). In 1992 H.’s staff attempted to create a separate company on the basis of H.’s assets. The contract for the creation of H. was eventually annulled by a final court judgment of 22-23 October 1992. M. retained ownership of H. as a result.
The applicant company was created as a result of the privatisation of M. in 1994 and thereafter. During the privatisation, the new owners bought the entire company from the State, including its subsidiary H.
In 2002 the Prosecutor General, at the request of H.’s staff, asked for annulment of the final judgment of 22-23 October 1992. On 24 April and 24 July 2003 the Supreme Court of Justice annulled that judgment and ordered the registration of H. as an independent company.
Relying on the Court’s judgment of 27 February 2007, the applicant company requested annulment of the judgments of 24 April and 24 July 2003. On 19 July and 2 August 2007 the Supreme Court of Justice annulled those two judgments, reinstating the applicant company in its rights. On 8 August 2007 the State Registration Chamber made changes to the State registry of companies and issued the applicant company a certificate, confirming its ownership of its subsidiary SA Hidrotehnica.
