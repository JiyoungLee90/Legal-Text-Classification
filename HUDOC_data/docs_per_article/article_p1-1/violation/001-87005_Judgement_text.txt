The case originated in an application (no. 12334/03) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Mr Constantin Irimia (“the applicant”), on 4 April 2003.
The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu.
On 15 June 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Paşcani.
On 24 March 1992 the Paşcani Court of First Instance allowed the applicant’s action and recognized his property right, together with his brothers, for a land of 8,64 ha situated in the Stolniceni-Prăjescu village. That judgment became final.
On 17 March 1993 the district administrative authority acknowledged the applicant’s property right and ordered the local authorities to allow him to take possession of 8,64 ha of agricultural land. The local authorities had not performed the task and therefore the applicant brought administrative proceedings.
On 18 November 1994 the  Court of Appeal, by a final decision, ordered the local authorities to provide the applicant and his brothers with a land of 8,64 ha in the Stolniceni-Prăjescu village.
On 10 November 1998 the applicant and his two brothers were given the possession of 5 ha of land in the Stolniceni-Prăjescu village, namely 0,9 ha intra muros and 4,1 ha extra muros. However, on 4 June 2001 the local authorities annulled these transfers, on the grounds that they had been illegal and that third persons had already been given these lands.
On 27 October 2000 the district administrative authority acknowledged again the applicant’s property right.
On 5 February and 19 March 2007 the Stolniceni-Prăjescu Town Council informed both district and central authorities that they needed to assign land to several persons, including the applicant. As the land in question was in possession of a local company, the Town Council requested the transfer of this land into its own name for subsequent allocation to the entitled persons.
The judgment of 18 November 1994 remains unenforced.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of
