The case originated in an application (no. 5761/03) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mrs Lyubov Grigoryevna Dorozhko (“the applicant”), on 29 January 2003.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, the Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 5 December 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Voronezh.
On 30 October 2001 the Kominternovskiy District Court of Voronezh awarded the applicant 10,300 Russian roubles (“RUB”) in damages against the Ministry of Defence. This judgment became binding on 10 November 2001 and was enforced on 12 August 2003. To compensate for the delay, on 11 November 2003 the court upgraded the debt in line with the cost of living and awarded a further RUB 2,874.
On 8 November 2001 the Central District Court of Voronezh awarded the applicant damages against the police. This judgment became binding on 19 February 2002 and was enforced on 15 November 2005.
As these judgments had not been enforced promptly, the applicant complained to a court. On 12 September 2002 the Kominternovskiy District Court urged the Ministry of Finance to enforce the judgments. On 30 September 2002 the court awarded the applicant RUB 15 of legal costs. This decision became binding but was not enforced.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months. Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.
