The case originated in two applications (nos. 66590/10 and 3773/11) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals, Ms Patimat Arzhiyeva (“the first applicant”) and Mr Akhmed Tsadayev (“the second applicant”), on 18 October and 2 December 2010 respectively.
The first applicant, who was granted legal aid, was represented by Mr V.V. Kulapov, a lawyer practising in Saratov. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
The applicants complained, in particular, of a breach of their right to property as a result of their inability to obtain compensation for the property lost during a counterterrorist operation in Chechnya.
On 19 October 2015 notice of the applications was given to the Government.
The first applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Strasbourg, France. The second applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Grozny, Chechnya, Russia.
At the relevant time the applicants were residents of Grozny, Chechnya. Their property was damaged in the course of a counterterrorist operation in 1999-2000. The applicants did not pursue criminal remedies in order to determine the exact circumstances or identify the perpetrators of the damage. Instead, they sought to obtain no-fault compensation provided for by Government Decree no. 404 (see below). The applicants complied with the requirements for applying for the compensation and submitted the relevant documents. However, for administrative reasons their claims were not processed until September 2013. Their individual situations can be summarised as follows.
The first applicant’s flat was damaged during the hostilities in 19941995, and then destroyed in 1999-2000. It was situated in a 70-flat apartment block at 21 Tereshkova Street in Grozny, Chechnya.
In March 2005 the first applicant submitted an application for administrative compensation to the Commission for compensation for lost property (Комиссия по рассмотрению заявлений граждан о компенсационных выплатах за утраченное жилье и имущество, hereafter “the Commission”). She received an acknowledgment of receipt of documents (no. 22/9777).
In April 2005 the Leninskiy District Court of Grozny confirmed the first applicant’s title to property of flat no. 25 in the destroyed apartment block at 21 Tereshkova Street.
In 2007 the first applicant was registered as a person eligible for social housing because her flat had been destroyed during the hostilities. She was assigned number 742 in the waiting list; in February 2016 her number was 727.
In June 2010 the applicant was informed that her application had not been examined by the Commission since the building in question had not been entered in the register of destroyed buildings. The register was to be updated by the technical unit of the Federal authority on construction and municipal services (техническая группа Федерального агентства по строительству и ЖКХ по формированию перечня разрушенного жилья на территории Чеченской республики, hereafter “the technical unit”). However, in August 2005 the work of the technical unit had been put on hold and the list of destroyed housing has not been updated since that time. Hence, the first applicant’s application has not been processed and no decision has been taken.
The first applicant complained to a district court about the Commission’s failure to act. On 12 August 2010 the Staropromyslovskiy District Court of Grozny rejected the first applicant’s claim, pointing out that the Commission was unable to proceed in the absence of the corresponding entry in the register. On 7 September 2010 the Supreme Court of Chechnya upheld that judgment on appeal. The first applicant’s subsequent attempts to obtain supervisory review were unsuccessful.
In 2011 she was informed by the Commission’s secretariat that the technical unit had not been operational since 2005 and that the Commission did not know whether or when it would restart its work.
The first applicant instituted civil proceedings, seeking damages for the destroyed property directly from the Government of Chechnya. On 21 March 2013 the Leninskiy District Court of Grozny rejected the first applicant’s claim, referring to the expiry of the time-limit and the lack of legal grounds for such claims. On 28 May 2013 the Supreme Court of Chechnya upheld that decision, except the part referring to expiry of the limitation period. The Supreme Court stressed that compensation could not be paid because a new procedure for the payment of compensation was currently being devised.
The second applicant owned flat no. 12 in an apartment block at 53 Kavkazskaya Street, Grozny. The building was destroyed during the hostilities in 1999-2000.
In November 2004 the second applicant applied to the Commission and his file was assigned number 02/13975.
In 2008 the applicant was registered as a person eligible for social housing because his flat had been destroyed during the hostilities. He was assigned number 1599 in the waiting list; in 2016 his number was 1579.
In April 2010 he was informed that his application had not been examined by the Commission since the address in question had not been entered in the register of destroyed buildings.
The second applicant complained to a court. On 5 July 2010 the Staropromyslovskiy District Court of Grozny rejected his complaint since the Commission was unable to proceed in the absence of the technical unit’s register. On 10 August 2010 the Supreme Court of Chechnya upheld the decision on appeal.
The second applicant sought to obtain damages from the Government of Chechnya for the damaged property and for failure to compensate the damage by alternative means. His claim was dismissed for failure to comply with the limitation period in a judgment of the Leninskiy District Court of Grozny of 27 June 2013, upheld on appeal on 7 November 2013 by the Supreme Court of Chechnya.
The Government submitted a letter issued by the Chechen Government on 13 January 2016, in response to a request for information in relation to the applicants’ situation. The letter stated that the Commission had ceased to exist in January 2014. It had held a final meeting on 16 September 2013 and, according to the minutes of the meeting (no. 61), had rejected all claims lodged by the owners of property which had not been entered in the register of destroyed buildings. Both applicants were in that category. In respect of the first applicant, the letter stated that her house had been inspected by the technical unit, which had confirmed its destruction (without specifying the date or any reference to the inspection record); however, for unknown reasons the building had not been entered in the register. The second applicant’s house had been inspected by the technical unit, which had found that it had not been destroyed (without specifying the date or any reference to the inspection record). The letter concluded by saying that all documents relevant to the individuals’ claims for compensation had been transferred to the Chechnya Government Archives Service for storage. No additional documents were submitted by the Government, and it is unclear whether the applicants were informed of the Commission’s decision.
The second applicant also submitted additional documents dating back to 2008 and 2010, confirming destruction of the apartment block where he had owned a flat. In February 2008 the local district administration examined flat no. 12 at 53 Kavkazskaya Street, Grozny, and concluded that it had been 100% destroyed. The applicant was issued with a certificate to that effect. On 24 May 2010 the local administration examined the building at 53 Kavkazskaya Street and found that it had been demolished.
In Decree no. 510 of 30 April 1997 the Russian Government established that residents of the Chechen Republic who had lost their housing and/or other possessions during the hostilities in the Republic and who, no later than 12 December 1994, had left permanently for another region were entitled to compensation.
Government Decree no. 404 of 4 July 2003 established the right of all permanent residents of the Chechen Republic who had lost their housing and any possessions therein after 12 December 1994 to receive compensation up to a maximum amount of 300,000 Russian roubles (RUB) for housing and RUB 50,000 for other possessions. The decree was subsequently changed on several occasions; most notably, in 2008 the Ministry of Regional Development (in lieu of the Federal Authority on construction and municipal services) was put in charge of implementing its provisions. In 2012 its application was extended beyond the initially determined period of 2003-2004. According to the Government, between 2003 and 2012 compensation payments were made to 85,151 people in a total sum of RUB 29,802.8 million.
As can be seen from the relevant documents, three presidential directives (поручения Президента) were issued by the President of Russia to the competent Government agencies with the aim of resolving the compensation issues in August 2006 (no. 1325), June 2007 (no. 1094) and September 2010 (no. 2736). According to various official letters furnished by the applicants, since 2009 the Ministry of Regional Development has been developing a new scheme of compensation for the persons affected.
On 22 January 2014 the Head of the Chechnya Government passed Decree no. 10 putting the Chechnya Archive Service in charge of storing documents concerning compensation for lost property.
On 27 November 2015 the Ministry of the Russian Federation on matters concerning the Northern Caucasus issued order no. 179, setting up an inter-agency working group. Its mandate included developing measures of State support for persons who had lost their homes during the crisis in Chechnya.
On 20 December 2005 the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation refused to examine in substance complaints about the constitutionality of Government Decrees nos. 510 and 404. In its decision the Court stressed that “these Government Decrees are specific legislative acts which establish simplified procedures enabling affected individuals to have their rights restored and to obtain certain compensation; they neither limit nor exclude the application of the general rules of civil law governing property rights, compensation for damage and so on. These questions remain to be resolved by the courts of general jurisdiction following claims by individuals seeking to vindicate their rights, upon full establishment of all the factual circumstances of each case”.
On 14 September 2010 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation issued a decision following an application brought by Mrs I., a Grozny resident. She sought to have certain provisions of Decree no. 510 declared unconstitutional since they could be interpreted as preventing her from obtaining full compensation for destroyed property. The Supreme Court stressed that the Decree in question set up a simplified procedure for obtaining an additional measure of social relief available to a wide group of affected individuals. It was not intended to compensate fully for the losses sustained, but did not prevent those willing to do so from pursuing civil remedies in the usual manner.
