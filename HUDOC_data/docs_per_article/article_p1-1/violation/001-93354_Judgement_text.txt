The case originated in an application (no. 27636/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Ms Egalina Simeonova Panayotova (“the applicant”), on 23 July 2004.
The applicant was represented by Ms S. Margaritova-Vuchkova, a lawyer practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs S. Atanasova of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged that she had been deprived of her property in violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention.
On 3 March 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
Zdravka Kalaydjieva, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the case. On 30 January 2009 the Government appointed in her stead Pavlina Panova as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1 of the Rules of the Court).
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in .
In 1967 her parents purchased from the  municipality a two-room apartment of 69 square metres in the centre of the city. The apartment had become State property by virtue of the nationalisations carried out by the communist regime in  after 1947.
After the deaths of her parents the applicant inherited from them.
On 23 February 1993 the former pre-nationalisation owners of the apartment brought proceedings against the applicant under section 7 of the Restitution Law, seeking nullification of her title and restoration of their property. The proceedings ended by a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 5 March 2004. The courts declared the 1967 contract null and void and restored the plaintiffs’ title to the apartment on two grounds: 1) the initial decision to sell the apartment had not been affirmed by the Minister of Architecture and Public Works but by his deputy; and 2) the sale contract had been signed not by the mayor but by one of his deputies. Although the mayor had been entitled to authorise another person to sign such contracts, he had made no written and explicit authorisation.
After the final judgment in her case, it became possible for the applicant to seek compensation from the State in the form of bonds, which could be used in privatisation tenders or sold to brokers. The applicant did not immediately apply for bonds.
She requested bonds in November 2006, following the amendments to the Restitution Law of June 2006. The regional governor dismissed the request and the applicant appealed against the refusal; the appeal was dismissed in a final judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court of 6 April 2009. The domestic courts found that persons who had not applied for compensation bonds within the relevant time-limit, in force since 2000, could not seek such bonds after the adoption in June 2006 of new paragraphs 2 and 3 of section 7 of the Restitution Law as the amendment at issue did not give rise to a new entitlement to compensation bonds and therefore did not affect the relevant time-limit.
In February 2007 the applicant vacated the apartment.
The relevant background facts and domestic law and practice have been summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Velikovi and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 43278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01, and 194/02, 15 March 2007.
