The case originated in an application (no. 35355/08) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Ms Gana Petkova Velcheva (“the applicant”), on 30 June 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms G. Chernicherska, lawyers practising in Plovdiv. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Y. Stoyanova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged that the authorities had failed to comply with a final court judgment allowing her claim for restitution of agricultural land.
On 7 May 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1927 and lives in the village of Ribaritsa.
Her father, of whom she is the sole heir, owned agricultural land in the area surrounding the village which was incorporated into an agricultural cooperative at the beginning of the 1950s.
In 1991, following the adoption of the Agricultural Land Act (“the ALA”, see paragraph 17 below), the applicant applied for the land’s restitution.
By a decision dated 10 March 1999 the land commission dealing with the case refused to restore her rights to two plots of 900 and 2,000 square metres respectively, noting that sheep pens had been built on them by the agricultural cooperative. It held that the applicant was entitled to compensation in lieu of restitution.
The above decision was served on the applicant in 2004, whereupon she applied for a judicial review.
In a judgment of 8 September 2005 the Teteven District Court quashed the decision of 10 March 1999, finding, on the basis of an expert report, that there were no buildings on the plots at issue, only assorted construction materials. Accordingly, there was no obstacle to the plots’ restitution in kind. In addition, the Agriculture and Forestry Department – the successor body of the land commission – had argued in the proceedings that the land had been sold by the agricultural cooperative to a third party. According to the District Court, this circumstance, apart from being unsubstantiated, could not bar restitution in kind either, because any dispute as to the land’s ownership would fall to be examined by the civil courts after completion of the restitution procedure.
On the basis of the above, the District Court held that the applicant was entitled to the restitution in kind of the two plots of land.
No appeal was lodged against the above judgment and it entered into force on 26 September 2005.
On 20 February 2006 the Agriculture and Forestry Department took another decision on the same matter, refusing the restitution in kind of two plots of land, one of 2,127 square metres and the other of 454 square metres, apparently identical to the plots discussed above. The Department noted that in 1995 the two plots had been sold by the agricultural cooperative to a third party, and that an agricultural building and a metal shelter had been erected on the plot of 2,127 square metres. It held once again that the applicant was entitled to compensation in lieu of restitution.
The applicant applied for a judicial review of that decision. In a final judgment of 4 October 2006 the Lovech Regional Court found the decision null and void since it contradicted the judgment of 8 September 2005.
The applicant submits that following the Lovech Regional Court’s judgment she paid numerous visits to the Agriculture and Forestry Department to request compliance with the judgment of 8 September 2005. In July 2007 she wrote to the Department’s superior body, the Lovech Regional Directorate of Agriculture and Forests, requesting its intervention.
In 18 October 2006 the Agriculture and Forestry Department adopted a new decision on the matter. Noting that the applicant’s right to restitution had been recognised by virtue of the judgments of 8 September 2005 and 4 October 2006, it restored her rights to three plots, measuring 2,127, 319 and 454 square metres respectively, which were apparently identical to the plots discussed above. The decision identified the plots measuring 2,127 and 454 square metres with their borders and specifications under the cadastral plan, but not the plot of 319 square metres. The decision, a copy of which was submitted by the Government, bears no mention of having been received by the applicant.
The Agricultural Land Act (Закон за собствеността и ползването на земеделските земи) was adopted in 1991. Its relevant provisions concerning the restitution of agricultural land to its former owners have been summarised in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Lyubomir Popov v. Bulgaria (no. 69855/01, §§ 8387 and 92, 7 January 2010) and Sivova and Koleva v. Bulgaria (no. 30383/03, §§ 29-44, 15 November 2011).
In particular, section 14(1) of the ALA provides that a decision of the Agriculture Department (as the Agriculture and Forestry Departments were referred to after 2008) ordering restitution, accompanied by a plan of the respective plot, serves as valid title to property equivalent to a notarial deed. Where no such plan has been issued, the domestic courts have systematically accepted that the restitution procedure has not been finalised and that the interested parties therefore cannot seek judicial protection of their property rights (see for example Решение № 1161 от 14.11.2008 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 4952/2007 г., II г. о., and Определение № 466 от 17.10.2008 г. на ВКС по ч. гр. д. № 1187/2008 г., I г. о., submitted by the applicant; also Решение № 248 от 27.07.2010 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 58/2009 г., II г. о.). Such judicial protection can be sought in situations where third parties claim to be the owners of restituted land on a legal basis other than restitution (see, for more details on such situations, Sivova and Koleva, cited above, § 44).
On the other hand, section 14(4) of the ALA provides that “any dispute concerning substantive rights is to be resolved by the courts”. This procedure is to be resorted to where there are competing claims as to who was the owner of a given plot prior to the collectivisation, and thus who is entitled to restitution (see Тълкувателно решение № 1 по гр. д. № 11/1997 г. на ВКС, ОСГК, and Решение № 9 от 11.04.2009 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 6026/2007 г., I г. о.). This provision can be resorted to even where the restitution procedure concerning some of the claimants has not been completed.
