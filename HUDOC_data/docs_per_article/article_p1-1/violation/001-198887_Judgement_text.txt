The case originated in an application (no. 45806/11) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a hundred and forty-seven Bulgarian nationals (“the applicants”) on 15 July 2011. Some of the applicants passed away after the lodging of the application and their heirs expressed a wish to continue the proceedings in their stead. A list of the applicants, indicating also the heirs of those of them who have passed away, is set out in the appendix.
The applicants were represented by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms G. Chernicherska, lawyers practising in Plovdiv. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms I. Stancheva-Chinova and Ms I. Nedyalkova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicants, who had initiated restitution-of-property proceedings, complained, relying on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 13 of the Convention, about the impossibility of obtaining restitution in kind and about the prolonged uncertainty in resolving their restitution claims.
On 5 July 2018 the Government were given notice of the application, in so far as the applicants enumerated in the appendix were concerned, while the complaints of other initial applicants were declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
Ancestors of the applicants owned plots of agricultural land in the outskirts of Sofia, in an area called Vrazhdebna. In the 1950s the land was incorporated into an agricultural cooperative.
In 1960 the State expropriated part of the land used by the cooperative. The plot, measuring about 350,000 square metres, was registered as State property in 1970. On that land the Ministry of Education created, and subsequently managed, an experimental field for students and trainee agrobiologists. In the 1960s and 1970s buildings, roads, irrigation installations and other infrastructure were constructed on the land.
In 1998 the Minister of Education granted the use of the field to the Forestry University in Sofia.
In the meantime, in 1991 Parliament enacted the Agricultural Land Act (hereinafter “the 1991 Act”, see paragraph 46 below). On different dates after that the applicants applied for the restitution of their ancestors’ land. The individual restitution procedures, most of which have not yet ended, are described in more detail in paragraphs 17-45 below.
In 1999 the Ministry of Agriculture proposed that about 63,000 square metres of the territory of the experimental field be reserved for use by the Forestry University, and the remainder be used to satisfy restitution claims of former owners of land in the area. In 2001, upon the initiative of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Sofia regional governor proposed to the Council of Ministers (the Government) to annul its 1960 decision concerning the expropriation of the land (see paragraph 6 above), as that decision was seen as an impediment to the completion of the restitution procedures. The proposal has never been examined by the Government.
A land redistribution plan for Vrazhdebna (concerning land not included in the territory of the experimental field) was adopted in 1999 (on such plans see paragraph 48 below).
In 2008 the Minister of Education once again granted the Forestry University the right to use and manage the experimental field, and initiated a procedure for the registration of that land as public State property.
In 2010 the Kremikovtsi Agricultural Department (hereinafter “the Agricultural Department”) took the position that the land at issue was being used “ineffectively” by the University. It reiterated its proposal that, apart from 63,000 square metres necessary for the experimental field, the remainder of the land should be subject to restitution.
In 2011 the Minister of Education sent a letter to the Minister of Agriculture, explaining that the totality of the land was being used as an experimental field, and insisting that the restitution decisions concerning the territory of the field be re-examined.
On 18 March 2014 the plot of land, with a surface of 340,959 square metres, was entered by the Sofia regional governor into the list of public State properties.
In 2017 the Agricultural Department instructed the applicants to submit requests for the restitution in kind of their plots.
In October 2018 some of the applicants brought an action against the State, contesting the registration of the land of the experimental field as public State property, and seeking a judicial declaration that that land was not such property. The Court has not been informed of the course of these proceedings.
In a decision of 18 May 1994 the Kremikovtsi land commission (hereinafter “the land commission”, after 2002 renamed as Agricultural Department, see paragraph 59 below) refused the restitution of a plot of land. After applicants nos. 1-9 sought judicial review, that decision was quashed on 26 May 1995 by the Sofia District Court, which found it sufficiently established that the applicants’ ancestor had owned the plot and that the land had been included in the agricultural cooperative. Accordingly, it stated that it “restored” the applicants’ rights to the plot “through a land redistribution plan”.
Despite that, in a subsequent decision of 19 June 1995 the land commission stated that the applicants were to receive compensation in lieu of restitution. That decision was served on the applicants.
The applicants did not object to the land redistribution plan for Vrazhdebna adopted in 1999 (see paragraph 10 above).
In 2006 they sought a judicial declaration that the decision of 19 June 1995 was null and void. Such a declaration was made in a judgment of the Sofia District Court of 4 July 2007, which found that the impugned decision contradicted the previous judgment of 26 May 1995.
In 2017 the applicants submitted a request for restitution in kind (see paragraph 15 above). In a decision of 18 January 2018 the Agricultural Department refused such restitution, noting that the land claimed by them was considered public State property, and held that the applicants were entitled to compensation. The applicants applied for judicial review. The proceedings initiated by them are still pending.
As concerns the restitution claims of applicants nos. 34, 37 and 6167, prior to 2010 the land commission, subsequently Agricultural Department, gave several decisions, which were quashed or declared null and void by the competent courts upon application by the applicants. Finally, their entitlement to restitution in kind was recognised in a decision of the Agricultural Department of 16 December 2010.
In 2005-06 applicants nos. 10-25 and 44-60 brought proceedings against the Agricultural Department under section 11(2) of the 1991 Act (see paragraph 53 below), seeking a declaration that they were entitled to the restitution of different plots of land. Their claims were allowed in judgments of the Sofia District Court, which recognised the applicants’ restitution rights. After that, in decisions given in 2006 and 2007 the Agricultural Department also provided such a recognition.
In 2017 the applicants submitted requests for restitution in kind (see paragraph 15 above). In four decisions dated 11 and 18 January 2018 the Agricultural Department refused such restitution, noting that the land at issue was considered public State property, and held that the applicants were entitled to compensation in lieu of restitution. The applicants applied for judicial review. The proceedings are still pending.
In one of the cases (brought by applicants nos. 44-60), in a judgment of 8 January 2019 the Sofia District Court dismissed the application for judicial review, finding that the previous judicial and administrative decisions had not ordered restitution in kind and could not give rise to title to property, but had contained a general recognition of the applicants’ entitlement to restitution. The Agricultural Department’s impugned decision had determined the manner of completing the restitution procedure, namely through the provision of compensation. Restitution in kind of the land claimed by the applicants was impossible, in particular given the requirements of section 24(2) of the 1991 Act (see paragraph 49 below).
On an unspecified date the applicants lodged an appeal against that judgment.
In 2007 applicants nos. 121-30 brought proceedings against the Agricultural Department under section 11(2) of the 1991 Act, and their entitlement to restitution was recognised in a judgment of 7 March 2008 of the Sofia City Court. In a subsequent decision of 17 May 2008, which was not contested and became final, the Agricultural Department also recognised the applicants’ entitlement to restitution, holding expressly that part of the plot claimed by them could not be subject to restitution in kind since it fell within the territory of the experimental field.
As concerns applicants nos. 103-08, on 9 March 1999 the land commission stated that they were entitled to compensation in lieu of restitution. In another decision which the applicants submitted, dated 20 February 2001, it recognised, in principle, their entitlement to restitution in kind. The Government contested the authenticity of that latter decision, on the ground that an original of such a decision had not been found in the Agricultural Department’s archives, and the decision with corresponding number and date concerned different plots.
The entitlement of applicants nos. 68-82, 109-16 and 147 to the restitution of several plots of land in Vrazhdebna was recognised in decisions of the land commission (respectively Agricultural Department) issued on different dates in 1999 and 201011.
In 2017 the applicants submitted requests for restitution in kind (see paragraph 15 above). By letters sent in the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018 the Agricultural Department informed them that they had to submit cadastral plans of the plots claimed by them – documents that the applicants contend they are not able to obtain. The course of the restitution procedures after that is unclear.
In 2006 and 2007 applicants nos. 83-89 brought proceedings against the Agricultural Department, under section 11(2) of the 1991 Act, seeking a declaration that they were entitled to the restitution of different plots of land in Vrazhdebna. The actions were allowed by the competent courts in 2006 and 2011.
In the proceedings brought by applicants nos. 83-87, in a subsequent decision of 11 January 2018 the Agricultural Department refused restitution in kind, noting that the plot of land claimed by them was considered public State property, and held that the applicants were to receive compensation. In ensuing proceedings for judicial review brought by the applicants, in a judgment of 27 December 2018 the Sofia District Court quashed the impugned decision, finding that the Agricultural Department had failed to show that any of the impediments to restitution in kind was present. The Department filed an appeal, and the appeal proceedings are pending.
In the proceedings brought by applicants nos. 88-89, on 2 August 2013 the Agricultural Department refused restitution in kind of the plots claimed, noting that the land fell within the territory of the experimental field used by the Forestry University, and held that the applicants were entitled to compensation. In judicial-review proceeding brought by the applicants, that decision was quashed in a final judgment of 29 May 2014 of the Sofia District Court, which noted that the Agricultural Department had not shown that any of the impediments to restitution in kind were present, in particular since it had not submitted evidence to prove that the land at issue indeed fell within the territory of the experimental field. Accordingly, the Sofia District Court held that the applicants’ property rights were to be restored. In a subsequent decision of 26 September 2014 accompanied by a cadastral plan the Agricultural Department also ordered restitution in kind, and in 2016 the applicants obtained a notarial deed, recognising them as owners. However, they could not enter into possession of the land, since it was being held by the Forestry University. In 2017 the land register in Sofia refused to register the land as property of the applicants, noting the property dispute between them and the University and pointing out that it fell to be decided by the civil courts.
In judgments given in 1996-97 and 2006 the Sofia District Court recognised the entitlement of applicants nos. 32-33, 117-20 and 140-46 to the restitution of several plots of land in Vrazhdebna. In further decisions given on different dates between 1999 and 2017 the land commission, respectively the Agricultural Department, refused restitution in kind of the plots at issue and held that the applicants were to receive compensation. The applicants did not apply for judicial review of the respective decisions, and those decisions entered into force.
As to applicants nos. 38-43, the land commission refused restitution in kind and held that they would receive compensation in a decision of 13 January 1995. Upon application by the applicants, that decision was declared null and void by the Sofia District Court on 19 November 2008. Subsequently, on 18 March 2009 the Agricultural Department held once again that the applicants were to receive compensation. The application for the judicial review of that decision submitted by the applicants was found inadmissible in 2011 and the decision at issue thus entered into force. Applicants nos. 38-43 submitted in addition a decision of the land commission dated 4 March 1999, restoring their property rights to the plots at issue. The document sent by them does not carry the signatures of the commission members, but has a handwritten mention that it is a valid copy, accompanied by the commission’s stamp. The Government disputed the authenticity of the document, saying that an original copy of such a decision could not be found, and that if such a decision had been validly given, it would have been pointless for the applicants to contest the initial refusal of the commission of 13 January 1995.
In 2001 the land commission set the value of the compensation to be provided to applicants nos. 140-46, and the applicants made a declaration as to their preferred means of compensation. No further decision on the compensation due to them has been taken. Nor has the land commission (later on Agricultural Department) taken any decision on the compensation to be provided to applicants nos. 32-33, 38-43 and 117-20.
Applicants nos. 134-39 submitted a copy of a decision dated 23 March 1999, with the heading and the stamp of the Agricultural Department, stating that their property rights to several plots in Vrazhdebna were being restored. The plots were not however identified with the necessary specifications (see paragraph 55 below). The document submitted by the applicants does not carry the signatures of the Department members, but has a handwritten mention that it is a valid copy, accompanied by the Department’s stamp. The applicants stated that it had not been accompanied by a cadastral plan of the plot.
The Government disputed the authenticity of the above document, and submitted another decision of the same date and bearing the same number, issued by the land commission and signed by its members, refusing restitution in kind of some of the plots claimed by the applicants and stating that the applicants would receive compensation. Another similar decision concerning the remaining plots claimed by the applicants had been issued on 12 January 1995. The Government stated that both decisions submitted by it had entered into force. The applicants, for their part, contended that they had never been notified of such decisions.
In several decisions issued in 1995 the land commission recognised the entitlement of applicants nos. 90-102 and 131-33 to the restitution of plots of land in Vrazhdebna, holding that these plots were to be returned to the applicants through a land redistribution plan. The applicants’ complaints concern some of these plots only.
A land redistribution plan for the area was adopted in 1999 (see paragraph 10 above) and a number of plots of land were allotted to the applicants. The applicants did not challenge the plan. In their submissions to the Court they claimed that that plan did not concern the plots which are the subject of the present complaints.
In 2001 a further decision of the land commission stated that other plots were to be returned through a land redistribution plan to applicants nos. 131-33.
In 2017 applicants nos. 90-102 submitted a request for restitution in kind of the plot which is the subject of their complaints. In a letter of 30 October 2017 the Agricultural Department instructed them to submit a cadastral plan of that plot – a document which they contend not to be able to obtain.
In decisions given between 1994 and 1999 the land commission recognised the entitlement of applicants nos. 26-31 and 34-37 to the restitution of several plots of land in Vrazhdebna, through a land redistribution plan.
Such a plan for the area was adopted in 1999 (see paragraph 10 above). Under it plots of land were allotted to the applicants. In December 1999 the applicants took possession of their land.
The individual proceedings described above are also presented in the following table, which contains additionally data on the size of the plots claimed by the applicants:
Restitution of agricultural land is provided for in the Agricultural Land Act of 1991 (Закон за собствеността и ползването на земеделските земи – “the 1991 Act”) and the Regulations on the Implementation of the Agricultural Land Act (Правилник за прилагане на Закона за собствеността и ползването на земеделските земи, hereinafter “the Regulations”).
The 1991 Act provides, inter alia, that persons, or their heirs, whose land has been collectivised, may request the restoration of their ownership rights under certain conditions. If their request is allowed, they can obtain restitution in kind or compensation in lieu thereof.
Restitution in kind can be “in actual boundaries” (“в стари реални граници”) – in cases where the old borders of the plot of land once owned by the claimant or his or her ancestors are preserved or traceable (roads, fences, river banks, trees and others, which have not changed after the collectivisation), or through a so-called land redistribution plan (“план за земеразделяне”). Land redistribution plans set new borders of the plots to be restituted, if possible in the approximate area where the plots previously owned had been situated (section 10a(2) of the 1991 Act).
The 1991 Act envisages different situations where restitution in kind (“in actual boundaries” or through a land redistribution plan) cannot be carried out and the claimants are to receive compensation in lieu thereof. Section 10(7) excludes restitution in kind in situations where third parties have lawfully constructed buildings in urbanised areas. Under section 10b(1), compensation is also to be awarded in cases where the land has been taken by a “complex of construction works” (мероприятие). The national courts have interpreted that latter term broadly, taking it to cover any construction or other public works, regardless of their lawfulness (Решение № 77 от 9.03.2010 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 4209/2008 г., I г. о., ГК; Решение № 70 от 22.06.2010 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 674/2009 г., I г. о., ГК). In addition, under section 24(2), (3) and (4) of the 1991 Act the State retains property of land used for purposes such as education, science, archaeological studies and national defence, as well as land included in certain national parks and reserves. The existence or not of the above impediments to restitution in kind is to be assessed as of the moment of the 1991 Act’s entry into force.
Additionally, if the land available for redistribution is not sufficient to satisfy the restitution claims of all former owners, they may be awarded partial compensation (section 19(1) and (8) of the Regulations). Compensation is also to be awarded in situations where a claimant has presented to the land commission/Agricultural Department a court judgment recognising his entitlement to restitution through a land redistribution plan or a judgment given in the procedure under section 11(2) of the 1999 Act (see paragraph 53 below) after a redistribution plan for the area has already been elaborated (section 11(4) of the 1991 Act and section 25(3) of the Regulations).
As to compensation in lieu of restitution, it can be through comparable municipally-owned land, in so far as such land is available, or through so-called compensation bonds.
Under section 11(1) of the 1991 Act, former owners, or their heirs, could initiate administrative proceedings for restitution within a period of seventeen months following the entry into force of the Act. They had to lodge a request for restitution with the local land commission, which had to establish whether the relevant statutory conditions for restitution were met, and if so, to issue a decision. Favourable decisions of the land commissions were not subject to judicial review and were final, whereas negative decisions were subject to judicial review (section 14(3) of the 1991 Act).
Persons seeking restitution of agricultural land who had missed the seventeen-month time-limit indicated above could bring an action for a declaratory judgment against the local land commission/Agricultural Department (section 11(2) of the 1991 Act). Such a possibility existed until 2007. Where the courts decided in favour of the claimants, the administrative bodies had to comply and issue the necessary decisions.
It has been the established practice of land commissions (Agricultural Departments) to issue several types of decisions during the different stages of the procedure. A first decision, based usually on an assessment of merely whether the claimants’ predecessors were the owners of the plots of land concerned and whether the land was included in an agricultural cooperative, recognises the claimants’ entitlement to restitution. Sometimes such a decision can also state that the restitution would be carried out through a land redistribution plan (section 14(1)(2) of the 1991 Act). Decisions of that type do not give rise to any title to property (Решение № 11 от 06.02.1998 г. по гр. д. № 1480/1997, ВКС, IV гр. о.; Решение № 43 от 3.02.2010 г. на ОСПазарджик по в. гр. д. № 12/2010 г.; Решение от 20.12.2017 г. на ОС-Ямбол по в. гр. д. № 318/2017 г.). They have been referred to in the legal theory as “recognition” decisions (Венцислав Стоянов, Стойка Куртева, Юлия Стойкова, „Правен режим на земеделските земи и горските територии“, 2011, стр. 24-25). Judgments given in proceedings under section 11(2) of the 1991 Act can also only have a “recognition” effect (Решение от 20.12.2017 г. на ОСЯмбол по в. гр. д. № 318/2017 г.; Решение № 473 от 24.11.2014 г. на РС - Карлово по гр. д. № 235/2013 г.).
A further decision of the land commission (Agricultural Department) orders restitution “in actual boundaries” or allocates the former owners specific plots under a land redistribution plan. Such decisions – capable of giving rise to property rights and completing the restitution procedure through restitution in kind – have been known in the legal theory as “restoration” decisions. A “restoration” decision has to indicate the specifications of the plots of land concerned, namely their size, category, location and borders. Such a decision must also be accompanied by a cadastral plan of the plots. If these requirements are met, the decision at issue, after it enters into force, serves as title to property equivalent to a notarial deed (sections 14(1)(1) and 17(1) of the 1991 Act and sections 18g(1) and 27(1) and (3) of the Regulations).
Nevertheless, even where such a decision has been issued and has entered into force, it can be contested by a third party having competing claims (not based on restitution) to the same plot of land, since the procedure under the 1991 Act does not permit that party’s participation and any judgments and decisions given in the restitution proceedings are not considered binding on it. The domestic courts examining such a third-party claim exercise what is called “indirect judicial review” and re-examine, in view of the new arguments put forward, whether the preconditions for restitution in kind had been in place (Решение № 201 от 30.06.2010 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 79/2009 г., II г. о., ГК; Решение № 250 от 8.05.2014 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 3215/2013 г., II г. о., ГК; additional domestic case law is cited in Sivova and Koleva v. Bulgaria, no. 30383/03, § 44, 15 November 2011).
Different decisions are also given by the land commissions (Agricultural Departments) with regard to the allocation of compensation in lieu of restitution. The relevant bodies are to set the value and type of compensation and, where compensation is to be through the provision of other comparable land, select and distribute the respective plots (Article 19a of the 1991 Act).
Interested parties may make challenges to land redistribution plans, before the land commission or the courts, within fourteen days of their publication (section 25(2), (4) and (6) of the Regulations).
The competent administrative bodies – land commissions, which were local branches of the Ministry of Agriculture – were replaced with Agricultural Departments in 2002.
Pursuant to section 7(1) of the State Property Act (Закон за държавната собственост), public State property cannot be transferred to private persons.
Entries into the list of State-owned properties, to be effectuated by regional governors, do not in themselves give rise to property rights for the State (section 5(3) of the State Property Act). Any ownership dispute is to be determined by the courts (section 79(3) of the Act).
