The case originated in an application (no. 5271/05) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Lyudmila Borisovna Dubinskaya (“the applicant”), on 14 November 2003.
The applicant was represented by Ms K. Moskalenko, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Ms V. Milinchuk, Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 22 October 2007 the President of the First Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning non-enforcement of a domestic judgment to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3). The Government objected to the joint examination of the admissibility and merits, but the Court rejected this objection.
The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Volgodonsk, a town in the Rostov Region. In 1999 she lost her home in a terrorist bomb attack.
On 1 November 2002 the Leninskiy District Court of Krasnodar ordered a local authority to provide the applicant with a flat within three months of the judgment’s entry into force. This judgment entered into force on 19 December 2002.
On 19 February 2003 the District Court clarified the judgment and indicated that the flat had to measure at least 72 m².
In 2002–04 the local authority several times applied for a supervisory review of the judgment, and pending this procedure the enforcement was stayed.
On 12 March 2004 the local authority offered the applicant a flat, but she refused it. On 9 August 2004 the local authority offered another flat (measuring 76.78 m²) and the applicant accepted it. On 28 September 2004 the applicant’s ownership was formalised.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months.
