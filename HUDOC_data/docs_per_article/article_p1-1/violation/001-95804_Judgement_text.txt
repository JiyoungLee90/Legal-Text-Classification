The case originated in an application (no. 46755/99) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Greek national, Mrs Anthousa P. P. Iordanou (“the applicant”), on 17 December 1998.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr P. Erotocritou, a lawyer practising in . The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z.M. Necatigil.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the Turkish occupation of the northern part of  had deprived her of her properties.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
By a decision of 25 June 2002 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Government of Cyprus, which had exercised its right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 (b)).
The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in .
The applicant lived in her family home in Lapithos (the biggest village in the Kyrenia district of northern ) until 1963, when she married and moved to her husband's house in a neighbouring village. Her mother came from Sysklipos, another village near Lapithos, where she owned land. The applicant claimed to have acquired the ownership of the family property in the two villages, as well as a right to draw a certain amount of water from a spring in Sysklipos.
The Government challenged the applicant's property claims, particularly as regarded the properties in Sysklipos, as they had evidence that it had belonged to other persons. The applicant replied that those other persons were her parents who had donated these properties to her.
On 27 November 1973 the applicant applied to the Kyrenia Land Registry Office for a permit to divide one of her plots of land in Lapithos into sixteen building sites. She alleged that the issuing of the permit would have significantly increased the value of her land.
However, this planning procedure was not completed because, due to the 1974 Turkish intervention, the applicant and her family had been forced to leave all their property and possessions and move to Limassol in southern . The applicant was thereby deprived of her property rights, all her property being located in the area which was under the occupation and control of the Turkish military authorities. The latter had prevented her from having access to and using her property.
Attached to her observations of 4 September 2002, the applicant produced a certificate of affirmation of ownership of Turkish-occupied immovable properties, issued on 12 August 2002 by the Departments of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus, and an affidavit, signed by herself, in which she declared that she owned 8 pieces of land in Lapithos “all on the mountain slope, very suitable for building purposes”.
