The case originated in an application (no. 889/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Croatian nationals of Serbian origin, Mr Nikola Vučak and Mrs Mira Vučak (“the applicants”), on 6 December 2005.
The applicants were represented by Mr T. Vukičević, a lawyer practising in . The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Š. Stažnik.
On 14 May 2007 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the right to respect for one’s home and the right to the peaceful enjoyment of one’s possessions to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants were born in 1940 and 1946, respectively, and currently live in .
They are the owners of a three-storey family house in Knin, with a surface area of 350 square metres. They lived there until 5 August 1995, when they left . It appears that the second applicant returned to Croatia in November or December 1995 and went to live with her son in . The first applicant joined them in July 2000.
On 27 September 1995 the Temporary Takeover and Administration of Certain Property Act (“the Takeover Act”) entered into force. It provided that property belonging to persons who had left Croatia after 17 October 1990 was to be sequestered, that is, taken into the care of and controlled by the State. It also authorised local authorities (takeover commissions) to temporarily accommodate other persons in such property.
On 4 October 1996 the Commission for Temporary Takeover and Use of Certain Property of the Town of  (Komisija za privremeno preuzimanje i korištenje određene imovine Grada Knina – “the Takeover Commission”) issued a decision authorising a certain A.M. and M.M. to use the applicants’ house temporarily.
In June 1998 Parliament adopted the Programme for the Return of Refugees and Displaced Persons (“the Programme for Return”), regulating the principles for their return and repossession of their property.
On 17 March 1999 both applicants applied for repossession of their house to the Housing Commission of the Town of Knin (Stambena Komisija Knin – “the Housing Commission”), as provided by the Programme for Return.
On 30 November 2001 the Housing Commission set aside the Takeover Commission’s decision of 4 October 1996 and ordered that the property be returned to the applicants once alternative accommodation had been secured for the temporary occupants. However, no such accommodation was secured and the temporary occupants continued to live in the applicants’ house.
On 9 April 2003 the applicants brought a civil action in the Knin Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Kninu) against A.M. and M.M., seeking their eviction. On 7 October 2003 the court delivered a judgment ordering the respondents to vacate the house within 15 days after being provided with a place to stay. It held that until then they were entitled to remain in the applicants’ property.
Even though the court formally ruled in favour of the applicants, they appealed, arguing that by making their right to repossess their own house dependent on a future and uncertain event, the first-instance court actually exceeded its authority by granting a relief different from the one they sought (that is, ruled extra petitum).
On 22 December 2003 the  (Županijski sud u Šibeniku) dismissed the applicants’ appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment. The applicants then lodged a constitutional complaint alleging violations of their constitutional rights to respect for their home and their property and to equality before the law.
On 21 September 2005 the  (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed their complaint.
The applicants submit that they have never regained possession of their house, which was instead sold without their authorisation (see paragraph 18 below).
Meanwhile, on 16 September 2004 the State Real Estate Agency (Agencija za pravni promet i posjedovanje nekretninama) and a certain K.V. – who submitted a power-of-attorney allegedly signed by the applicants authorising her to act on their behalf – concluded a sale contract whereby the applicants sold their house to the State for 335,700 Croatian kunas (HRK).
On 27 October 2004 the State leased the house to the above-mentioned temporary occupants.
The applicants claimed that they had never heard of K.V., let alone authorised her to sell their house, and that only on 29 November 2004 had they found out that the house had been sold. On 1 December 2004 they filed a criminal complaint against K.V. with the competent State Attorney’s Office.
On 11 October 2004 the State Real Estate Agency applied to the Land Registry Division of the Knin Municipal Court with a view to registering the State as the owner of the applicants’ house on the basis of the above sale contract. On 10 November 2004, after finding that the sale contract and the power-of-attorney were not in conformity with certain formal requirements, the court allowed only preliminary registration, which the State had to validate by bringing a civil action against the applicants within 15 days. After finding out about the sale (see paragraph 20 above), on 15 December 2004 the applicants appealed against the preliminary registration decision, arguing they did not know who K.V. was and thus could not have authorised her to sell their house.
On 19 January 2005 the  accepted the appeal and reversed the first-instance decision by dismissing the Agency’s request in its entirety. It found that the request did not even meet the requirements for preliminary registration.
On 14 June 2005 the State Real Estate Agency re-submitted their request. On 28 June 2005 the Knin Municipal Court dismissed it.
On 27 June 2005 the State brought a regular civil action against the applicants in the Knin Municipal Court seeking to be declared the owner of their house and recorded as such in the land register.
The plaintiff argued that the applicants had sold their house to the State and received the money for it. The applicants replied that they had never heard of K.V., who had purportedly signed the sale contract on their behalf, nor authorised her to do so. They added that they had never received any money for the sale of their house.
After obtaining an opinion from an expert in graphology, on 5 March 2007 the Municipal Court dismissed the plaintiff’s action, finding that the applicants’ signatures on the power-of-attorney allegedly given to K.V. had been forged and that the sale contract was therefore null and void.
On 18 June 2008 the  dismissed the appeal of the State and upheld the first-instance judgment, which thereby became final.
Section 27 (4) of the Act on Areas of Special State Concern (Zakon o područjima od posebne državne skrbi, Official Gazette nos. 44/1996, 57/1996 (corrigendum), 124/1997, 73/2000, 87/2000 (corrigendum), 69/2001, 94/2001, 88/2002, 26/2003 (consolidated text), 42/2005), as amended by the 2002 Amendments (which entered into force on 1 October 2002), provides for the State to pay compensation for the damage sustained by owners who applied for repossession of their property prior to 30 October 2002 but whose property was not returned by that date.
The Decision on the Level of Compensation Due to Owners for Damage Sustained (Odluka o visini naknade vlasnicima za pretrpljenu štetu, Official Gazette no. 68/2003) established the amount of that compensation at HRK 7 per month per square metre.
The other relevant domestic law and practice concerning repossession of property sequestered by the State are set out in Radanović v. Croatia, no. 9056/02, §§ 27-29 and 33, 21 December 2006, and Kunić v. Croatia, no. 22344/02, §§ 42-43, 11 January 2007.
Section 120 (1) of the Act on Ownership and Other Rights In Rem (Zakon o vlasništvu i drugim stvarnim pravima, Official Gazette nos. 91/1996, 73/2000 and 114/2001) provides that ownership of immovable property shall be acquired by registration in the land register, unless the law provides otherwise.
