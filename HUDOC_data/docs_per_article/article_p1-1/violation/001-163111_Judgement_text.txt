The case originated in fifteen applications (nos. 61604/10, 62492/10, 62499/10, 62658/10, 62668/10, 63100/10, 63108/10, 63123/10, 63137/10, 63145/10, 63356/10, 63494/10, 63510/10, 63587/10, and 64856/10) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on 29 September 2010. The applicants are all Serbian nationals, and their further personal details are set out in the appendix to this judgment.
The applicants were all represented before the Court by Mr M. Marjanović and Ms M. Dedović-Marjanović, lawyers practicing in Leskovac. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Ms V. Rodić.
On 5 June 2013 the applications were communicated to the Government.
All applicants were former employees of “LETEKS” u stečaju (the debtor), which was, at the relevant time, a company predominantly comprised of socially-owned capital.
Since the debtor failed to fulfil its contractual obligations towards its employees, on an unspecified date, the applicants instituted civil proceedings against it.
On 18 April 2008 the Leskovac Municipal Court ordered the debtor to pay the applicants specified amounts on account of salary arrears, plus the costs and expenses of the civil proceedings.
On 3 October 2010 the above judgment became final.
Between 20 November 2008 and 30 November 2009 all applicants filed separate requests for the enforcement of the above judgment.
The Leskovac Municipal Court ultimately accepted the applicants’ requests and issued the enforcement orders, respectively. The essential information as to the enforcement proceedings in respect of each application is outlined in the Annex to this judgment.
On 25 January 2011 the Leskovac Commercial Court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor (St. 47/2010).
The applicants duly submitted their respective claims.
On an unspecified date the applicants’ claims based on the judgment of 18 April 2008 were formally recognised.
The insolvency proceedings against the debtor are still ongoing.
On 31 March 2010, the applicants lodged a constitutional appeal.
On 8 July 2013 the Constitutional Court dismissed the appeal in respect of all applicants except the applicants Ms Jagoda Jančić (application no. 62499/10), Mr Predrag Stamenković (application no. 63100/10) and Ms Stana Stanković (application no. 63137/10).
On 18 September 2013 the Constitutional Court also found a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, in respect of Ms Jančić, Mr Stamenković and Ms Stanković. It further awarded each of them 500 euros (EUR) as just satisfaction for non-pecuniary damage and ordered the court in Leskovac to expedite the proceedings.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially-owned companies, as well as enforcement and insolvency proceedings, has been outlined in the cases of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06 et al., §§ 57-64 and 71-76, 15 January 2008, and Jovičić and Others v. Serbia (dec.), no. 37270/11, §§ 88-93, 15 October 2013. Furthermore, the case-law of the Constitutional Court in respect of socially-owned companies, together with the relevant provisions concerning constitutional redress has likewise been outlined in the admissibility decision in Marinković v. Serbia (dec.), no. 5353/11, §§ 26 -29 and 31-44, 29 January 2013, the judgment in Marinković v. Serbia, no. 5353/11, §§ 29-31, 22 October 2013, and the decision in Ferizović v. Serbia (dec.), no. 65713/13, §§ 12-17, 26 November 2013.
