The case originated in an application (no. 36765/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Aleksandr Anatolyevich Bezborodov (“the applicant”), on 29 October 2003.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Ms V. Milinchuk, the former Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 9 July 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in . He is a military officer.
At some point the applicant sued his military unit for wage arrears. By judgments of 1 June 2000 and 10 August 2000 the Mozdokskiy District Court of the  (Alaniya) (“the District Court”) awarded him 242,293 Russian Roubles (RUB). This amount was not paid to him within the statutory time-limit.
At some point the applicant brought a claim against the military unit for inflation losses arising out of protracted enforcement of the judgments of 1 June 2000 and 10 August 2000.
On 5 November 2001 the District Court allowed his claim and ordered military unit no. 3737 to pay him RUB 122,975.28 of damages resulting from delayed enforcement of two judgments in his favour.
It appears that the judgment was not appealed against and entered into force ten days later.
On 19 November 2001 the District Court issued the applicant with a writ of execution in respect of the judgment.
On 13 February 2002 the applicant submitted the writ to the Ministry of Finance.
By letter of 20 September 2002 the Ministry informed the applicant that the writ of execution had been forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior. The judgment remained unenforced, since no budget funds had been allocated from the federal budget for these purposes until 2004.
According to the Government, on 29 October 2004 the amount of RUB 122,975.28 was paid to the applicant. The Government submitted a copy of the payment order dated 29 October 2004 confirming that the entire sum had been transferred to the applicant’s account.
According to the applicant, on 1 November 2004 he received the amount of RUB 122,900 credited into his bank account. He submitted a copy of the same payment order of 29 October 2004 (see paragraph 12 above) confirming transfer of 122,975.28 to his account.
On 14 November 2005 the applicant brought court proceedings claiming compensation for depreciation of the judgment debt due to inflation for a period between 14 February 2002, the date when the Ministry of Finance received the writ of execution, and 29 October 2004, the date when the judgment had been enforced.
On 20 December 2005 the District Court granted the applicant’s claim and awarded him RUB 46,238.68 against his military unit.
On 17 March 2006 the command of the respondent unit applied for reopening of the case in view of the newly established circumstances.
On 27 March 2006 the District Court granted the application, annulled the judgment of 20 December 2005 and scheduled a new examination of the case.
On 18 August 2006 the District Court examined the applicant’s action, found in his favour and ordered the military unit to pay him RUB 125,557.76. The respondent unit appealed.
On 16 May 2007 the Supreme Court of the  (Alaniya) quashed the judgment of 18 August 2006 on appeal and remitted the case for a new consideration by the first instance court.
On 3 October 2007 the District Court examined the case afresh and allowed the applicant’s action. The court found that the military unit was to pay the applicant RUB 41,528.75 of compensation for inflation losses resulting from the delayed enforcement of the judgment of 5 November 2001.
It appears that at some point the command of the respondent military unit applied for the reopening of the proceedings due to newly established circumstances.
On 26 December 2007 the District Court granted the request and reversed the judgment of 3 October 2007 on account of newly established circumstances.
On 29 January 2008 the District Court again examined and granted the applicant’s claim for upgrading of the judgment debt of 5 November 2001 and made a pecuniary award in the amount of RUB 40,950 in his favour.
In letter of 15 March 2008 the applicant informed the Court that at some point the judgment of 29 January 2008 had been appealed against by one of the parties. A new hearing had been scheduled for 19 March 2008. No further information has been provided by the parties. It appears that the proceedings are still pending.
At some point the applicant sued the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Interior and the Chief Command of the Interior troops of the Ministry of Interior for damages resulting from the delayed enforcement of the judgment of 5 November 2001. On 27 February 2008 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow rejected his claims. The court found no evidence that the damage claimed had been caused to the applicant by the respondent authorities, or that the latter had unlawfully withheld the applicant’s monetary assets. The applicant appealed. It appears that the appeal proceedings are still pending.
Chapter 59 § 4 of the Civil Code obliges the State to compensate a person’s non-pecuniary damage caused by a breach of his property rights. In particular, a court may hold the tortfeasor liable for non-pecuniary damage caused to an individual by actions impairing his or her personal non-property rights or affecting other intangible assets belonging to him or her (Articles 151 and 1099 § 1 of the Civil Code). Compensation for non-pecuniary damage sustained through an impairment of an individual’s property rights is only recoverable in cases provided for by law (Article 1099 § 2 of the Civil Code). Compensation for non-pecuniary damage is payable irrespective of the tortfeasor’s fault if damages were caused to an individual’s life or limb, sustained through unlawful criminal prosecution, dissemination of untrue information and in other cases provided for by law (Article 1100 of the Civil Code). Harm caused in the course of the administration of justice by the courts shall be compensated in cases where the fault of a judge has been established by a court judgment that has entered into legal force (Article 1070 § 2 of the Civil Code).
By Ruling no. 1-P of 25 January 2001, the Constitutional Court found that Article 1070 § 2 of the Civil Code was compatible with the Constitution in so far as it provided for special conditions on the State liability for the damage caused by administration of justice. State liability for the damage caused by such procedural acts or failures to act, such as a breach of the reasonable time of court proceedings, could arise even in the absence of a final criminal conviction of a judge if the fault of the judge has been established in civil proceedings. The  emphasised, however, that the constitutional right to compensation by the State for the damage should not be tied in with the individual fault of a judge. An individual should be able to obtain compensation for any damage incurred through a violation by a court of his or her right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. The  held that Parliament should legislate on the grounds and procedure for compensation by the State for the damage caused by unlawful acts or failures to act of a court or a judge and determine territorial and subject-matter jurisdiction over such claims.
