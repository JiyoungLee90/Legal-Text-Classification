The case originated in two applications (nos. 6161/13 and 57863/14) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Ms Branka Uzelac (“the first applicant”) and Ms Nada Đekić (“the second applicant”), on 10 December 2012 and 8 August 2014 respectively. The first applicant is a Croatian national, whereas the second applicant is a Croatian and Serbian national.
The first applicant was represented by Mr M. Ličina, a lawyer practising in Zagreb, and the second applicant was represented by Mr J. Borić, a lawyer practising in Belgrade. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik
The Government were given notice of the complaints concerning the right of property on 8 October 2015 (application no. 6161/13) and 7 September 2017 (application no. 57863/14), and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government of Serbia, having been informed of their right to intervene (application no. 57863/14) in accordance with Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court, did not avail themselves of this right.
The Government objected to the examination of the applications by a Committee. Having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The first applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Zagreb. The second applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Belgrade.
On 14 October 1997 the first applicant asked the Regional Office of the Croatian Pension Fund in Gospić (Hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje, Područna služba u Gospiću, hereinafter “the Gospić Office”) to grant her an old-age pension. At the time of submitting her request, the first applicant had her registered domicile in Gospić, Croatia. In order to demonstrate that she met the statutory requirement concerning years of service (see section 21(1) of the Basic Pension and Disability Insurance Act quoted in paragraph 53 below), she relied exclusively on the period between 1 December 1965 and 2 September 1991, during which she had worked in Croatia. In that regard, she submitted a copy of her employment booklet (radna knjižica) indicating that she had been in continuous employment during that period for twenty-five years and nine months. She did not fill in the section of the relevant application form provided by the Croatian Pension Fund where applicants were required to provide information concerning their employment abroad.
On 16 February 1998 the Gospić Office issued an interim decision whereby it
-  established that the first applicant had the right to a pension because on 1 November 1997 she had met the statutory requirements for an old-age pension (see section 21(1) of the Basic Pension and Disability Insurance Act quoted in paragraph 53 below); and
-  granted her advance payment of her pension (akontacija mirovine) until subordinate legislation for the implementation of the Validation Act was adopted (see paragraph 55 below) and the exact amount of her pension was calculated.
On the basis of that decision, the first applicant received advance payment of her pension until 31 December 2000.
On 4 February 1999, relying on the Validation Act (see paragraph 55 below), the first applicant asked the Gospić Office to recognise that in the period between 9 October 1991 and 4 August 1995 she had been working in a part of Croatia which had, in that period, been outside the Croatian authorities’ control, and to take that period into account for the purposes of her pension, namely, when calculating her years of service. By a decision of 14 November 2008 the Gospić Office established that the available evidence suggested that the first applicant had only worked during a part of that period, specifically, between 11 August 1992 and 18 March 1993, and it recognised only that part as counting towards her years of service.
Meanwhile, on 31 January 2001, the Gospić Office had invited the first applicant to submit evidence on whether she had been employed in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia after 1991, instructing her to request such evidence from the relevant authorities in Belgrade. The first applicant did not reply. The Gospić Office then requested that information of its own motion.
On 7 March 2001 the Serbian Fund for Pension and Disability Insurance in Belgrade (Republički fond za penzijsko i invalidsko osiguranje zaposlenih Beograd) informed the Gospić Office of the Croatian Pension Fund that from 28 April 1993 until 30 April 1994 the first applicant had been employed in Serbia (which was a federal unit of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in that period).
On 26 March 2001 the Central Office of the Croatian Pension Fund (Hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje, Središnja služba, hereinafter “the Central Office”) re-examined the first applicant’s case of its own motion in the context of supervision proceedings (see section 126 of the Pension Insurance Act quoted in paragraph 54 below, and section 63 of the Administrative Procedure Act quoted in paragraph 56 below). It established that the Gospić Office did not have jurisdiction to decide the first applicant’s case, given that her most recent employment had not been in Croatia (see section 75(4) of the Basic Pension and Disability Insurance Act quoted in paragraph 53 below). Thus, relying on section 263(1) subparagraph 1 of the Administrative Procedure Act (see paragraph 56 below), it set aside the first-instance decision of the Gospić Office of 16 February 1998 (see paragraph 8 above) and remitted the case for reconsideration.
In fresh proceedings, on 4 May 2001, the Gospić Office dismissed the first applicant’s request for a pension on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction. It considered that, in accordance with domestic law (see section 75(4) of the Basic Pension and Disability Insurance Act quoted in paragraph 53 below), the relevant authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had jurisdiction in the matter, since the first applicant’s most recent employment had been in Serbia (see paragraph 12 above). The first applicant did not appeal and that decision became final.
On 17 April 2001 the first applicant found employment in Croatia and was employed until 18 June 2001.
On 27 June 2001 she submitted a new pension request.
On 24 October 2001 the Zagreb Office of the Croatian Pension Fund (Hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje, Područna služba u Zagrebu, hereinafter “the Zagreb Office”) issued an interim decision whereby it
-  established that the first applicant had the right to a pension because she met the statutory requirements for an old-age pension (see section 178 of the Pension Insurance Act quoted in paragraph 54 below); and
-  granted her advance payment of her pension until the entry into force of the bilateral Social Insurance Agreement between Croatia and Serbia (see paragraph 58 below), which would enable it to obtain all the relevant information from the Serbian authorities about her employment there that was needed for the exact calculation of the amount of her pension.
Following the entry into force of that bilateral agreement on 1 May 2003 (see paragraph 58 below), on 7 May 2008 the Zagreb Office issued a definitive decision granting the first applicant the right to a pension with effect from 1 January 2001. Since the first applicant did not appeal, the decision became final shortly afterwards.
 Civil proceedings
In a letter of 24 July 2002 the Central Office proposed that the first applicant pay back in instalments the pension payments which she had received before 31 December 2000 (see paragraphs 8-9 above).
On 14 July 2005 the Central Office reminded the first applicant that she had to pay back those pension payments, and cautioned her that civil proceedings would be instituted against her if she failed to do so.
By a letter of 15 September 2005 the first applicant informed the Central Office that she refused to pay back the amounts sought (see paragraph 19 above).
On 3 November 2005 the Croatian Pension Fund brought a civil action against the first applicant, seeking reimbursement of the pension paid to her before 30 December 2000, in total, 51,208.38 Croatian kunas (HRK), together with statutory default interest. That amount corresponded to approximately 6,900 euros (EUR) at the material time.
In a judgment of 18 November 2011, relying on section 164 of the Pension Insurance Act and section 214 of the Obligations Act (see paragraphs 54 and 57 below), the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court (Općinski građanski sud u Zagrebu) allowed the plaintiff’s claim and ordered the first applicant to pay the amount sought back to the Croatian Pension Fund, together with statutory default interest accrued from 3 November 2005 (the date when the action had been brought against the first applicant, see paragraph 22 above). The court held that the first applicant had received the disputed payments in good faith, and that therefore statutory default interest could not have started to accrue from an earlier date.
On 12 June 2012 the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) dismissed an appeal by the first applicant and upheld the firstinstance judgment, which thereby became final and enforceable.
The first applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske). She relied on Article 14 and Article 29 of the Constitution, which guarantee the right of equality before the law and the right to a fair hearing respectively. She also complained that it was evident from the case file that she had fulfilled all statutory requirements to be granted a pension, and that she had been deprived of her right to a pension only because the domestic authorities had subsequently established that they lacked jurisdiction to decide her request.
By a decision of 8 November 2012 the Constitutional Court declared the first applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible, finding that the case did not raise any constitutional issue.
On 23 August 2013 the Croatian Pension Fund instituted enforcement proceedings against the first applicant before the Požega Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Požegi), applying for enforcement of the above-mentioned judgment of 18 November 2011 (see paragraph 23 above).
On 25 March 2014 the Požega Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Požegi) issued a writ of execution (rješenje o ovrsi) for garnishment of part of the first applicant’s pension.
By 29 February 2016 HRK 25,126.14 (approximately EUR 3,300 at the material time) had been collected from the first applicant’s pension (see paragraph 18 above).
It appears that the enforcement proceedings are still pending.
On 6 May 1998 the second applicant asked the Gospić Office to grant her an old-age pension. In order to demonstrate that she met the statutory requirement concerning years of service (see section 21(1) of the Basic Pension and Disability Insurance Act quoted in paragraph 53 below), she submitted a copy of her employment booklet indicating that she had spent thirty-five years in continuous employment. According to the booklet, she had most recently been employed from 1 September 1992 to 31 January 1993 in Futog, Serbia. In the section of the relevant application form provided by the Croatian Pension Fund where applicants were required indicate whether they had already been granted a right arising from pension insurance, the second applicant stated that she had not.
On 10 August 1998 the Gospić Office issued an interim decision whereby it
-  established that the second applicant had the right to a pension because on 1 May 1998 she had met the statutory requirements for an old-age pension (see section 21(1) of the Basic Pension and Disability Insurance Act quoted in paragraph 53 below); and
-  granted her advance payment of her pension until the subordinate legislation for the implementation of the Validation Act was adopted (see paragraph 55 below) and the exact amount of her pension was calculated.
On the basis of that decision, the second applicant received advance payment of her pension until 30 April 2002.
On 30 November 1998, relying on the Validation Act (see paragraph 55 below), the second applicant asked the Gospić Office to recognise that in the period between 9 October 1991 and 31 August 1992 she had been working in a part of Croatia which had, in that period, been outside the Croatian authorities’ control, and to take that into account for pension purposes, namely when calculating her years of service. By a decision of 30 November 1998 the Gospić Office established that the second applicant had indeed been working during that period, and recognised that this counted towards her years of service.
On 12 March 2002 the Gospić Office requested information from the relevant Serbian authorities on whether they had granted the second applicant a pension and whether she had been employed in Serbia after 8 October 1991.
On 29 March 2002 the Serbian Fund for Pension and Disability Insurance in Novi Sad (Republički fond za penzijsko i invalidsko osiguranje zaposlenih Novi Sad) informed the Gospić Office of the Croatian Pension Fund that the second applicant had been employed in Serbia from 1 September 1992 until 31 January 1993, and she had been granted a pension in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the basis of which she had received a pension from 1 February 1993 until 30 April 1998.
On 16 May 2002 the Central Office of the Croatian Pension Fund reexamined the second applicant’s case of its own motion in supervision proceedings (see section 126 of the Pension Insurance Act quoted in paragraph 54 below, and section 63 of the Administrative Procedure Act quoted in paragraph 56 below). Relying on section 263(1) sub-paragraph 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act (see paragraph 56 below), it set aside the first-instance decision of the Gospić Office of 10 August 1998 (see paragraph 32 above) and remitted the case for reconsideration, because the second applicant had failed to disclose that she had been granted a pension in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
In fresh proceedings, by a decision of 17 June 2002, the Gospić Office declared the second applicant’s request for a pension inadmissible, on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction. It found that, in accordance with domestic law (see section 75(4) of the Basic Pension and Disability Insurance Act quoted in paragraph 53 below), the relevant authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had jurisdiction in the matter, since the second applicant’s most recent employment had been in Serbia.
On 29 January 2003 the Central Office dismissed an appeal by the second applicant and upheld the first-instance decision, endorsing the reasons given therein. It also advised the second applicant that she could submit a new pension request following the entry into force of the bilateral Social Insurance Agreement between Croatia and Serbia (see paragraph 58 below). Since the second applicant did not challenge that decision before the Administrative Court, it became final.
On 27 May 2003 the second applicant submitted a new pension request, relying on that bilateral agreement, which had come into force on 1 May 2003 (see paragraph 58 below).
On 30 September 2003 the Central Office of the Croatian Pension Fund issued an interim decision whereby it
-  established that the second applicant had the right to a pension because she met the statutory requirements for an old-age pension (see section 178 of the Pension Insurance Act quoted in paragraph 54 below); and
-  granted her advance payment of her pension until it obtained all the relevant information from the Serbian authorities that was needed for the exact calculation of the amount of her pension.
On 27 January 2006 the Central Office issued a definitive decision granting the second applicant the right to a pension with effect from 1 May 2003. The second applicant lodged an appeal, an action for judicial review, and a constitutional complaint against that decision, but those proceedings were eventually dismissed. The decision became final on 23 November 2011.
Civil proceedings
On 9 October 2002 and 3 March 2003 the Central Office asked the second applicant to pay back the pension payments which she had received before 30 April 2002 (see paragraphs 32-33 above). On 14 July 2003 the second applicant told the Croatian Pension Fund that she refused to repay the amounts sought.
On 29 August 2003 the Gospić Office instituted enforcement proceedings against the second applicant before the Gračac Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Gračacu), seeking reimbursement of the pension paid to her before 30 April 2002 – HRK 56,866.10 (approximately EUR 7,300 at the material time) in total – together with statutory default interest.
On 4 September 2003 the Gračac Municipal Court issued a writ of execution as requested by the Gospić Office. However, since the second applicant challenged the writ by objecting to it, the court set it aside. As a consequence, pursuant to the relevant civil procedure legislation, the enforcement proceedings were transformed into regular civil proceedings, and were resumed as such. It appears that the case was then transferred to the Gospić Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Gospiću).
In a judgment of 8 November 2012, relying on section 164 of the Pension Insurance Act (see paragraph 54 below), the Gospić Municipal Court ordered the second applicant to pay back to the Croatian Pension Fund the amount sought, together with statutory default interest accrued from 14 July 2003 (the date on which the second applicant had refused to pay back the amount sought, see paragraph 43 above).
The second applicant lodged an appeal against the first-instance judgment. In the appeal, inter alia, she reiterated the two following arguments which had been raised during the first-instance proceedings:
-  the administrative authority’s decision of 17 June 2002 (see paragraph 38 above) declaring her pension request inadmissible for lack of jurisdiction did not (automatically) imply that she had to pay back the pension payments which she had received;
-  receiving those payments had not constituted unjust enrichment, because it was evident that she had been entitled to a pension, as she had met the relevant statutory requirements concerning age and years of service.
On 10 September 2013 the Karlovac County Court (Županijski sud u Karlovcu) dismissed the second applicant’s appeal and upheld the firstinstance judgment, which therefore became final and enforceable.
The second applicant then lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court in which she raised the same argument that she had raised in her appeal against the first-instance judgment (see paragraph 47 above). In doing so, she relied on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
By a decision of 29 January 2014 the Constitutional Court declared her constitutional complaint inadmissible, finding that the case did not raise any constitutional issue. The Constitutional Court’s decision was served on the second applicant on 14 February 2014.
On 4 October 2013 the Central Office of the Croatian Pension Fund applied to the Gospić Municipal Court for that court’s judgment of 8 November 2012 (see paragraph 46 above) to be enforced against the second applicant.
It appears that shortly afterwards the case was transferred to the Zadar Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zadru), which on 20 January 2014 issued a writ of execution for garnishment of part of the second applicant’s pension (see paragraph 42 above). The writ became final on 18 July 2014.

The relevant provisions of the Pension Insurance Act (Zakon o mirovinskom osiguranju, Official Gazette no. 102/98 with subsequent amendments), which was in force between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2013, therefore at the material time, read as follows:

The Validation Act (Zakon o konvalidaciji, Official Gazette no. 104/97), which entered into force on 8 October 1997, allowed for the recognition of documents and decisions issued by the occupying authorities in areas not controlled by the Croatian authorities during the Croatian War of Independence. For pension purposes, it also allowed for the recognition of years of service completed in such areas. The following pieces of relevant subordinate legislation implementing the Validation Act in relation to pension insurance entered into force on 10 April 1998 and 9 May 2008 respectively:

The relevant provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (Zakon o općem upravnom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 53/91 with subsequent amendments), which was in force between 1 July 1978 and 1 January 2010, read as follows:
Section 11
“A party has the right to appeal against a first-instance decision.”
Section 263
“The relevant authority shall, in the context of supervision [proceedings], set aside a definitive decision rendered in administrative proceedings:
