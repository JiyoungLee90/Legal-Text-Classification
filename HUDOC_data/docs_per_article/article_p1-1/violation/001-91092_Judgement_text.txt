The case originated in an application (no. 42711/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr St John Edward Mitchard (“the applicant”), on 18 March 2002.
The applicant was represented by Royds Rdw, solicitors in . The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, .
The applicant complained under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, because he was a man, he was denied social security benefits equivalent to those received by widows.
On 8 April 2003 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning widows’ benefits relating to the period after the date on which the applicant lodged his relevant claim and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. Subsequently, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in .
His wife died on 12 October 1996 leaving dependent children. His claim for widows’ benefits was made in March 2001 and on 2 May 2001 it was determined that he was entitled to Widowed Parent’s Allowance as from 10 April 2001. The applicant however requested that the claim be treated as from the date of his wife’s death, or alternatively that he be allowed to claim the equivalent widow’s benefit. On 22 October he made a formal application for widow’s benefit which was rejected on 27 February 2002 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under  law.
The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court’s judgment in the case of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV.
