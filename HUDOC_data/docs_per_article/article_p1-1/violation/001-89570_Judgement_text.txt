The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Luga, the Leningrad Region.
He sued the military unit no. 29760 of the Leningrad Military Circuit for damages resulting from a traffic accident.
On 21 June 1999 the Luzhskiy Town Court of the Leningrad Region granted his action and awarded him 40,911.50 Russian Roubles (“RUB”) to be paid by the military unit. The judgment was not appealed against and on 2 July 1999 entered into force.
On 2 August 1999 the  issued a writ of execution and on 9 August 1999 the bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 21 June 1999.

The unit did not comply with the judgment, since no budget funds had been allocated from the federal budget for these purposes.
As from 1 January 2002 the system of administration of the finances of the Leningrad Military Circuit has changed. The military units of the circuit, including military unit no. 29760, started receiving funds through the Federal Treasury system. The respondent unit’s account at the local department of the Central Bank of  was accordingly closed. On an unspecified date the unexecuted writ was returned to the bailiffs’ office.
On 16 January 2003 the bailiffs returned the writ and accompanying documents to the applicant. With reference to Decree No. 143 dated 22 February 2001 (see the relevant domestic law section below) they invited the applicant to submit the documents to a local department of the Ministry of Finance.

At some point the local department of the Federal Treasury returned the unexecuted writ to the applicant, referred to the impossibility to enforce the judgment due to the respondent unit’s lack of funds and invited him to submit it to the Federal Treasury in . On 20 May 2003 the applicant forwarded the writ of execution and the accompanying documents to the Federal Treasury. The applicant did not furnish any documents evidencing those transfers of the writ. He further submitted that after his complaint to the Administration of the President of Russia dated 30 January 2004 he obtained enforcement of the judgment.
On 21 April 2004 the military unit complied with the judgment in full.
Section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997 provides that a bailiff’s order on the institution of enforcement proceedings must fix a time-limit for the defendant’s voluntary compliance with a writ of execution. The time-limit may not exceed five days. The bailiff must also warn the defendant that coercive action will follow, should the defendant fail to comply with the time-limit.
Under section 13 of the Law, the enforcement proceedings should be completed within two months of the receipt of the writ of enforcement by the bailiff.
Under special rules governing at the relevant time enforcement of judgments against the recipients of allocations from the federal budget, adopted by the Federal Government on 22 February 2001 (Decree No. 143, as in force at the relevant time), a creditor was to apply to a relevant branch of the Federal Treasury holding debtor’s accounts (sections 1 to 4).
Within the next five days the branch had to examine the application and to notify the debtor of the writ, compelling the latter to abide by the respective court decisions (sections 7 to 12). In case of the debtor’s failure to comply within two months, the branch could temporarily freeze the debtor’s accounts (section 13).
