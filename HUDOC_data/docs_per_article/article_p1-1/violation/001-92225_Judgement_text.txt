The case originated in an application (no. 26873/05) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Valentyn Mykolayovych Garashchenko (“the applicant”), on 21 June 2005.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 7 September 2006 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in .
The applicant is a lawyer. In 1998 he provided a private company, “D.”, with legal assistance according to an agreement between them; however, the latter failed to pay for the services.
By judgments of 14 July 2000 and 26 October 2000 the Cherkasy Regional Arbitration Court (after June 2001 – the ) ordered the company “D.” to pay the applicant 308,332.67 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH).
Those judgments became final and on 24 November and 4 December 2000 the State Bailiffs’ Service (hereafter “the Bailiffs’ Service”) instituted enforcement proceedings. In the course of those proceedings a total of UAH 4,000 was paid to the applicant.
Being dissatisfied with the lengthy non-enforcement of the judgments, on 25 May 2001 the applicant lodged a claim with the  against the Bailiffs’ Service, seeking compensation for pecuniary damage caused by its inactivity.
On 10 April 2002 the court found for the applicant, noting that the Bailiffs’ Service had failed to take measures to enforce the judgments of 14 July 2000 and 26 October 2000, and awarded him UAH 308,332.67 in damages to be paid from the State budget. It further noted that the Bailiffs’ Service could still collect these damages from company “D.” to cover the expenses. On 29 October 2002 and 25 September 2003 the Kyiv Commercial Court of Appeal and the Higher Commercial Court of Ukraine, respectively, rejected the defendant’s appeals against the judgment. Subsequently, in 2005-2007, the State Treasury of Ukraine, being an administrator of the State budget, also attempted to appeal against the judgment, but the courts found that it lacked standing to that end.
On 22 November 2002 the applicant requested the Bailiffs’ Service to institute enforcement proceedings. However, according to the applicant, those proceedings were instituted only after he had made several pertinent complaints to the court. Later on, the applicant’s writ of enforcement was transferred from one department of the Bailiffs’ Service to another for various reasons; once it was also transmitted to the State Treasury of Ukraine for further processing but was subsequently remitted back to the Bailiffs’ Service. Furthermore, the latter terminated and resumed the enforcement proceedings several times. The applicant lodged numerous complaints with the courts alleging inactivity and omissions on the part of the Bailiffs’ Service; the courts found those complaints well-founded on a number of occasions (for example, by decisions of 28 February 2003, 13 December 2004, 22 April and 2 June 2005).
In August 2008 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Cherkassy Commercial Court against the Bailiffs’ Service, seeking additional compensation for pecuniary damage (namely, inflation losses, exemplary damages based on a 3% interest rate and legal costs) caused by its inactivity. On 28 November 2008 the court allowed the claim and awarded the applicant UAH 292,720.63 to be paid by the State Treasury of Ukraine from the State budget. The Bailiffs’ Service appealed and the proceedings apparently are pending before the Kyiv Commercial Court of Appeal.
In December 2008 the applicant requested the local department of the Bailiffs’ Service to resume the enforcement proceedings upon the judgment of 10 April 2002. On 4 December 2008 the Bailiffs’ Service dismissed the request for lack of territorial jurisdiction.
In the meantime the judgment of 10 April 2002 remains unenforced.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-19, 27 July 2004).
