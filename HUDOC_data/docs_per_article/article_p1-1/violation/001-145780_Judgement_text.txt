The case originated in 250 applications against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Ukrainian nationals, one Azerbaijan national (application no. 6397/13) and legal entities registered in Ukraine. Their details are specified in the appended tables (“the applicants”).
In applications nos. 711/13 and 736/13 court decisions were delivered in favour of the applicants’ deceased relatives. The applicants claim to be their lawful successors in title.
The Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 16 October 2013 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The Azerbaijan Government, having been informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings in respect of the applicant in application no. 6397/13 (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 of the Rules of Court), indicated that they did not wish to exercise that right.
On the dates set out in the appended tables domestic courts and labour disputes commissions delivered decisions according to which the applicants were entitled to various pecuniary amounts or to have certain actions taken in their favour. The decisions became final and enforceable. However, the applicants were unable to obtain the enforcement of the decisions in due time.
Some of the applicants also made submissions concerning factual and legal matters unrelated to the above non-enforcement issues.
