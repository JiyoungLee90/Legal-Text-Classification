The case originated in an application (no. 62864/09) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on 6 November 2009 by twenty-three natural or legal persons whose particulars appear in Appendix 1.
Two of the applicants, Mr V. Šindelár and Ms K. Šindelárová, died on 21 February 2010 and 24 April 2014 respectively (see points 13 and 14 of Appendix 1). Their son and sole heir Mr M. Šindelár expressed the wish to pursue the application in their stead.
The applicants were represented before the Court by Mr J. Brichta, a lawyer practising in Bratislava, and Mr M. Siman of EL Partners, s.r.o. in Bratislava. The Government of the Slovak Republic (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Pirošíková.
The applicants complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, both taken alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention, about restrictions which rules governing rent control had imposed on their right to peacefully enjoy their possessions.
By a decision of 21 February 2012, the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicants and the Government each submitted further written observations (Rule 59 § 1) on the merits and just satisfaction, and replied in writing to each other’s observations.
The applicants are owners of residential buildings in various parts of Bratislava and Košice which are subject to the rent-control scheme. They obtained ownership of the flats by various means, such as restitution, donation, inheritance or purchase. Under the relevant legislation they were obliged to let their flats to tenants while charging no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the State. The legislation precluded them from unilaterally terminating the leases, or selling the flats, other than to the tenants. The particulars of the flats affected by the rent control are set out in Appendix 3 (columns AF).
The situation of the applicants is structurally and contextually the same as that in Bittó and Others v. Slovakia (no. 30255/09, 28 January 2014 (merits) and 7 July 2015 (just satisfaction) and three subsequently decided cases concerning the rent controlscheme in Slovakia (Krahulec v. Slovakia, no. 19294/07; Bukovčanová and Others v. Slovakia, no. 23785/07; and Rudolfer v. Slovakia, no. 38082/07, all adopted on 5 July 2016).
The applicants in the present case initially submitted that the regulated rent for a flat with a surface area of 72.56 sq. m was 71.5 euros (EUR) a month, whereas the free-market rent for such a flat was approximately EUR 830 a month. They further relied on the opinion of an expert written at their request on 19 July 2010, which set out the difference between the regulated rent and the market rent in a residential building located in the municipality of Bratislava-Nivy. Following the Court’s decision to declare the application admissible, the applicants submitted voluminous expert opinions concerning their properties, in which they calculated the pecuniary damage that had resulted from the rentcontrol scheme as the difference between the market rent in similar dwellings and the regulated rent applicable to their property.
The Government initially submitted its own expert opinion, drawn up in 2010, which stated that the average free-market monthly rent for flats comparable to those of the applicants was between EUR 6.13 and 6.48 per sq. m in the municipality of BratislavaStaré Mesto and EUR 3.14 and 3.55 per sq. m in Košice. In response to the detailed expert opinions submitted by the applicants, the Government submitted one by the Forensic Engineering Institute in Žilina, examining each of the expert opinions submitted by the applicants. They also submitted a report from the same institution of 7 December 2012, which pointed to what they considered to be errors in the opinions submitted by the applicants and which challenged the methods applied by their experts.
The relevant domestic law and practice governing the rentcontrol scheme in Slovakia and its historical background are set out in the case of Bittó and Others (merits), cited above, §§ 716, 3272).
On 15 September 2011, the Termination and Settlement of Tenancy (Certain Apartments) Act (“Law no. 260/2011”) came into force, which was enacted with a view to ending the rent-control scheme by 31 December 2016. The owners of apartments whose rent had been regulated were entitled to give notice of the termination of a tenancy contract by 31 March 2012. The law further entitled landlords to increase the rent by 20% once a year as of 2011.
