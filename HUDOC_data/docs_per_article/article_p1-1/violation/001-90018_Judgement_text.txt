On 4 November 2000 the Talovskiy District Court of the Voronezh Region granted the applicant’s civil action against the Social Welfare Department of the Talovskiy District and awarded her 756.52 Russian roubles (RUB) in pension arrears.
The judgment was not appealed against and became enforceable on 15 November 2000. At some point the domestic court issued the applicant with the writ of execution in respect of the judgment.
At the end of November 2000 the bailiffs received the writ.
At some point in 2001 the bailiffs’ service returned the writ to the applicant without execution, since the respondent authority did not have funds available for enforcement of the applicant’s claim.
It appears that on 9 February 2006 the applicant resubmitted the writ of execution to the respondent authority.
On 1 March 2007 the award was paid to the applicant in full.
