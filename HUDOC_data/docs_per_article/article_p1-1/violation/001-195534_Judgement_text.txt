The case originated in sixteen applications (nos. 43815/17, 43819/17, 46335/17, 46382/17, 58825/17, 72892/17, 77141/17, 77875/17, 77876/17, 77879/17, 77882/17, 78142/17, 79575/17, 83186/17, 5791/18 and 6256/18) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by sixteen Serbian nationals. The applicants’ personal details are set out in the appendix to this judgment.
The applicants were represented by Ms T. Stojiljković, a lawyer practising in Leskovac. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 25 September 2018 notice of the applications was given to the Government pursuant to Rule 54 § 2 (b) of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants were employed by the following socially/State-owned companies: Vučje, Inkol, Elektrouniverzal and Graditelj (hereinafter – “the debtors”).
They obtained final court decisions ordering the debtors to pay them their salaries plus default interest and costs and expenses. The essential information as to the domestic proceedings in respect of each application is indicated in the appendix to this judgment.
Between April 2009 and September 2010 the Leskovac Commercial Court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtors. Since all the enforcement proceedings against the debtors were stayed by operation of law (see paragraph 12 below), the applicants reported their claims based on the court decisions mentioned in paragraph 6 above to the liquidator. On different dates the liquidator accepted their claims in the amount of the principal debt plus default interest accrued until the day of institution of the insolvency proceedings against the debtors, as provided for by domestic law (see paragraph 12 below).
On different dates (see the appendix to this judgment) the Commercial Court of Appeal found that the applicants’ right to a trial within a reasonable time had been violated and awarded them between 100 and 400 euros (EUR) each for non-pecuniary damage. No award was made in respect of the fifth and the seventh applicant. That court also ordered the Leskovac Commercial Court to speed up the insolvency proceedings against the debtors.
All the applicants complained to the Supreme Court of Cassation about the amount of the awards. The Supreme Court of Cassation rejected their appeals.
On different dates in 2017 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicants’ right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions and ordered that the claims accepted by the liquidator (see paragraph 7 above) be paid directly by the State within four months. Furthermore, it held that the sums awarded in respect of non-pecuniary damage were reasonable.
Soon thereafter, those claims were indeed paid by the State.
Pursuant to sections 85 and 93 of the Insolvency Act 2009 (Zakon o stečaju; Official Gazette nos. 104/09, 99/11, 71/12, 83/14, 113/17 and 44/18), as of the day of institution of insolvency proceedings against a company (both private and socially/State-owned), any ongoing enforcement proceedings against the company are stayed and default interest on any outstanding debt of the company cease to accrue. The Insolvency Act 2004 (Zakon o stečajnom postupku; Official Gazette nos. 84/04 and 85/05), which was in force until the entry into force of the Insolvency Act 2009, contained almost identical provisions.
