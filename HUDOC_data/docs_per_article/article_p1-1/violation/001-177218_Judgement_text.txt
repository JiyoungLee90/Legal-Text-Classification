.  The case originated in an application (no. 50113/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Ms Valentina Aleksandrovna Postnova.
.  The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
.  The applicant alleged that the authorities had failed to honour the final domestic judgment in favour of her deceased husband.
.  In line with the pilot judgment Burdov v. Russia (no. 2) (no. 33509/04, ECHR 2009), on 6 May 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
.  On 25 September 2013 the Government refused to settle the case arguing, inter alia, that the applicant had not exhausted the domestic remedies in respect of the non-enforcement complaint.
.  The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Tolyatti. The applicant is the widow of Mr Vitaliy Sergeyevich Postnov.
.  On 5 December 2000 the Leninskiy District Court of Ulyanovsk (“the District Court”) ordered the Administration of the Ulyanovsk Region to pay Mr Postnov 228,000 Russian roubles (RUB) in reimbursement of costs for purchase of housing. The amount was to be paid from the federal budget funds allocated for housing of the military servicemen. The District Court further awarded Mr Postnov RUB 810, the cost of the expert examination.
.  On 15 December 2000 the decision of the District Court came into force.
.  In January 2001 Mr Postnov obtained two writs of execution and forwarded them to the bailiffs’ service in Ulyanovsk.
.  On 26 April 2002 Mr Postnov passed away.
.  On 16 June 2003 the applicant joined the enforcement proceedings in her late husband’s stead, pursuant to a domestic court’s decision.
.  In 2003 the applicant and the bailiff in charge of the enforcement proceedings applied for changing the method of execution of the judgment of 5 December 2000. They argued that as the Administration of the Ulyanovsk Region had no authority to administer the federal budget funds, the judgment could not be enforced as prescribed in its operative part.
.  On 25 November 2003 the District Court refused the application for changing the method of execution.
.  On 22 December 2004 the writ of execution in respect of RUB 228,000 was returned to the applicant from the bailiffs’ service without enforcement.
.  On 30 January 2005 the judgment of the District Court in the part concerning RUB 810 was enforced.
.  On 13 November 2003, 13 July 2004, and 20 May 2005 the District Court index-linked the amount due to the applicant under the judgment of 5 December 2000, and awarded her RUB 169,846.46, RUB 17,401.28, and RUB 36,517.69 respectively. These amounts were to be paid from the federal budget funds allocated for housing of the military servicemen. The decisions came into force.
.  In June 2005 the applicant obtained the writs of execution in respect of the three above decisions, and a new writ of execution in respect of the judgment of 5 December 2000 due to the change of the creditor in the enforcement proceedings (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above).
.  On 31 May 2006 the applicant submitted all the writs of execution to the bailiffs’ service.
.  On 2 June 2006 the bailiffs initiated the execution proceedings. On 6 June 2006 the proceedings were terminated. The writs of execution were returned to the applicant as the compulsory enforcement of the judicial decisions in question was impossible.
.  In 2005-2006 the applicant submitted the enforcement documents to the Ministry of Finance of Russia and the Federal Treasury Department for the Ulyanovsk Region. Each time the writs of execution were returned to the applicant without enforcement.
.  For a summary of the relevant provisions of Federal Law no. 68FZ “On Compensation for violations of the right to a trial within a reasonable time or the right to enforcement of a judgment within a reasonable time” (“the Compensation Act”), see the case of Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev v. Russia ((dec.), nos. 27451/09 and 60650/09, §§ 15-20, 23 September 2010).
