The case concerns, under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, the alleged depreciation of a compensation amount vis-à-vis inflation.
The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Ankara. She was represented by Ms N. Özdemir, a lawyer practising in Ankara.
The Government were represented by their Agent.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 25 July 1996 the applicant went to the gynaecological department of the GATA military hospital, complaining about a persistent ache in her uterus and excess bleeding.
After diagnosing the applicant’s symptoms as uterine fibroids, the doctors decided to carry out a procedure called uterine fibroid embolisation. This procedure by way of an angiography is used for blocking the blood flow to the fibroids in order to reduce their size without surgery. It appears that this procedure was new in the hospital at the time and the applicant was the fourth patient selected for it. The doctors did not explain the procedure to her. The procedure was carried out immediately and the applicant was discharged the same day after being observed by the hospital staff for eight hours.
The next day the applicant went back to the hospital complaining about pain in her leg where the angiography had been carried out. She was examined by intern doctors in different departments of the hospital and was told that she could return home.
On 29 July 1996 the applicant went back to the hospital as her pain had not subsided. She was examined in the gynaecological department by an intern doctor who reported that he could not find anything in particular.
On 1 August 1996 the applicant was hospitalised in the GATA hospital’s emergency department. After several surgeries, her leg was amputated on 8 August 1996. She was discharged from the hospital on 16 September 1996.
On 19 November 1996 the applicant brought compensation proceedings against the Ministry of Defence (“the Ministry”) for medical negligence before the Ankara Assize Court in Civil Matters. On 27 January 1999 the civil court rejected the case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, holding that the administrative courts were competent to examine the case.
On 26 May 1999 the applicant therefore lodged her compensation claim with the Ankara Administrative Court and requested a total of 45,000,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) in respect of pecuniary damage, and TRL 5,000,000,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, with interest running from the date of the incident, that is 25 July 1996 (see paragraph 4 above).
On 17 March 2008 the Ankara Administrative Court found for the applicant and awarded the compensation requested by her in full in new Turkish liras (TRY), that is TRY 50,000 for both pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage (equivalent to approximately 25,000 euros (EUR) at the time). The court also ruled that default statutory interest be applied to those amounts from the date of the incident.
The Ministry lodged an appeal against the judgment before the Supreme Administrative Court.
In the meantime, the applicant started enforcement proceedings against the Ministry for the judgment award. On 29 December 2008, the Ministry paid TRY 330,373 to the applicant.
On 10 April 2009 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Ankara Administrative Court’s judgment of 17 March 2008 on the merits but quashed it in terms of the starting date of the statutory interest on the judgment award. It held that interest must run from the date when the applicant brought the compensation proceedings before the civil courts, namely on 19 November 1996 (see paragraph 9), and therefore remitted the case to the Ankara Administrative Court.
On 25 March 2010 the Ankara Administrative Court decided in line with the Supreme Administrative Court’s reasoning and awarded the compensation to the applicant together with statutory interest running from 19 November 1996.
The applicant appealed against the judgment of 25 March 2010 on the grounds that the interest should run from the date of the incident that is from 25 July 1996. Her appeal was rejected as out of time.
On 10 June 2000 the Ministry requested the applicant to return TRY 28,620, the amount of overpayment as a result of the final ruling in respect of the date from which the interest started to run. On 11 November 2011 the applicant paid the amount back.
The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in Okçu v. Turkey (no. 39515/03, §§ 19-31, 21 July 2009) with respect to compensation claims before the administrative courts.
The Compensation Commission was set up by Law no. 6384 in order to provide for the settlement, by means of compensation, of applications lodged with the Court concerning length of judicial proceedings and non-enforcement or delayed enforcement of judicial decisions. A full description of the relevant domestic law may be found in Turgut and Others v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 4860/09, §§ 19-26, 26 March 2013).
The Compensation Commission’s competence was recently extended by the presidential decree no. 809 of 7 March 2019, published in the National Gazette on 8 March 2019. Accordingly, the Compensation Commission is now entitled to examine and grant compensation to applicants in cases where the Court has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 without rendering a decision on compensation or in cases where it has reserved the question under Article 41 of the Convention (see Kaynar and Others v. Turkey, nos. 21104/06 and 2 others, § 24, 7 May 2019).
