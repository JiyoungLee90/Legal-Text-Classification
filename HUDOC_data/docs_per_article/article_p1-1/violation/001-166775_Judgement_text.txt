The case originated in an application (no. 23496/13) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Mile Vukosavljević (“the applicant”), on 30 March 2013.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Ms V. Rodić.
On 23 October 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Velika Reka.
He was employed by Holding Kompanija “Komgrap” – DD “Komgrap gradnja”, a socially-owned company based in Belgrade (hereinafter “the debtor”).
On 3 February 2006, the First Belgrade Municipal Court ordered the debtor to pay the applicant specified amounts on account of salary arrears and social insurance contributions, plus the costs of the civil proceedings. This judgment became final on 31 July 2006.
On 23 October 2006, upon the applicant’s request to that effect, the Fourth Belgrade Municipal Court accepted the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicant the enforcement costs.
On 24 December 2010 the Belgrade Commercial Court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor (St. 4372/2010).
On 22 June 2011 the applicant submitted his respective claims.
On 31 October 2010 the Belgrade Commercial Court dismissed these claims as out of time. The Commercial Appeals Court upheld that decision on 26 June 2012.
The insolvency proceedings against the debtor are still ongoing.
On 23 April 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal.
The Constitutional Court dismissed his appeal on 14 July 2011.
On 13 March 2012 the applicant lodged a new constitutional appeal.
On 26 January 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed again his appeal. On 28 December 2012 that decision was delivered to the applicant.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially-owned companies, as well as enforcement and insolvency proceedings, has been outlined in the cases of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06 et al., §§ 57-64 and 71-76, 15 January 2008, and Jovičić and Others v. Serbia (dec.), no. 37270/11, §§ 88-93, 15 October 2013. Furthermore, the case-law of the Constitutional Court in respect of socially-owned companies, together with the relevant provisions concerning constitutional redress has likewise been outlined in the admissibility decision in Marinković v. Serbia (dec.), no. 5353/11, §§ 26 -29 and 31-44, 29 January 2013, the judgment in Marinković v. Serbia, no. 5353/11, §§ 29-31, 22 October 2013, and the decision in Ferizović v.
