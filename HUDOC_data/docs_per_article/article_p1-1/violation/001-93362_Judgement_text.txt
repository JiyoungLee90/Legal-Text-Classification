The case originated in an application (no. 27213/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Bulgarian nationals, Mrs Asenka Petrova Tsonkova and Mr Geno Petrov Tsonkov (“the applicants”), on 21 July 2004.
The applicants were represented by Ms S. Margaritova-Vuchkova, a lawyer practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mrs S. Atanasova and Mrs R. Nikolova of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicants alleged that they had been deprived of their property in violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Articles 6, 13 and 14 of the Convention.
On 5 March 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
Judge Kalaydjieva, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court). On 30 January 2009 the Government appointed in her stead Ms Pavlina Panova as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1 of the Rules of Court).
The applicants were born in 1952 and 1950 respectively and live in . They are sister and brother.
In September 1967 their parents bought from the Sofia municipality a three-room apartment of 108 square metres in the centre of the city, which had become State property by virtue of the nationalisations carried out by the communist regime in  after 1947.
In 1994 the applicants’ parents conveyed the title to the property to the applicants. All four of them – the applicants and their parents – continued to live in the apartment.
On 13 March 1998, following the amendments to the Restitution Law whereby the initial one-year time-limit for bringing proceedings under section 7 of that law was renewed (see paragraph 15 below), the heirs of the former, pre-nationalisation, owners of the flat brought such proceedings against the applicants’ parents.
In March 2002 the applicants’ mother died and the applicants joined the proceedings as her heirs. On an unspecified later date their father died too.
The proceedings ended by a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 26 March 2004. The courts found that the title of the applicants’ parents was null and void because documents related to the sale of the apartment had not been signed by the officials in whom the relevant power had been vested but by their deputies.
On an unspecified date the former owners of the apartment brought a rei vindicatio action against the applicants. Considering that they stood no chance in these proceedings, in November 2004 the applicants vacated the apartment. In December 2005 they bought from the municipality an apartment in the outskirts of  for 24,393 Bulgarian levs (BGN), the equivalent of approximately 12,450 euros (EUR).
On 8 July 2004 the applicants applied for compensation bonds. On 10 March 2005 their request was rejected by the regional governor, who found that it had been lodged after the expiry of the statutory two-month time-limit following the final judgment in their case. In April 2005 the applicants lodged an appeal against the governor’s order, arguing that his refusal ran contrary to the purpose of the Compensation Law. As of April 2009 the proceedings were still pending at first instance before the Sofia City Court.
The relevant background facts, domestic law and practice have been summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Velikovi and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 43278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01, and 194/02, 15 March 2007.
In 1997 former pre-nationalisation owners who had missed the initial one-year period under section 7 of the Restitution Law for bringing an action against post-nationalisation owners were given a second chance through a legislative amendment renewing the time-limit. On 11 March 1998 the  struck down the amendment as it encroached on the principle of protection of property and legal certainty (реш. 4 от 11.3.1998 по к.д. 16/97). Nevertheless, as the judgments of the  have no retroactive effect, the courts continued to examine claims brought between the entry into force of the 1997 law renewing the time-limit and the ’s judgment of 11 March 1998.
