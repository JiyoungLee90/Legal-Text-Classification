The case originated in an application (no. 40610/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Sergey Grigoryevich Belyayev (“the applicant”), on 27 August 2007.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 6 May 2013 the application was communicated to the Government. In accordance with the pilot judgment Burdov v. Russia (no. 2) (no. 33509/04, ECHR 2009), the application was adjourned pending its resolution at the domestic level.
The Government refused to settle the case and submitted that the applicant had lost the victim status as he had received compensation for non-pecuniary damage and interest for the alleged delay in enforcement of the judgment. The Court therefore decided to resume examination of the present case.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Tambov.
On 23 October 2006 the Leninskiy District Court of Tambov (“the District Court”) ordered the Tambov town administration to pay the applicant approximately 776,150 Russian roubles (RUB) in social benefits and inflation losses, and recalculated regular payments received by the applicant due to his participation in the clean-up operation at the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site. The judgment entered into force on 3 November 2006.
.  On 7 November 2006 the District Court clarified the judgment of 23 October 2006.
.  On 29 November 2007 the judgment of 23 October 2006 was executed, i.e. in approximately one year and one month after it became final.
.  On 1 August 2008 the District Court awarded the applicant RUB 87,060.05 of interest and RUB 5,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage in respect of the delayed enforcement of the judgment of 23 October 2006. The decision came into force on 10 September 2008 and was fully enforced on 24 November 2008.
