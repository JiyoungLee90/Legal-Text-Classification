The case originated in an application (no. 42019/06) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by six Turkish nationals, on 10 October 2006. A list of the applicants and their personal details are set out in the Appendix.
Following the deaths of two of the applicants, namely, Ms Yaşar Alaloğlu and Mr Süleyman Altay, their heirs, whose names are listed in the Appendix, informed the Court of their intention to pursue the application in their stead. For practical reasons, Ms Alaloğlu and Mr Altay will continue to be called “the applicants” in this judgment, although their heirs are now to be regarded as such.
The applicants were represented by Ms Alaloğlu, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
In a decision of 8 April 2014, the Court declared the applicants’ complaint regarding the length of proceedings inadmissible on account of a new remedy offered by Law no. 6384 and adjourned the examination of the remainder of the application.
On 19 October 2017 the Government were given notice of the complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicants owned a plot of land, namely, an island on Lake Eğirdir, Isparta. On 15 March 1975 the property was designated as a nature conservation area.
By a decision of 16 December 1980, the Eğirdir Municipality decided to expropriate the property. On 7 April 1981 it determined the expropriation compensation as 1,350,450 former Turkish liras (TRL).
On 1 May 1981 the first applicant and a certain Ms Altay, who was the testator of the other applicants, lodged an action before the Eğirdir Civil Court of General Jurisdiction, claiming TRL 18,649,500 in additional compensation.
Subsequently, they lodged another action before the Administrative Court for the annulment of the expropriation decision. The Civil Court decided to adjourn the examination of the additional compensation claim, pending the outcome of the proceedings before the Administrative Court. The administrative case for the annulment of the expropriation decision was eventually dismissed and the property was registered in the name of the Treasury in 1984. In the meantime, in 1984 the applicants initiated a third set of proceedings, which concerned the cadastral records and were concluded in 1995.
During the course of the first set of proceedings regarding additional compensation, on 24 November 1997 the Civil Court carried out an on-site inspection together with two civil engineers and a local expert. On 2 February 1998 the board of experts submitted a report to the domestic court, whereby they determined the value of the property as TRL 6,039,457.
Following the applicants’ objection to that report, the Civil Court carried out another on-site inspection, this time with different civil engineers and another expert. The second expert report dated 19 June 2003 specified the property’s value as TRL 6,197,359.
On 17 March 2006 the Eğirdir Civil Court partially accepted the applicants’ case and awarded them TRL 4,689,007 together with legal interest. In so doing, the domestic court relied on the findings of the first expert report determining the value of the property as TRL 6,039,457, and deducted TRL 1,350,450 initially paid to the applicants from that amount. As regards the applicants’ request to have the amount calculated in view of the inflation rates during the relevant period, the domestic court stated that by initiating several sets of proceedings, the applicants themselves caused the proceedings to last for a long time. It added that in case their loss was not compensated by the statutory interest applied, it was open to them to initiate compensation proceedings for additional damage under Article 105 of the Code of Obligations. Lastly, the court stated that that decision was final.
By a decision of 8 April 2014 (see Haçikoğlu and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no. 21786/04 and 830 others, 8 April 2014), the Court declared the applicants’ complaint under Article 6 § 1 concerning the length of the domestic proceedings inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies, in the light of its conclusions in the case of Turgut and Others v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 4860/09, §§ 19-58).
Subsequently, on 6 June 2014 the applicants applied to the Compensation Commission established by Law no. 6384 in respect of their complaint concerning the length of the proceedings and those concerning their right to property.
On 19 February 2015 the Compensation Commission found a violation of the applicants’ right to a fair trial on account of the excessive length of the compensation proceedings and awarded them 36,200 Turkish liras (TRY) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. The Commission found that it was not necessary to rule on the other complaints as their examination had been adjourned by the Court.
The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the case of Aka v. Turkey (23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 VI).
A description of the Compensation Commission established by Law no. 6384 and the extension of that Commission’s competence by a decree of 16 March 2014 may be found in the case of Yıldız and Yanak v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 44013/07, 27 May 2014). The relevant parts of the said decree read as follows:
Article 4
