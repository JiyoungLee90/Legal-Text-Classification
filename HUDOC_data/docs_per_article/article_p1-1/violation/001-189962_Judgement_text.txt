The case originated in applications against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on the dates indicated in the appended table.
The applicants’ complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of the Protocol No. 1 concerning the non-enforcement of domestic judgments were communicated to the Romanian Government (“the Government”). In application no. 45096/09 the applicant also raised other complaints under the provisions of the Convention.
On 8 February 2018 a committee of three judges of the Court adopted a judgment in a group of four cases which included the current two applications (Beșleagă and Others v. Romania, no. 35723/03 and 3 other applications).
On 7 June 2018 the same committee decided to reopen the proceedings in the current two applications following a request by the Government submitted on 8 February 2018. The parties were informed accordingly.
The list of applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table.
On 25 September 2000 the Neamț County Court ordered a stateowned company to pay the applicant due salary rights.
On 9 October 2001 the Roman District Court ordered a private person to reimburse a loan to the applicant.
On 14 November 2008 the Brașov County Court ordered the municipality of Brașov to leave a plot of land in the applicant’s full property and possession.
On 3 April 2009 the applicant signed a report, drafted on the occasion of the compulsory enforcement of the above judgment, which attested to the restoration of his possession over the land in dispute by placement of metal bars on the free area and by tracing a line with white paint over the area occupied by roads and bridge pillars belonging to the municipality.
On 18 July 2008 the applicant contracted a loan of 250,000 euros (EUR) from a bank, with the plot of land used as guarantee.
On 22 August 2011 the bank sold the land at a public auction for EUR 325,000, since the applicant had failed to repay the loan within the set deadline. In accordance with domestic law, the remaining amount after the recovery of the debt must be returned to the debtor.
