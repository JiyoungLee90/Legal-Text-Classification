The case originated in an application (no. 23795/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Anatoliy Tikhonovich Chebotarev (“the applicant”), on 28 May 2002.
The applicant complained of non-enforcement of several judgments in his favour concerning the amount of his disability pension. He also complained of the quashing of one judgment in his favour by way of supervisory review.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Kazmin. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by P. Laptev, the Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 21 January 2004 the Court decided to communicate the application. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in the town of .
The applicant took part in the liquidation of the consequences of the nuclear accident at the  nuclear plant. He was recognised as handicapped, and therefore entitled to a special social benefit. In 1999-2002 the applicant brought a number of actions against the social security authorities, claiming that the amount of the special benefit had not been properly calculated. The Voronezh Region Novovoronezhskiy District Court decided six cases in favour of the applicant, awarding him compensation for the wrongly calculated amount of the social benefit:
a) by judgment of 30 August 2000 - 10,195 Russian roubles (RUR);
b) by judgment of 26 February 2001 - 19,066 RUR;
c) by judgment of 21 May 2001 - 7,524 RUR;
d) by judgment of 14 December 2001 - 10,032 RUR;
e) by judgment of 17 June 2002 - 21,227 RUR;
f) by judgment of 10 October 2002 - 2,508 RUR.
These judgments were not appealed against and became effective ten days after their pronouncement. However, for a certain period of time they remained unenforced.
According to the applicant’s submissions of 28 April 2004, the judgment of 30 August 2000 was executed in part. Thus, on 30 October 2003 he received 8,760 RUR. The rest of the amount awarded (1,434 RUR) has not been paid.
Further, the judgment of 26 February 2001 was executed on 22 September 2003, i.e. with a delay of two years, six months and fifteen days.  The judgment of 21 May 2001 was executed 25 September 2003, i.e. with a delay of two years, three months and 25 days. The judgment of 14 December 2001 was executed on 25 September 2003, i.e. with a delay of one year, nine months, and one day. The judgment of 17 June 2002 was executed by two instalments, on 25 September and on 18 November 2003 the delays were therefore fifteen months and sixteen months and 22 days accordingly. The judgment of 10 October 2002 was executed on 18 November 2003, the delay was thus eleven months and 28 days.
In their letter of 28 June 2004 the Government contended that by 4 June 2004 all judgments had been executed in full. In support they produced a payment order, dated 4 June 2004, by which the Treasury Department of the Voronezh Region transferred 110,053 RUR to an unidentified bank account at the  branch of Sberbank. That payment order did not refer to any particular recipient. However, it indicated that the above amount was transferred in relation to the execution of judgments in favour of  victims “in accordance with lists nos. 432-433”. Further, the Government produced a copy of three documents entitled “List no. 431”, “List no. 432” and “List no. 433”. It appears that those documents were issued by the social security office of the local administration. They indicated that certain amounts were due to the applicant under a “court judgment”. The document entitled “List no. 431” referred to the amount of 1,434 RUR.
In 2000 the applicant brought an action against the social security authorities, claiming interests for the delays in the payment of the social benefits. On 25 December 2000 the Novovoronezhskiy District Court allowed his claim, awarding him 10,806 RUR as interests for the delay. The judgment was not appealed against and became final on 5 January 2001.
On 7 October 2002 the President of the  lodged an extraordinary appeal (протест) against this judgment. On 14 October 2002 the  quashed the judgment of 25 December 2000 by way of extraordinary review and remitted the case for a fresh examination. On 18 November 2002 the Novovoronezhskiy District Court rejected the applicant’s claims on the ground that the law did not provide for the payment of interests claimed by the applicant. On 3 December 2002 this decision was upheld by the .
In May 2004 the local authorities contacted the applicant with a view of reaching an agreement in the matter. However, the applicant refused to accept the terms of the agreement.
