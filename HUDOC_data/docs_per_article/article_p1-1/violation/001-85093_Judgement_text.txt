The applicant filed an appeal in cassation against this decision.
On 28 May 2002 the Supreme Court (Верховний Суд України) upheld the decision of 19 February 2002. On 13 September 2002 the Supreme Court refused the applicant’s request to review this matter on the ground of new circumstances.

According to the Government, by letter of 26 September 2001 a judge of the Zmiyivskyy Court informed the Bailiffs’ Service about the appeal against the judgment of 31 May 2001, filed by the Department (see paragraph 10 above), and indicated that it was necessary to suspend the enforcement proceedings pending the outcome of the appeal proceedings. Thereupon the Bailiffs’ Service suspended the enforcement proceedings. The Government added that the destruction of the materials relating to the enforcement proceedings upon expiry of the archiving period prevented them from submitting relevant copies.
On 10 October 2003 the enforcement proceedings were terminated because the amount, awarded to the applicant by the judgment of 31 May 2001 was paid to her in full.
