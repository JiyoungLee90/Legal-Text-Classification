The case originated in an application (no. 18229/11) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr P.G. (“the applicant”), on 17 March 2011. The President of the Section acceded to the applicant’s request not to have his name disclosed (Rule 47 § 4 of the Rules of Court).
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Kádár, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
The applicant complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 – read alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention – that the imposition of 98% tax on the upper bracket of his severance payment constituted an unjustified deprivation of property, or else taxation at an excessively disproportionate rate, with no remedy available.
Moreover, he argued under Article 8 that the legal presumption of the impugned revenues contravening good morals represented an interference with his right to a good reputation. Lastly, he argued that the tax in question – in reality, of a punitive character – had not been imposed in judicial proceedings conducted before the civil or the criminal courts – which, in his view, amounted to a breach of Article 6 of the Convention.
On 19 February 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Budapest.
In 2006 the applicant concluded an employment contract with a State-owned financial institution. His contract was amended in 2009 stipulating, in case of ordinary dismissal, severance payment equal to one month’s salary and remuneration corresponding to a notice period of eight months.
On 22 June 2010 the applicant’s employment was terminated by mutual agreement. Under this agreement, on 25 June 2010 his former employer paid him, after taxes, a net amount of 17,994,127 Hungarian forints (HUF) (approximately 58,800 euros (EUR)), amounting to seven months’ salary.
Under new legislation (see paragraph 10 below) the gross amount corresponding to the above payment was subsequently taxed at a 98% rate in its part exceeding HUF 3.5 million; the income tax and social security contributions already paid (see paragraph 8 above) were deducted from the tax payable. Thus, the applicant had to pay an additional HUF 14,162,433 as special tax, until 20 May 2011.
For relevant domestic law, see the judgments N.K.M. v. Hungary (no. 66529/11, §§ 8-19, 14 May 2013); Gáll v. Hungary (no. 49570/11, §§ 8-18, 25 June 2013) and R.Sz. v. Hungary (no. 41838/11, §§ 8-17, 2 July 2013).
