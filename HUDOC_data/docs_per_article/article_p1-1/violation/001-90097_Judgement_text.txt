The case originated in an application (no. 36153/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Svetlana Fedorovna Alekseyeva (“the applicant”), on 10 October 2003.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Brykin, a lawyer practising in Novoaltaysk. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, former Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 9 February 2004 and 14 June 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning non-enforcement and supervisory review of a binding judgment to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Novoaltaysk, a town in the Altay Region.
In 2003 the applicant sued the Government and the Ministry of Finance for liquidation of Soviet bonds issued in 1982.
On 30 June 2003 the Novoaltaysk Town Court of the Altay Region awarded the applicant 6,635,348.50 Russian roubles (RUB). This judgment became binding on 18 July 2003 but was not enforced immediately.
The Ministry of Finance lodged a supervisory-review appeal, and on 10 February 2004 the Presidium of the  quashed the judgment. The Presidium found that the District Court had misinterpreted material law and, in particular, had ignored the rule saying that the Soviet bonds could have been liquidated only after their ulterior conversion into Russian special-purpose debentures. The Presidium concluded that since until then no such conversion had been made, and since the yearly budget had had no allocations for the liquidation of the bonds, the District Court had effectively replaced itself for the body competent to make the conversion and thus overstepped its authority.
In 2003–04 the applicant also instituted a number of proceedings against high ranking State ofﬁcials. These proceedings were refused or stayed because of the applicant’s failure to comply with procedural requirements.
Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.
