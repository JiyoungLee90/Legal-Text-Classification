The case originated in an application (no. 50506/09) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Bulgarian nationals, Mr Aleksandar Petkov Tomov and Ms Mariana Petrova Nikolova (“the applicants”), on 9 June 2009.
The applicants were represented by Ms N. Dobreva, a lawyer practising in Sofia. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Panova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicants alleged that they had been unfairly deprived of their title to a plot of agricultural land.
On 16 March 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
.  On 17 April 2015 Mr Yonko Grozev, the judge elected in respect of Bulgaria, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 § 3 of the Rules of Court). Accordingly, on 1 April 2016 the President of the Section selected Ms Pavlina Panova as an ad hoc judge from the list of five persons whom the Republic of Bulgaria had designated as eligible to serve as such a judge (Article 26 § 4 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court).
The applicants were born in 1950 and 1957 respectively and live in Sofia.
On 19 February 1993 the applicants, at the time a married couple, bought a plot of land of 1,000 square metres in the village of Kranevo, on the Black Sea coast. The seller, Mr O., had acquired the property in 1967 from the agricultural co-operative that existed at the time, in exchange for another plot of land of his.
The applicants’ possession of the land remained undisturbed until 2003, when other persons took possession of it. The applicants discovered then that the land had been collectivised after 1945 and that in 1991 the heirs of the pre-collectivisation owner, Mr K., had instituted restitution proceedings under the relevant provisions of the Agricultural Land Act (“the ALA”, see paragraph 13 below). Their restitution request had been allowed in a court judgment of 7 December 1995 and in a decision issued by the competent administrative body ‒ the local agricultural land commission ‒ on 4 April 1996. Thereafter, the heirs of Mr K. had transferred the land to the persons who had later taken possession of the plot.
On an unspecified date in 2003 the applicants brought a rei vindicatio action against these individuals.
In a judgment of 25 May 2005 the Balchik District Court dismissed their claim. It relied on the provision of section 10(13) of the ALA (see paragraph 15 below), holding on its basis that of the two rival claims to the same land the law gave priority to the one based on restitution.
Upon appeal, on 25 January 2007 the Dobrich Regional Court reversed that decision and allowed the applicants’ action. It considered in particular that section 10(13) of the ALA was not applicable to the case as it had only been introduced in 1997, that is to say after the restitution decision in favour of Mr K.’s heirs and after the applicants had bought the plot of land.
Upon further appeal, in a final judgment of 12 December 2008, the Supreme Court of Cassation quashed the Regional Court’s judgment and dismissed the applicants’ rei vindicatio claim. It took the view that section 10(13) of the ALA, introduced in 1997, had to be considered to be applicable with effect from the ALA’s entry into force in 1991 because it was merely clarifying its general restitution provisions. As to the exception contained in section 18z(3) of the Regulations for the ALA’s implementation, also introduced in 1997 (see paragraph 16 below), the Supreme Court considered it inapplicable to the case; in its view, section 18z(3) only precluded the restitution of properties which had been the subject of transactions prior to the ALA’s entry into force in 1991, whereas the applicants had bought their plot in 1993.
The Agricultural Land Act (Закон за собствеността и ползването на земеделските земи) was adopted in 1991. It entitled individuals whose land had been collectivised, or their heirs, to request ‒ in certain circumstances ‒ the restoration of their ownership.
At the time of its adoption the ALA did not expressly address situations where restitution was sought in respect of plots which had been acquired by third parties after the collectivisation process. In an Interpretative Decision of 25 June 1996 (Тълкувателно решение № 2 от 25.VI.1996 г. по гр. д. № 2/96 г., ОСГК) the former Supreme Court found that in situations where the post-collectivisation buyers had acted in good faith and their title was not otherwise defective, their rights would prevail over the rights of the parties claiming restitution. It thus held that:
“[t]he legal effect of valid sale contracts, in accordance with the legislation in force at the time, excludes the rights of former owners to obtain restitution of agricultural land ...”
In 1997 Parliament added section 10(13) to the ALA. The new provision stipulated that former owners’ rights to plots which had not been built on were to be restored even in cases where the land in question had been sold or transferred to third parties. It also provided that those third parties could not rely on acquisitive prescription.
An exception to the above rules was provided for in section 18z(3) of the Regulations for the ALA’s implementation (Правилник за прилагане на Закона за собствеността и ползването на земеделските земи). Under that provision, also introduced in 1997, third parties who had acquired the land which was the subject to restitution claims would retain their property where two conditions were met: 1) the land in question had been acquired in exchange for another plot transferred to the co-operative, and 2) the land had been the subject of further transactions or had been built on.
In a judgment of 14 November 2000 (Решение № 13 от 14 ноември 2000 г. по к. д. № 11/2000 г.) the Constitutional Court dealt with the compatibility of section 10(13) of the ALA with the constitutional provisions guaranteeing the right to property. It found that it was compatible with these provisions, in particular because:
“the owners of land included in [agricultural co-operatives] never lost their property rights but during a certain period of time were merely unable to exercise them. That is why any contracts transferring their land cannot be opposed to them, regardless of whether or not the third parties acquiring the land acted in good faith.”
As to the provision that the third parties who acquired the land could not rely on acquisitive prescription, the Constitutional Court held:
“Through that provision, the legislator has given precedence to the rights of the owners of agricultural land included in [agricultural co-operatives], who with that [act of inclusion] were deprived of the possibility of exercising their property rights and preventing the possible acquisition of their land by third parties through adverse possession, over [the rights of] those who have acquired it through such adverse possession.
The [Constitutional] Court finds that a fair balance between the conflicting fundamental constitutional rights has thus been achieved.”
Even before the judgment mentioned above, in several earlier judgments, the Constitutional Court had taken the view that the collectivisation of agricultural land had not extinguished the owners’ property rights, but had merely created obstacles to their exercise (Решение № 6 от 5 юли 1992 г. по к. д. № 9/92 г.; Решение № 12 от 8 юли 1993 г. по к. д. № 12/93 г.; Решение № 8 от 19 юни 1995 г. по к. д. № 12/95 г.).
However, before 1989 it was considered that agricultural cooperatives could validly sell land to private individuals (Тълкувателно решение № 16 от 11.III.1977 г. по гр. д. № 86/76 г., ОСГК). Moreover, the former Supreme Court found during that period that upon collectivisation the co-operatives became the owners of collectivised land and that former owners’ rights became extinguished (Решение № 314 от 25.II.1966 г. по гр. д. № 2484/66 г., I гр. о.; Решение № 2119 от 31.X.1966 г. по гр. д. № 1502/66 г., I гр. о.).
