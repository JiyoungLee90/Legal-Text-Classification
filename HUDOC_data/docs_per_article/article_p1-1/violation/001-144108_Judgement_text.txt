The case originated in an application (no. 47922/08) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Milan Mećava (“the applicant”), on 29 September 2008.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 11 October 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Smederevo.
The applicant was employed by “HP Fagram DP”, a socially-owned company based in Smederevo (hereinafter – “the debtor”).
On 30 September 2003 the Smederevo Municipal Court ordered the debtor to pay the applicant certain sums in respect of salary arrears, social security contributions and procedural costs.
On 22 October 2003 the judgment became final.
On 9 January 2004 the applicant lodged an application for the enforcement of the above court decision with the Smederevo Municipal Court.
On 17 March 2003 the court allowed the application and issued an enforcement order.
On 1 September 2004 the Požarevac Commercial Court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor, which led to the ongoing enforcement proceedings before the Smederevo Municipal Court being stayed.
In 22 November 2004 the applicant duly registered a claim for the sums specified in the judgment referred to above.
On 26 April 2005 the Commercial Court accepted the applicant’s claim. His right to separate settlement from the immovable property of the debtor was contested and he was instructed to initiate separate civil proceedings in order to secure his right to separate settlement of his claim.
The applicant did not initiate separate civil proceedings.
On 3 April 2008 the Commercial Court adopted the decision on final distribution of the company’s insolvency assets, classifying the applicant into the fourth sequence of payment. In the course of the insolvency proceedings the final judgment in the applicant’s favour was partially enforced.
The relevant domestic law was set out in the Court’s judgments of EVT Company v. Serbia (no. 3102/05, §§ 26 and 27, 21 June 2007); Marčić and Others v. Serbia (no. 17556/05, § 29, 30 October 2007); R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia (nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, §§ 57-82, 15 January 2008); Vlahović v.
