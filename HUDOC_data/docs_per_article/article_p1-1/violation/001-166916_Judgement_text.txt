The case originated in fifteen applications (nos. 8265/04, 10342/04, 20018/07, 21043/07, 10313/08, 13953/08, 36611/08, 50948/08, 59052/08, 31477/09, 56499/09, 4225/10, 42111/10, 43017/10 and 61212/10) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eighteen Russian nationals, Mr Viktor Semenovich Rubin, Mr Vladimir Ilyich Rogozhnikov, Mr Ambartsum Torgomovich Papikyan, Ms Nadezhda Aleksandrovna Kostyuchenko, Mr Nikolay Vasilyevich Anishchenko, Ms Tatyana Vasilyevna Gordeyeva, Mr Mikhail Vasilyevich Zhuravlev, Mr Petr Afanasyevich Anufriyev, Mr Igor Anatolyevich Korneyev, Mr Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Roshchupkin, Mr Aleksey Ivanovich Zinin, Ms Valentina Alekseyevna Burayeva, Ms Natalya Nikolayevna Churilova, Ms Lyubov Anatolyevna Kuleshova, Mr Grigoriy Ivanovich Kotok, Ms Olga Viktorovna Gorbunova, Ms Radimkhan Dautovna Arapkhanova, and Mr Vladimir Alekseyevich Kanev (“the applicants”), on various dates listed below.
Mr Rogozhnikov was represented by Mr S.I. Belyayev and Mrs Gorbunova was represented by S.M. Loginov, lawyers practising in Yekaterinburg and in Ulyanovsk respectively. The Russian Government (“the Government”) are represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
Between 24 November 2006 and 16 February 2015 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants in the present cases are Russian nationals. Their names, years of birth and places of residence are tabulated below.
The applicants sued different municipal companies, referred to in the Appendix as the “debtor companies”, in various unrelated sets of the court proceedings.
.  The companies were incorporated as municipal unitary enterprises set up by decisions of local administrations and provided services tabulated below in the respective municipal districts in several regions of Russia. The companies had “the right of economic control” (право хозяйственного ведения) over the assets allocated to them by the administrations in order to carry out their statutory activities.
On the dates tabulated below by decisions of the local authorities some of the assets allocated to the companies were transferred back to the administration.
At a later point insolvency proceedings were opened in respect of the debtor companies. As a result, the companies were subsequently liquidated. The dates on which the insolvency started and ended are tabulated below.
On the dates tabulated below domestic courts by separate judgments made pecuniary awards in the applicants’ favour, to be paid by the debtor companies. Particulars of each judgment are summarised in the appended table.
On the dates listed in the Appendix the awards became enforceable.
The final judicial decisions in the applicants’ favour have remained unenforced due to companies’ insolvency and subsequent liquidation. Several applicants’ subsequent court actions against authorities, including subsidiary liability claim, legal succession proceedings or claims for damages against the respective local administrations, as well as repetitive complaints to the bailiffs’ service or the prosecutor’s office in connection with pending criminal proceedings brought in 2006-07 with regard to the company’s insolvency (applications nos. 20018/07, 10313/08, 36611/08, 56499/09, 42111/10, 43017/10, and 61212/10) proved futile.
On 20 November 2009 the applicant in application no. 10313/08 died. On 1 November 2010, his widow, Anishchenko Raisa Yakovlevna, expressed her willing to participate in the proceedings before the Court in her late husband’s stand.
The domestic provisions relevant to the cases on the legal status of State and municipal unitary enterprises with the right of economic control are summarised in Liseytseva and Maslov v. Russia (nos. 39483/05 and 40527/10, §§ 54-127, 9 October 2014), and Samsonov v. Russia ((dec.) no. 2880/10, 18 September 2014).
