The case originated in an application (no. 84721/17) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Nedžad Bradarić (“the applicant”), on 14 December 2017.
The applicant was represented by Zajednička advokatska kancelarija Jezdić & Matuzović, a law firm from Tuzla. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms B. Skalonjić.
On 13 November 2018 notice of the complaint concerning nonenforcement was given to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Tuzla.
On 26 April 2012 the applicant and his former employer, a private company based in Tuzla, concluded a settlement before the Tuzla Municipal Court concerning the applicant’s severance pay.
On 29 August 2012 the applicant filed a request with the Tuzla Municipal Court for enforcement of the settlement.
On 20 March 2017 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal complaining about the non-enforcement of the settlement in question.
On 15 June 2017 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Constitutional Court”) found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and ordered the Tuzla Municipal Court to expedite the enforcement proceedings. The Constitutional Court also awarded the applicant 1,000 convertible marks (BAM; approximately 500 EUR), in respect of nonpecuniary damage.
On 27 September 2017, following a request submitted by a third party (a company which brought a civil action against the applicant’s former employer in a separate set of proceedings), the Tuzla Municipal Court postponed the enforcement proceedings until the end of the proceedings initiated by the third party. The applicant appealed against that decision.
On 15 November 2017 the Tuzla Cantonal Court overturned the decision of 27 September 2017 and rejected the third party’s request. It furthermore ordered the third party to pay the applicant BAM 1,053 in legal costs.
At the date of the latest information available to the Court (28 June 2019), the enforcement proceedings in the applicant’s case were still pending.
