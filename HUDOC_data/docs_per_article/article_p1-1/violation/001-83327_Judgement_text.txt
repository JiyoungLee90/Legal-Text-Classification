The case originated in an application (no. 73652/01) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Andrew Anderson (“the applicant”), on 31 May 2001.
The applicant was unrepresented before the Court. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.
The applicant complained that the  authorities' refusal to grant him Widow's Bereavement Allowance or equivalent constituted discrimination on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
On 15 October 2002 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning Widow's Bereavement Allowance and to declare the remainder of the application inadmissible. It was subsequently decided under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1923 and lives in Penrith.
His wife died on 22 December 1994. On 22 January 2001 the applicant made a claim to the Inland Revenue requesting an allowance equivalent to that received by a widow, namely Widow's Bereavement Allowance (“WBA”). On 22 February 2001 the Inland Revenue informed him that he was ineligible for WBA as he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such benefit was payable to widowers under  law.
The relevant domestic law and practice is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the , nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 26 March 2007.
