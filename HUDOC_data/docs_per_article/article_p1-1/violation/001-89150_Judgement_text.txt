The case originated in an application (no. 27995/05) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Andrey Yevgenyevich Bogunov (“the applicant”), on 14 July 2005.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev and Ms V. Milinchuk, former Representatives of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 13 February 2007 the President of the First Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning non-enforcement of a binding judgment to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Moscow.
The applicant is a colonel of the Border Guard Service. In May 2004 he sued his command for its failure to grant his early discharge from service with the provision of a flat as guaranteed by domestic law.
On 11 October 2004 the  ordered the applicant’s command to provide his family with a flat in  and, once the flat had been provided, to grant the applicant an early discharge. On appeal, on 14 January 2005 the Military Court of the Moscow Command modified the award. It ordered that the flat did not necessarily have to be in Moscow, that the flat should have been provided out of turn, and that the defendant was to pay 5,000 Russian roubles (RUB) by way of non-pecuniary damages.
This judgment became binding on the day of its adoption but was not enforced immediately. For this reason, from January 2005 the applicant rented private flats.
On 12 May 2005 the Border Guard Service paid to the applicant RUB 5,000.
In July 2005 the command offered the applicant two rooms in a service dormitory, but the applicant rejected this offer as unsuitable.
On 16 August 2006 the Housing Commission of the Border Guard Service decided to provide the applicant with a flat in Moscow and asked the applicant to submit papers necessary for the recording of his title. In December 2006 the applicant submitted the papers, but since in January 2007 their validity had expired, he had to resubmit them. On 9 April 2007 the applicant’s title to the flat was recorded.
On 12 July 2007 the applicant was discharged from service.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months.
