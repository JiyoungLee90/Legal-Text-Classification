The case originated in an application (no. 38943/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Albert Amiranovich Tibilov (“the applicant”), on 3 October 2004.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mrs V. Milinchuk, former Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 5 April 2007 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. He also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in , a town in the Krasnodar Region.
As an employee of the State-owned Scientifico-industrial Centre for Mountain Horticulture and Industrial Floriculture, the applicant was entitled to a service flat. The flat was not provided, and the applicant sued the Centre.
On 19 July 1993 the Khosta District Court of the Krasnodar Region ordered the Centre to provide the applicant with a flat for a family of four. This judgment became binding on 31 August 1993, but was not immediately enforced.
As in the meantime the Centre had been reorganised, on 10 June 2003 the District Court redirected the enforcement proceedings to the Centre’s successor – Russia’s .
On the applicant’s request, on 5 September 2003 the District Court changed the mode of enforcement to a cash payment. The court found that the applicant had been entitled to a three-room flat and that such a flat could cost 1,368,000 Russian roubles (RUB). The court relied on a professional evaluation of December 2002 submitted by the applicant.
On 21 January 2004 the writ of enforcement was passed to the Ministry of Finance and on 8 February 2005 the Ministry paid the debt.
On 25 March 2005 a court awarded the applicant RUB 272,000 to compensate his inflationary loss caused by the delayed payment.
On 15 April 2005 the applicant bought a one-room flat for 45,494 US dollars.
