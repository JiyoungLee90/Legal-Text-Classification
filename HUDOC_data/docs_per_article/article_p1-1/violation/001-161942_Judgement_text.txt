The case originated in an application (no. 33751/05) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Mr Guță Tudor Teodorescu (“the applicant”), on 15 August 2005.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Zorcă, a lawyer practising in Bucharest. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged that the failure of the public authorities to issue and validate in a timely manner the decisions granting him compensation for lost properties from provinces which were formerly part of Romania, followed by the domestic court’s refusal to grant him the adjustment of the due compensation, caused him a significant financial loss, in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
On 7 July 2009 the application was communicated to the Government.
On 8 April 1998 the applicant requested the Bucharest Commission for Implementing Law no. 9/1998 (the County Commission) to award compensation for a property owned by his ancestors and taken over by the Bulgarian State. On 15 December 2000 the Commission issued a decision proposing payment of compensation in the amount of ROL 2,013,957,441 (approximately EUR 88,000 at the time).
That decision, according to the law, had to be validated by a central commission within sixty days. As the Central Commission did not issue any decision, the applicant brought a court action aimed at obliging the Central Commission to act in accordance with the law. The applicant also asked for the amounts granted by the County Commission to be adjusted for inflation when payment was made.
The applicant’s action was dismissed on 17 February 2002 by the Bucharest County Court, which held that the sixty-day deadline was not compulsory, but rather advisory. The court also held that the adjustment of the amounts granted was indeed prescribed by Article 8 § 3 of the law, but any adjustment was to be made at the time payment was actually made, once the Central Commission had ratified or otherwise the County Commission decision.
On 23 June 2003 the Bucharest Court of Appeal allowed the applicant’s claim, and ordered that the Central Commission issue a decision ratifying or otherwise the proposal made by the County Commission on 15 December 2000. The court held that the claim concerning the adjustment of the amounts granted as compensation was to be dealt with during the enforcement stage.
On 29 August 2003 the Central Commission ratified the County Commission decision of 15 December 2000.
The compensation, representing at that time approximately EUR 54,000, was paid to the applicant on 22 November 2003.
Dissatisfied with the decision of the Central Commission, on 13 December 2003 the applicant lodged a court action aimed at obtaining an adjustment of the initial amount to take into account inflation from the date on which it was established by the County Commission to the date of actual payment.
By a decision of 16 April 2004, the Bucharest County Court ruled in the applicant’s favour. The County Court established that in accordance with Article 8 § 2 of Law no. 9/1998, the amounts set by the County Commission had to be adjusted for inflation if they were not paid in the year they were awarded.
On 21 February 2005 the Bucharest Court of Appeal reversed the decision, and ruled that the applicant was not entitled to an adjustment for inflation.
The appellate court concluded that the County Court had interpreted the applicable law incorrectly, as the entitlement to adjustment for inflation had to be determined on the basis of the date when the Central Commission had ratified the decision of the County Commission. As the payment had been made uno ictu, and not in instalments, during the same year as the Central Commission took its decision, the applicant was not entitled to an adjustment for inflation.
It also concluded that the failure of the Central Commission to ratify the decision of the County Commission within sixty days could not represent a legal basis for the adjustment of the amount in question.
For an overall description of the legal framework and of the domestic mechanisms created for the assessment of various types of restitution and compensation claims, see Maria Atanasiu and Others v. Romania, nos. 30767/05 and 33800/06, §§ 45-51, 12 October 2010. As mentioned in this pilot judgment, the Romanian State undertook via various international treaties signed at the relevant time the obligation to compensate former owners or their successors in title who lost buildings, land or crops abandoned on certain territories following border changes before and during the Second World War. The administrative procedure for obtaining compensation in respect of such property, provided for by Laws nos. 9/1998, 290/2003 and 393/2006 and coordinated by the National Authority, differed from that for immovable property nationalised by the communist regime, and the necessary funds came out of the State budget (see Maria Atanasiu and Others, cited above, § 51), as also presented succinctly below.
Law no. 9/1998 came into force on 14 March 1998 and was amended in 2004 and 2007; it established a compensatory mechanism for Romanian citizens whose immovable properties were confiscated without due compensation under the Treaty of Craiova, signed by Romania and Bulgaria on 7 September 1940 (see paragraph 32 below).
The mechanism referred essentially to pecuniary compensation or to the right to shares in State-run companies. The deadline for filing such claims was set in Article 4 § 1 at eighteen months from the entry into force of the law. This deadline was subsequently extended by Law no. 97/2005, for a period of twelve more months starting with the entry into force of the law on 21 April 2005 and then by Law no. 348/2006, for a period of eighteen more months, starting from the entry into force of the law on 28 July 2006.
The bodies in charge of implementing the said Law were the County Commissions established within each county (including Bucharest) under the authority of the Prefect, and the Central Commission for Implementing Law no. 9/1998.
Under Article 7 § 1, the County Commissions had responsibility for assessing and dealing with requests for compensation within a maximum of six months following the date of registration. The decisions of the County Commissions were communicated to the claimants and the Central Commission, and they could be challenged by the claimants before the Central Commission within fifteen days. The latter then had to ratify or reject such decisions within sixty days.
In their turn, the decisions adopted by the Central Commission could be challenged before the domestic courts.
The methodological rules issued for the implementation of Law no. 9/1998, in force since 30 November 1998, provided for, inter alia, a calculation method for the setting of the compensation. This amount was to be updated when payment was made, according to Articles 8, 21 and 27 of the rules, on the basis of the median salary index of the last trimester prior to the moment of the actual payment.
In its original version, Article 8 stipulated in its paragraph 3 that
“(3) Within sixty days of the deadline set out in Article 4 § 1, depending on the total amount of compensation to be granted, a Government Decision will set up payment by instalments, the amounts being adjusted for inflation. The instalments are not to be set for more than two consecutive years.”
This paragraph became paragraph 2 from 9 November 1999, and stated as follows:
“(2) ...when the compensation is paid in the year it was awarded it is granted in the amount validated by the Central Commission, and when it is paid the next year ... it is to be adjusted on the basis of the consumer price index. The payment is to be staggered over a maximum of two years.”
Government Decision no. 286/2004, in force since 22 March 2004, provided in its Article 5 that compensation validated by the Central Commission was to be paid in two annual instalments, namely 40% in the year of the payment and 60% the following year, this second instalment being adjusted for inflation as set out in Law no. 9/1998.
From 18 October 2004, when Government Decision no. 1643/2004 came into force, the responsibilities of the Central Commission were taken over by the Department for the Application of Law no. 9/1998, functioning within the Prime Minister’s Chancellery. The Department forwarded the ratification decisions adopted by the County Commissions for the approval of the Prime Minister’s Head of Chancellery.
The Department was further entitled to make a proposal for adjustment of the compensation at the time of the ratification decision, in accordance with Law no. 9/1998.
These responsibilities were taken over by the National Authority with effect from the entry into force of Government Decision no. 361/2005, namely on 29 April 2005; this act was modified by Government Decision no. 240/2006 on 27 February 2006.
The methodological rules issued for the implementation of Law no. 9/1998, as amended on 26 October 2007 by Government Decision no. 1277/2007, set out in Article 38 § 1 that payment of compensation was to be made by the National Authority as the institution in charge of dealing with all claims lodged under the restitution laws adopted in Romania.
Law no. 164/2014 concerning measures for the acceleration and finalisation of the process of resolving compensation claims lodged under Law no. 9/1998 and Law no. 290/2003 entered into force on 18 December 2014.
Article 10 of the law sets out the deadlines by which all payments should be made; paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article refer essentially to the manner in which the compensation should be adjusted for inflation, on the basis of the consumer price index, from the moment the decision was issued until the entry into force of the law.
Given the conflicting domestic case-law on Article 8 § 2 of Law no. 9/1998 and of Article 5 of Government Decision no. 286/2004 regarding the manner of adjusting amounts granted as compensation to claimants, the General Prosecutor attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justice lodged an extraordinary appeal (recurs în interesul legii), mechanism generally designed to unify and settle the conflicting views taken by the domestic courts in the interpretation of a specific legal text.
By a decision of 19 March 2007 the High Court of Cassation and Justice established that, taking into account the principle of restitutio in integrum, the correct interpretation of Article 8 § 2 of Law no. 9/1998 was that the date when the amount of compensation was established was the date when the County Commissions were to issue their decision. If such a decision was not ratified within the legal limit of sixty days, which was the case in many situations, the entire amount initially determined had to be adjusted for inflation on the basis of the consumer price index.
The High Court further held that the adopted conclusion was obvious, in view of the applicable legislation, which was clear and unquestionable on this matter (“reglementare neîndoielnică”), as well as based on the principle of fully compensating claimants for damage incurred. This interpretation of the High Court was mandatory for all domestic courts ex nunc.
The Treaty of Craiova was signed on 7 September 1940 by Romania and Bulgaria. Under the terms of this treaty, the signatory parties agreed on the border line that was to be established between the two countries, with particular reference to the territory between the Black Sea and the Danube River (the Cadrilater). Section III of the Treaty provided for a mandatory resettlement of Romanian citizens of Bulgarian ethnicity living in Tulcea and Constanţa Districts to Bulgaria, and the resettlement of ethnic Romanians living in Durostor and Caliacra Districts to Romania. Section V of Annex C of the Treaty stipulated that the Romanian State was in charge of compensating those Romanian citizens who, following the mandatory resettlement had to abandon their possessions in the rural areas which were transferred to Bulgaria.
