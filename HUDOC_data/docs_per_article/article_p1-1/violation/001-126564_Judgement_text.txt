The case originated in an application (no. 64931/10) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Gojko Stošić (“the applicant”), on 29 September 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Marjanović and Ms M. Dedović-Marjanović, lawyers practising in Leskovac. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 30 March 2012 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant is a Serbian national who was born in 1943 and lives in Leskovac.
The applicant was a former employee of LETEKS (u stečaju), a company based in Leskovac (hereinafter “the debtor”). Since the debtor had failed to fulfil its contractual obligations toward him, the applicant instituted three sets of civil proceedings against it.
On 20 April 2001 the Leskovac Municipal Court ordered the debtor to pay the applicant:
(i) holiday pay for 1998 in the amount of 700 Serbian dinars (RSD), plus interest; and
(ii) RSD 1,490 for his legal costs, plus interest.
On 14 May 2001 the judgment became final.
On 23 August 2002 the applicant filed a request for enforcement of the above judgment.
On 29 August 2002 the Leskovac Municipal Court accepted the applicant’s request and issued an enforcement order.
On 25 February 2004 the enforcement proceedings were stayed because the debtor was undergoing restructuring.
On 20 October 2006 the applicant requested the Leskovac Municipal Court to continue with the enforcement.
On 11 March 2011 the enforcement proceedings were stayed again because insolvency proceedings had been opened in respect of the debtor.
On 19 June 2003 the Leskovac Municipal Court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the debtor to pay him:
(i) salary arrears for the period 1 July 2001 to 31 December 2002, plus interest; and
(ii) the pension, disability, health and unemployment insurance contributions due for the following periods: 1 January 1991 to 31 December 1992, 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1996, and 1 July 2002 to 31 December 2002.
On 20 July 2003 the judgment became final.
On 20 October 2006 the applicant sought enforcement of the above judgment, proposing that it be carried out by means of an auction of the debtor’s movable assets.
On 25 October 2006 the Leskovac Municipal Court accepted the applicant’s request and issued an enforcement order.
On 17 March 2008 the applicant filed a further request for enforcement of the judgment, this time proposing that it be carried out by means of an auction of the debtor’s specific immovable assets.
The Leskovac Municipal Court never ruled on the applicant’s request of 17 March 2008, but instead on 23 June of that year suspended the enforcement proceedings because the applicant had failed to pay a deposit of RSD 640 on account of the enforcement costs.
On 14 March 2007 the Leskovac Municipal Court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the debtor to pay him;
(i) salary arrears for 1 January 2003 to 11 October 2005, plus interest; and
(ii) the pension, disability, health and unemployment insurance contributions due for the period 1 January 2005 to 11 October 2005.
On 19 April 2007 the judgment became final.
On 14 March 2008 the applicant filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment.
On 12 October 2009 the Leskovac Municipal Court eventually accepted the applicant’s request and ordered the enforcement of his pecuniary claims. The enforcement proceedings relating to payment of the social security contributions were suspended. In its decision, the court awarded the applicant a fixed sum in respect of enforcement costs.
The applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal with the Leskovac High Court.
On 7 April 2011 the Leskovac High Court returned the file to the first-instance court, ordering it to stay the enforcement proceedings because insolvency proceedings had been opened in respect of the debtor.
On 16 April 2010 preliminary insolvency proceedings against the debtor were initiated before the Leskovac Commercial Court.
On 13 July 2010 the court issued an interim measure and prohibited any enforcement action being taken against the debtor.
On 25 January 2011 it opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor.
In May 2011 the applicant duly registered a claim for the sums specified in the judgments of 20 April 2001, 19 June 2003 and 14 March 2007.
On 6 December 2011 the applicant’s claims based on the above judgments were recognised in the total amount of RSD 864,838.93.
On 14 September 2012 some of the debtor’s property was sold.
As at the date of this judgment, the insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor were still ongoing.
On 5 December 2006 the debtor was privatised.
On 8 April 2008 the contract for the sale of the debtor was annulled because the buyer in question had failed to fulfil his contractual obligations.
From June 2008 the debtor was comprised of predominantly Stateowned capital.
On 31 October 2010, the applicant lodged a joint constitutional appeal with other former employees of the debtor.
As at the date of this judgment, the case was still pending before the Constitutional Court.
Article 4 § 1 provided that all enforcement proceedings were to be conducted urgently. Articles 63-84, 134-176 and 180-188 set out details as regards enforcement by means of a bank transfer or an auction of the debtor’s movable and immovable assets.
The Enforcement Procedure Act 2004 (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force on 23 February 2005, thereby repealing the Enforcement Procedure Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”). Article 5 § 1 of the 2004 Act provides that all enforcement proceedings are to be conducted urgently. In accordance with Article 12 § 5, an appeal against an enforcement order does not in principle suspend enforcement. In accordance with Article 304, all enforcement proceedings instituted prior to 23 February 2005 are to be conducted pursuant to the previous 2000 Act.
This Act regulates the framework for initiating and conducting insolvency proceedings against legal persons. Article 2 provides that the aim of insolvency is to ensure the most favourable collective settlement for creditors. Article 8 states that all insolvency proceedings are to be conducted urgently. In accordance with Articles 19 § 1 and Article 22 § 1, in insolvency proceedings against socially/State-owned companies the role of the insolvency administrator is to be performed by the Privatisation Agency. Article 93 §§ 1 and 2 provide that “from the date insolvency proceedings are instituted” the debtor cannot be simultaneously subject to a separate enforcement procedure. Any ongoing enforcement proceedings are thus to be stayed, while new enforcement proceedings cannot be instituted for as long as the insolvency proceedings are still pending.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially-owned companies is outlined in the case of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia (nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, §§ 57-64 and §§ 71-76, 15 January 2008). Further, the relevant case-law of the Constitutional Court in respect of socially-owned companies, together with the relevant provisions concerning constitutional appeals and the privatisation of socially-owned companies are outlined in the case of Marinković v. Serbia ((dec.) no. 5353/11, 29 January 2013, §§ 26-29 and §§ 31-44).
