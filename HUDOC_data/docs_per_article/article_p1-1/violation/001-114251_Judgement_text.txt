The case originated in an application (no. 41661/05) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Bulgarian nationals, Mr Anani Vladimirov Yavashev and Mr Stefan Vladimirov Yavashev, and a national of the United States of America, Mr Christo Vladimirov Javasheff (“the applicants”), on 14 November 2005.
The applicants were represented by Ms S. Margaritova-Vuchkova, a lawyer practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms R. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicants alleged, in particular, that they had been unjustifiably deprived of property that they had obtained by restitution.
On 16 June 2008 Zdravka Kalaydjieva, the judge elected in respect of the , withdrew from sitting in the case. On 4 April 2012 the President of the Fourth Section appointed Pavlina Panova as an ad hoc judge from the list of three persons whom Bulgaria had designated as eligible to serve as such judges (Article 26 § 4 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1 of the Rules of Court).
In the meantime, on 15 March 2011 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to give the Government notice of the complaint concerning the applicants’ alleged deprivation of a plot of land and two buildings. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the remainder of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1 of the Convention).
The applicants were born in 1932, 1938 and 1935 respectively. The first and second applicants live in Sofia, Bulgaria, and the third applicant lives in New York, the . They are brothers.
The applicants’ father owned a factory, together with the adjacent plot, in the town of . In 1947 the property was nationalised under the Nationalisation of Private Industrial and Mining Undertakings Act 1947. In the following years the authorities added a storey to the main factory building, transformed the factory into a school, and transformed the adjacent plot, together with other plots, into a schoolyard. The transformation was reflected in the relevant zoning plan. In 1964 the property was entered in the State properties register.
In 1983 the applicants’ father died, leaving them as his only heirs.
After the Restitution of Ownership of Nationalised Real Property Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act” – see paragraphs 2530 below) came into force on 25 February 1992, the applicants asked the mayor of Gabrovo to strike the property out of the State properties register. On 30 November 1992 the mayor granted their request, reasoning that the conditions for restitution were in place and that the applicants had become owners of the property by the operation of the Act. The restituted property consisted of a plot of land of 3,730 square metres, the first storey of the two-storey main building of 620 square metres (the second storey, which, as noted above, had been added by the authorities after the nationalisation, remained the property of the municipality), a one-storey accessory building of 200 square metres, and a second one-storey accessory building of 60 square metres. On 28 March 1996 the applicants obtained a notary deed certifying their title to the property.
In the following years the municipality continued to use the building as a school, with the applicants’ consent. However, the municipality sought to settle the issue of its use of the school. In a letter of 13 March 1995 the mayor invited the second applicant to a meeting to discuss the future amount of rent to be paid by the municipality. The outcome of the meeting was not specified by the parties. In a letter of 3 September 1996 the mayor advised the applicants that the municipality intended to start a procedure for the expropriation of the property or its purchase. When the applicants objected, this initiative was abandoned.
In a contract of 3 August 1998 the applicants allowed the municipality to use the property in return for a monthly rent of 3,646,000 old Bulgarian levs (BGL). The municipality also agreed to pay the applicants BGL 34,637,000 as compensation for use of the property between 15 October 1997 and 3 August 1998.
On 21 January 1999 the municipal council adopted a resolution to start a procedure for the purchase of the property. It appears that the resolution was subsequently abandoned.
On 17 May 2001 the municipal council adopted a resolution for the purchase of the property. The price was set at the equivalent of 180,000  dollars.
On 22 June 2001 the regional governor of Gabrovo ordered the suspension of the execution of the municipal council’s resolution of 17 May 2001. She noted, in particular, that since 1960 the main building and the yard had accommodated a school. She went on to say that the property served the needs of the local community and was municipal public property, that it had never been returned to the applicants, and that the mayor’s decision to strike it out of the State properties register had been made in error.
The governor also brought judicial review proceedings to have the resolution set aside. On 31 October 2001 the  dismissed her claim. It found that the governor’s assertions that the property had not been returned to the applicants and had remained municipal property were ill-founded. On appeal, in a final judgment of 15 July 2002 the  disagreed and set the resolution aside. It held, inter alia, that the school was municipal public property by virtue of the Constitution of 1991 and interpretative decision no. 19 of 1993 of the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 31 below), and had never been returned to the applicants. The court went on to say that since it had not been possible to return the property to the applicants, they were entitled to compensation under the Compensation of Owners of Nationalised Real Property Act 1997 (“the 1997 Act” – see paragraphs 3539 below).
Meanwhile, on 1 April 2001 the municipality stopped paying rent to the applicants. On an unspecified date in 2002 they filed a claim for nonpayment of rent against the municipality with the Gabrovo District Court. The municipality filed a counterclaim, seeking a judicial declaration that it was the owner of the property.
On 3 July 2002 the Gabrovo District Court granted the applicants’ claim and dismissed the municipality’s counterclaim. The municipality appealed, but on 20 December 2002 the  upheld the lower court’s judgment.
The municipality appealed on points of law. On 14 October 2004 the Supreme Court of Cassation granted its claim in respect of the main building. It held, in particular, that the municipality had reconstructed that building in such a way that a new building, different from the nationalised one, had been created. That building had been earmarked to accommodate a school and thus serve the needs of the community. The court went on to say that in view of that, the main building could not have been returned to the applicants and had remained the property of the municipality. The judgment in this part was final. The court remitted the remainder of the case, which concerned the two accessory buildings and the plot of land, for reexamination. It instructed the lower court to examine which part of the plot existed independently of the school, because only that part could have been returned. As for the accessory buildings, the lower court had to determine whether they had been part of the school compound and on that basis decide whether or not they had been subject to restitution.
Having re-examined the case, on 7 October 2005 the  dismissed the applicants’ claim and allowed the municipality’s counterclaim. It found, in particular, that under the relevant zoning plan the plot of land, together with another plot, had been earmarked to serve the school. The court went on to say that the two accessory buildings and the plot of land were functionally connected with the main building and served the needs of the school. Therefore, they could not have been severed and returned to the applicants.
On 12 December 2007 the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld that judgment and held that the property in question had always belonged to the municipality. In the court’s view, the property had been municipal public property at the time when the 1992 Act had come into force, and had therefore not been subject to restitution. The adoption in 1996 of the State Property Act 1996 and the Municipal Property Act 1996 (see paragraph 32 below) had not in itself transformed State and municipal property into private and public property, as that transformation had already been envisaged in the Constitution of 1991. The two Acts had simply laid down the detailed rules governing those types of property. The court went on to say that since the property could not be returned to the applicants, they were entitled to compensation under the 1997 Act (see paragraph 26 below). In addition to those findings, the court also endorsed the findings of the  and held, in particular, that the disputed plot of land was part of a bigger plot, did not feature as a discrete plot in the zoning plan, and could not therefore have been returned.
Following the Supreme Court of Cassation’s ruling of 14 October 2004 in respect of the main building (see paragraph 18 above), in 2005 the municipality lodged a claim for unjust enrichment against the applicants with the Sofia City Court. It sought repayment of allegedly wrongly paid rent in the amount of 151,207 new Bulgarian levs (BGN), plus interest for the period between 3 August 1998 and 31 March 2001. The proceedings are still pending.
On 24 November 2005 the applicants applied for compensation under the 1997 Act (see paragraphs 3539 below). On 25 January 2006 the governor dismissed the application, saying that the applicants had missed the one-year time-limit laid down in the Act, which had expired in 1998. The applicants sought judicial review. In a final judgment of 17 May 2007, the  upheld the governor’s decision.
On 27 March 2008 the applicants sent a letter to the chairperson of the municipal council and the mayor of Gabrovo, seeking compensation. Meetings with representatives of the municipal council followed. On 25 May 2008 the applicants sent another letter to the council’s chairperson and the mayor, reiterating their request. According to the applicants, the authorities did not react to that letter.
On 21 October 2010 the municipal council adopted a resolution to close down the school. In April 2011 the applicants sent letters to the mayor, the municipal council and the regional governor, saying that after the closure of the school the property had become private municipal property and should be returned to them.
In 1992, after the fall of the communist regime, Parliament adopted the Restitution of Ownership of Nationalised Real Property Act 1992 (Закон за възстановяване собствеността върху одържавени недвижими имоти). It came into force on 25 February 1992 and provided, in section 2(1) and (3) and section 4, that former owners, or their heirs, of real property nationalised under, inter alia, the Nationalisation of Private Industrial and Mining Undertakings Act 1947, regained ownership of their nationalised properties if (a) the properties still existed in their state prior to nationalisation, (b) they were still owned by, in particular, the State or municipalities, and (c) no adequate compensation had been received by the owners at the time of nationalisation.
Section 3(3) provided that where restitution was impossible the former owners or their heirs were to be compensated in a manner to be set out in a separate statute. That statute – the Compensation of Owners of Nationalised Real Property Act 1997 – was adopted and came into force in November 1997 (see paragraphs 3539 below).
Section 6(3) read in conjunction with (2) of the 1992 Act provided that if a restituted property had accommodated, among others, hospitals or schools, they could continue to use it for a period of three years after the Act’s coming into force, but had to pay, from the date of restitution, regulated rent to the persons in whose favour the property had been returned. The meaning of that provision was not entirely clear. It appears that it concerned property which was being used as a hospital or a school; even if all the conditions for the restitution of such property were in place, in view of its designated use it was warranted not to return it immediately to its former owners, so that its pre-restitution occupiers could continue to use it for a certain period of time (реш. № 515 от 10 май 1995 г. по гр. д. № 1381/1994 г., ВС, IV г. о.).
The restitution of ownership under the 1992 Act was by operation of law. There was no need for an administrative or judicial decision certifying that the conditions for restitution were in place. In particular, mayors’ decisions to strike property out of the State properties register were internal acts with no effect on property rights (реш. № 115 от 21 март 1994 г. по гр. д. № 3428/1993 г., ВС, III г. о.).
The Bulgarian courts have sought to clarify the restitution conditions laid down in the 1992 Act, in particular the exact meaning of the condition that the property had to still exist in its state prior to nationalisation (see paragraph 25 above). In an interpretative decision of 17 May 1995 (тълк. реш. № 1 от 17 май 1995 г. по гр. д. № 3/1994, ВС, ОСГК), the former Supreme Court found that condition not to mean that a property should have remained in the exact same state it had been at the time of nationalisation. Subsequent modifications concerning its designated use did not preclude restitution. It was enough for the property to exist as a discrete object of a property right and within the boundaries that it had had at the time of nationalisation.
The above-mentioned condition was further clarified in subsequent caselaw. In particular, the Supreme Court of Cassation has held that if the designated use of the nationalised property has been modified by virtue of a zoning plan and the property has been transformed into an element of the public infrastructure, such as a public square, the property does not constitute a discrete object of a property right and does not exist in its boundaries at the time of nationalisation. In such cases, restitution is not possible (реш. № 1343 от 21 октомври 2001 г. по гр. д. № 1233/2001 г., ВКС, IV г. о.).
The Constitution of 1991 provides that property is private and public (Article 17 § 2), and that the legal regime of property that belongs to the State and the municipalities is to be governed by statute (Article 17 § 4). In its interpretative decision no. 19 of 21 December 1993 (реш. № 19 от 21 декември 1993 г. по к. д. № 11 от 1993 г., обн., ДВ, бр. 4 от 12 януари 1994 г.), the Constitutional Court held that although Article 17 § 2 of the Constitution made a distinction between public and private property, it did not lay down criteria for that distinction. The leading criteria were: who had title to the property, the property’s nature and designated use. The court went on to say that only the State and the municipalities could own public property. By contrast, private property could be owned not only by the State and the municipalities, but also by private persons. Lastly, the court noted that it was within the power of the legislature to give a definition of property belonging to the public domain.
The State Property Act 1996 and the Municipal Property Act 1996 came into force on 1 June 1996. At the material time the Municipal Property Act 1996 provided, inter alia, that municipal public property was property designated as such by statute or property that served the needs of the community in a permanent manner (section 3(2)(1) and (2)(3)). Such property is inalienable – it cannot be transferred to third parties or acquired by adverse possession (section 7(1) and (2)). The State Property Act 1996 contains similar provisions in respect of State public property.
In its decision no. 4 of 11 March 1998 (реш. № 4 от 11 март 1998 г. по к. д. № 16 от 1997 г., обн., ДВ, бр. 30 от 17 март 1998 г.), the Constitutional Court held that restitution was possible only in respect of private property as only the private property of the State or the municipalities could be transferred to individuals or non-State entities. In particular, the restitution of State public property had been prohibited by the 1992 Act and the 1997 Act. This was so because restitution could not affect property that belonged to the public domain and was protected by the Constitution because it served constitutionally established public interests.
In line with the two 1996 Acts, in March 1998 the National Education Act 1991 was amended to provide that property earmarked for use by municipal schools was in the public domain and constituted municipal public property (section 10(3) (since 2009 subsection (4)) in fine).
In November 1997 Parliament adopted the Compensation of Owners of Nationalised Real Property Act 1997 (Закон за обезщетяване на собственици на одържавени имоти). It came into force on 22 November 1997 and provided for the compensation of former owners of nationalised property or their heirs in cases where it was impossible to return the property because it had become State or municipal public property, had been acquired in good faith by third parties, or had been transformed by construction or otherwise (section 2(1)).
Under section 6(1), applications for compensation had to be made to the regional governor or the relevant minister within one year after the Act had come into force, that is, until 22 November 1998.
The former owners could choose the manner of compensation, except in cases where the property had become State or municipal public property before 25 February 1992, the date on which the 1992 Act had come into force (section 2(4)). In that case, compensation was only in the form of compensatory bonds (реш. № 9371 от 7 декември 2001 г. по адм. д. № 3193/2001, ВАС, III о., реш. № 7511 от 16 юли 2003 г. по адм. д. № 2202/2003 г., ВАС, III о.), which could be used, in particular, in tenders for the privatisation of State-owned companies (section 4(2)).
If the property had become State or municipal public property after 25 February 1992, the former owners were entitled to compensation equal to the fair market value of the property at the time when the 1997 Act had come into force (section 2(7)).
In its above-mentioned decision no. 4 of 11 March 1998 (see paragraph 33 above), the Constitutional Court held that the reason for the difference in the manner of compensation was in the fact that any transfers of property to the State which had taken place after the coming into force of the 1992 Act in effect amounted to expropriations and called for the payment of compensation equivalent to the fair market value of the property.
Section 1 of the State Responsibility for Damage Caused to Citizens Act 1988 (Закон за отговорността на държавата за вреди, причинени на граждани), in July 2006 renamed the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (Закон за отговорността на държавата и общините за вреди – “the 1988 Act”), provides that the State and municipalities are liable for damage suffered by individuals (and since 1 January 2006 also legal persons) as a result of unlawful decisions, actions or omissions by their organs and officials committed in the course of or in connection with the carrying out of administrative action. Section 8(2) provides that if another statute provides for a special manner of indemnification, the Act does not apply. It seems that the domestic courts are not inclined to allow claims under section 1 of the Act in situations where, as in the present case, the claimants have failed to make applications for compensation under the 1997 Act in a timely manner (реш. № 4137 от 23 март 2011 г. по адм. д. № 15208/2010 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.).
