The case originated in twenty applications (nos. 20578/08, 21159/08, 22903/08, 24519/08, 24728/08, 25084/08, 25558/08, 25559/08, 27555/08, 27568/08, 28031/08, 30511/08, 31038/08, 45120/08, 45124/08, 45131/08, 45133/08, 45141/08, 45167/08 and 45173/08) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). Their details appeared in a judgment delivered on 1 December 2016 (“the principal judgment”).
In the principal judgment, the Court held there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (Tomina and Others v. Russia, nos. 20578/08 and 19 others, §§ 33-43, 1 December 2016) and made an award under Article 41 of the Convention to the applicants as regards their claims in respect of non-pecuniary damage and costs and expenses. The Court also made an award under Article 41 of the Convention to all the applicants, except Mr Vasyukhin and Ms Vasyukhina, as regards the claims in respect of pecuniary damage (application no. 45173/08).
Since the question of the application of Article 41 of the Convention was not ready for decision as regards the claims in respect of pecuniary damage of Mr Vasyukhin and Ms Vasyukhina (hereinafter, “the applicants”), the Court reserved it and invited the Government and the applicants concerned to submit, within four months from the date on which the principal judgment became final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, their written observations on that issue and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., § 51, and point 4 of the operative provisions).
The applicants and the Government filed observations.
