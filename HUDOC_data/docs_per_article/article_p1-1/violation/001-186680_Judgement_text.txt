The case originated in an application (no. 43326/11) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Mitat Iseni (“the applicant”), on 18 July 2011.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 10 March 2017 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
In 1990 the local authorities expropriated a flat in Belgrade belonging to the applicant. The size of the flat was 31.80 square metres.
On 16 December 2010 the Constitutional Court of Serbia ordered the local authorities in question to allocate the applicant a suitable replacement flat or to pay him compensation not lower than the market value of the flat in accordance with the Expropriation Act 1995. The decision entered into force on 23 February 2011 (see paragraph 8 below).
Whilst a number of steps have been taken (notably, the tax authorities estimated the market value of the flat at 209,015 Serbian dinars (RSD) per square metre on 3 February 2017 and the applicant accepted that assessment on 1 June 2017), the Constitutional Court’s decision in question has not yet been enforced.
Pursuant to Article 171 of the Constitution of Serbia, the decisions of the Constitutional Court are final and binding. Pursuant to section 89 of the Constitutional Court Act, the decisions of the Constitutional Court finding a breach of human rights enter into force when they are served on the parties to the proceedings.
