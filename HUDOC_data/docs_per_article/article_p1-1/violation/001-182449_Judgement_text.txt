The case originated in an application (no. 78352/14) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Artur Sepczyński (“the applicant”), on 26 November 2014.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 13 October 2015 the complaints under Article 3 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention were communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejected it.
The applicant was born in 1987 and lives in Łomża.
On 7 August 2010 the applicant had a motorcycle accident in which he broke his right arm and right thigh. Between 13 and 22 December 2010 the applicant underwent an arthroscopy on his right knee. Between 25 January and 15 February 2011 the applicant underwent rehabilitation treatment in Łomża Regional Hospital and during this stay no dysfunction was diagnosed in his right foot.
Subsequently, between 28 March and 26 July 2011, he was detained in Białystok Remand Centre. While in prison, he was examined three times (on 1 and 18 April and on 13 May 2011) by an orthopaedist, who observed that the applicant required physical therapy in the light of a limitation of his knee-joint movement, the atrophy of a thigh muscle, and an injury to a peroneal nerve. On 11 April 2011 the applicant was examined by a neurologist who likewise found atrophy of the thigh muscle and impaired bending of the right foot, which he attributed to an injury to the peroneal nerve. The applicant never received any physical therapy during his imprisonment, instead being offered only nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines.
On an unspecified date, but not later than 27 March 2012, the applicant brought a civil action against the State Treasury/Białystok Remand Centre for infringement of his personal rights, claiming that the prison healthcare system had failed to provide him with appropriate medical care during his detention and, moreover, that the cells had not met the minimum spatial requirement of 3 square metres per person and had been mouldy and infested with insects. He requested 200,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) in compensation, the equivalent of approximately 48,300 euros (EUR).
On 27 March 2012 the Białystok Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) exempted the applicant from the court fees.
On 20 January 2014 the Białystok Regional Court granted the applicant PLN 23,000 (approximately EUR 5,550) and dismissed the remainder of his action. The court held, particularly on the basis of the medical expert opinion, that the applicant had had a motorcycle accident and had required physical therapy as recommended by the prison orthopaedist. However, he had not been given any, either in prison or outside, which had resulted in a deterioration of his health. The court established that, due to the lack of physical therapy, the applicant had suffered atrophy of the thigh muscle and foot drop affecting his right foot. The court compared this finding with the fact that upon his arrival the applicant had not been suffering from foot drop, the pain in his knee had not been severe, and his right leg muscles had been working more effectively. The court emphasised that the applicant had not been offered proper treatment despite a worsening of his symptoms. These changes in his physical condition would not have been irreversible, but the break in the therapy had entailed a prolonged rehabilitation process. The court stated that the rehabilitation process for the applicant would be long and arduous, a situation which could have been avoided had the defendant acted appropriately. The court held that the applicant had suffered physical pain of significant seriousness, which, in turn, had had negative psychological consequences. The court therefore found the applicant’s claim for compensation for lack of adequate medical care partly justified. The claim concerning the alleged overcrowding and inadequate sanitary conditions was dismissed in full. The court also ordered the applicant to reimburse PLN 3,186 (EUR 766) for the costs of the defendant’s legal representation and PLN 10,932 (EUR 2,628) in court fees (in total: PLN 14,118 (EUR 3,394)).
The applicant did not lodge an appeal against the first-instance judgment.
Following the defendant’s appeal against the judgment, on 12 September 2014 the Białystok Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) amended the judgment, reduced the compensation granted to the applicant to PLN 13,000 (EUR 3,095), and upheld the first-instance court’s findings of fact and law. The applicant was not ordered to pay the court fees for the proceedings before that court. This court pointed out that in the experts’ opinions it was not specified, even approximately, what the effects of the negligence might be, how much longer the rehabilitation process would take, or how much stronger the pain had become in comparison to pain experienced previously by the applicant.
The relevant provisions of domestic law concerning medical care in prisons and remand centres are set out in the Court’s judgments in Sławomir Musiał v. Poland, no. 28300/06, §§ 48 and 51-53, 20 January 2009; Kaprykowski v. Poland, no. 23052/05, §§ 36-39, 3 February 2009; and Bujak v. Poland, no. 686/12, §§ 51-52, 21 March 2017.
The relevant provisions of domestic law concerning civil-law provisions which regulate the State Treasury’s liability in tort are set out in the Court’s ruling in Orchowski v. Poland, no. 17885/04, § 78, 22 October 2009.
Under Polish law, everyone except public authorities and institutions is obliged to pay a court fee when lodging a claim with the competent civil court. As a case progresses, a party is obliged to pay additional court fees when lodging any further appeals.
Article 98 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:
“The costs of litigation necessary for the effective conduct of a case are borne by the unsuccessful party to the proceedings. The costs of litigation comprise the court fees referred to above, legal fees paid to professional legal representatives, and various other items of expenditure incurred in connection with the proceedings, such as transport costs and loss of earnings as a result of participation in the hearings.”
Article 100 of the Code, as far as relevant, reads as follows:
“In case of partial granting of the claims, the costs shall be mutually cancelled out or proportionally divided.”
An exception to this general principle is provided for in Article 101 of the Code. Pursuant to this provision:
“The court may not order the losing defendant to pay the costs of litigation if he or she did not cause the proceedings to be instituted and acknowledged the claim at a first hearing.”
The scope of operation of the general principle whereby the unsuccessful party bears the litigation costs, as referred to above, is also mitigated by Article 102 of the Code. This provision enshrines the principle of equity in respect of litigation costs and stipulates that:
“The court may order the losing party to pay only a part of the litigation costs, or may exempt it altogether from the obligation to pay these costs, where the particular circumstances of the case justify such a decision.”
The amounts of court fees in civil cases are regulated in the Law of 28 July 2005 on Court Fees in Civil Cases (Ustawa o kosztach sądowych w sprawach cywilnych). Article 13 (1) provides:
“In cases concerning proprietary interests a proportionate fee shall be collected; it shall amount to five per cent of the value of the claim or of subject of an appeal, but not less than PLN 30 and not more than PLN 100,000.”
Lawyers’ fees at the material time were determined by the Ordinance of the Minister of Justice of 28 September 2002 on lawyers’ fees and on the rules of covering the costs of free legal aid by the State Treasury (rozporządzenie Ministra Sprawiedliwości z dnia 28 września 2002 r. w sprawie opłat za czynności adwokackie oraz ponoszenia przez Skarb Państwa kosztów nieopłaconej pomocy prawnej udzielonej z urzędu). Section 6 read:
“The minimum fees are, depending on the amount in dispute:
1) up to PLN 500 - PLN 60;
2) more than PLN 500 up to PLN 1,500 - PLN 180;
3) more than PLN 1,500 up to PLN 5,000 - PLN 600;
4) more than PLN 5,000 up to PLN 10,000 - PLN 1,200;
5) more than PLN 10,000 up to PLN 50,000 - PLN 2,400;
6) more than PLN 50,000 up to PLN 200,000 - PLN 3,600;
7) more than PLN 200,000 - PLN 7,200.”
