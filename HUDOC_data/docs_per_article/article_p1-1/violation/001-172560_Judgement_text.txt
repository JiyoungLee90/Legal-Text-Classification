The case originated in an application (no. 63391/13) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Ms Maria Nikolaeva Basmenkova (“the applicant”), on 21 September 2013.
The applicant was represented by Ms A. Gavrilova-Ancheva, a lawyer practising in Sofia. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms A. Panova, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 10 January 2014 the complaints concerning the continued failure of the authorities to provide compensation to the applicant for her husband’s expropriated property were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Sofia.
The applicant’s husband owned part of a house and a yard in Sofia.
By a decision of the mayor of 15 October 1981 the property was expropriated with a view to constructing a metro station. The decision, based on section 98(1) of the Territorial and Urban Planning Act of 1973, provided that the applicant’s husband was to be compensated with a threeroom flat in a building which the municipality planned to construct.
In 1989 the applicant and her husband were moved out of the expropriated property and settled in a two-room municipally-owned flat. The expropriated house was subsequently pulled down.
By a supplementary decision of 1 September 1989, based on section 100 of the Territorial and Urban Planning Act, the mayor determined the exact location, size and other details in respect of the future flat offered in compensation, which was to measure 94 square metres.
In 1993 the applicants’ husband passed away, after which the applicant became the owner of the future flat allocated in compensation to him.
In the years that followed the applicant requested on many occasions that the authorities complete the compensation procedure and deliver the flat due to her, but to no avail. The construction of the building in which the flat was to be located did not commence.
In 2001 the applicant brought a tort action, claiming wrongful failure on the part of the Sofia municipality to build and provide her with the flat due to her during the period from January 1993 to September 2001. In a final judgment of 6 March 2008 the Supreme Court of Cassation, holding that the municipality was responsible for the failure to deliver the flat within a reasonable time-limit, awarded the applicant 10,000 Bulgarian levs (BGN) in non-pecuniary damage and BGN 44,320 for loss of profit.
In 2009 the applicant brought a new tort action against the Sofia municipality covering the period after October 2001. The action was dismissed in a final judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court of 22 March 2013, on the ground that the applicant had had a special remedy at her disposal, namely the possibility provided for in section 9(1) of the transitional provisions of the Territory Planning Act 2001 to claim monetary compensation for the expropriated property instead of compensation with a flat (see paragraph 16 below).
In 2013 the Sofia municipality informed the applicant that the construction of the building where the flat due to her was to be located was to start in the near future. According to the latest information submitted by the parties in 2014, the municipality was looking for a company to carry out the construction works.
The relevant domestic law in force until 1996-98 concerning the expropriation of property for public use and the provision of compensation, as well as the relevant domestic practice, have been summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kirilova and Others v. Bulgaria (nos. 42908/98, 44038/98, 44816/98 and 7319/02, §§ 72-79, 9 June 2005).
In particular, section 100 of the Territorial and Urban Planning Act (Закон за териториалното и селищно устройство) provided that following an expropriation a supplementary decision by the respective mayor had to designate the exact property to be offered in compensation to the owners. Such a decision could be amended by the mayor at the request of the owners whose property had been expropriated, to provide compensation in cash or with other property (section 103(5) of the Act). In 1996 and 1998 the provisions of the Territorial and Urban Planning Act regarding expropriation for public use were superseded by other rules, but it was provided that the earlier provisions, although repealed, would continue to govern pending expropriation proceedings.
The Territorial Planning Act 2001 (Закон за устройство на територията) provides, in section 9(1) of its transitional provisions, that where expropriation proceedings have commenced under the earlier legislation and the owners of any expropriated property have not yet received the compensation due to them, the former owners can seek financial compensation.
