The case originated in an application (no. 30601/08) against the Republic of Albania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Albanian national, Mr Pëllumb Luli (“the applicant”), on 23 January 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Tartari, a lawyer practising in Tirana. The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their then Agents of the State Advocate’s Office, Mrs E. Hajro and, subsequently, by Ms L. Mandia.
On 25 January 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Tirana.
On 31 May 1996 the Tirana Commission recognised the applicant’s and other heirs inherited title to a plot of land measuring 23,500 sq. m, of which 5,000 sq. m were restored (“the first Commission decision”). They would be compensated by way of an equivalent plot of land within their property (i njihet dhe i kthehet ish pronarit pronësia mbi këtë truall duke kompensuar me truall ekuivalent brenda truallit të tij) in respect of a plot of land measuring 966 sq. m (“the first plot of land”), of which 188 sq. m were occupied with illegal constructions. The occupiers were entitled to buy the plot of land measuring 188 sq. m or rent it on the basis of an agreement to be concluded between the parties. It also recognised the right of first refusal of a public building measuring 444 sq. m situated within the plot of land measuring 966 sq. m. It further decided that the applicant and other heirs would be compensated in one of the ways provided for by law in respect of another plot of land measuring 3,961 sq. m (“the second plot of land”). Finally, it decided to examine the applicant’s and other heirs’ inherited property right in respect of the remaining plot of land measuring 13,454 sq. m at a later stage (“the third plot of land”). To date, no Commission decision has been taken in respect of the remaining plot of land measuring 13,454 sq. m.
On 30 April 1997 the applicant’s and other heirs’ inherited title over a plot of land measuring 6,154 sq. m, of which the first plot of land was part, was registered into the land register. The relevant data entered in the land register reads as follows:
“On 30 April 1997 is registered into the land register an unoccupied plot of land measuring 5,000 sq. m; an unoccupied plot of land measuring 966 sq. m, which was compensated by way of an equivalent plot of land within their property ...”
To date, the applicant has not been provided with any compensation concerning the first and second plots of land.
On the same day, the Tirana Commission, by virtue of another decision (“the second Commission decision”), recognised the applicant’s and other heirs’ inherited title to another plot of land measuring 2,900 sq. m (“the fourth plot of land”). Since the entire plot of land was occupied, it decided that the applicant and other heirs would be compensated in one of the ways provided for by law. To date, the applicant has not been provided with any compensation.
The relevant domestic law and practice have been described in detail in, inter alia, Manushaqe Puto and Others v. Albania (nos. 604/07, 43628/07, 46684/07 and 34770/09, §§ 23-53, 31 July 2012) and Ramadhi v. Albania (no. 38222/02, §§ 22-30, 13 November 2007).
On 6 March 2013 and 30 July 2014 the Government approved and issued new property valuation maps, which included the reference price per square metre throughout the country (Council of Ministers’ decisions nos. 187 of 6 March 2013 and 514 of 30 July 2014).
Subsequent to the events described in Karagjozi and Others v. Albania [Committee], nos. 25408/06, 37419/06, 49121/06, 1504/07, 19772/07, 46685/07, 49411/07, 27242/08, 61912/08 and 15075/09, §§ 36-38, 8 April 2014, the Committee of Ministers gave a decision on 6 March 2014 on the execution of judgments concerning the Albanian authorities’ failure to enforce final domestic judicial and administrative decisions awarding compensation in one of the ways provided for by law to the applicants in lieu of the physical restoration of their plots of land, which was adopted at its 1193th meeting, stated, in so far as relevant, the following:
“The Deputies
(...)
considered the actions taken since September 2013 and the measures foreseen for the coming weeks and months as encouraging; regretting, however, that the deadline fixed by the pilot judgment will not be met, underlined that in order to fulfill the obligations imposed by the European Court and to introduce the required compensation mechanism without further delay and within the time frame proposed by the action plan, the political commitment expressed in the action plan must be followed by concrete and substantial actions at the domestic level, in particular in the fields identified by the Committee in its Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2013)115;
(...).”
The Committee of Ministers’ decision of 5 June 2014 on the execution of judgments concerning the Albanian authorities’ failure to enforce final domestic judicial and administrative decisions awarding compensation in one of the ways provided for by law to the applicants in lieu of the physical restoration of their plots of land, which was adopted at its 1201st meeting, stated, in so far as relevant, the following:
“The Deputies
welcomed the formal adoption by the Albanian Council of Ministers of the action plan for the establishment of an effective compensation mechanism, thereby rendering the action plan binding, and noted with satisfaction that the measures foreseen are being adopted in conformity with the previsions in that plan;
in view of the overall deadline foreseen for the implementation of this mechanism, strongly encouraged the authorities to intensify their efforts with a view to reducing this time-frame as much as possible;
 (...).”
The Committee of Ministers’ decision of 11 June 2015, which was adopted at its 1230th meeting, stated, in so far as relevant, the following:
“The Deputies
welcomed the commitment showed by the Albanian authorities in the search for an effective and sustainable solution to the important structural problem at stake in this group of cases; welcomed in this regard their presentation of the draft law and their co-operation with the Council of Europe, as well as the close consultations held with the Department for Execution, particularly in Tirana on 23 April 2015;
noted that, as requested by the Committee of Ministers and by the pilot judgment Manushaqe Puto, the authorities have conducted a careful review of all of the legal and financial implications and have estimated the overall cost of compensation in order to have a concrete basis for considering the necessary legislative changes;
invited the Albanian authorities to submit, as soon as possible, explanations and additional information on the solutions proposed in the draft law ...
