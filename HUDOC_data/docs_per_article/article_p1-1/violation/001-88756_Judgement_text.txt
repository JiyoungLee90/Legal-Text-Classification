The case originated in an application (no. 33431/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mrs Kerime Abacı (“the applicant”), on 1 May 2002.
The applicant was represented by Mr Z. Işık, a lawyer practising in Hatay. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 5 November 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Hatay.
On 15 September 1993 the applicant bought a plot of land (plot no. 1241), near the coast in Hatay. The land was registered in the applicant’s name in the Land Registry. She built a house there.
On 4 July 1995 the Treasury brought an action before the Samandağ Court of First Instance, requesting the annulment of the applicant’s title deed to the land on the ground that it was located within the coastal area.
On 16 December 1999 the Samandağ Court of First Instance upheld the Treasury’s request and decided to annul the title deed of the applicant to the plot of land. In its decision, the court held that, pursuant to domestic law, coastal areas could not be subject to private ownership and that, therefore, the applicant could not rely on the argument that she had acted bona fides.
On 16 May 2001 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. On 14 January 2002 a request by the applicant for rectification was rejected by the Court of Cassation.
The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the Doğrusöz and Aslan v. Turkey judgment (no. 1262/02, § 16, 30 May 2006).
