The case originated in three applications (nos. 39979/08, 43101/08 and 47759/08) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Russian nationals. The applicants’ names and the dates of their applications to the Court appear in the Appendix.
The Russian Government ("the Government")  were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 7 July 2016 the applications were communicated to the Government.
Between 2005 and 2006 the courts held for the applicants and ordered the pension authority to recalculate their pensions. These judgments became final.
On the pension authority’s request, in 2008 the district and town courts quashed their judgments previously delivered in the applicants’ favour due to discovery of new circumstances. The courts found, in particular, that the judgments had ignored the interpretation of the Labour Pensions Act given by the Supreme Court in December 2005 and March 2007. The applicants’ claims were eventually dismissed.
The Code of Civil Procedure (“CCivP”), as in force at the material time, provided as follows:
“[Judgments] which have come into force may be re-considered on the basis of newly-discovered circumstances. The grounds for re-consideration ... shall be:
significant circumstances which were not and could not have been known to the party who applies for re-consideration; ...
...
cancellation of a court [judgment] or of another authority’s decision which served as legal basis for the [judgment] in question.”
