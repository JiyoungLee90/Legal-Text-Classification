The case originated in an application (no. 61940/13) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Tamás Nagy (“the applicant”), on 22 September 2013.
The applicant was represented by Mr G.C. Veress, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Justice.
On 7 December 2016 the applicant’s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention concerning the imposition of 98% tax on part of his severance payment was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Gyor.
The applicant was employed at a State-owned institution from 1 July 2007 until 21 June 2010. Upon termination, a certain part of his severance payment was taxed at 98% in the amount of HUF 5,051,012 (approximately EUR 16,800). The employer had deducted HUF 2,094,624 as special tax. Despite his statutory obligation, the applicant failed to pay the remaining special tax.
The National Tax Authority carried out a tax audit for the year 2010. As the result of the audit, the authority required the applicant to pay HUF 2,569,831 as outstanding special tax and 10 percent tax penalty. The applicant challenged the decision before the Győr Administrative and Labour Court. The court found the decision lawful but quashed the tax penalty.
Tax enforcement proceedings are currently being pursued against the applicant in respect of the outstanding special tax and late payment interests. Until May 2017 HUF 615,238 (approximately EUR 2,000) were collected from the applicant.
