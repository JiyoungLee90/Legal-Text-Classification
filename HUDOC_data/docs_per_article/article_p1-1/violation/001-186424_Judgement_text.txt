The case originated in an application (no. 41749/12) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ms Božana Martinović (“the applicant”), on 12 June 2012.
The applicant was self-represented. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms B. Skalonjić.
On 12 December 2016 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Assemini (Italy).
By a decision of 4 December 2006 of the Cantonal Prosecutor of the Hercegovina-Neretva Canton (Hercegovačko-neretvanski kanton; one of the ten cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) the applicant was granted the reimbursement of costs which she had incurred as a witness in the amount of 519 convertible marks (BAM).
On 29 February 2008 the Mostar Municipal Court (“the Municipal Court”) rejected the applicant’s request for the enforcement of this decision, deeming it unenforceable.
On 18 September 2008 the Mostar Cantonal Court (“the Cantonal Court”) quashed this decision and remitted the case for reconsideration.
On 19 November 2008 the Municipal Court issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju).
On 19 June 2009 the Municipal Court upheld the objection lodged against this decision.
On 1 April 2010 the Cantonal Court quashed this decision and again remitted the case to the Municipal Court.
On 18 February 2011 the Municipal Court partly accepted the objection against the writ of execution specifically as regards the interest on the main debt calculated from 4 January 2007, and the interest on the total costs of the enforcement proceedings.
On 2 December 2011 the Cantonal Court upheld this decision.
On 19 September 2013 the Supreme Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina dismissed the applicant’s request for revision as inadmissible.
On 23 December 2013 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina partially accepted the applicant’s appeal and thereby found a violation of her right to a trial within a reasonable time, due to the non-enforcement of the decision of the Municipal Court of 18 February 2011 (see paragraph 12 above). It also ordered the Hercegovina-Neretva Canton to undertake measures in order to enforce the decision within a reasonable time. The Constitutional Court, however, did not award the non-pecuniary damage requested by the applicant.
On 21 October 2014 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina confirmed that the final decision in question had not yet been enforced.
On 18 December 2014 the said final decision was enforced and the applicant was paid in cash.
By a judgment of the Municipal Court of 3 April 2009, which became final on 16 December 2009, a certain P.M. was ordered to pay the applicant the costs of civil proceedings in the amount of BAM 1,959.
On 31 October 2010 the applicant submitted to the Municipal Court a request for the enforcement of this judgment.
On 14 September 2011, 4 November 2011 and 5 October 2012 the applicant submitted requests for the acceleration of the enforcement proceedings.
On 5 December 2012 the Municipal Court issued a writ of execution.
On 13 June 2013 the Municipal Court dismissed the objection lodged against its decision of 5 December 2012, and P.M. subsequently appealed this decision to the Cantonal Court.
On 17 September 2013 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina found a violation of the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time, due to the duration of the enforcement proceedings before the Municipal Court. It further ordered the Cantonal Court to urgently rule on the appeal lodged by P.M. The Constitutional Court, however, did not award the non-pecuniary damage requested by the applicant.
On 16 October 2013 the Cantonal Court dismissed the appeal lodged by P.M.
On 11 June 2015 the Municipal Court issued a writ of execution.
On 4 August 2016 the said final judgment was enforced and the applicant was paid in cash on her bank account in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It appears that the applicant was still living in Italy at that time.
