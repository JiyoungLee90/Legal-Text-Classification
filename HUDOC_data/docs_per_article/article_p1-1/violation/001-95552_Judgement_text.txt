The case originated in an application (no. 58764/00) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovakian national, Ms Jarmila Jenisová (“the applicant”), on 22 February 2000.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Ms V. Danková, a lawyer practising in , between 6 September 2005 and 12 December 2005. The Government of the  (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Pirošíková.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that her right to peaceful enjoyment of property had been violated as a result of the compulsory letting of her land and its envisaged transfer to the tenants and that she had been discriminated against in that respect.
By a decision of 12 September 2006 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant and the Government each submitted further written observations (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other's observations.
The applicant was born in 1925 and lives in .
In 1938 the applicant's father acquired land in Levoča. After the Second World War, when the communist regime was installed in , the State availed itself of the land and put it at the disposal of a State-owned agricultural farm in Levoča without the owner's consent and without paying any compensation. The applicant's father remained the owner of the land in name (nuda proprietas).
In 1983 the farm put the land, of which the applicant and her four sisters had become the owners in the meantime, at the disposal of the local organisation of the Slovak Union of Gardeners in Levoča for ten years. The owners were provided with no compensation.
In accordance with the provisions of the Land Ownership Act 1991, the gardeners' right to use the land was extended by ten years in 1993.
Levoča is nowadays a district town with approximately 15,000 inhabitants. According to the data in the land register, the applicant's land is situated outside the town's built-up area.
On 23 June 1994 the applicant sued the users of the land for rent. She claimed that the tenants should pay her two Slovak korunas (SKK) per square metre of land a year for the period from 24 June 1991 to 31 December 1994.
On 15 May 2003 the Spišská Nová Ves District Court obliged the tenants to pay the applicant a rent of SKK 0.1 per square metre of land for the period from 24 June 1991 to 31 December 1991, and SKK 0.3 for the period from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994.
As to the former period, the rent due was up to 1.5% of the administrative value of the land. Part of the applicant's land was classified as pasture and its value under the applicable regulation was SKK 0.5 per square metre. The remaining part of the plot was classified as arable land and its value was SKK 0.65 per square metre. Under the law in force the applicant was thus entitled to a total sum of SKK 10.1 as rent for the above period in 1991. However, since the gardeners had agreed to pay SKK 0.1 per square metre for the use of the land the court accepted that sum as the basis for determination of the rent. The rent due for that period was thus SKK 126.9.
As to the second period, that is from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994, valuation of land was governed by Regulation 465/1991. According to this, the arable part of the applicant's land had the value of SKK 0.5 per square metre and the remainder SKK 0.375. Compensation for temporary use of the land was to be agreed upon by the parties. Since no such agreement had been reached, the District Court considered it appropriate that the gardeners should pay SKK 0.3 per square metre per year. It had thereby also regard, as reference, to section 4(1) of Law no. 64/1997. The decision stated that the sum claimed by the applicant, namely SKK 2 per square metre, was too high, considering the location of the land and the gardeners' contribution to increasing its quality.
The applicant appealed. She argued that the first-instance court had not correctly determined the surface area of her share in the plot used by the gardeners and that the rent due had not been determined correctly.
On 30 October 2003 the  granted the applicant's claim in part, in that it held that the gardeners were obliged to pay rent in respect of the overall land covered by the contract of 1983, that is also on its parts which, according to the gardeners, could not be used for gardening because of a steep slope. The surface area of the applicant's land for which rent was due was 2,804.4 square metres. As to the amount of rent due, the regional court upheld the first-instance judgment. Finally, the court of appeal drew the applicant's attention to the Constitutional Court's judgment PL ÚS 17/00 addressing conformity with the Constitution and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of certain provisions of Law no. 64/1997 (for further details concerning that judgment see Urbárska obec Trenčianske Biskupice v. , no. 74258/01, §§ 67-79, ECHR 2007... (extracts)).
On 16 December 2008 the applicant informed the Court that the gardeners had paid SKK 11,030 to her for the use of her land between 1991 and 2008. That sum was based on a yearly rental value of SKK 0.1 per square metre initially and later on SKK 0.3 per square metre.
On 21 June 1999 the gardeners requested, under section 7(1) of Law no. 64/1997, that the ownership relationship in respect of their gardens be settled by the Levoča District Office in a land consolidation procedure under section 7(4) of that Act.
On 22 February 2000 the district office made a formal announcement under section 18(1) of Law no. 64/1997 of the commencement of the land consolidation procedure pursuant to section 7(4) of that Act. On 8 March 2000 it published a register of the original ownership and a surveyor's plan concerning the current state of the land (“the preliminary inventory”). By a decision of 11 May 2000 the administrative authority approved the preliminary inventory.
On 22 June 2001 the district office dismissed the applicant's objection to the preliminary inventory. On 5 November 2001, upon the applicant's appeal, the Prešov Regional Office quashed the contested decision due to procedural shortcomings.
In the subsequent proceedings, on 21 February 2003, the applicant objected to the inventory, in particular to the area of land covered by it. The district office dismissed the objection on 21 March 2003. On 20 July 2006 the Regional Land Office in Prešov dismissed the applicant's appeal. On 22 June 2006 the applicant sought a judicial review of that decision.
In a decision of 23 October 2006 the District Land Office in Poprad approved the preliminary inventory. In that context, the administrative value of the applicant's land was established at SKK 0.5 per square metre. Since the minimum amount for compensation was SKK 3, the administrative authority took the latter sum as a basis for assessment and increased the valuation of the applicant's land to SKK 6 on the ground of its location. The applicant appealed.
On 8 February 2007 the regional land office stayed the proceedings pending the determination by a court of the applicant's action against the regional land office's decision of 20 July 2006.
On 20 May 2008 the  quashed the last-mentioned decision. It granted the applicant's argument that the whole land put at the disposal of the association of gardeners should be taken into consideration in the consolidation procedure regardless of whether it was used for gardening purposes or not. The court further held that the administrative authorities had not established the relevant facts with sufficient certainty.
On 7 November 2008 the regional land office quashed the district office's decision of 21 March 2003 dismissing the applicant's objection to the preliminary inventory.
In the meantime, on 26 October 2006, the director of the district land office in a letter stated that, according to an inventory of the original state of the land, the value of the applicant's land was SKK 0.5 per square metre. Compensation under section 11 of Law no. 64/1997 was SKK 6 (the equivalent of approximately EUR 0.2) per square metre.
The land consolidation procedure under Law no. 64/1997 is pending before the administrative authorities.
On 2 April 2009, at the Government's request, the Forensic Engineering Institute in Žilina elaborated an opinion on the value of the applicant's land as of 20 March 2009. It noted that the applicant owned 2,804 square metres of land in the area concerned which, according to the zoning plan, was to be used exclusively for gardening purposes. The institute estimated the general value of the land at EUR 6.47 per square metre and its general rental value at EUR 0.448 per square metre per year.
The applicant, with reference to several decisions on sale of real property approved by the Levoča municipal council, submitted that the current market value of her land was at least EUR 16.6 per square metre. She considered its annual rental value to be no less than EUR 0.664 per square metre.
On 13 July 2001 the applicant sued the gardeners' association before the Poprad District Court. She claimed that the defendant's right to use her land should be cancelled. The applicant argued that the gardeners had disregarded the contract on use of the land of 1983. In particular, the surface of certain individual gardens exceeded the limit of 200 square metres and the surface of some of the gardeners' huts exceeded 16 square metres contrary to what the 1983 contract stipulated.
On 11 September 2002 the District Court dismissed the action. It held that the use of the land was governed by the relevant provisions of the Land Ownership Act 1991 and of Law no. 64/1997. The applicant appealed. She argued that the gardeners were bound by the contract of 1983 and that they had failed to respect its provisions.
On 8 March 2004 the  upheld the first-instance judgment as being in compliance with the applicable law. The court of appeal further pointed out that individual gardeners had become tenants of the land after the entry into force of Law no. 64/1997 on 26 March 1997. The defendant association could therefore no longer be considered as a user of the applicant's land.
Article 152 § 4 of the Constitution provides that constitutional laws, laws and other generally binding legal regulations are to be interpreted and applied in conformity with the Constitution.
Pursuant to Article 154c § 1 of the Constitution, international treaties on human rights and fundamental freedoms which the Slovak Republic has ratified and were promulgated in the manner laid down by a law prior to the entry into force of Constitutional Act 90/2001 on 1 July 2001 form a part of its legal order and have precedence over laws where they provide for a larger scope of constitutional rights and freedoms.
In judgment I. ÚS 36/02 delivered on 30 April 2003 the Constitutional Court, with reference to Articles 152 § 4 and 154c § 1 of the Constitution, held that the Convention and the case-law of its bodies represent binding guidelines for national authorities on interpretation and implementation of legal provisions bearing on fundamental rights and freedoms. The Convention and the case-law of its organs thus set a framework which the national authorities cannot overstep when dealing with a case. The same view was expressed in its judgment I. ÚS 239/04 of 26 October 2005.
On 15 October 2003 the  delivered a judgment in proceedings III. ÚS 138/03. The case concerned alleged flaws in proceedings on implementation of a consolidation project under Law no. 64/1997. In particular, the plaintiff complained that by its decision to discontinue the proceedings concerning lawfulness of the administrative authorities' decisions a court had breached his rights to judicial protection and to own property.
The  granted the complaint considering that the court should have dealt with the merits of the case. It returned the case to the ordinary court for further proceedings.
The Land Ownership Act 1991 (Zákon o úprave vlastníckych vzťahov k pôde a inému poľnohospodárskemu majetku) entered into force on 24 June 1991.
Paragraph 2 of section 22 provides that from the date of entry into force of the Act and unless a different agreement is reached with the owner, the user of the land shall acquire tenancy rights in respect of it.
Under section 22(3), as in force until 25 March 1997, in cases where the land was used by individual gardeners on an allotment site the tenancy could not be terminated before expiry of the period for which the land had been originally put at the disposal of the users. Unless the parties otherwise agreed, the tenants had the right to have the tenancy extended by another ten years. The rent and the purchase price in respect of such land were to be determined on the basis of the classification and quality of the land at the time when the gardeners' right to use it had been established.
Law no. 64/1997 on the use of plots of land in allotment gardens and arrangements as regards their ownership (Zákon o užívaní pozemkov v zriadených záhradkových osadách a vyporiadaní vlastníctva k nim) governs the use of land within allotment gardens and the transfer of ownership rights in respect of such land. It entered into force on 11 March 1997 and took effect on 26 March 1997. It repealed section 22(3) of the Land Ownership Act 1991.
Its relevant provisions, domestic practice as well as the general background to the use and consolidation of land used by garden communities are set out in Urbárska obec Trenčianske Biskupice (cited above, §§ 7-13, 49-65 and 67-79).
Pursuant to section 4(1), as in force until 31 October 2004, the yearly rent for the use of plots of land in allotment gardens is ten per cent of their value as established under section 15(5-7) of Regulation 465/91 of the Ministry of Finance, the minimum sum being SKK 0.3 per square metre.
Since 1 November 2004, when Regulation 465/1991 was repealed, section 4(1) of Law no. 64/1997 has fixed the rent in respect of the land in allotments at 10% of its value, as determined in accordance with a special law. Reference is made to the Land Consolidation Act 1991, as amended. Section 43(2) of that Act empowers the Ministry of Agriculture to issue a binding regulation in that respect (Regulation 38/2005, see below).
Regulation 465/1991 of the Ministry of Finance of 25 October 1991, as amended, governed determination of the price of buildings and plots of land and compensation for the use of land. It concerned the value of property for administrative purposes. It was repealed on 1 January 2004. Section 15(5-7) provides that the price of plots of land registered as arable land, orchards, vineyards, meadows or pasture is to be fixed in accordance with Annex 8 to the Regulation. In the case of meadows and pasture the price is 0.75% of the price indicated in Annex 8. The annex provides for prices per square metre ranging from SKK 12.1 to SKK 0.5 according to the quality and classification of the land.
Regulation 38/2005 of the Ministry of Agriculture governs valuation of plots of land and vegetation on it for the purpose of proceedings under the Land Consolidation Act 1991 (see Urbárska obec Trenčianske Biskupice, cited above, §§ 45-48). It was enacted with effect from 15 February 2005.
In it valuation is based on a scheme of “quality pedo-ecological units” (bonitované pôdno-ekologické jednotky) categorising agricultural land and other areas in . Section 1(5) provides that such valuation is applicable also to gardens located outside a municipality's built-up area. The scheme provides for value of agricultural land within a range from EUR 0.0216 to EUR 0.402 (Annex 1). Pursuant to Annex 5, the value of a particular plot is determined by multiplying the unitary value as set out in Annex 1 by its surface area.
