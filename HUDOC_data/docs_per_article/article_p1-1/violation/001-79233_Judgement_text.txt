The case originated in an application (no. 24620/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Sergey Grigoryevich Belyayev (“the applicant”), on 3 June 2002.

On 4 January 2006 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in . He is permanently disabled as a result of participation in the emergency response operations at the  nuclear power station.
On 27 April 1999 the Leninskiy District Court of Tambov delivered a judgment in which it ordered the Social Security Service to provide the applicant with a car with hand controls. The judgment was not appealed against and became enforceable on 12 May 1999.
It appears that the Social Security Service did not comply with the judgment. For that reason, on 13 June 2000 the bailiff's office issued a charging order in respect of two vehicles purchased by the Social Security Service. On 24 June 2000 the Social Security Service complained against the measure taken by the bailiff's office.
On 5 October 2000 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Tambov revoked the charging order. That decision was upheld on 1 November 2000 by the .
Thereafter the Social Security Service submitted a request to the Leninskiy District Court of Tambov to stay the execution of the judgment. However, on 4 April 2001 the District Court dismissed the request.
On 26 July 2001 the bailiff's office discontinued the enforcement proceedings and returned the writ of execution to the applicant. The bailiff's decision, however, was quashed by the Leninskiy District Court of Tambov on 27 September 2001.
Subsequently, the Social Security Service once more submitted a request to stay the execution of the judgment until 31 December 2003. On 19 March 2003 the Leninskiy District Court of Tambov granted the request.
On 21 June 2004 the applicant purchased a car at his own expense; the Social Security Service reimbursed a portion (66,900 Russian roubles (RUR)) of the purchase price equivalent to that of a cycle car.
According to the Government, the enforcement proceedings were terminated on 8 July 2004.
On an unspecified date the applicant brought a civil action, seeking an increase of the monthly rate of the disability compensation he was entitled to receive.
In a judgment of 1 June 2001 the Leninskiy District Court of Tambov awarded the applicant RUR 77,826.90 for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 May 2001 and increased the monthly rate to RUR 10,000, effective as from 1 June 2001. The judgment became enforceable on 14 June 2001.
In April 2002 the Social Security Service paid RUR 77,826.90 to the applicant.
On 1 January 2003 the Social Security Service started to make monthly disability payments in the amount of RUR 10,000.
On 23 March 2003 the applicant received RUR 140,243 in arrears on account of the State's failure to pay, in 2001 and 2002, the disability compensation in the amount determined in the judgment of 1 June 2001.
On 8 October 2001 the applicant brought an action seeking the adjustment of the unpaid amount awarded to him on 1 June 2001 to take account of inflation.
On 27 April 2002 the Leninskiy District Court of Tambov granted the applicant's claim and awarded him RUR 171,181.36. The judgment became enforceable on 8 May 2002.
On 1 April 2003 the Social Security Service requested the court to clarify the judgment of 27 April 2002 and to reduce the amount awarded.
On 9 April 2003 the District Court reduced the award to RUR 93,354.46.
The judgment of 27 April 2002, as amended on 9 April 2003, was enforced on 13 May 2003.
