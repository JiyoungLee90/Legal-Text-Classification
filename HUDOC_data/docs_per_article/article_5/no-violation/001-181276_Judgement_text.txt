The case originated in an application (no. 35346/16) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Syrian national, Mr M.K. (“the applicant”), on 21 June 2016. The President of the Section acceded to the applicant’s request not to have his name disclosed (Rule 47 § 4 of the Rules of Court).
The applicant was represented by Ms E. Davidyan and Ms D. Trenina, lawyers practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 10 November 2016 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant, a Syrian national, was born in 1993 and currently resides in Khartoum, Sudan.
On 24 April 2015 the applicant arrived in Russia, being in possession of a study visa. He enrolled in the Izhevsk State Technical University and had his registered residence in the town of Izhevsk. His visa expired on 26 April 2016.
On 4 May 2016 the applicant applied for refugee status alleging the risks to his life and safety in the light of the on-going conflict in Syria. The request and the subsequent appeals were dismissed by the Russian migration authorities and the courts.
On 8 June 2016 the applicant was arrested and put in detention by the migration authorities.
By a judgment of 9 June 2016 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Izhevsk found the applicant in breach of migration rules, an offence under Article 18.8 § 1.1 of the Code of Administrative Offences, and ordered his expulsion. In order to facilitate enforcement, the court ordered that the applicant be placed in detention.
On 10 June 2016 the Supreme Court of the Udmurtiya Republic upheld the lower court’s judgment.
On 22 June 2016 the Court indicated to the respondent Government, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that the applicant should not be extradited, expelled or otherwise involuntarily removed from Russia to Syria for the duration of the proceedings before the Court. Since that date the enforcement of the applicant’s expulsion was monthly postponed by the domestic courts.
On 13 January 2017 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on appeal amended the lower courts’ judgments and excluded administrative removal from the sanction, since it would have exposed the applicant’s life to risk in Syria.
On 20 January 2017 the applicant left Russia for Lebanon.
The relevant domestic law and practice relating to the expulsion and detention of foreign nationals in Russia, refugee status, and temporary asylum, and the situation of Syrian nationals in the country, is summarised in the Court’s leading judgment in the case of L.M. and Others v. Russia (nos. 40081/14 and 2 others, §§ 61–75, 15 October 2015), and in the followup case of S.K. v. Russia (no. 52722/15, §§ 23-41, 14 February 2017).
