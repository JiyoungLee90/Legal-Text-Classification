The case originated in three applications (nos. 7753/13, 75188/13 and 76511/14) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Moldovan nationals, Mr Alexandru Cucu, Mr Eugeniu Tanasiev and Mr Vadim Vladarcic (“the applicants”), on 27 December 2012, 8 November 2013 and 28 November 2014 respectively.
The first two applicants were represented by Mr A. Croitor, a lawyer practising in Chișinău and the third applicant was represented by Mr I. Oancea and Mr G. Malic, lawyers practising in Chișinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr L. Apostol.
On 4 May 2015 the applicants’ complaints concerning Article 5 §§ 1 and 5 of the Convention were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the applications were declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicants were born in 1990, 1988 and 1957, respectively and live in Chișinău.
The first and the second applicants were arrested on 8 and 9 April 2009, as a result of the mass protest which took place in Chișinău after the elections of 5 April 2009. They were placed in detention for ten and seven days respectively. Later the charges against them were dropped.
The third applicant was accused of fraud and placed in detention pending trial between 15 and 18 April 2004 and between 28 July and 3 August 2005, i.e. for nine days. Later the charges against him were dropped. The Government disputed the fact that the third applicant was detained between 28 July and 3 August 2005.
On different dates the applicants brought civil actions under Law No. 1545 (on compensation for damage caused by illegal acts of the criminal investigation bodies, the prosecution authorities or the courts) seeking 115,000 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 6,765 euros (EUR)), MDL 600,000 (the equivalent of EUR 36,700) and MDL 80,000 (the equivalent of EUR 4800), respectively, in compensation for nonpecuniary damage. On 11 December 2013, 3 July 2013 and 28 May 2014 respectively, the Supreme Court of Justice concluded that the applicants’ detentions had been unlawful and in breach of Article 5 of the Convention and awarded them MDL 15,000 (the equivalent of EUR 835), MDL 7,000 (the equivalent to EUR 428) and MDL 6,000 (the equivalent of EUR 317) respectively as compensation for the damage caused. The domestic courts found inter alia that the third applicant had been detained between 15 and 18 April 2004 and between 28 July and 3 August 2005.
In addition, the first and the second applicants were part of a group of persons considered to be victims of the events of April 2009 and were awarded by two Government decisions MDL 10,000 (the equivalent of EUR 625) and MDL 7000 (the equivalent of EUR 444), respectively.
