The case originated in an application (no. 46245/08) against the Republic of Armenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Armenian national, Mr Masis Ayvazyan (“the applicant”), on 12 September 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Shushanyan, a lawyer practising in Yerevan. The Armenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr G. Kostanyan, Representative of the Republic of Armenia to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 27 November 2012 the complaint concerning the alleged unlawfulness of the applicant’s detention between 1 and 13 May 2008, and on 21 February 2017 the complaint concerning the alleged lack of relevant and sufficient reasons for the applicant’s detention, were communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Jrvezh.
On 19 February 2008 a presidential election was held in Armenia, which was followed by daily protest rallies held at Yerevan’s Freedom Square from 20 February onwards by the supporters of the main opposition candidate. On 1 March 2008 the assembly at Freedom Square was dispersed by the police. The applicant, who was present at Freedom Square at that time, was arrested and later charged under Article 316 § 1 of the Criminal Code (CC) with assaulting police officers.
On 4 March 2008 the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention for a period of two months, namely until 1 May 2008, on the ground that the applicant, if at large, might abscond and obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful influence on the persons involved in the criminal proceedings.
On 10 March 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal, arguing that there was no evidence to substantiate the need for his detention. He was a former high-ranking police officer and a law-abiding citizen who enjoyed trust and respect in society.
On 21 March 2008 the Criminal Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that the fact that the applicant was accused of a grave offence punishable by up to ten years’ imprisonment increased the probability of his evading criminal liability and punishment and was sufficient to conclude that the applicant, if at large, might commit a new offence. As to the applicant’s good character, mentioned by him in his appeal, this was not sufficient for lifting the detention order.
On 29 April 2008 the indictment was finalised and the applicant’s case was sent to court for trial. The applicant remained in detention by virtue of Article 138 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP).
On 13 May 2008 the District Court decided to set the case down for trial, ruling in the same decision that the applicant’s detention was to remain unchanged. That decision was not subject to appeal.
On 11 June 2008 the District Court found the applicant guilty under Article 316 § 1 of the CC of assaulting police officers and sentenced him to a suspended term of one and a half years’ imprisonment.
