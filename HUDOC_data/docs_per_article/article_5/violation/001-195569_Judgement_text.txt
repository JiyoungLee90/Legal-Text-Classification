The case originated in eight applications against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). The application numbers and the dates on which they were lodged with the Court as well as the applicants’ personal details are listed in the appended table.
The applicants were represented by various NGOs and lawyers indicated in the appended table. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
Between 7 January 2016 and 31 May 2016 notice of the complaints under Articles 2, 3, 5, and Article 13 in conjunction with these provisions, was given to the Government and the remainder of the applications nos. 31143/11 and 40161/12 was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government did not object to the examination of the applications by a Committee.
The applicants are Russian nationals who at the material time lived in the Chechen Republic and the Republic of Ingushetia, a region neighbouring Chechnya. They are close relatives of individuals who disappeared in these regions in 2000-2005 after allegedly being unlawfully detained by servicemen. In each of the applications the events took place in the areas under full control of the Russian federal forces. The applicants had no news of their missing relatives thereafter.
In each of the cases the applicants complained about the abductions to law-enforcement bodies and an official investigation was instituted. In every case the proceedings, after being suspended and resumed on several occasions, have been pending for several years without attaining any tangible results. It follows from the documents submitted that no active investigative steps have been taken by the authorities other than forwarding formal information requests to their counterparts in various regions of Chechnya and the North Caucasus. Further to such requests, the authorities generally reported that the involvement of servicemen in the abductions had not been established and that no special operations had been carried out at the relevant time. The applicants also lodged requests for information and assistance in the search for their missing relatives to various authorities but received only formal responses, if any. The perpetrators have never been identified by the investigating bodies. It appears that all of the investigations are still pending.
Summaries of the facts in respect of each application are set out below. Each account of events is based on statements provided by the applicants and their relatives and/or neighbours to the Court and the domestic investigating authorities. The Government did not dispute the principal facts of the cases as presented by the applicants, but contested the involvement of servicemen in these events.
The applicant was the father of Mr Said-Magomed Abdulazimov, who was born in 1970. He died on 13 October 2014. The applicant’s son, Mr Sayd-Khasan Dzhamakhadzhiyev, who is also the brother of the missing person Mr SaidMagomed Abdulazimov, expressed his wish to pursue the application.
On 12 May 2002 (in the documents submitted, the date was also referred to as 17 May 2002) a group of armed men in balaclavas and camouflage uniforms opened fire and wounded Mr Abdulazimov on a street in the centre of Chiri-Yurt, Chechnya. While he was unconscious, they put him in a Gazel minivan and drove off to an unknown destination.
The whereabouts of Mr Said-Magomed Abdulazimov have remained unknown ever since.
On 8 June 2002 the applicant complained about the abduction of his son to the deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia (the Russian Parliament). It is unclear whether any reply was given to his complaint.
On 24 July 2002 the applicant lodged an official complaint with the Shali district prosecutor requesting assistance in the search for his son.
On 1 August 2002 the Shali district prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. 59177 under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (abduction).
The investigators sent several requests for information to the lawenforcement authorities. Most responses contained statements that no information about Mr Said-Magomed Abdulazimov was available.
In a letter of 16 August 2002 the Shali district office of the Federal Security Service (“the FSB”) informed the investigators that Mr SaidMagomed Abdulazimov was the emir of Chiri-Yurt who had up to fifteen armed subordinates. Since 2001 he had been involved in planning and carrying out terrorist attacks against the Russian federal forces. Mr Said-Magomed Abdulazimov had a wide network involving leaders of the illegal armed groups and active representatives of Wahhabism. The letter also stated that Mr Abdulazimov carried a Makarov handgun on a permanent basis and was equipped with a grenade belt and a “Kenwood” portable radio set. The Shali district office was undertaking operational search activities aimed at establishing Mr Abdulazimov’s whereabouts.
On 19 September 2002 the applicant was granted victim status and questioned.
On 1 October 2002 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators. The applicant was informed thereof. The investigators’ letter stated that the operational search activities aimed at establishing his son’s whereabouts were being undertaken despite the suspension of the investigation.
On 8 January 2004 the applicant asked the Shali district prosecutor’s office for information about any progress in the investigation.
On 30 January 2004 the investigation was resumed.
On 20 February 2004 the investigators examined the crime scene.
On 25 February 2004 the applicant was questioned again. He stated that Mr Said-Magomed Abdulazimov had participated in the first Chechen war against the Russian federal forces.
On 3 March 2004 the investigation was suspended. The applicant was informed thereof.
The investigation case file contained the death certificate of Mr SaidMagomed Abdulazimov stating that he had died on 27 May 2002.
On 25 November 2009 the applicant requested the Shali inter-district investigation department to grant him full access to the criminal case file and to resume the proceedings. On 26 November 2009 the investigators allowed him to study the case file but refused to resume the investigation.
On 8 November 2010 the deputy head of the Shali inter-district investigation department annulled the decision of 3 March 2004 as unlawful and ordered the resumption of the proceedings. It was stated that on 12 May 2002 Mr Abdulazimov was arrested by unidentified armed men on the street in Chiri-Yurt after an identity check. He offered armed resistance to his arrest and wounded one of the men. They returned fire and wounded Mr Abdulazimov; then they put him in a Gazel minivan and drove off in the direction of Stariye Atagi.
Between 10 and 24 November 2010 the investigators questioned several neighbours and relatives of the applicant.
On 25 November 2010 the investigators ordered a forensic DNA examination.
On 8 December 2010 the investigation was suspended. It was resumed on 18 April 2011 and suspended again on 23 April 2011.
On 26 November 2012 the applicant asked the Shali district interdistrict investigation department for information about any progress in the investigation. On 4 December 2012 the investigators allowed him to study the criminal case file and make copies of the documents.
It appears that the investigation is still pending.
On an unspecified date the applicant challenged the investigators’ decision of 3 March 2004 to suspend the proceedings and their failure to take basic investigative steps before the Shali Town Court. On 19 April 2011 the court dismissed the complaint, having found that a day earlier the investigators had already resumed the proceedings.
The first applicant is the mother of Mr Isa (also spelled as Issa) Tovdayev, who was born in 1984. The second applicant is his brother.
On 29 April 2000 Mr Isa Tovdayev and his friend Mr I.T., who were teenagers at the time, left their homes in Petropavlovskaya village of Grozny District and went to a rubbish dump located on the outskirts of the village. Between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. they were seen near the road leading to the military base of the Russian federal forces in Khankala. At that time a convoy of military vehicles, including an APC (armoured personnel carrier), an URAL lorry and an UAZ van, was driving in the same direction. Mr Tovdayev and Mr I.T. never returned home.
The applicants later learned from unidentified servicemen that Mr Tovdayev had been detained at the main military base of the Russian federal forces in Khankala.
According to the statements of Mr A.T., the father of Mr. I.T., the disappeared teenagers had been transferred from the military base to the detention centre in Chernokozovo, Chechnya. In June 2000 they had been seen in “Beliy Lebed” prison near Pyatigorsk.
The whereabouts of Mr Isa Tovdayev have remained unknown ever since.
Immediately after the disappearance the applicants informed the authorities and requested that an investigation be opened.
On 3 May 2000 the head of the administration of Petropavlovskaya asked the Representative of the President of the Russian Federation in Chechnya to provide assistance in the search for Mr Isa Tovdayev and Mr I.T. He indicated, in particular, the presence of military equipment and personnel on the day of the disappearance.
On 13 June 2000 police officers from the Grozny department of the interior examined the crime scene.
On 16 June 2000 the Grozny department of the interior (police station) refused to institute a criminal investigation into the disappearance. On 12 February 2001 the Chechnya prosecutor’s office overruled that decision and opened criminal case no. 19016 under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (abduction).
On 12 March 2001 the grandfather of Mr Isa Tovdayev, Mr D.M., was granted victim status and questioned. He stated that after the disappearance of his grandson he had visited the military base in Khankala where General P. had informed him that both missing teenagers had been taken to Chernokozovo. Mr D.M. had then visited Chernokozovo, but neither his grandson nor Mr I.T. had been detained there.
On 10 April 2001 Mr A.T. was granted victim status and questioned. He stated that on the next day after the disappearance he had visited the police station in Grozny. Police officers had informed him that when they had passed the outskirts of the village on 29 April 2000, they had seen servicemen driving an APC, URAL lorry and UAZ vehicle. Later Mr A.T. learnt from an acquaintance that his son and Isa Tovdayev had been taken to Khankala on that day and had stayed there for about two hours, and then they had been taken to an unknown place.
On 10 April 2001 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators. The applicants were informed about that decision on 26 March 2002.
On 14 May 2001 the investigation was resumed, and on 14 June 2001 suspended again.

On 25 October 2005 the second applicant was granted victim status in the criminal case.
Between 20 and 26 October 2006 the investigators questioned several witnesses who knew about the abduction mostly from hearsay.
The investigation was resumed and then suspended on a number of occasions. The suspensions took place on 29 October 2005 and 9 October 2009, with the case being resumed on 2 September 2009 and 11 February 2011 accordingly. On 13 March 2011 the investigation was suspended again.
On 13 April 2009 the first applicant asked the head of the Committee for the search for persons who disappeared during the counter-terrorist operation in the Chechen Republic for assistance in the search for Mr Isa Tovdayev. Her request was forwarded to the investigators, who on 4 May 2009 replied that operational search activities were being carried out to establish his whereabouts.
It appears that the investigation is still pending.
On 31 January 2011 the second applicant challenged the investigators’ decision to suspend the proceedings and their failure to take basic investigative steps before the Grozny District Court. On 11 February 2011 the court dismissed the complaint, having found that the investigators had already resumed the proceedings earlier on the same date. On 16 March 2011 the Chechnya Supreme Court upheld that decision on appeal.
The applicants are close relatives of brothers Mr Tapa Tagirov and Mr Apti Tagirov (both also spelled as Tigirov), who were born in 1974 and 1968 respectively. The first applicant was their mother; she died in 2011. The second and the third applicants are their sisters.

On 7 June 2002 around fifteen armed men arrived together with Mr Tapa Tagirov in two white Gazel minibuses without registration numbers at the house where he had lived. Some of them were in civilian clothes; others were wearing camouflage uniforms and balaclavas. The men were of Slavic appearance and spoke unaccented Russian. They did not identify themselves and provided no documents authorising the search. Having searched the premises, the men left together with Mr Tapa Tagirov.
The applicants have not seen their relatives since their disappearance.
On an unspecified date in June 2002, as submitted by the applicants, the first applicant complained of the abduction of her sons to the Ingushetia prosecutor’s office.

On 26 October 2004 the investigators questioned Mr D. and Ms D. who had rented Mr Tapa Tagirov a room in their house from the end of November 2001 until June 2002. He had lived there with his wife and children. Mr D. and Ms D. had learnt about his disappearance from his wife. A few days after the disappearance a group of servicemen had visited them together with Mr Tapa Tagirov. They had arrived in a white Gazel minivan; some of them had been wearing balaclavas and military uniforms. The servicemen had been of Slavic appearance and spoken unaccented Russian. One of the servicemen had told Mr and Ms D. to stay in their room. Through the window Ms D. had seen that the servicemen had searched Mr Tapa Tagirov’s room and had seized some of his belongings.

Грозного) at 2 Pobedy Avenue in the Zavodskoy district of Grozny, when about twenty armed servicemen in black military uniform surrounded him, forced him into an UAZ vehicle with no registration numbers and drove off to an unknown destination.
On 18 August 2005 the applicants’ relative, Mr V.G., went to the Katayama department of the interior (police station) in Staropromyslovskiy district in Grozny. In one of the corridors of the police station he saw Mr Garbulatov sitting on a chair under armed guard. Mr V.G. managed to approach Mr Garbulatov and to have a brief conversation with him. Mr Garbulatov told him that since his arrest on 10 August 2005 he had been detained in the basement of the police station. At that moment a serviceman in a black military uniform approached them, shouted at Mr V.G. for talking to Mr Garbulatov and walked the latter away.

Two and a half months after the disappearance of her husband the head of the police station had asked Mr Garbulatov’s brother-in-law, Mr S.G., to bring his clothes. When the latter had arrived at the police station, a police officer had approached him and had provoked him to a quarrel. Then Mr S.G. had been taken to the premises of the separate reconnaissance battalion 2-ORB (2-ОРБ) where he had spent two days. He had been told to stop searching for Mr Garbulatov.

The applicant is the mother of Mr Khamzat Larsanov (also spelled as Lorsanov), who was born in 1983.
At about 4 a.m. on 11 September 2002 Mr Larsanov, his father, Mr R.L., and his mother − the applicant − were at home at 97 Obukhova Street in Grozny when a group of about fifteen armed servicemen in camouflage uniforms and balaclavas arrived in three UAZ vehicles and three APCs. One of the APCs had a registration number containing the digits “002”. The servicemen spoke unaccented Russian; some of them were equipped with portable radio sets which they used at some point to receive a command. Having forced their way into the applicant’s house, they fired some shots and then searched the premises, asking the family members whether any members of illegal armed groups were hiding in the house. One of the servicemen took off his balaclava. He was of Slavic appearance. After the search, the servicemen forced Mr Larsanov into one of their vehicles and took him away to an unknown destination.
The whereabouts of Mr Khamzat Larsanov have remained unknown ever since. His abduction took place in the presence of several witnesses, including the applicant, her relatives and neighbours.
The criminal case file concerning the abduction of the applicant’s son was lost in unknown circumstances. Following the supervisor’s order to restore it, in 2016 the investigators resumed the proceedings and took several investigative steps. In particular, they questioned the witnesses and examined the crime scene. The following account of events is based on the copies of the original case file and other documents submitted by the applicant as well as the documents from the restored case file submitted by the Government.
Immediately after the abduction, the applicant informed the authorities thereof and requested that criminal proceedings be opened.
On the same day the investigators examined the criminal scene.
On 26 September 2002 the Grozny town prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. 48162 under Article 126 of the Criminal Code.
On 16 October 2002 the case no. 48162 was joined with the case no. 48172 concerning the abduction of Mr I.Yu. under the joint number 48162.
On 26 October 2002 the applicant was granted victim status.
On an unspecified date between October and November 2002 the investigators interviewed the applicant, her husband, their relatives and neighbours. All of them confirmed the circumstances of the abduction as described above.
On 26 November 2002 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators.
Between 2004 and 2007 the applicant complained to various authorities and NGOs about the abduction of her son and requested assistance in the search for him. Her complaints were forwarded to the investigators, who replied that the investigation had been suspended and that operational search activities were in progress.
On 15 March 2007 the investigators informed the applicant that the proceedings in the criminal case had been suspended on 26 November 2002 and that operational search activities were in progress to establish her son’s whereabouts.
On 26 June 2007 a police officer from the Leninskiy district police department interviewed the applicant.
On 27 October 2012 the supervising prosecutor overruled the decision of 26 November 2002 to suspend the investigation and ordered its resumption. On 12 December 2012 the proceedings were suspended again.
On 28 June 2016 the Chechnya Investigations Department ordered the head of the investigative committee in Grozny to restore the criminal case-file no. 48162 which had been lost.
On 30 June 2016 the investigators resumed the proceedings.
On 4 July 2016 the investigators questioned the applicant who reiterated her previous statements.
Between 5 and 7 July 2016 the investigators questioned Ms M.E., Ms M.M., Ms Z.D. and the applicant’s husband who had witnessed the abduction of Mr Khamzat Larsanov. All of them confirmed the circumstances of the abduction as described above.
On 13 July 2016 the investigators examined the crime scene.
It appears that the investigation is still pending.
The applicant is the wife of Mr Isa Gaydakov, who was born in 1959.
Mr Isa Gaydakov was a cousin of Mr Shamil Basayev, the underground leader of the Chechen rebel separatist movement, who masterminded and led a number of guerrilla attacks on Russian security forces and civilians, including the hostage-taking in a school in Beslan in September 2004 (see Tagayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 26562/07 and 6 others, 13 April 2017).
On 23 April 2004 Mr Gaydakov was at the Zhanetta petrol station on Mayakovskogo Street in Grozny, when a group of about seven men in camouflage uniforms forced him out of his Volga car and took him to an unknown destination.
The whereabouts of Mr Isa Gaydakov have remained unknown since the date of his abduction.
According to the applicant, she informed the authorities of the abduction shortly afterwards and requested that criminal proceedings be opened. Despite her requests, the authorities refused to officially register her complaints, thereby impeding the investigation.
On 22 May 2005 a police officer from the Leninskiy district department of the interior (the police station) in Grozny interviewed Mr T.M. and Mr L.D. who had worked at the petrol station at the time of the events in question. Both of them denied that they had any information about the abduction of Mr Gaydakov.
On 7 June 2005 the Leninskiy district prosecutor’s office in Grozny refused to open a criminal case into the abduction.
On 1 August 2005 the supervising prosecutor overruled that decision and opened criminal case no. 40157 (in the documents submitted the number was also referred to as 44064) under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (abduction).
On 23 August 2005 the applicant was granted victim status and questioned.
The investigators sent several requests for information to the lawenforcement authorities about Mr Gaydakov. Most responses contained statements that no information had been available.
On an unspecified date in September 2005 the head of the police station informed the investigators that according to their information Mr Gaydakov had been arrested by the officers of the Security Service of the President of Chechnya (Служба безопасности при Президенте Чеченской Республики) on suspicion of his involvement in the activities of illegal armed groups.
On 1 October 2005 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators. That decision was overruled by the supervising prosecutor on 15 November 2005 and the investigation was resumed. It was again suspended on 15 February 2006. The applicant was informed thereof.
On 10 November 2005 the investigators examined the crime scene.
On 15 November 2005 Mr V.M., the deputy head of the provisional task force of the criminal police department of the Ministry of the Interior in Khankala (КМ ВОГО и П МВД России) informed the investigators that Mr Gaydakov was listed as a participant in illegal armed groups. Their statement contained the description of the circumstances of the abduction of Mr Gaydakov.
On 14 December 2005 the investigators questioned Ms Kh.Kh., who was Mr Gaydakov’s second wife. She stated that he had never been involved in the activities of illegal armed groups and had never had any relations with Shamil Basayev.
On the same date Ms Kh.Kh. was also granted victim status in the criminal case.
On 15 December 2005 the investigators questioned several acquaintances of Mr Gaydakov. Some of them had seen his car several days after the abduction driving in various directions.
On 15 January 2006 the investigators’ supervisor approved the plan of investigative steps and operational measures to be taken in order to establish the circumstances of Mr Gaydakov’s abduction and those responsible for it. One of the hypotheses considered by the investigators was the abduction of Mr Gaydakov by the Chechen law-enforcement officers on account of his kinship with Shamil Basayev.
In March 2006 the applicant informed the investigators that on 1 February 2006 a Russian TV channel had aired a story about her husband and Mr A. who had been sentenced to eleven years’ imprisonment. She requested the investigators to obtain a copy of the television programme broadcast.
On 23 March 2006 the investigators granted the applicant’s request. In reply they received a letter from the TV channel stating that no information about Mr Gaydakov had been given on 1 February 2006.
On 27 March 2006 the investigators sent a request for information to the Federal Penitentiary Service in Sverdlovsk Region asking whether Mr Gaydakov had been detained in the colonies of that region. It is unclear whether they received any reply.
On 22 June 2011 the applicant requested that the investigators resume the proceedings, inform her about progress in the investigation and grant her access to the case file. Her request was granted in part: the investigators gave her permission to consult the contents of the case file and informed her about progress in the case.
On 4 April 2012 the applicant’s representative again requested that the investigators resume the proceedings but to no avail.
It appears that the investigation is still pending.
On 28 May 2012 the applicant challenged the investigators’ decision to suspend the proceedings and their failure to take basic investigative steps before the Leninskiy District Court of Grozny. On 16 July 2012 the court dismissed the complaint as unfounded, having established that all the necessary investigative steps had been taken.
