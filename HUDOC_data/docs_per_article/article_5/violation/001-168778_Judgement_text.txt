The case originated in an application (no. 49689/10) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Minira Rakhimovna Dzhasybayeva (“the applicant”), on 3 August 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr N.V. Levchenko, a lawyer practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 2 June 2014 the complaint concerning the length of pre-trial detention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lived, prior to her arrest, in Moscow.
On 6 June 2008 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of multiple counts of fraud.
On 7 June 2008 the Naberezhnye Chelny Town Court of the Tatarstan Republic remanded her in custody. She remained in custody pending investigation, study of the case file and trial. Referring to the seriousness of the charges, the courts extended her pre-trial detention, stating that she might interfere with the investigation, abscond, reoffend, destroy evidence or threaten witnesses.
On 24 March 2014 the Naberezhnye Chelny Town Court convicted the applicant as charged.
