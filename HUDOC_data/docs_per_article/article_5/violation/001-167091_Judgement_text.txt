The case originated in two applications (nos. 7723/07 and 56124/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals, Mr Yevgeniy Aleksandrovich Semenov and Ms Olga Vladimirovna Bachurina (“the applicants”), on 9 February and 29 November 2007, respectively.
The applicant, Ms Bachurina, was represented by Mr V. Sivchenko, a lawyer practising in Moscow.
