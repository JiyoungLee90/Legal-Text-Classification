The case originated in an application (no. 71660/11) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Vyacheslav Vasylyovych Baryshevskyy (“the applicant”), on 9 November 2011.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr M.A. Tarakhkalo, a lawyer practising in Kyiv. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms N. Sevostianova.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that he had not been provided with adequate medical care in detention, the length of his pre-trial detention was unreasonable, he had no effective procedure by which to challenge the lawfulness of his detention, and that the length of proceedings in his case was unreasonable.
On 4 December 2013 the application was declared partly inadmissible and the above complaints were communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Konotop.
On 8 January 2009 the Konotop Transport Prosecutor’s Office of the Sumy Region instituted proceedings against the applicant, then an officer of the Konotop Transport Police, on suspicion of abuse and exceeding his authority with respect to Mr Z.
On 9 January 2009 the applicant was arrested and taken to the Konotop Temporary Detention Facility (“the ITT”).
On 12 January 2009 the Konotop Court examined the applicant’s complaint against his arrest and the investigator’s request for the applicant’s detention. The court rejected the applicant’s complaint and extended his detention for up to ten days.
On 17 January 2009 the applicant was charged with abuse and exceeding his authority.
On 19 January 2009 the Konotop Court ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention on the grounds that he was accused of a serious offence related to corruption which had become publicly known, that being at large he could evade investigation, continue his criminal activities and influence persons related to the investigation, and that his state of health was compatible with detention.
The same day, the applicant’s lawyer appealed against the above decision.
On 26 January 2009 the applicant was transferred to the Sumy Pre-Trial Detention Centre (“the SIZO”).
On 3 February 2009 the Sumy Regional Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) upheld the decision of 19 January 2009.
On 5 March 2009 the Zarichnyy District Court of Sumy extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention for up to three months. The court noted that the applicant was accused of a serious offence and if released could evade investigation and trial, obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case, influence witnesses and victims. This decision was upheld by the Sumy Regional Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) on 24 March 2009.
On 3 April 2009 the investigator brought additional charges against the applicant for misappropriation of money and documents.
On 7 April 2009 the Zarichnyy District Court of Sumy extended the applicant’s detention for up to four months on the same grounds as in its decision of 5 March 2009. This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 28 April 2009.
