The case originated in an application (no. 46580/08) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Aleksandr Fedorovich Malimonenko (“the applicant”), on 22 July 2008.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr M.O. Tarakhkalo, a lawyer practising in Ukraine. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 30 August 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Kharkiv, Ukraine.
In 1999 he obtained a Russian passport.
On 29 December 2006 the Leninskiy District Court of Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, ordered to arrest and bring the applicant to the court in order to determine the preventive measure during the investigation of his alleged robbery. The applicant’s name was put on the international list of wanted persons.
On 26 September 2007 the applicant was arrested in Moscow. As the applicant was a Russian national, he was released.
On 14 October 2007 the Ukrainian authorities sought the applicant’s extradition from Russia in relation to the criminal proceedings against him.
On 21 December 2007 the Russian Federal Migration Authority concluded that the applicant had fraudulently obtained his Russian passport by falsifying a number of documents. They ordered to seize his passport and put his name on the federal wanted list. The applicant’s subsequent attempts to challenge the Federal Migration Authority’s decision on his Russian passport were unsuccessful.
On 13 May 2008 the applicant was arrested. On 15 May 2008 a prosecutor authorised his detention considering that the decision of 29 December 2006 of the Leninskiy District Court of Dnepropetrovsk had authorised the applicant’s “placement into custody”, as mentioned in Article 61 § 1 of the Minsk Convention.
On 24 June 2008 a district prosecutor decided that the applicant should be “placed in custody” considering that the decision of the Leninskiy District Court of Dnepropetrovsk of 29 December 2006 authorised “placement into custody”, as required under Article 466 § 2 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCrP”).
On several occasions the applicant unsuccessfully complained about his detention to the prosecuting authorities. On 4 September 2008 the Perovskiy District Court of Moscow dismissed the applicant’s complaint considering that his arrest and detention in relation to the Ukrainian extradition request had been and remained lawful. On 24 November 2008 the Moscow City Court upheld this decision of 4 September 2008 concluding that “matters relating to lawfulness and reasons for detention should be raised under another procedure prescribed by law”.
On 3 October 2008 the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office granted the extradition request. On 18 November 2008 the Moscow City Court confirmed the decision of 3 October 2008. On 29 January 2009 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the judgment of 18 November 2008 on appeal.
On 20 May 2009 the applicant was transferred to the Ukrainian authorities in the town of Kharkov. On 26 May 2009 he was transferred to the town of Dnepropetrovsk. On 6 June 2009 a Ukrainian court refused to order the applicant’s detention pending the investigation. The applicant was released.
