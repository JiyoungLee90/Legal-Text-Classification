The case originated in six applications (nos. 29545/06, 15306/07, 30671/07, 31267/07, 21014/08 and 62007/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by six Turkish nationals, Turgay Ulu, Sedat Hayta, Kamil Yaman, Metin Yamalak, Tamer Tuncer and Kamil Görkem, born in 1973, 1973, 1977, 1980, 1971 and 1981 respectively. The dates of introduction of the applications and the names of the applicants’ representatives are indicated in the appended table. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 19 May 2009 the Court decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (former Article 29 § 3).
The applicants are Turkish nationals who were arrested and subsequently detained pending judicial proceedings. They were either released or convicted on various dates, except for the applicant Kamil Yaman (no. 30671/07) who is still in pre-trial detention. The details of the dates of the arrests, the dates of the orders for the applicants’ pretrial detention, the dates of the indictments, the dates of the domestic court decisions, the total periods of pre-trial detention, the total periods of the criminal proceedings where relevant, the dates of release and the grounds for continued detention are set out in the appendix hereto.
