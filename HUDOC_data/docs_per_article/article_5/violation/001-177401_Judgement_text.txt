The case originated in an application (no. 40708/11) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Elvan Bağlar (“the applicant”), on 21 April 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr H. Çalışçı, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 14 March 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant, who was born in 1989, lives in Istanbul.
On 14 January 2009 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation.
On 17 January 2009 the investigating judge at the Istanbul Assize Court, after questioning the applicant, ordered his pre-trial detention.
On 24 June 2009 the Istanbul public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Istanbul Assize Court.
The trial commenced before the Istanbul Assize Court and the first preparatory hearing was held on 4 November 2009.
In the subsequent hearings held between 17 February 2010 and 3 November 2010, the applicant appeared before the court and the judges ordered his continued detention.
The applicant filed an objection against the decision of 3 November 2010. On 29 November 2010 the 12th Chamber of the Istanbul Assize Court dismissed this objection without holding an oral hearing, and based on the public prosecutor’s written opinion, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative.
On 13 February 2013 the applicant was released from detention on remand.
According to the latest information in the case-file, the proceedings against the applicant are still pending before the first-instance court.
A description of the relevant domestic law which was in force at the material time can be found in Altınok v. Turkey (no. 31610/08, §§ 28-32, 29 November 2011).
