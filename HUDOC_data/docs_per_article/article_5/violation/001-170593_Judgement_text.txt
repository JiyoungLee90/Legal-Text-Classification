The case originated in three applications (nos. 18232/11, 42945/11 and 31596/14) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Russian nationals, Mr Florid Railyevich Vakhitov, Mr Maksim Andreyevich Bogdashkin and Mr Karnik Mkrdychevich Aslanyan (“the applicants”), on 25 February 2011, 15 June 2011 and 16 April 2014 respectively.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights. One of the applicants, Mr Aslanyan was represented by Mr A. B. Tolstykh, a lawyer practising in Moscow.
The applicants alleged that after their respective arrests they had not been brought promptly before a judge, in breach of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.
On 26 May 2015 the complaints concerning Article 5 § 3 of the Convention formulated by all applicants, the complaints concerning Article 5 §§ 1, 2 and 4 of the Convention lodged by Mr Bogdashkin and that concerning Article 6 § 2 of the Convention formulated by Mr Aslanyan were communicated to the Government and the remaining parts of the applications were declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The applicant was born in 1986 and is detained in Sterlitamak, Perm region.
On 24 August 2009 the Sovetskiy District Court of Ufa convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment with two years’ probation.
On 2 February 2010 the Supreme Court of the Bashkortostan Republic quashed the applicant’s conviction and remitted the case for fresh examination.
On 19 February 2010 the Sovetskiy District Court scheduled the first hearing for 4 March 2010.
On 26 February 2010 the applicant and his lawyer were sent a notification about the hearing by ordinary letter post. According to the applicant, they never received this letter.
On 4 March 2010, in view of the applicant’s failure to appear before it, the trial court ordered his compulsory attendance.
On 18 March 2010 the trial court sent a letter ordering the applicant’s compulsory attendance the following day to the bailiff service in Tuymazy. This letter was not received by the bailiffs until 20 March 2010.
On 19 March 2010 the trial court noted that the applicant had again failed to appear and decided to remand him in custody in absentia. According to the applicant, he and his lawyer had not been notified about the hearing of 19 March 2010.
On 15 April 2010 the applicant was arrested in Tuymazy. According to him, he was apprehended at his place of work. He was placed in a temporary detention centre in Tuymazynskiy district. Later on the same day, he was transferred to Ufa and the judge of the Sovetskiy District Court was informed accordingly.
On 19 April 2010 the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal against the detention order of 19 March 2010, arguing that neither the applicant nor his lawyer had been apprised of the hearings of 4 and 19 March.
On 28 April 2010 the judge in charge of the applicant’s case decided that the latter should remain in detention. The applicant and his lawyer were neither notified of nor present at this hearing.
On 10 May 2010 the applicant supplemented the appeal lodged against the decision of 19 March 2010.
On 25 May 2010 the applicant was released at the hearing in return for an undertaking not to leave his place of residence.
On an unspecified date the President of the Sovetskiy District Court confirmed in a letter sent to the applicant’s lawyer that the summonses to the hearing of 4 March 2010 had been sent to the applicant and his representative on 26 February 2010 by ordinary post and that the case file did not contain any indication that they had actually been received by them.
On 26 August 2010 the Supreme Court of the Bashkortostan Republic confirmed the decision of 19 March 2010, finding that the applicant had been duly apprised of the hearings of 4 and 19 March 2010 at his place of residence.
On 15 March 2011 the trial court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to four years and six months’ imprisonment. The applicant was remanded in custody immediately in the courtroom.
The applicant was born in 1986 and lives in Krasnokamensk, Krasnoyarsk region.
On 28 September 2010 the justice of the peace of judicial district no. 94 postponed the examination of the applicant’s criminal case to 11 October 2010 in view of his absence from the hearing without explanation. According to the applicant, he had not been informed about the hearing.
On 11 October 2010 the justice of the peace ordered suspension of the proceedings and that a search for the applicant be conducted. He also held that, once arrested, the applicant should be remanded in custody. On the same day, the applicant’s name was placed on the search list.
On 4 March 2011 the applicant was arrested by police and placed in a temporary detention centre in Kuraginskiy district.
On 11 March 2011 the applicant submitted a complaint to the prosecutor of the Krasnoyarsk region about his unlawful detention and the police’s failure to inform him about the reasons for his arrest. He referred in particular to their failure to provide him with a copy of the detention order of 11 October 2010 and stated that at the time of his transfer to Minusinsk, Krasnoyarsk region, on 7 March 2011 he had still not been informed of the reasons for his detention.
On 12 April 2011 the trial court convicted the applicant of attempted murder and sentenced him to one year and nine months’ imprisonment.
The applicant was born in 1973 and was detained in Krasnodar.
On 25 April 2013 the applicant was indicted for murder.
On 30 May 2013 the applicant’s name was placed on the international search list because he had fled from his place of residence.
On 14 May 2013 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Krasnodar issued a detention order in absentia in respect of the applicant.
On 11 July 2013 the applicant was arrested.
On 4 September 2013 the Oktyabrskiy District Court extended the applicant’s detention at a hearing at which the applicant was present. The district court held that the applicant’s guilt was confirmed, both by his own testimonies and by other evidence collected by the investigation.
On an unspecified date the applicant challenged the detention order of 4 September 2013. He referred to Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, arguing that the authorities had failed to bring him before a judge promptly after he was apprehended on 11 July 2013. He also referred to Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, arguing that the wording used in the detention order ran counter to the presumption of innocence.
On 16 October 2013 the Krasnodar Regional Court upheld the aforementioned detention order on appeal. It does not appear that the Regional Court addressed any of the applicant’s arguments.
The Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (CCrP), in force with effect from 1 July 2002, allows a court to take a decision to place an accused in custody in the latter’s absence only if an international warrant for his arrest has been issued (Article 108 § 5). No extension of detention may be ordered by the court in the absence of the accused unless the latter is undergoing forensic psychiatric examination in an inpatient institution or there are other circumstances that make it impossible to bring him to court, the existence of which circumstances must be confirmed by the presentation of the appropriate documentation (Article 109 § 13). Where such circumstances exist, the presence of a defence counsel at the court hearing must be ensured (ibid.).
In its judgment no. 4-P of 22 March 2005, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation pronounced its opinion on the right of defendants to be heard in detention matters during the criminal proceedings and stated as follows:
“3.3. ... Since deprivation of liberty ... is permissible only pursuant to a court decision taken at a hearing ... on condition that the detainee has been provided with an opportunity to submit his arguments to the court, the prohibition on issuing a detention order ... without a hearing shall apply to all court decisions, whether they concern the initial imposition of this preventive measure or its confirmation.”
