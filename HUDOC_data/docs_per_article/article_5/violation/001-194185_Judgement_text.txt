The case originated in an application (no. 32567/11) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Roman Volodymyrovych Akymenko (“the applicant”), on 18 May 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr P.M. Sobyna, a lawyer practising in Okhtyrka. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, most recently Mr I. Lishchyna.
On 3 December 2015 notice of the applicant’s complaint concerning the lawfulness of his detention from 25 April to 25 July 2011 was given to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible, pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Okhtyrka.
On 26 July 2010 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of tax evasion. His pre-trial detention was extended several times. In particular, on 18 February 2011 the Sumy Regional Court of Appeal extended it to nine months (until 25 April 2011).
On 22 April 2011 a judge of the Sumy Regional Court of Appeal ordered another such extension, this time to twelve months (that is to say until 25 July 2011). That ruling was not subject to appeal.
Article 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1960, as worded at the material time (it was repealed on 20 November 2012 with the entry into force of a new Code) limited initial pre-trial detention terms to two months, but provided for the possibility of an extension of a pre-trial detention term: (1)  a total term of up to four months – by a judge of the court that originally remanded the person in question in custody as a preventive measure; (2)  a total term of up to nine months – by a judge of an appellate court; and (3)  a total term of up to eighteen months – by a judge of the Higher Specialised Court for Civil and Criminal Matters.
