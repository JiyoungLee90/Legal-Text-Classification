The case originated in an application (no. 35878/08) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Denis Vladimirovich Panov (“the applicant”), on 29 May 2008.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr E. Markov, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 7 January 2014 the complaint concerning the lack of review of the applicant’s pre-trial detention was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1977 and is currently serving a sentence in a correctional colony in the Tambov Region.
On 17 July 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of robbery. On the following day the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow authorised his detention.
On 6 September 2007 the Taganskiy District Court extended the detention. That detention order was upheld on appeal on 22 October 2007 by the Moscow City Court.
Another extensions of detention followed on 16 October 2007 and 11 December 2007. The applicant appealed against both detention orders.
On 17 January 2008 the applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment. The conviction became final on 19 March 2008.
.  On 2 July 2008, in reply to the applicant’s complaint about the failure to examine his appeal, the City Court informed him that his appeal against the detention order of 16 October 2007 was not received by the City Court. However, by a letter of 22 August 2008 the City Court forwarded the applicant’s appeal statement lodged on 17 October 2007 to the District Court, requiring it to perform procedural steps necessary to initiate the appeal proceedings. The City Court also informed the applicant that his appeal complaint of 17 October 2007 was mistakenly attached to another case-file.
.  No further information on organisation of the appeal hearing against the detention order of 16 October 2007 was provided.
