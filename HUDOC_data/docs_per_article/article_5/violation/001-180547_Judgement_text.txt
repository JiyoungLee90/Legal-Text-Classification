The case originated in an application (no. 46637/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Uzbek national, Mr Igor Aleksandrovich Butorin (“the applicant”), on 28 August 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr I.L. Fedotov and Mrs L.V. Stakhiyeva, lawyers practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 6 April 2011 the applicant’s complaints were communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Belebey, Republic of Bashkortostan.
In October 2007 the applicant and his family moved from Uzbekistan to Russia, apparently for the purpose of obtaining Russian nationality as well as seeking medical treatment for the applicant’s drug addiction.
In December 2007 the Uzbek authorities charged the applicant with large-scale drug-trafficking committed in October 2007 and issued a detention order and an international search warrant.
On 12 July 2008 the applicant was arrested in Moscow and on 14 July 2008 the Dragomilovskiy District Court of Moscow ordered the applicant’s detention pending extradition, without setting any time-limit.
On 9 December 2008 the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office ordered the applicant’s extradition.
On 28 January 2009 the Moscow City Court confirmed the lawfulness of the applicant’s arrest and detention, and upheld the extradition.
In the meantime, on 4 March 2009 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the judgment of 28 January 2009.
On 10 August 2009 the applicant issued an authority form to lawyers to lodge an application with the Court on his behalf.
On 21 August 2009 the extradition order was enforced and the applicant was transferred to Uzbekistan.
On 28 August 2009 the applicant’s lawyers – who were apparently unaware of the extradition − requested an interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court in order to stay the removal. On 1 September 2009 the Court indicated the relevant measure to the Russian Government.
However, after the Russian Government had informed the Court about the extradition on 21 August 2009, the interim measure was lifted on 7 October 2009.
The parties submitted no information on related events in Uzbekistan.
On an unspecified date the applicant joined his family in Russia.
