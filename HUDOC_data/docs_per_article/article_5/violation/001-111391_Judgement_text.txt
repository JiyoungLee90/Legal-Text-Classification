The case originated in an application (no. 29448/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Oleg Mikhaylovich Razhev (“the applicant”), on 24 June 2005.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicant alleged that his pre-trial detention in the period from 4 to 17 March 2005 had not been covered by a valid detention order and that the lawfulness of his detention during that period was not amenable to judicial review.
On 17 November 2009 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Nizhniy Novgorod.
On 3 March 2004 the applicant was detained as a suspect in a criminal case concerning embezzlement, and on 4 March 2004 his pre-trial detention was authorised by a court. On 27 December 2004 the Sormovskiy District Court, Nizhniy Novgorod, extended the term of pre-trial detention until 3 March 2005 (inclusive of the latter date).
On the latter date the period of detention authorised by the court expired, but the applicant remained in detention although no extension of his detention was ordered.
On 9 March 2005 the criminal case file was submitted to the Kanavinskiy District Court of Nizhniy Novgorod.
On 17 March 2005 the Kanavinskiy District Court declined jurisdiction over the criminal case in favour of the Sormovskiy District Court, and decided at the same time to extend the applicant’s detention, placing him “in the charge of the Sormovskiy District Court”. On 24 March 2005 the applicant lodged an appeal against the extension of the detention order. On an unidentified date several days later he lodged a complaint with the Presidium of the ; he expressly complained that he had been detained without any detention order after the expiry of the detention term on 3 March 2005, and claimed that in any event his further detention had ceased to be justified.
On 11 April 2005 the Sormovskiy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 11 May 2005. This decision was upheld by the  on 11 May 2005.
On 22 April 2005 the  examined the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 17 March 2005, by which the applicant’s detention had been extended. It held that the extension had been lawful and justified. The period of detention between 4 and 17 March 2005 was not examined by the appeal court.
On 6 May 2005 the Sormovskiy District Court scheduled a hearing of the applicant’s criminal case and held that “the measure of restraint, namely pre-trial detention, [was] to remain unchanged”. This decision was upheld by the  on 1 June 2005.
On 19 May 2005 the Sormovskiy District Court examined and dismissed the applicant’s application for release. This decision was upheld by the  on 1 June 2005.
On 27 July 2005 the  judge examined and dismissed the applicant’s request for supervisory review of the appeal decision of 22 April 2005. The decision upheld the reasons for the applicant’s further detention, without any mention of the period between 4 and 17 March 2005.
On 9 September 2005 the Sormovskiy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 9 December 2005.
On 6 December 2005 the Sormovskiy District Court convicted the applicant of embezzlement. The applicant’s appeal was dismissed by the  on 4 April 2006. On 3 July 2006 the applicant was released on parole.
On 27 December 2006 the  examined a criminal case in which the applicant was a victim of unauthorised telephone tapping. The court convicted the implicated police officer of abuse of powers and awarded the applicant non-pecuniary damages.
The Code of Criminal Procedure of the , in force from 1 July 2002, provides that from the date the prosecutor forwards the case to the trial court, the defendant’s detention is “before the court” (or “during the trial”). Upon receipt of the case file, the judge must determine, in particular, whether the defendant should remain in custody or be released pending trial (Articles 228 (3) and 231 § 2 (6)).
The term of detention “during the trial” is calculated from the date the court received the file and to the date the judgment is given. The period of detention “during the trial” may not normally exceed six months, but if the case concerns serious or particularly serious criminal offences, the trial court may approve one or more extensions of no longer than three months each (Article 255 §§ 2 and 3).
At any time during the trial the court may order, vary or revoke any preventive measure, including detention (Article 255 § 1). An appeal against such a decision lies to the higher court. It must be lodged within ten days and examined no later than one month after its receipt (Articles 255 § 4 and 374).
On 22 March 2005 the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation adopted Ruling no. 4-P on a complaint lodged by a group of individuals concerning the de facto extension of detention after the transfer of a case file to a trial court by the prosecution. In part 3.2 of the ruling the  held:
“The second part of Article 22 of the Constitution of the  provides that ... detention is permitted only on the basis of a court order ... Consequently, if the term of detention, as defined in the court order, expires, the court must decide on the extension of the detention, otherwise the accused person must be released ...
These rules are common to all stages of criminal proceedings, and also cover the transition from one stage to another. ... The transition of the case to another stage does not automatically put an end to a preventive measure applied at previous stages.”
