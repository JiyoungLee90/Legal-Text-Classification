The case originated in an application (no. 41467/11) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Sergiy Ivanovych Us (“the applicant”), on 24 June 2011.
The applicant was represented by Ms S. Netidova, a lawyer practising in Yuzhnoukrainsk. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention that his detention at the police station between 13 and 14 October 2010 had not been documented.
On 16 April 2018 the Government were given notice of the above complaint, and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible, pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Voznesensk.
According to the applicant, on 13 October 2010 police officers came to his home requesting him to appear at the local police station at 3 p.m. on the same day. Having been escorted to the Voznesensk police station, the applicant was questioned about his relationship with T., whose dead body had been found.
According to the record of his questioning, the applicant was questioned as a witness between 4.25 p.m. and 7.10 p.m. on 13 October 2010. According to the applicant, the police officers handcuffed and ill-treated him in order to pressure him into confessing to the murder of T. Since then the applicant was in uninterrupted detention until his formal arrest on 14 October 2010 (see paragraph 8 below).
On 14 October 2010, after the applicant had confessed to the murder of T., an investigator from the Voznesensk police station formally documented his arrest. According to the arrest record, the process of arresting the applicant took ten minutes – from 3.30 p.m. until 3.40 p.m. on 14 October 2010.
On 15 October 2010 the local court ordered the applicant’s detention on remand as from 14 October 2010, after he was charged with the murder of T. Subsequently, his detention was extended by the court a number of times.
On 22 October 2010 the applicant lodged with the Voznesensk Local Court a complaint regarding the alleged unlawfulness of his detention by the police on 13 October 2010.
On the same day the applicant lodged with the Voznesensk prosecutor’s office a complaint concerning his alleged ill-treatment by the police on 13 October 2010.
In the course of the examination of the applicant’s complaint about his allegedly unlawful detention, the Voznesensk Local Court noted that the applicant had been questioned as a witness at the police station on 13 October 2010 and that he had been arrested on the following day, after confessing to the murder of T. On 8 December 2010 the Voznesensk Local Court dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant’s complaint about his allegedly unlawful detention. On 27 December 2010 the Mykolayiv Regional Court of Appeal, in a final judgment, upheld that decision.
In the course of the examination of the applicant’s ill-treatment complaint, an investigator from the Voznesensk prosecutor’s office interviewed the deputy head of the Voznesensk police station, who stated that in the course of the applicant’s questioning on 13 October 2010 the latter had confessed to the murder of T. The witness also stated that at about 11 p.m. on the same day the applicant had left the police station to go home. On the morning of the following day the applicant had returned to the police station and been formally arrested on suspicion of committing the abovementioned crime.
On 16 November 2011 the investigator from the Voznesensk prosecutor’s office declined to institute criminal proceedings on the basis of the applicant’s ill-treatment complaint on the grounds that there had been no constituent elements of an offence in the actions of the police officers concerned. The wording of that decision contained a reference to the circumstances of the applicant’s presence in the Voznesensk police station on 13 October 2010 and to the confession given by him (see paragraph 13 above).
On 6 June 2014 the Voznesensk Local Court acquitted the applicant of murder. That decision was upheld, following appeals by the prosecutor’s office and the victim’s brother, by the Mykolayiv Regional Court of Appeal and by the Higher Specialised Court for Civil and Criminal Matters on 20 May and 6 June 2015, respectively.
