The case originated in an application (no. 2450/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Aleksey Viktorovich Kondratyev (“the applicant”), on 17 October 2003.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by Ms V. Milinchuk, former Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights, and subsequently by their Representative, Mr G. Matyushkin.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his detention had been excessively long.
On 11 January 2008 the President of the First Section decided to communicate the above complaint to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1977 and is currently serving a prison sentence in .
On 4 November 2000 the town prosecutor authorised the applicant’s placement in custody on the ground that he was suspected of having committed aggravated murder and was liable to abscond and pervert the course of justice.
On 8 November 2000 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody. Shortly afterwards, on 13 November 2000, charges of aggravated murder were brought against him.
In the period from 1 February to 5 October 2001 the regional prosecutor extended the applicant’s detention on six occasions pending investigation, referring to the necessity to undertake various investigation activities and having regard to the gravity of the charges. The applicant’s appeals against the above decisions yielded no result.
On 13 July 2001 the additional charge of firearms trafficking was brought against the applicant.
On 2 November 2001 the regional prosecutor’s office approved the bill of indictment and the case was sent to  for trial.
On 3 December 2001  Regional Court remitted the case for an additional investigation, due to various procedural irregularities of the initial investigation. The court held that the applicant should remain in custody. The court did not indicate either reasons for, or the time-limit of, the extension ordered.
During the additional investigation the applicant’s detention was extended by the regional prosecutor on 14 March 2002 until 13 April 2002, and on 29 March 2002 until 1 July 2002, both times with reference to the gravity of the charges against the applicant, his character and the risk of his absconding and interfering with the investigation. The applicant did not appeal against either of the above decisions.
On 28 June 2002 the regional prosecutor’s office returned the case to  for examination on the merits.
On 27 December 2002  Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention pending trial until 28 March 2003. The decision reads as follows:
“...
On 28 December 2002 the six-month time-limit of the [applicant’s] detention during the trial, established by Article 255 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, expires. However the trial cannot be completed by this date.
In connection with the above, in the absence of information allowing the conclusion that the need for the preventive measure applied to [the applicant] has disappeared or that the grounds for the [applicant’s] detention have changed; regard being had to the fact that [the applicant] is charged with crimes carrying a sentence of over two years’ imprisonment, including especially serious crime connected with encroachment on human life and therefore representing an increased danger to society, and the fact that the nature of the charges gives sufficient grounds to believe that [the applicant] can abscond or otherwise obstruct justice, the court considers it necessary to extend the [applicant’s] detention until the termination of the trial but not exceeding three months.
...”
On 18 March 2003 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the extension order on appeal, finding that it had been lawful and justified.
On 25 March 2003  Regional Court extended the applicant’s and his four co-defendants’ detention until 28 June 2003, repeating the decision of 27 December 2002 verbatim.
The applicant appealed, claiming that the  had no grounds to conclude that he presented a persistent flight risk. Besides, the court did not give any consideration to the fact that the applicant was detained under a prison regime, that he had a permanent residence and employment in Kaluga, that he had participated in prevention of armed conflicts in Chechnya and , and that his mother was seriously ill. On 22 July 2003 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the decision of 25 March 2003 on appeal, relying on the arguments mentioned by the .
On 26 June 2003  Regional Court extended the applicant’s and his four co-defendants’ detention until 28 September 2003. The court reproduced the same reasoning as in the extension orders of 27 December 2002 and 25 March 2003.
On 4 September 2003 the Supreme Court of Russia confirmed the lawfulness of the decision of 26 June 2003 on appeal.
On 27 August 2003  Regional Court extended the applicant’s and his four co-defendants’ detention until 28 December 2003. Besides the reasons indicated in previous extension orders the court referred to the great complexity of the case, in particular to the significant number of witnesses to be called and to the substantial amount of evidence to be examined.
On 30 October 2003 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the decision of 27 August 2003 on appeal, having briefly reproduced the reasoning of the .
On 4 December 2003  Regional Court convicted the applicant of firearms trafficking and aggravated murder and sentenced him to twenty years’ imprisonment.
On 16 June 2004 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the judgment on appeal.
The Russian Constitution of 12 December 1993 establishes that a judicial decision is required before a defendant can be detained or his or her detention extended (Article 22).
Prior to 1 July 2002 detention matters were governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the RSFSR (Law of 27 October 1960, the “CCrP”).
At the material time a decision ordering pre-trial detention could be taken by a prosecutor or a court (Articles 11, 89 and 96 of the CCrP).
Before 14 March 2001, pre-trial detention was authorised if the accused was charged with a criminal offence carrying a sentence of at least one year’s imprisonment (Article 96 of the CCrP). The amendments of 14 March 2001 repealed the provision that permitted defendants to be remanded in custody on the sole ground of the dangerous nature of the criminal offence they had allegedly committed.
After his or her arrest the suspect was placed in custody “pending investigation” for an initial two-month period (Article 97 of the CCrP). Further extensions could be granted by prosecutors at ascending levels of jurisdiction.
Once the investigation had been completed and the defendant had received the charge sheet and finished reading the case file, the file was submitted to a trial court. From that date a defendant’s detention was “before the court” (or “pending trial”). Until 14 March 2001 the Code of Criminal Procedure set no time-limit for detention “pending trial”. On 14 March 2001 a new Article 239-1 was inserted, which established that the period of detention “during trial” could not normally exceed six months from the date the court received the file.
Since 1 July 2002 detention matters have been governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (Law no. 174-FZ of 18 December 2001, “the Code”).
“Preventive measures” or “measures of restraint” (меры пресечения) include an undertaking not to leave a town or region, personal surety, bail and detention (Article 98 of the Code). If necessary, the suspect or accused may be asked to give an undertaking to appear (обязательство о явке) (Article 112 of the Code).
When deciding on a preventive measure, the competent authority is required to consider whether there are “sufficient grounds to believe” that the accused would abscond during the investigation or trial, reoffend or obstruct the establishment of the truth (Article 97 of the Code). It must also take into account the gravity of the charge, information on the accused’s character, his or her profession, age, state of health, family status and other circumstances (Article 99 of the Code).
Detention may be ordered by a court if the charge carries a sentence of at least two years’ imprisonment, provided that a less restrictive preventive measure cannot be applied (Article 108 § 1 of the Code).
After arrest the suspect is placed in custody “during investigation”. The period of detention during the investigation may be extended beyond six months only if the detainee is charged with a serious or particularly serious criminal offence. No extension beyond eighteen months is possible (Article 109 §§ 1-3 of the Code). The period of detention “during investigation” is calculated up to the day when the prosecutor sends the case to the trial court (Article 109 § 9 of the Code).
From the date the prosecutor forwards the case to the trial court, the defendant’s detention is “before the court” (or “during the trial”). The period of detention “during the trial” is calculated up to the date the judgment is given. It may not normally exceed six months, but if the case concerns serious or particularly serious criminal offences, the trial court may approve one or more extensions of no longer than three months each (Article 255 §§ 2 and 3 of the Code).
