The case originated in an application (no. 63038/10) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Nikolay Gennadyevich Rodkin (“the applicant”), on 4 October 2010.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 18 February 2014 the complaint concerning the length of pre-trial detention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1988 and is detained in Saransk.
On 3 August 2009 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of the rape of a girl, who was also a minor.
On 5 August 2009 the Staroshaygovskiy District Court of the Mordovia Republic remanded him in custody. He remained in pre-trial detention pending investigation and trial on the grounds that he was accused of a serious crime, might reoffend, abscond, destroy evidence, threaten witnesses, or interfere with the investigation.
On 24 December 2010 the Supreme Court of the Mordovia Republic found him guilty as charged.
On 4 October 2010 the applicant, acting for himself, submitted his first letter to the Court.
On 4 August and 4 October 2010 he provided two powers of attorney authorising Mr Frimu, one of his cellmates, to represent him before the Court.
