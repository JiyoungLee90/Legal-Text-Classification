The case concerns allegedly excessive length of the applicant’s detention on remand after 23 July 2011.
The applicant was born in 1961 and is detained in Wojkowice Detention Centre
The Government were represented by their Agent, Mrs J. Chrzanowska, and subsequently by Mr J. Sobczak, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 18 January 1999 the applicant was arrested and detained on remand on charges of participating in an organised armed criminal group and of committing numerous violent offences (including two murders) while acting as a member of that group. The trial before the Katowice Regional Court began on 20 February 2001.
On 13 February 2008 the Katowice Regional Court gave judgment in relation to the applicant and thirty-five other accused. The applicant was convicted of participating in an organised armed criminal group, arms trafficking, two counts of murder, three counts of robbery, three counts of attempted robbery, illegal possession of firearms and several other offences. The applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of applying for conditional release after serving thirty years.
On 18 February 2010 the Katowice Court of Appeal partly quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case, particularly in so far as it concerned the applicant.
On 11 February 2011 the Supreme Court dismissed cassation appeals lodged by the applicant and other accused.
Meanwhile, on 25 May 2010 the applicant’s detention on remand was lifted. However, the applicant was at that time serving a prison sentence imposed on him in another set of criminal proceedings, which would continue until 22 July 2011.
On 27 June 2011 the Katowice Regional Court again decided to detain the applicant on remand, in the course of the same set of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 4 above). The court applied the measure owing to the high probability that the applicant had committed the offences with which he was charged and in view of the severity of the maximum sentence provided by law for such offences. The court relied on the evidence which had been gathered so far, particularly witness testimony, including the testimony of a key prosecution witness, known as a “crown witness”.
The court stressed that since the applicant had already been sentenced to life imprisonment, there was an increased risk that he would obstruct the proceedings. It noted that the applicant had a close relationship with his co-accused and some of the witnesses, given that they had all been members of the same organised criminal group. Within the group, the applicant’s role had been maintaining discipline and punishing others for disobedience. Therefore, it could not have been excluded that he might use the same methods in respect of persons involved in the trial.
The court further noted that the applicant had already made attempts to contact and influence one of the witnesses and he had also threatened another witness. Moreover, as it transpired from the evidence collected during the proceedings, the applicant had undertaken preparations in order to murder a person who had been a witness in another case. The court concluded that in view of those facts, none of the other preventive measures could secure the proceedings sufficiently.
Subsequently, the applicant’s detention on remand was extended on several occasions (specifically, in 2012: on 17 January, 21 June, 18 December; in 2013: on 13 June and 10 December; in 2014: on 9 June and 17 December; in 2015: on 11 June and 3 December; in 2016; on 10 May and 12 October).
The trial court continued to rely on the same grounds as in the initial decision. It noted a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences concerned, the maximal severity of the anticipated penalty and the risk of collusion, or the applicant absconding or his committing other serious crimes. The court also stressed that the applicant had tried to illegally contact and influence one of the witnesses and had threatened another witness. Furthermore, the applicant had undertaken preparations to murder a person who was a witness in another case. The court also relied on the fact that the case was very complex, related to a number of accused and concerned numerous charges.
In addition, the trial court stressed in its decisions of 10 December 2013, 9 June 2014 and 17 December 2014 that evidence from the crown witness had not been obtained yet. In its decision of 11 June 2015 the court noted that there had been an interruption in the proceedings caused by the fact that one of the accused had been detained on remand in another criminal case.
The applicant unsuccessfully appealed against at least some of the decisions prolonging his detention on remand (namely the decisions of 17 January and 18 December 2012, 13 June and 10 December 2013, 9 June and 17 December 2014, 11 June and 3 December 2015).
The Katowice Court of Appeal, when examining the applicant’s appeals, agreed with the assessment of the Katowice Regional Court and concluded that such an extension was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings and to prevent the applicant from committing another serious offence.
Between 11 June 2015 and 6 April 2016 the applicant served a prison sentence imposed on him in another set of criminal proceedings.
On 12 October 2016 the Katowice Regional Court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of applying for conditional release after serving thirty years of the sentence.
The applicant appealed and the appeal proceedings are pending before the Katowice Court of Appeal.
From the remittal of the case to the Katowice Regional Court (see paragraphs 6,7 above) to the applicant’s conviction on 12 October 2016 a total of 174 hearings was held. The first hearing was held on 26 May 2011 and subsequent hearings were held at regular intervals. In particular, in 2011 twenty eight hearings were held, in 2012 forty four, in 2013 thirty four, in 2014 twenty six, in 2015 twenty four and in 2016 eighteen. In total, the Katowice Regional Court scheduled 276 hearings out of which 102 were adjourned for various reasons, in particular due to witnesses’ illness, the accused or judges’ illness or justified absence of forensic experts.
During the proceedings the Katowice Regional Court obtained extensive evidence, heard evidence from numerous witnesses including a “crown witness” and obtained forensic reports. At the time of the final judgment the case-file comprised 75 000 pages.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention on remand (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other, socalled “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are set out in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland (no. 31330/02, §§ 2733, 25 April 2006), Celejewski v. Poland (no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 May 2006), and Kauczor v. Poland (no. 45219/06, §§ 26-27, 3 February 2009).
