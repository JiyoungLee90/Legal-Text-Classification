The case originated in an application (no. 48528/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of Uzbekistan, Mr Sergey Valeryevich Yakovenko (“the applicant”), on 10 September 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr I. Fedotov and Ms L. Stakhiyeva, lawyers practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, former Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M.Galperin.
On 3 December 2014 the complaints concerning the applicant’s detention were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1961.
On 10 October 2003 a deputy prosecutor in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, added the applicant’s name to the list of fugitives from justice and issued an arrest warrant on suspicion of human trafficking with the purpose of sexual exploitation.
On 26 February 2009 the applicant was arrested in Russia.
On 28 February 2009 the Pechorskiy District Court in the Pskov Region ordered the applicant’s detention pending extradition, referring to Articles 108 and 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but without setting a time-limit.
On 16 March 2009 the Russian Prosecutor General’s office received a request for the applicant’s extradition from his counterpart in Uzbekistan.
On 15 May 2009 the deputy Russian Prosecutor General ordered the applicant’s extradition to Uzbekistan.
The applicant challenged the extradition order before the Pskov Regional Court. On 26 June 2009 the Regional Court found that the extradition order was lawful. On 17 August 2009 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the decision on appeal.
On 17 October 2009 the applicant was extradited to Uzbekistan.
