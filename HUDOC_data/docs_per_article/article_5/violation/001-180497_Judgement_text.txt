The case originated in an application (no. 3512/11) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Kemal Koçhan (“the applicant”), on 23 November 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr S. Türkdoğru, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 11 September 2012 the complaints concerning the length of applicant’s detention and the effectiveness of the procedure by which the applicant could challenge the lawfulness of his detention were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Istanbul.
On 20 January 2009 the applicant was arrested and taken into custody.
On 22 January 2009 the Edirne Magistrates’ Court placed the applicant in detention on remand on suspicion of forming an organised criminal organisation to commit offences and illegal possession of firearms contrary to Article 13 § 1 of Law no. 6136.
On 3 July 2009 the Edirne public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Edirne Assize Court charging the applicant with membership of an organised criminal organisation as well as fraud and robbery.
On 8 July 2009 the Edirne Assize Court held that it had no jurisdiction and referred the case file to the Istanbul Assize Court. The court also ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention.

The applicant filed an objection against this decision. On 25 May 2010 his objection was dismissed by the 10th Chamber of the Istanbul Assize Court without holding an oral hearing.
By decisions dated 30 June 2010 and 8 July 2010 the 9th Chamber of the Istanbul Assize Court rejected the applicant’s requests for release without holding an oral hearing.
On 30 September 2010 the 9th Chamber of the Istanbul Assize Court held the third hearing in the proceedings and again prolonged the applicant’s detention. The applicant was present at this hearing.
On 11 October 2011 the 9th Chamber of the Istanbul Assize held the seventh hearing in the proceedings and released the applicant from detention on remand.
At the time when he present application was lodged with the Court, the proceedings against the applicant were still pending before the firstinstance court. The parties did not submit any further information concerning the outcome of the proceedings.
