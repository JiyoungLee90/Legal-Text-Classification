The case originated in an application (no. 42921/10) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Vladimir Moscalciuc (“the applicant”), on 15 July 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Babără and Mr V. Nicula, lawyers practising in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Apostol.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his detention on remand had not been based on relevant and sufficient reasons, and that the conditions of his detention had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment, in violation of Article 5 § 3 and Article 3 of the Convention respectively.
On 13 November 2012 notice of the complaints was given to the Government.
On 19 March 2019 the Court declared the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1967 and is detained in Chişinău.
In 2003 the applicant received a criminal sentence for theft and was imprisoned. On 10 February 2010 an application which he had made for an amnesty law to be applied was allowed, and he was released.
Immediately after exiting the court room following his release, the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having created an organised criminal group consisting of detainees in various prisons of the Republic of Moldova for the purpose of obtaining money from other detainees and creating a power system parallel to the prison administration.
On 12 February 2010 the Rîșcani District Court ordered that the applicant be detained for thirty days pending trial, accepting the prosecutor’s arguments that the applicant could abscond and attempt to influence witnesses and victims, and that there was a need to protect public order. That decision was confirmed by the Chișinău Court of Appeal on 18 February 2010.
The applicant’s detention was extended by the Rîșcani District Court on 10 March, 9 April, 10 May, 10 June and 6 July 2010. Each time, his detention was extended by thirty days. Those decisions were confirmed by the Chișinău Court of Appeal on 30 March, 20 April, 21 May and 18 June 2010. On 6 August 2010 the Chișinău Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention pending trial by another ninety days. The same court ordered further ninety-day extensions on 1 November 2010, as well as on 3 February, 21 April, 6 July and 26 October 2011. The grounds for extending the applicant’s detention were always the same as those set out in the initial decision of 12 February 2010. Each of those decisions was upheld by a higher court and the applicant’s pre-trial detention ended on 27 February 2012, when he was found guilty as charged and convicted.
The relevant domestic law concerning detention on remand has been set out in the Court’s judgment in Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova [GC] (no. 23755/07, §§ 42-43, ECHR 2016 (extracts)).
Article 25 of the Constitution, in its relevant parts, reads as follows:
“(4)  Detention on remand takes place on the basis of a warrant issued by a judge for a maximum period of 30 days. The lawfulness of the detention warrant may be challenged, in accordance with the law, before a hierarchically superior court. The period of detention on remand may be extended only by a court, in accordance with the law, up to a maximum period of twelve months.”
