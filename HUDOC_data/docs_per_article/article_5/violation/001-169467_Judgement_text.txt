The case originated in an application (no. 11214/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Petr Bogdanovich Boychuk (“the applicant”), on 12 February 2007.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 2 December 2014 the complaint concerning the allegedly unlawful period of the applicant’s detention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.
On 29 April 2006 the applicant was remanded in custody on suspicion of robbery. On 18 July 2006 the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Town Court extended the applicant’s detention until 27 August 2006.
On 15 August 2006 the Town Court fixed the date of the first trial hearing and held that the applicant should remain in custody. It did not cite any grounds for continued detention or set a time-limit for it. On 4 October 2006 the Sakhalin Regional Court rejected an appeal against that decision.
On 10 October 2006 the Town Court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment. On 28 February 2007 the Regional Court upheld the conviction.
