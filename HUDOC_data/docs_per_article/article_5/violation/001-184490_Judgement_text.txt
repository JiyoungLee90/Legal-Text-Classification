The case originated in an application (no. 4728/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hasan Özcan (“the applicant”), on 12 January 2007.
The applicant was represented by Mr F.N. Ertekin, Mr K. Öztürk, and Ms. F. Kılıçgün, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 6 November 2009 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a committee. After having considered the objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant, who was born in 1968, was detained at the Tekirdağ Prison at the time when the application was lodged.
On 16 November 2005 the applicant was taken into custody.
On 19 November 2005 the investigating judge ordered the applicant’s detention on remand.
On 22 November 2005 the applicant’s lawyer lodged an objection against the detention order and requested his release. On 24 November 2005 the Istanbul Assize Court dismissed the objection, on the basis of the case file, without holding a hearing.
Between 19 December 2005 and 6 October 2006, the applicant’s pretrial detention was extended at regular intervals in view of the nature of the offence and the state of the evidence, through examinations held by the Istanbul Assize Court ex proprio motu on the basis of the case file.
On 15 November 2006 the applicant’s lawyer filed an objection against the applicant’s continued pre-trial detention. On 20 November 2006 the objection was dismissed by the Istanbul Assize Court without holding a hearing. On 7 December 2006 the applicant’s lawyer filed a further objection and requested the court to hold a public hearing before deciding on the applicant’s continued detention. On 8 December 2006 the Istanbul Assize Court dismissed the objection without holding a hearing.
On 18 January 2007 the public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Istanbul Assize Court charging the applicant with attempting to undermine the constitutional order, an offence proscribed by Article 146 § 1 of the former Criminal Code.
On 21 March 2007 the Istanbul Assize Court held its first hearing, at the end of which it ordered the applicant’s continued detention. During the subsequent hearings, the court rejected the applicant’s requests for release.
On 4 May 2011 the Istanbul Assize Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to eighteen years and nine months’ imprisonment.
On 25 September 2012 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 4 May 2011.
