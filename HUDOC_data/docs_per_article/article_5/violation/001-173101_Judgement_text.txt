The case originated in an application (no. 24157/11) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Belarusian national, Mr Denis Aleksandrovich Solovey (“the applicant”), on 18 April 2011.
The applicant was represented by Ms N. Yermolayeva, a lawyer practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 30 August 2016 the complaint concerning the belated examination of the applicant’s statements of appeal against two detention orders was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1982 and was detained in Moscow until his extradition to Belarus.
On 10 September 2010 the applicant was arrested in Moscow pursuant to an extradition request from the Belarus authorities. On the following day the Dorogomilovskiy District Court of Moscow ordered his detention.
The applicant’s detention was subsequently extended by judicial orders on several occasions, in particular, on 28 February and 2 June 2011. Both the applicant and his lawyer lodged their statements of appeal against these detention orders with the Moscow City Court, which upheld them on appeal on 11 April and 18 July 2011, respectively.
