The case originated in an application (no. 50473/11) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Iurie Pașa (“the applicant”), on 1 August 2011.
The applicant was represented by Ms A. Procopciuc, a lawyer practising in Bălți. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr L. Apostol.
The applicant complained in particular that his rights guaranteed by Article 5 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention had been breached.
On 22 May 2013 the complaints concerning Article 5 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Bălți.
On 5 February 2011 at 1.30 p.m. the applicant was arrested on suspicion of trafficking in human beings and placed in detention for a period of seventy-two hours, which is the maximum duration of detention under the Moldovan law before a detainee is brought before a judge.
On 8 February 2011 at 10.20 a.m. the prosecutor applied to a judge for the applicant’s remand in custody and at 2 p.m. the applicant was brought before a judge, who ordered his remand in custody for thirty days. It is not clear at what time the decision was adopted, but there is a handwritten note on it which states it had been presented to the applicant at 3.50 p.m., followed by the applicant’s signature.
The applicant appealed against the above decision and argued, inter alia, that the detention which had taken place before the court’s decision of 8 February 2011 had been longer than seventy-two hours, which was the maximum duration provided for by law. He also submitted that he had not been given access to the materials in the case-file relied upon by the prosecutor when requesting his remand in custody.
On 17 February 2011 the Bălți Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The court did not pay attention to the applicant’s allegation that he had no access to the materials in the case-file.
On 5 March 2011 the prosecutor in charge of the case applied to a judge for a prolongation of the applicant’s detention for another thirty days. A judge examined and upheld it on the same date. He ordered the applicant’s detention until 6 March 2011.
On an unspecified date, the same judge issued a new decision rectifying the date of the validity of the applicant’s order for remand in custody from 6 March to 6 April 2011. The applicant appealed.
On 16 March 2011 the Bălți Court of Appeal upheld the applicant’s appeal and quashed the decision of the lower court, after having found that the second decision modifying the date from 6 March to 6 April 2011 had not been taken in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court found therefore that the applicant’s detention had been unlawful since 6 March and ordered his immediate release.
It appears from the materials contained in the case file that the applicant has been convicted at first instance and that the proceedings are still pending before the Bălți Court of Appeal. According to the information provided by the parties, the applicant is currently wanted by the authorities.
The relevant domestic law has been set out in Ignatenco v. Moldova, no. 36988/07, § 54, 8 February 2011.
The relevant provisions of Law no. 1545 (1998) on compensation for damage caused by illegal acts by the criminal investigation authorities, prosecution and courts have been set out in this Court’s judgment in Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, § 54, 4 October 2005.
