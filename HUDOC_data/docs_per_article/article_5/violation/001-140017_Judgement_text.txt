The case originated in seven applications (see details in Appendix I) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Russian nationals (“the applicants”), on the dates indicated below in Appendix I.
The applicants were represented before the Court by Mr D. Itslayev, a lawyer practising in Grozny, lawyers from the NGO Stichting Russian Justice Initiative (in partnership with NGO Astreya), and lawyers from the NGO Materi Chechni. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants alleged that on various dates between 2001 and 2005 their fourteen relatives had been abducted by State servicemen in Chechnya and that no effective investigation of the matter had taken place.
On 21 October 2011 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants are Russian nationals who live in various districts of the Chechen Republic. They are close relatives of persons who disappeared after allegedly being arrested at home by servicemen. In each of the applications the events took place in areas under the full control of the Russian federal forces.  The alleged abductions were primarily carried out during curfew hours, at night or early in the morning. In some of the cases the applicants submitted that at the material time a special operation was being conducted by Russian servicemen in the area, which was subsequently confirmed by the investigation.
The applicants complained to law-enforcement bodies, and official investigations were opened. The proceedings were repeatedly suspended and resumed, and have remained pending for several years without achieving any tangible results. The investigations consisted mainly of the authorities making requests for information and formal requests to their counterparts in various parts of Chechnya and other regions of the North Caucasus to carry out operational search measures. The requests received negative responses or no replies at all.
From the documents submitted it appears that the relevant State authorities were unable to identify the State servicemen allegedly involved in the arrests or abductions.
In their observations the Government did not challenge the allegations as presented by the applicants. At the same time, they stated that there was no evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that State agents had been involved in the abductions.
Below are the summaries of the facts relevant to each individual complaint. The personal data of the applicants and their disappeared relatives, and some other key facts, are summarised in the attached table (Appendix I).
The applicant, Mr Pakhrudin (also spelt as Pakhruddin and Bakhrudin) Akhmatov, was born in 1950 and lives in Noybera (in the documents submitted also referred to as Melchikhi and Nizhniy Noyber), Gudermes district, in the Chechen Republic. He is represented before the Court by Mr D. Itslayev.
The applicant is the father of Mr Lom-Ali Akhmatov, who was born in 1978.
Between 1 and 5 January 2005 the applicant’s son Lom-Ali Akhmatov was celebrating his wedding and staying at the applicant’s house.
At around 4 p.m. on 6 January 2005 three armed men in military uniforms arrived at the applicant’s house in a silver VAZ-21099 car without official registration numbers, and asked to speak to Lom-Ali outside. Once in the street they put him in their car and drove away towards Gudermes. The abduction took place in the presence of the applicant’s fellow villagers.
The applicant has not seen Mr Lom-Ali Akhmatov since 6 January 2005.
On 8 January 2005 the applicant complained to the Gudermes district prosecutor’s office (the investigators) and the Gudermes district department of the interior (the ROVD) that his son had been arrested by unidentified military men who had arrived in a civilian VAZ-2199 car without registration numbers.
On 5 March 2005 the Gudermes ROVD informed the investigators that the abduction of the applicant’s son had been perpetrated under the pretext of an “informal inquiry” by the police and that it could have been connected to the arrest of Lom-Ali’s acquaintance who was a member of an illegal armed group, Mr U.-M. D.
On 15 March 2005 the applicant wrote to the the prosecutor’s office asking for a criminal case not to be opened as his son Lom-Ali “has not been abducted”.
On the same date the prosecutor’s office refused to initiate a criminal investigation.
On 12 August 2005 the applicant stated to the investigators from the prosecutor’s office that his son had indeed been abducted in January 2005 and that he had written the request of 15 March 2005 asking for a criminal case not to be opened while under pressure from officers of the Gudermes ROVD. The applicant insisted that the prosecutor’s office must investigate his son’s abduction and open a criminal case in connection with it.
On 26 September 2005 the Gudermes district interim prosecutor overruled the refusal to open a criminal case. On the same date an investigation of the abduction (in the documents submitted it was also described as the murder) of the applicant’s son was initiated and the criminal case file was given the number 45107.
On 13 December 2005 the investigators examined the crime scene.
On 26 December 2005 the investigation was suspended for failure to establish the identity of the culprits. The applicant was informed thereof on 9 November 2007 when he enquired on 8 November 2007 about the progress of the investigation.
On 17 February 2010 the investigation was resumed and the investigators were instructed, amongst other things, to question a number of witnesses.
On 1 May 2010 the investigation was suspended again. The applicant was informed thereof.
From the documents submitted it appears that on an unidentified date in the spring of 2010 the applicant complained to a local court that the investigation was ineffective. On 5 May 2010 the domestic court examined the complaint. The outcome of the examination is unknown.
On 23 January 2012 the investigation was resumed again.
The proceedings are currently pending.
On 12 October 2005 the applicant was granted victim status and questioned. He described the circumstances of the abduction and provided names of witnesses to the abduction, Mr I.A. and Mr I.V.
On 6 or 8 December 2005 the investigators questioned the applicant’s neighbour Mr V.A., who stated that before the abduction the abductors had pulled over at his house and inquired about Lom-Ali. They had said that they were from Tsentoroy, Chechnya.
On 13 December 2005 and 6 January 2006 the investigators questioned Mr I.A., who described the circumstances of the abduction.

Early in the morning of 16 July 2003 about 100 military servicemen conducted a sweeping operation in Chernorechye, in the Zavodskoy district of Grozny. They cordoned off the area between Pyatigorskaya and Vyborgskaya Streets with armoured personnel carriers (APCs), Ural lorries and UAZ cars. The servicemen randomly broke into blocks of flats situated in the area, searched them and checked the residents’ identity documents. During the check they fired weapons and detonated explosives.
At the relevant time Mr Rustam Shakhgareyev, Mr Zelimkhan Kagirov and their respective families, including the first, second, and seventh applicants were living in two separate flats in the area. Mr Zelimkhan Latayev and Mr Khavazhi Aliyev were staying at a flat also situated in the neighbourhood.
Between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. on 16 July 2003 groups of up to ten servicemen in camouflage uniforms armed with machine guns broke into Mr Rustam Shakhgareyev’s and Mr Zelimkhan Kagirov’s flats. Some of the servicemen were not wearing masks and were of Slavic appearance. After brief questioning and a search of the premises the servicemen took the two men outside, put them in their vehicles, whose registration numbers were obscured, and drove away. The servicemen told the second applicant to look for his brother Rustam at the Ministry of the Interior.
Meanwhile, Mr Zelimkhan Latayev and Mr Khavazhi Aliyev noticed that their building was surrounded by servicemen and tried to escape through the window. However, once in the street they were arrested by the servicemen, who drove them away.
According to the applicants, ten other residents were arrested by the servicemen on the same day. A convoy of several vehicles freely passed through checkpoint no. 4 situated on an exit road from Chernorechye.
The applicants have not seen their four relatives since 16 July 2003.
On 16 and 17 July 2003 the applicants and other relatives of Zelimkhan Kagirov, Rustam Shakhgareyev and Zelimkhan Latayev complained to the law-enforcement authorities about the abduction. On the same day, 16 July 2003, officers of the Zavodskoy district prosecutor’s office and the Zavodskoy ROVD visited the applicants. The officers questioned them and their neighbours, examined the crime scene and collected a number of spent cartridges and explosives.

Subsequently, on 13 March 2005 the three criminal cases were joined under the number 30125.
On 30 July 2003 the first applicant was granted victim status.
On 4 October 2003 the Chechnya FSB informed the investigators that their servicemen had not arrested Mr Shakhgareyev and that they did not suspect him of criminal activities. On 31 December 2003, 30 June 2005 and 16 May 2006 the military prosecutor’s office of the United Group Alignment (the UGA), in interviews with the investigators, denied any involvement of their servicemen in the abduction.
On 22 December 2005 the investigators ordered a ballistic expert evaluation of a bullet cartridge found at the crime scene. According to the expert’s report, the latter belonged to a special kind of bullet used for a certain type of sniper rifle.

On 9 September 2008 the investigators ordered an expert assessment of the remains of the explosive device found at the crime scene. According to the expert’s report, the device was part of a tear gas grenade.
On 15 September and 6 November 2008 the Grozny Zavodskoy District Court dismissed the applicants’ complaints concerning ineffective investigation of the abductions as premature and unsubstantiated.
The investigation has been suspended and resumed on several occasions since. For instance, it was resumed on 30 November 2011 and then suspended again on 30 December 2011.

A group of at least fifteen masked men in camouflage uniforms carrying shields and machine guns got out of the vehicles. Some of them cordoned off the house, while the others entered into the building. After searching the premises, the servicemen took Rizvan and Bislan outside and pushed them to the ground. They told the applicants in unaccented Russian that they would check whether the two brothers were involved in illegal activities and, if not, would release them.
The men were shown a certificate issued by the Shali district prosecutor’s office to the effect that on 7 February 2002 the brothers had already been arrested by Shali law-enforcement officers during an identity check and subsequently released when the brothers’ involvement in illegal armed groups could not be confirmed; however, the servicemen took no notice of the certificate.
Then the men put Rizvan and Bislan in the APC and drove away.
The applicants have not seen Rizvan and Bislan Musliyev since 8 June 2002.
On 14 June 2002 the Shali district prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. 59123.
From the documents submitted it appears that on a number of occasions the applicants complained to various State authorities about their relatives’ abduction and requested assistance in their search. For instance, in August 2004, March 2008 and June and September 2009 they forwarded complaints to various law-enforcement agencies, alleging that Rizvan and Bislan Musliyev had been unlawfully “detained”, and requested the authorities to investigate the matter. In response to their complaints they were informed that an investigation of the abduction was in progress.
On 30 May 2008 the UGA military prosecutor’s office replied to the investigators that their servicemen and/or special services had not conducted special operations in the area, nor had they arrested the applicants’ relatives.
On 17 May 2010 (in the documents submitted the date was also referred to as 5 May 2006) the first applicant was granted victim status.
On 20 May 2010 the investigators examined the crime scene.
The investigation has been suspended and resumed on several occasions. In particular, it remained suspended between August 2002 and April 2006 and between May 2006 and May 2010. On 26 September 2009 the Shali district prosecutor criticised the progress of the proceedings, indicating that the investigative measures were inadequate. As a result, the investigation was resumed on 11 May 2010 but further suspended on 11 June 2010.
On 21 December 2010 the Shali District Court dismissed as unsubstantiated the first applicant’s complaint that the investigation was ineffective.
The criminal proceedings are still pending.
On 17 June 2002 the investigators questioned the first applicant, who provided a detailed description of the events, described the abductors’ appearance, and stated that her sons had been taken away in an APC with the hull number 023.
On 18 June 2002 the investigators questioned the third applicant, who stated that her brothers had been abducted by the same servicemen who had previously arrested and detained them in February 2002. She provided a detailed description of the events and of the abductors’ appearance and their uniforms.
On 19 June 2002 the investigators questioned the father of Rizvan and Bislan Musliyev, Mr M. M., who stated that in February 2002 his sons had been taken from their home by law-enforcement officers to the temporary detention unit (the IVS) of the Shali ROVD. During their ten-day detention there his sons were repeatedly questioned. On 8 June 2002 his sons had been abducted by the same police officers from the Shali ROVD who had arrived in APC no. 023. The witness provided a detailed description of the officer in charge of the abductors, who had not been wearing a mask.
On 5 May 2006 the investigators questioned the wife of Bilan Musliyev, Ms R. P., whose statement concerning the abduction was similar to those given by the first and third applicants.
On 5 May 2006 the investigators again questioned the first applicant, who stated that her sons Rizvan and Bislan Musliyev had been abducted by servicemen who had arrived in APC no. 023; she provided a detailed description of the perpetrators.
On 13 May 2010 the investigators questioned the applicants’ neighbour Ms S. K., who stated that in 2002 she had witnessed Rizvan and Bislan Musliyev’s abduction by servicemen who had arrived in an APC.
On 17 May 2010 the investigators again questioned the first applicant, who stated that her sons Rizvan and Bislan Musliyev had been abducted by servicemen during an identity check and taken away in an APC with the number 023. She provided a detailed description of the appearance of the servicemen who had arrested her sons, and stated that in spite of the passage of time she would be able to identify them.
On 20 May 2010 the investigators questioned the aunt of Rizvan and Bislan Musliyev, Ms T. M., whose statement concerning the abduction was similar to the one given by the first applicant.
On various dates in May and June 2010 the investigators questioned several of the applicants’ neighbours, all of whom stated that they had not witnessed the abduction and had learned about it from the applicants. During the same period of time the investigators also questioned several police officers who had served at the Shali ROVD at the material time, but none of them could recall any pertinent information, owing to the passage of time since the abduction.
The applicants are:
(1) Ms Malika Dokuyeva, born in 1953;
(2) Ms Birlant Dokuyeva, born in 1975;
(3) Ms Baret Dokuyeva, born in 1977.
The first and third applicants live in Serzhen-Yurt, Shali District, and the second applicant in Grozny, Chechnya. The applicants are represented before the Court by lawyers from Materi Chechni.
The first applicant is the wife of Mr Uvays Dokuyev, who was born in 1950; the second and third applicants are his daughters.
At about 4 a.m. on 11 August 2002 a group of about thirty masked men in camouflage uniforms armed with machine guns broke into the applicants’ house in the Avtury settlement, Shali District. They arrived in two grey APCs and a UAZ vehicle without registration plates. The men threatened the applicants with firearms and took Uvays Dokuyev away. They told the applicants that they intended to check his identity through a computerised database at the Shali district military commander’s office. The men stopped the applicants from following them by throwing smoke grenades.
The Shali district military commander’s office denied to the applicants that Uvays had ever been brought there.
The applicants have not seen Uvays Dokuyev since 11 August 2002.
On 19 August 2002 the Shali district prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. 59210.
On 23 August 2002 the first applicant was granted victim status.
On 12 July 2005 the Shali ROVD replied to the applicants that the investigation was in progress.
On 29 March 2006 the military prosecutor’s office of the UGA replied to the applicants that their servicemen’s involvement in the abduction could not be confirmed.
On 26 March 2009 the investigators examined the crime scene.
The investigation has been suspended and resumed on several occasions. The last suspension took place on 10 April 2009. The applicants were not duly informed of these procedural decisions.
On an unspecified date in 2010 the first applicant complained to the Shali District Court that the investigation was ineffective. This complaint was dismissed on 17 December 2010 as unsubstantiated.
The criminal proceedings are still pending.
On 19 August 2002 and then on 10 February 2007 the investigators questioned the applicants’ relative, Mr L.-A.-D., who provided a detailed description of the events and stated that the abductors had arrived in APCs and checked the identity documents of the family members.
On 21 August 2002, 8 February 2007 and 3 April 2009 the investigators questioned the first applicant, who stated that her husband had been taken away by armed men in camouflage uniforms who had checked his identity documents and then taken him away “to run a computer check of his passport”.
On 16 and 19 March 2009 the investigators questioned police officers Mr R.S. and Mr S.A., both of whom stated that they did not recall the circumstances of the events and therefore they had no pertinent information.
