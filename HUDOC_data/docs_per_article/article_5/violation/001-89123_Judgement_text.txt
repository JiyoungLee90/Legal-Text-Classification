On 30 June 1998 the Poznań Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) extended the applicant’s detention until 7 October 1998. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged.

On 29 September 1998 the Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until 7 January 1999.
On 6 January, 29 July and 13 December 1999 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) extended the applicant’s detention. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question. It also had regard to the nature of the charges against the applicant and their number.

On 17 March 2000 the Supreme Court extended the applicant’s detention until 30 September 2000. It held that it was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings and to prevent the applicant from obstructing them.

Thus, he had impeded the conduct of the investigation.
On 21 April 2000 the Regional Court informed the applicant, who was suspected of having contracted tuberculosis, that if he continued to refuse to undergo medical tests with a view to determining whether he could participate in the trial without posing an epidemiological danger to other persons, the court would conduct the trial in his absence.

On 18 September 2001 the Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until 30 March 2002. The decision was upheld on appeal.
On 29 January 2002 the  refused an application by the applicant for his release. It found that for many months he had hindered the conduct of the proceedings and attempted to compel the court to release him. It further noted that the applicant had persistently refused to undergo medical tests, and that his only aim had been to use the state of his health as an argument militating in favour of his release.
On 14 February 2002 the  resumed the proceedings. That decision was upheld on appeal on 14 March 2002.
On 20 March 2002 the Court of Appeal ordered that the applicant be kept in detention until 30 September 2002, invoking the grounds given in the previous decisions. On 28 May 2002 the  refused an application by the applicant for his release.
The  held hearings on 17 and 19 June 2002. On the former date it decided to conduct the trial in the applicant’s absence. It found that the applicant’s obstructive behaviour was the main obstacle to the conduct of the proceedings.

Further hearings were held on 28 June, 9 July, 2 August, 2 September, 7 and 23 October, 14 and 22 November, 5 and 16 December 2002. They took place in the applicant’s absence given that he had continuously refused to undergo medical tests. On 19 August 2002 the  informed the applicant that he could participate in the trial if he agreed to undergo medical tests and if their results showed that he did not pose a health risk to others.
On 19 September 2002 the Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until 30 December 2002, finding that the grounds previously given remained valid.

On 16 June 2002 the Nakło nad Notecią District Prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings, finding that no offence had been committed.

It further found that any disciplinary measure taken against the applicant had resulted from breaches of the relevant prison rules. The applicant appealed.
On 9 December 2002 the Nakło nad Notecią District Court upheld the contested decision. It held that the actions of the prison staff had been motivated by the applicant’s illness and his refusal to undergo medical treatment, and could not be considered as ill-treatment.
