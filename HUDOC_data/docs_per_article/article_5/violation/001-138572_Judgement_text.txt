The case originated in an application (no. 20403/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Viktor Mikhaylovich Tarakanov (“the applicant”), on 16 May 2005.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his detention from 18 to 19 August 2004 had been unlawful and that he had had no effective remedy against that violation of the Convention.
On 26 April 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1974 and is serving a prison sentence in the town of Rubtsovsk (Altay Region).
On 10 February 2003 the applicant was detained on suspicion of theft.
On 12 February 2003 the Altayskiy District Court of the Khakasiya Republic (“the District Court”) remanded the applicant in custody pending investigation. The applicant remained in custody after the start of the trial. The applicant’s detention pending trial was due to expire on 17 December 2003.
On 10 December 2003 the District Court extended the applicant’s detention “for three months, until 17 March 2004”.
On 28 January 2004 the District Court convicted the applicant of theft, and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. The District Court stated in the operative part of its judgment that the applicant should remain in custody until the judgment became final. The applicant appealed against the judgment.
On 30 June 2004 the Khakasiya Supreme Court quashed the judgment of 28 January 2004 and remitted the case to the first-instance court for a fresh examination. It left the preventive measure unchanged, stating that there were “no reasons to release [the applicant]”. The Supreme Court did not specify the time-limit for the applicant’s detention. The detention order was based on Article 388 § 1 (8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
On 13 July 2004 the District Court received the applicant’s case for re-examination.
On 3 August 2004 the District Court set a date for a hearing and ordered that the preventive measure in respect of the applicant should remain unchanged. The detention order was based on Article 231 § 2 (6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure The detention order neither specified the period of the applicant’s detention nor gave any reasons therefor. The applicant did not appeal against that detention order.
On 12 August 2004 the applicant lodged an application for release. On the same day the District Court rejected it. The applicant appealed.  By a letter of 19 August 2004 the Khakasiya Supreme Court informed the applicant that his appeal against the decision of 12 August 2004 had been struck off the list, since the above-mentioned decision was not amenable to judicial review.
On 19 August 2004 the District Court extended the applicant’s detention from 19 August to 19 October 2004 and noted as follows:
“On 12 February 2003 [the applicant] was remanded in custody. On 17 March 2003 [his] criminal case was submitted to the court for trial. On 17 September 2003 his detention was extended for three months, until 17 December 2003. On the latter date [sic] his detention was extended until 17 March 2004. On 28 January 2004 [the applicant] was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. On 30 June 2004 the [conviction] judgment was quashed on appeal and the case was remitted for a new examination to the first-instance court. On 13 July 2004 the case arrived at the court. The authorised period of [the applicant’s] detention expires on 19 August 2004 ...”
The applicant appealed, arguing that the previous term of his detention had expired on 18 August 2004.
On 13 October 2004 the District Court extended the applicant’s detention for one month and seventeen days, until 30 November 2004.
On 23 November 2004 the District Court convicted the applicant of theft and sentenced him to three years and six months’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed.
On 9 February 2005 the Khakasiya Supreme Court, having applied a more lenient criminal law, upheld the judgment of 23 November 2004.
On the same date the Khakasiya Supreme Court also rejected the applicant’s appeal against the detention order of 19 August 2005 (see paragraph 14 above) and held as follows:
“The [the applicant’s] argument that the [District Court] issued the detention order on 19 August 2005, while his term of detention had expired on 18 August 2004, cannot serve as a ground for quashing of that detention order. According to Article 255 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a court extends a term of detention upon its expiry (по истечении ранее установленного срока). Thus, the law does not forbid the court to extend a term of detention on the next day after the previous term of detention had expired.”
Everyone has a right to liberty and security (Article 22 § 1). Arrest, placement in custody and custodial detention are permissible only on the basis of a court order (Article 22 § 2).
After arrest the suspect is placed in custody “pending investigation”. Custody may be ordered by a court on application by an investigator or a prosecutor if a person has been charged with an offence carrying a sentence of at least two years’ imprisonment, provided that a less restrictive measure of restraint cannot be used (Article 108 §§ 1 and 3).
A period of detention “pending investigation” may not exceed two months (Article 109 § 1). A judge may extend that period to six months (Article 109 § 2). Further extensions up to twelve months, or in exceptional circumstances, up to eighteen months, may only be granted if the person is charged with serious or particularly serious criminal offences (Article 109 § 3). The period of detention “pending investigation” is calculated up to the day when the prosecutor sends the case to the trial court (Article 109 § 9).
From the date the prosecutor forwards the case to the trial court, the defendant’s detention is “before the court” (or “pending trial”). Upon receipt of the case-file, the judge must determine, in particular, whether the defendant should remain in custody or be released pending trial (Articles 228 (3) and 231 § 2 (6)).
The period of detention “pending trial” is calculated up to the date the judgment is given. It may not normally exceed six months (Article 255 § 2). Upon expiry of that period the trial court can extend the defendant’s detention if the case concerns serious or particularly serious criminal offences for not longer than three months each time (Article 255 § 3).
Terms established by the Code are calculated in hours, days and months. A term calculated in days expires at midnight on the last day. A term calculated in months expires on the last day of the respective month (Article 128 §§ 1-2).
When determining a judgement, the criminal court shall decide whether the preventive measure imposed on the defendant is to be revoked or altered (Article 299 § 1 (17)). The operative part of a judgment of conviction and sentence must indicate, inter alia, a decision concerning any preventive measure to be imposed on the defendant until the judgment takes legal effect (Article 308 § 1 (10)). When quashing a judgment of a first- instance court, the appeal court shall indicate in its judgment a decision on any preventive measure (Article 388 § 1 (8)).
If the grounds serving as the basis for a preventive measure have changed, the preventive measure must be cancelled or amended. A decision to cancel or amend a preventive measure may be taken by an investigator, a prosecutor or a court (Article 110).
Under Law of 15 July 1995 no. 103-FZ “On Detention of Persons Suspected and Accused of Criminal Offences” (the Custody Act), the prison governor should release the detainee, having received a court order or a decision of the investigator or prosecutor to this effect. The prison governor should notify the authority in charge of the criminal case and the prosecutor that the authorised period of detention expires within twenty-four hours. If the authorised period of detention has expired and no decision to extend it or release the detainee has been received, the prison governor should immediately release the detainee (section 50).
The time spent by the accused person in pre-trial detention and detention pending trial is included in the duration of the deprivation of liberty pursuant to the conviction (Article 72 §§ 3 and 4).
On 22 March 2005 the Constitutional Court of the  adopted judgment no. 4-P in respect of a complaint concerning the de facto extension of pre-trial detention after the case file had been transmitted from the prosecution authorities to the trial court. It found that the challenged provisions of the new Code of Criminal Procedure complied with the Constitution of the . However, their practical interpretation by the courts may have contradicted their constitutional meaning. In part 3.2. of the judgment the  held as follows:
“The second part of Article 22 of the Constitution of the  provides that ... the detention is permitted only on the basis of a court order ... Consequently, if the term of detention, as defined in the court order, expires, the court shall decide on the extension of the detention, otherwise the accused person should be released ...
These rules are common for all stages of criminal proceedings, and also cover the transition from one stage to another. ... The transition of the case to another stage does not automatically put an end to the preventive measure applied at previous stages.
Therefore, when the case is transmitted by the prosecution to the trial court, the preventive measure applied at the pre-trial stage ... may continue to apply until the expiry of the term, for which it has been set in the respective court decision [imposing it] ...
[Under Articles 227 and 228 of the Code of Criminal Procedure] a judge should, after receiving a criminal case concerning a detained defendant, set a hearing within fourteen days and establish ‘whether the preventive measure applied should be lifted or changed’. This wording implies that the decision to detain the accused or extend his detention, taken at the pre-trial stage, may stand after the completion of the pre-trial investigation and transmittal of the case to the court, but only until the end of the term for which the preventive measure has been set.”
In its ruling no. 245-O-O of 20 March 2008, the Russian Constitutional Court noted that it had reiterated on several occasions (judgments nos. 14-P and 4-P of 13 June 1996 and 22 March 2005, and rulings nos. 417-O and 330-O of 4 December 2003 and 12 July 2005 respectively) that a court, when taking a decision under Articles 100, 108, 109 and 255 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the placement of an individual in detention or on the extension of a period of an individual’s detention, was under an obligation to indicate the grounds justifying his/her deprivation of liberty and its time-limit.
In its Resolution no. 1 of 5 March 2004 “On the Application by Courts of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure”, as in force at the relevant time, the Russian Supreme Court noted with regard to the provisions of Article 255 § 3 of the Code, that, when deciding on an extension of a defendant’s detention pending trial, the court should indicate the grounds justifying the extension and its time-limit (paragraph 16).
