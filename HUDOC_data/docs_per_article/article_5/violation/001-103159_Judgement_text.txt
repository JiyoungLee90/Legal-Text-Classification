The case originated in two applications (nos. 41433/06 and 47936/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Taylan Kutlar and Mr Osman Nuri Ocaklı (“the applicants”), born in 1980 and 1966 respectively. The introduction dates of the applications and the names of the applicants' representatives are indicated in the appended table. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 21 October 2009 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (former Article 29 § 3).
The applicants are Turkish nationals, who were arrested and subsequently detained pending criminal proceedings brought against them on the charge of membership of the MLKP (the “Marxist Leninist Communist Party”), an illegal organisation. They are still in pre-trial detention. The information concerning the dates of the arrests, the dates of the orders for the applicants' pretrial detention, the dates of the bills of indictment, the dates of the domestic court decisions, the total period of pre-trial detention, and the grounds for continued detention is set out in the appendix.
A description of the relevant domestic law and practice prior to the entry into force of the new Code of Criminal Procedure (the “CCP”; Law no. 5271) on 1 June 2005 may be found in Çobanoğlu and Budak v. Turkey (no. 45977/99, §§ 29-31, 30 January 2007). The current practice under the CCP is outlined in Şayık and Others v.  (nos. 1966/07, 9965/07, 35245/07, 35250/07, 36561/07, 36591/07 and 40928/07, §§ 13-15, 8 December 2009).
