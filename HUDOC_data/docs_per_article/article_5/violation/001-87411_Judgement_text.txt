The applicant appealed to the Cantonal Ministry for Social Affairs in Goražde pursuant to the instructions of the social work centre.

There are two legal regimes applicable to psychiatric detention.
First of all, the competent civil court can order compulsory confinement of a mental health patient in a psychiatric hospital if it is satisfied on the evidence of a psychiatrist that this is necessary in order to protect the patient concerned and/or the public from serious harm (see sections 22(1), 29(1) and 31(1) of the Mental Health Act of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina 2001; Zakon o zaštiti osoba sa duševnim smetnjama; published in the Official Gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“OG FBH”) no. 37/01 of 15 August 2001; amendments published in OG FBH no. 40/02 of 21 August 2002; “Mental Health Act”). The patient concerned must be summoned by the court, where this is possible, and must be examined in person by a psychiatrist (see sections 30(3) and 31(2) of the Mental Health Act). Proceedings must be concluded within seven days and a court decision must be issued within next three days (see sections 45(2) and 53(1) of the Non-Contentious Proceedings Act of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina 1998; Zakon o vanparničnom postupku; published in OG FBH no. 2/98 of 20 January 1998; amendments published in OG FBH nos. 39/04 of 24 July 2004 and 73/05 of 28 December 2005). A court decision ordering civil psychiatric detention must always indicate the duration of such detention; that period cannot be longer than one year, but is renewable (see sections 33-35 of the Mental Health Act). The patient concerned, among other authorised persons and bodies, has the right to appeal within eight days (see section 37 of the Mental Health Act). The competent second-instance court must give a decision within three days (ibid.). A civil psychiatric detainee has the right to seek judicial review of his or her detention at any time (see section 40 of the Mental Health Act).
Secondly, the competent criminal court can impose a hospital order (obavezno psihijatrijsko liječenje i čuvanje u zdravstvenoj ustanovi) on an offender who at the time of committing a criminal offence was suffering from a mental disorder affecting his or her mental responsibility, if it is satisfied on the evidence of a psychiatrist that this is necessary in order to prevent the offender from committing another criminal offence. However, there is an important difference in this regard between the old and new criminal legislation (the latter entered into force on 1 August 2003). While a hospital order can still be imposed on those who have been found guilty although suffering from diminished responsibility, it can no longer be imposed against those who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity (see Article 74 § 1 of the Criminal Code of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina 2003; Krivični zakon Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine; published in OG FBH no. 36/03 of 29 July 2003; amendments published in OG FBH nos. 37/03 of 31 July 2003, 21/04 of 17 April 2004, 69/04 of 7 December 2004 and 18/05 of 23 March 2005).
Accordingly, as from 1 August 2003 an offender who has been acquitted on the grounds of insanity can be placed in psychiatric detention only by the competent civil court if this is considered necessary for the protection of the offender and/or the public from serious harm (see paragraph 50 above). Any such acquittal is therefore reported to the competent social work centre which must initiate the appropriate procedure (see Article 410 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina 2003; Zakon o krivičnom postupku Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine; published in OG FBH no. 35/03 of 28 July 2003; amendments published in OG FBH nos. 37/03 of 31 July 2003, 56/03 of 14 November 2003, 78/04 of 31 December 2004, 28/05 of 11 May 2005, 55/06 of 20 September 2006, 27/07 of 18 April 2007 and 53/07 of 8 August 2007).
The relevant authorities had until 1 September 2003 to verify the status of all those who had been acquitted on the grounds of insanity pursuant to the old criminal legislation, to terminate the application of any hospital orders which were still pending and to initiate the procedure in which the competent civil court would decide whether to prolong the detention of any such mental health patient (see Article 420 of the Criminal Code 2003 and the instructions of the Ministry of Justice of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina no. 03-02-3132/03 of 22 December 2003).
