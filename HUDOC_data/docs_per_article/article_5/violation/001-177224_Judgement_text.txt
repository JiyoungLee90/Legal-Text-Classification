The case originated in an application (no. 61287/12) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Fadil Čović (“the applicant”), on 17 September 2012.
The applicant was represented by Mr K. Kolić, a lawyer practising in Sarajevo. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Ms M. Mijić.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the proceedings for review of the lawfulness of his detention had not complied with the requirements of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. He further complained under Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 that his detention had been arbitrary and its length unjustified.
On 11 January 2016 the complaints under Article 5 § 4 and Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 of the Convention were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Hadžići.
On 22 November 2011 the applicant was arrested and detained on suspicion of having committed war crimes against the civilian population and against prisoners of war during the 1992-95 war.
On 23 November 2011 the State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the State Court”) reviewed and extended his detention based on the risk of his obstructing the course of justice by exerting pressure on witnesses and co-accused or by destroying evidence. On 1 December 2011 that decision was upheld by the Appeals Chamber of the State Court.
On 21 December 2011 the State Court further extended the applicant’s detention on the same grounds as before. On 5 January 2012 that decision was upheld by the Appeals Chamber of the State Court.
On 29 December 2011 the State Prosecutor issued an indictment against the applicant and seven other co-suspects, which was confirmed by the State Court on 10 January 2012.
Thereafter, the applicant’s detention was regularly examined and extended every two months by the State Court. In addition to those automatic reviews, the applicant repeatedly challenged his detention before the Appeals Chamber of the State Court.
On 23 February 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal, relying on Article II § 3.(d) of the Constitution (see paragraph 16 below) and Article 5 of the Convention. He alleged, in particular, that his detention had been arbitrary and excessive, and that it had not been based on relevant and sufficient reasons.
On 13 July 2012 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Constitutional Court”), in a formation of eight judges, rejected the applicant’s appeal since it could not reach a majority on any of the proposals. The court’s reasoning included all the views expressed at the session on the issues raised in the case. Pursuant to Article VI § 4 of the Constitution (see paragraph 16 below) that decision was final.
On 1 November 2012 the State Court held that the grounds for the applicant’s continued detention had ceased to apply and released the applicant. By the same decision, the court imposed preventive measures on the applicant which included the following: a prohibition on leaving his place of residence without the prior approval of the State Court save for the purpose of appearing before that court; the duty to report once a week to the Hadžići police; a prohibition on associating with other co-accused and on associating or having contact with the witnesses. Furthermore, the applicant’s passport was seized.
The preventive measures were reviewed and extended every two months. On 16 December 2015 they were revoked.
At the date of the latest information available to the Court (22 July 2016), the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still ongoing.
The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Annex 4 to the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina) entered into force on 14 December 1995.
The relevant part of the Constitution reads as follows:
Article 137 § 1 of the 2003 Code of Criminal Procedure of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Zakon o krivičnom postupku Bosne i Hercegovine, Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“OG BH”), nos. 3/03, 32/03, 36/03, 26/04, 63/04, 13/05, 48/05, 46/06, 76/06, 29/07, 32/07, 53/07, 76/07, 15/08, 58/08, 12/09, 16/09, 93/09 and 72/13), provides that after an indictment has been lodged a judicial panel shall examine every two months whether the statutory conditions for detention continue to apply. A defendant, defence counsel or the State Prosecutor may lodge an appeal against a decision to order, extend or lift detention (Articles 134, 135, 136 and 137 § 1 of the 2003 Code).
Rule 40(2) of the Rules of the Constitutional Court in force at the relevant time (OG BH, nos. 60/05, 76/05, 64/08 and 51/09) provided that a plenary court made decisions by a majority of all its members. Rule 40(3) provided that when fewer than nine judges participated in a plenary session it was considered that an appeal was rejected unless a minimum of five judges voted identically on a proposal under discussion. Such a decision contained all the views expressed at the plenary session on the issues raised in a case and was final. A judge could not abstain from voting (Rule 41).
On 1 April 2014 new Rules of the Constitutional Court entered into force (OG BH, nos. 22/14 and 57/14). Rule 42(5) thereof provides that when fewer than nine judges participate in a plenary session, unless a minimum of five judges vote identically on a proposal under discussion, the case shall be adjourned for a maximum period of six months; if after that period the same situation occurs, the President’s vote shall count for two votes. Other provisions concerning voting system remained unchanged.
Furthermore, Rule 68(2) of the new Rules provides for the reopening of the proceedings following a judgment in which the European Court of Human Rights found a violation of the right of access to a court before the Constitutional Court. In such a case, the Constitutional Court shall re-examine the case within three months of the date on which the European Court’s judgment became final, at the latest.
