The case originated in an application (no. 63507/11) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Mihail Gorea (“the applicant”), on 1 September 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Donică, a lawyer practising in Chișinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr M. Gurin.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been unlawfully detained.
On 1 December 2015 the complaint concerning Article 5 § 1 of the Convention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Costesti.
On 16 July 2008 the Ialoveni District Court found the applicant guilty of disrespectful conduct towards a police officer and sentenced him to five days’ administrative arrest. The applicant appealed.
On 12 August 2008 the Chișinău Court of Appeal quashed the abovementioned judgment and returned the case for a reexamination on the merits.
On 11 February 2009 the Ialoveni District Court discontinued the proceedings against the applicant as a result of the expiry of the time-limit for applying an administrative sanction. Meanwhile, the applicant had already served his sentence. The applicant appealed.
On 13 March 2009 the Chișinău Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the district court and discontinued the administrative proceedings in respect of the applicant for lack of corpus delicti.
The applicant brought an action under Law no. 1545 seeking 300,000 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 18,750 euros (EUR)) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. On 11 May 2011 the Supreme Court of Justice concluded that the applicant’s administrative arrest had been unlawful and thus awarded him MDL 8,000 (equivalent to EUR 500) as compensation for the damage caused.
