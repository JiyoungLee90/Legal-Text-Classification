The case originated in an application (no. 49232/12) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Mutasam Erbek (“the applicant”), on 30 May 2012.
The applicant was represented by Ms Ç. Altuntaş, a lawyer practising in Mersin. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 7 June 2017 the applicant’s complaint concerning the effectiveness of the procedure by which he could challenge the lawfulness of his detention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1991 and lives in Mersin.
On 30 December 2011 the applicant was taken into custody on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organisation and of making propaganda for that organisation.
On the same day, the applicant was brought before the investigating judge who ordered his detention on remand taking into account the nature of the offences, and the strong suspicion that he had committed the alleged offences, and the risk of absconding.
On 28 March 2012 the applicant’s lawyer lodged an objection against the decision dated 30 December 2011 ordering the applicant’s detention and requested his release. On 29 March 2012 the Mersin Magistrates’ Court dismissed the objection on the basis of the case file, without holding a hearing. On 16 April 2012 the applicant’s lawyer filed a further objection against that decision. On 17 April 2012 the Mersin Criminal Court with General Jurisdiction dismissed the objection on the basis of the case file, without holding a hearing.
On 5 September 2012 the applicant was released from detention on remand.
On 10 September 2012 the Adana Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, accusing him of being a member of a terrorist organisation and of making propaganda in its favour.
According to the latest information in the case file, the proceedings against the applicant are still pending before an assize court.
