The case originated in an application (no. 19177/09) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Sergey Leonidovich Kosteychuk (“the applicant”), on 23 March 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr A.I.O. Dzhalilov, a lawyer practising in Kyiv. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented, most recently, by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna of the Ministry of Justice.
On 2 March 2014 the applicant’s complaints concerning the lawfulness and length of his detention and the length of criminal proceedings against him were communicated to the Government, and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Kyiv.
In 1995-2002 the applicant was convicted of and served a sentence for aggravated theft and burglary.
On 27 December 2005 and 6 January 2006 the police found the applicant in possession of illegal drugs.
On 20 January 2006 the police arrested the applicant on suspicion of drug manufacturing and possession.
On the same day criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant and a certain Mr I. for armed robbery committed in a group.
On 23 January 2006 the Kyiv Podilsky District Court (“the District Court”) ordered the applicant’s detention on remand until 20 March 2006 on the grounds that he had previous convictions and there was a risk that he would abscond, continue his criminal activities or obstruct the investigation.
On 16 March 2006 the District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 20 April 2006, stating that there was no reason to change it and there was a need to carry out investigative actions.
On 27 June 2006 the District Court held a preliminary hearing in the case and upheld the preventive measure imposed on the applicant without giving any reasons or setting a time-limit for it.
On 17 March and 14 July 2008, and 19 January and 23 April 2009 the District Court refused the applicant’s requests for release.
On 17 July 2009 the District Court convicted the applicant of drug possession and armed robbery committed in a group and sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment.
On 27 July 2010 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal quashed that judgment and remitted the case to the District Court for fresh consideration.
On the same day the applicant was released against his undertaking not to abscond.
On 30 September 2013 the District Court sent the case against the applicant to the prosecutor for further investigation.
On 25 April 2014 the charges concerning the armed robbery were separated into a second set of criminal proceedings.
On 29 April 2014 the bill of indictment for robbery was approved and on 3 June 2014 the District Court committed the applicant for trial on that charge.
As at the date of the last communication from the parties to the Court, 5 March 2015, proceedings against the applicant were still pending before the District Court.
