The case originated in an application (no. 702/11) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Çetin Taş (“the applicant”), on 10 November 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Erbil, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 10 May 2012 the application was declared partly inadmissible and the complaints concerning the length of the applicant’s pre-trial detention, the effectiveness of the procedure by which the applicant could challenge the lawfulness of his detention, and the applicant’s right to compensation in these respects were communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1992 and lives in Istanbul.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 7 December 2009 the applicant was arrested.
On 9 December 2009 the applicant was placed in detention on remand by the judge at the Istanbul Assize Court on suspicion of committing crimes on behalf of an illegal terrorist organisation, disseminating propaganda for the same organisation, storage of hazardous materials, and damage to public property.
On 30 December 2009 the Istanbul public prosecutor filed his indictment with the Istanbul Assize Court.
On 6 May 2010 the first hearing was held before the Istanbul Assize Court. At the end of the hearing the court ordered the continuation of his detention in the presence of the applicant.
The applicant filed an objection against this decision. On 20 May 2010 the 10th Chamber of Istanbul Assize Court dismissed this objection without holding an oral hearing. In delivering its decision, the court took into consideration the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative.
On 10 December 2010 the applicant was released from detention on remand.
At the time when the application was lodged, the proceedings against the applicant were still pending before the first-instance court.
