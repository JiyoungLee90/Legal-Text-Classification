The case originated in two applications (nos. 16777/06 and 2090/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Mehmet Kadri Can and Mr Mehmet Ziya Gümüş (“the applicants”), on 5 April 2006 and 28 December 2006 respectively. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent. On 16 October 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants were born in 1974 and 1975, respectively, and are detained in  prison.
The applicants were taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of Hizbullah, an illegal organisation, on 8 March 1995 and 29 June 1999. On 5 April 1995 and 16 July 1999 they were remanded in custody.
On unspecified dates criminal proceedings were brought against the applicants on charges of carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory, as well as membership of Hizbullah. Subsequently, the cases against the applicants were joined before the Diyarbakır State Security Court.
Following the promulgation of Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, the cases were transferred to the .
On 31 March 2005 the Diyarbakır Assize Court convicted the applicants of attempting to undermine the constitutional order and sentenced them to life imprisonment. On 11 December 2006 the Court of Cassation quashed this judgment. On 9 November 2007 the Diyarbakır Assize Court once again convicted the applicants. According to the information in the case file, the proceedings against the applicants are still pending before the Court of Cassation.
During the proceedings, the first-instance courts examined the applicants’ continued detention at the end of every hearing, either on their own motion or upon the applicants’ request. On each occasion, the courts ordered the applicants’ continued detention on remand having regard to the nature of the offence, the state of evidence and the content of the file.
