The present case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission") on 13 October 1983, within the three-month period laid down in Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 9017/80) against the  lodged with the Commission by an Irish national, Mr. Anthony McGoff, on 25 March 1980 under Article 25 (art. 25).
The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby  recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 5 paras. 3 and 4 (art. 5-3, art. 5-4).
In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings before the Court and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).
In a telex message of 3 November 1983, the Permanent Representative of Ireland to the Council of Europe informed the Registrar that his Government did not wish to intervene in the proceedings (Rule 33 para. 3 (b)).
On 3 November 1983, the President of the Court referred the McGoff case to the Chamber already constituted to hear the Skoogström case (Rule 21 para. 6). This Chamber included, as ex officio members, Mr. G. Lagergren, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. G. Wiarda, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b) of the Rules of Court). The five other members, drawn by lot on 27 October 1983, were Mr. R. Ryssdal, Mr. W. Ganshof van der Meersch, Mr. L. Liesch, Mr. E. Garcia de Enterria and Sir Vincent Evans (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4 of the Rules of Court) (art. 43). Mr. Ryssdal and Mr. Liesch, who were prevented from taking further part in the consideration of the case, were subsequently replaced by Mr. R. Macdonald and Mr. R. Bernhardt, substitute judges (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1).
Having assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr. Wiarda consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Swedish Government ("the Government"), the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant as to the need for a written procedure. On 23 November 1983, he directed that the Agent and the lawyer should each have until 6 February 1984 to submit a memorial and that the Delegate should be entitled to submit a memorial in reply within two months of the transmission to him by the Registrar of whichever of the aforesaid documents should last be filed (Rule 37 para. 1).
The Government’s memorial was lodged at the registry on 29 December 1983. On 26 January 1984, the Secretary to the Commission notified the Registrar that the Delegate did not consider it necessary to expand on the opinion expressed by the Commission in its report of 13 July 1983.
The Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 7 February.
By an Order made on 9 January 1984, the President granted legal aid to Mr. McGoff (Rule 4 of the Addendum to the Rules of Court).
On 21 May, the Chamber decided not to hold any hearings, having first satisfied itself that the requisite conditions for such a derogation from normal procedure had been fulfilled (Rules 26).
On 17 July, the lawyer for the applicant provided the Registrar with a statement of his fees and disbursements.
Mr. Anthony McGoff is an Irish citizen, born in 1950 and resident at Naas () in . At the time of the events complained of, he was a contractor by profession.
On 27 October 1977, the District Court (tingsrätten) of  issued a warrant for his arrest (häktningsbeslut) on the ground that there was probable cause to suspect him of gross smuggling and a serious offence against the legislation on narcotics, and also to believe that he would abscond.
McGoff was not present at the hearing but was represented by counsel assigned by the court.
After being arrested in the  on 10 July 1979, he was extradited to  on 24 January 1980 and immediately placed in custody in the main prison (allmänna häktet) in . The District Court was notified the following day.
As from 25 January 1980, the police inspector in charge endeavoured to interrogate Mr. McGoff, but the latter declined to make any statement until he had had the opportunity to consult a lawyer. Although informed that Mr. L had been appointed as official defence counsel, the applicant refused to accept any other lawyer than Mr. F. The District Court therefore appointed Mr. F who, on 28 January, visited the applicant in his cell.
On 8 February, the District Court held a hearing at the close of which it ordered Mr. McGoff’s continued detention and directed that criminal proceedings against him should be instituted no later than 21 February 1980. The public prosecutor instituted such proceedings on 21 February.
On 26 February, when the main hearing (huvudförhandling) was about to begin, the applicant requested that two persons be heard as witnesses and expressed his wish to adduce certain written evidence which was not immediately available. The District Court remanded Mr. McGoff in custody and deferred the hearing until 7 March 1980.
On the latter date, in view of the applicant’s poor physical condition, the District Court once more adjourned the hearing; it also directed that the applicant should be kept in detention.
The trial finally took place on 13 March 1980. Mr. McGoff was convicted of a serious offence against the legislation on narcotics and sentenced by the District Court to two years’ imprisonment; the District Court also ordered that he should be deported from  on expiry of his sentence.
Conviction and sentence were upheld on 12 May 1980 by the Svea Court of Appeal (Svea hovrätt).
On 26 June 1980, the Supreme Court (högsta domstolen) refused the applicant’s request for leave to appeal.
On 24 November 1980, Mr. McGoff was released after serving two-thirds of his sentence, account having been taken of the time spent in detention both in the  and in  prior to conviction (Chapter 33, section 5, of the Penal Code).
Under Chapter 52, section 1, of the Code of Judicial Procedure (rättegångsbalken) an appeal against an arrest warrant is not made subject to any time-limit.
In virtue of the last paragraph of Chapter 24, section 17, the court must be notified immediately when such warrants are executed. Once it is in receipt of such information, the court has to lay down the period of time within which criminal proceedings (åtal) against the person detained must be instituted. If this period is greater than two weeks, the court must normally hold a public hearing at least once a fortnight in order to decide whether or not detention is to be continued.
On 10 March 1983, the Swedish Government set up a commission to consider revising parts of the Code of Judicial Procedure, including the rules governing pre-trial detention. In particular, the commission is to inquire into the possibilities of making the prerequisites for placing a suspect in detention on remand (häktning) more stringent and into possible ways of shortening the duration of detention on remand and provisional detention (anhållande).
In his application of 25 March 1980 to the Commission (no. 9017/80), Mr. McGoff relied on several provisions of the Convention, namely Article 25 (art. 25) (he was allegedly not allowed to write to the Commission); Article 3 (art. 3) (a prison warder allegedly struck him); Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) (the original arrest warrant of 27 October 1977 was allegedly unlawful); Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) (he was allegedly not brought promptly before a judge); Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) (he was allegedly unable to contest the lawfulness of his detention); Article 6 para. 3 (b) (art. 6-3-b) (he allegedly did not enjoy the facilities necessary for preparing his defence); Article 6 para. 3 (d) (art. 6-3-d) (he was allegedly not allowed to have prosecution witnesses examined).
On 13 October 1982, the Commission decided to take no action with regard to the complaint under Article 25 (art. 25) and to declare admissible the complaints based on paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 5 (art. 5-3, art. 5-4). The remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
In its report of 13 July 1983 (Article 31 of the Convention) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a breach of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention but not of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).
The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to the present judgment.
