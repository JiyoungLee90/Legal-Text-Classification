The case originated in an application (no. 34170/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Gökhan Aydın (“the applicant”), on 31 July 2007.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Filorinalı and Ms Y. Filorinalı, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 16 June 2009 the complaints concerning the excessive length of the applicant’s pre-trial detention and the criminal proceedings brought against him and his right to take proceedings to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as well as his to an enforceable right to compensation were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant, Mr Gökhan Aydın, is a Turkish national who was born in 1983. He was detained in Tekirdağ F-type prison at the time of the introduction of the application with the Court.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 11 November 2002 the applicant was taken into custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorist Branch of the Istanbul police headquarters on suspicion of membership of TKP/ML-TIKKO, an illegal organisation.
On 14 November 2002 the Istanbul State Security Court ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention.
On 26 December 2002 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment charging the applicant and ten other persons with attempting to undermine the constitutional order, an offence prescribed by Article 146 § 1 of the former Criminal Code.
Following the promulgation of Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, the case against the applicant was transferred to 10th Chamber of the Istanbul Assize Court.
During the proceedings, the first-instance courts examined the applicant’s continued detention at the end of every hearing, either on their own motion or upon the applicant’s request.
On 25 December 2007, at the end of the hearing and in the presence of the applicant, the 10th Chamber of the Istanbul Assize Court ordered the applicant’s continued detention. The applicant objected to this decision. On 27 December 2007 the 11th Chamber of Istanbul Assize Court dismissed his objection without holding an oral hearing and relying on the public prosecutor’s opinion which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative.
On 24 March 2009 the applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to life imprisonment. This decision was upheld by the Court of Cassation and became final on 20 January 2011.
A description of the relevant domestic law can be found Demir v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 51770/07, §§ 29-33, 16 October 2012), Turgut and Others v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 4860/09, §§ 1926, 26 March 2013), and Altınok v. Turkey (no. 31610/08, §§ 28-32, 29 November 2011).
.  The applicant complained under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention that the length of his pre-trial detention had exceeded the “reasonable time” requirement.
The applicant contended under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention that there was no remedy in domestic law by which he could challenge the lawfulness of his pre-trial detention.
The applicant complained under Article 5 § 5 of the Convention that he did not have an enforceable right to compensation for his excessively long detention.
.  The applicant maintained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the criminal proceedings brought against him were not concluded within a reasonable time.
