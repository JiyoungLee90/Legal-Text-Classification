The case originated in an application (no. 16706/11) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Mariusz Różański (“the applicant”), on 23 February 2011.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz, succeeded by Ms J. Chrzanowska, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 11 January 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Piekary.
On 2 March 2008 the applicant was arrested by the police under the suspicion of having participated in an organised criminal gang trading in women and deriving profits from prostitution.
On 13 March 2008 the  District Court decided to detain the applicant on remand (file no. III K 278/08).
The applicant’s pre-trial detention was subsequently extended by the  on 2 September, 25 August and 1 December 2008.
In 2009 his pre-trial detention was further extended on 17 February and 27 May.
On 12 August 2009 the applicant and ten other co-accused were indicted before the  (file no. Ap V Ds. 37/09).
On 25 May 2010 the Poznan Court of Appeal decided to extend the applicant’s pre-trial detention. In addition to the reasonable suspicion against the applicant, the court relied on the risk of his going into hiding, especially since he had been avoiding arrest for one-and-a-half years. Moreover, the court relied on the severity of the penalty that might be imposed and a risk that the applicant would interfere with the proper course of the proceedings. The court finally considered that the criminal proceedings had been very complex as the case involved eleven co-accused charged with a dozen offences each.
The applicant’s appeal against this decision was dismissed on 29 June 2010.
Afterwards the applicant’s pre-trial detention was extended on 19 August, 26 October, and 21 December 2010. All decisions were unsuccessfully appealed against by the applicant. The court in particular relied on the severity of the possible penalty and on the fact that the applicant acted in an organised criminal gang. In the last of the above listed decisions the Court of Appeal considered that the risk of a severe sentence should no longer be a valid ground for the applicant’s very lengthy pre-trial detention. However, the other grounds, namely risk of his interfering with the proper course of the proceedings and going into hiding, were still valid grounds for his continued detention.
On 24 March and 26 May 2011 the Poznan Court of Appeal further extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention.
On 8 September 2011 the Poznan Court of Appeal decided that the applicant could be released on bail in the amount of 70,000 Polish zlotys (PLN).
On 12 October 2011 the applicant paid the bail and was released from detention.
On 6 June 2012 the  convicted the applicant and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment (file no. XVI K 45/10). The judgment is not final as the applicant lodged an appeal against it.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pretrial detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 2733, 25 April 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 2223, 4 August 2006.
