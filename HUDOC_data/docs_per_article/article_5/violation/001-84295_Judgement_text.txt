The case originated in an application (no. 74318/01) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by twelve Turkish nationals, Mr Resul Sadak, Mr Nihat Osal, Mr Mehmet Çakar, Mr Rustem Bayar, Mr Tahir Kutlu, Mr Cengiz Balık, Mr İzzet Belge, Mr Abdurrazak İnan, Mr Mehmet Temelkuran, Mr Mehmet Nezir Ayan, Mr Yakup Uyar and Mr Erdal Güler (“the applicants”), on 1 April 2001.
In a judgment delivered on 5 December 2006, the Court declared the part of the application concerning Erdal Güler inadmissible and held that there had been a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in respect of the remainder of the applicants. The Court also decided to award Mr Resul Sadak, Mr Nihat Osal, Mr Mehmet Çakar, Mr Rustem Bayar, Mr Tahir Kutlu, Mr Cengiz Balık, Mr İzzet Belge, Mr Abdurrazak İnan, Mr Mehmet Temelkuran, Mr Mehmet Nezir Ayan, Mr Yakup Uyar 1 800 Euros (EUR) each in respect of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 1 000 jointly in respect of costs and expenses and dismissed the remainder of the claims for just satisfaction.
On 18 April and 24 April 2007 the Government and the applicants' representative requested revision of the judgment within the meaning of Rule 80 of the Rules of Court, submitting that Mehmet Temelkuran had passed away on 26 May 2005.
On 3 July 2007 the Court considered the requests for revision. It decided to refuse the Government's request for revision of the judgment and striking out of the Court's list of cases the application brought by Mehmet Temelkuran. The Court decided to give the Government three weeks in which to submit any observations on the applicants' representative's request. Those observations were received on 19 July 2007.
