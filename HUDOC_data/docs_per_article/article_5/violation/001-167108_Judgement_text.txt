The case originated in an application (no. 57215/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Valeriy Vasilyevich Burykin (“the applicant”), on 30 September 2009.
The applicant was represented by Ms M. Belinskaya, a lawyer practising in St Petersburg. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.

The applicant was born in 1953 and lived, prior to his arrest in St Petersburg.
On 20 December 2005 the applicant was put on the wanted list on suspicion of a murder and gangsterism.
On 17 July 2007 the Vyborskiy District Court of St Petersburg remanded the applicant in custody in absentia.
