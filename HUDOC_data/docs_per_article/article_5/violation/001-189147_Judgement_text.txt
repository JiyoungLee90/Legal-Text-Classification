The case originated in an application (no. 6593/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Bekir Kılıçaslan (“the applicant”), on 25 January 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr İ. Akmeşe, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 17 January 2012 the application was declared partly inadmissible and the complaints concerning the length of the applicant’s pre-trial detention and the criminal proceedings brought against him, the effectiveness of the procedure by which the applicant could challenge the lawfulness of his detention as well as the absence of effective domestic remedies in those respects were communicated to the Government.
The applicant, who was born in 1972, lives in İzmir.
On 29 November 2004 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organisation.
On 3 December 2004 the applicant was brought before the judge at the Istanbul Assize Court who placed him in detention on remand taking into consideration the nature of the offence, the state of evidence and the risk of absconding.
On 7 December 2004 the Istanbul public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Istanbul Assize Court, charging the applicant with membership of a terrorist organisation.
On 14 March 2006 the Istanbul Assize Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to six years and three months’ imprisonment. The court ordered the continuation of his detention.
On 24 January 2007 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment on procedural grounds. The case was accordingly remitted to the Istanbul Assize Court.
On 19 July 2007 the 10th Chamber of the Istanbul Assize Court held a further hearing, in which both the applicant and his lawyer were present. At the end of that hearing, the court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention.
On 25 July 2007 the applicant’s lawyer filed an objection against the decision of 19 July 2007. On 7 August 2007 the 11th Chamber of the Istanbul Assize Court dismissed this objection without holding a hearing. In delivering its decision, the court took into consideration the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative.
On 6 November 2007 the Istanbul Assize Court once more convicted the applicant and sentenced him to six years and three months’ imprisonment and ordered his release.
On 30 January 2012 the Court of Cassation upheld this decision.
