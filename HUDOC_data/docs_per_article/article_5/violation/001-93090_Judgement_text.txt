The case originated in an application (no. 7883/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Bartłomiej Figas (“the applicant”), on 29 January 2007.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged that his detention had exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.
On 29 April 2008 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Wojkowice. He is currently detained in the Zabrze Remand Centre.
On 17 November 2003 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and uttering threats.
On 19 November 2003 the Zabrze District Court remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question, supported by evidence from witnesses and the applicant’s confession of having beaten the victim. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The court stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence, given the character of the offence and the magnitude of the injuries suffered by the victim. It found no special grounds that would justify lifting the detention and imposing a less severe measure.
In the course of the proceedings, the applicant’s detention was extended by the  on 9 February, 10 May and 11 October 2004 and 20 January 2005.
In all their detention decisions the authorities repeatedly relied on a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question, which was supported by evidence from witnesses. They attached importance to the serious nature of those offences and the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. They further considered that the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings justified holding him in custody and that the applicant, if released, could disrupt the trial.
On 6 April 2005 the  convicted the applicant of rape, aggravated assault and uttering threats and sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment. The applicant’s detention was extended.
On 7 July 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal quashed the firstinstance judgment and remitted the case to the .
Further decisions extending the applicant’s detention were taken on 8 August and 10 November 2005, and 24 January and 12 April 2006. On 5 May 2006 the Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicant against the latter decision.
Subsequent decisions prolonging the detention were given by the  on 8 June and 13 October 2006.
In the retrial proceedings the applicant made two applications for release, which were refused by the  on 16 January and 10 July 2006. In his applications he relied on his personal circumstances. In particular, the need to ensure that his sick mother and his brother (a minor) were cared for.
On 27 October 2006 the  convicted the applicant of rape, aggravated assault and uttering threats and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment.
On 8 January 2007 the  prolonged the applicant’s detention. It held that in the light of the first-instance court’s judgment, the reasons for the applicant’s continued detention were still valid. A further interlocutory appeal was dismissed by the Katowice Court of Appeal on 31 January 2007.
On 15 March 2007 the Katowice Court of Appeal upheld the firstinstance judgment.
On 27 April 2007 the applicant lodged a request to have a legal-aid lawyer appointed to his case with a view to lodging a complaint questioning the constitutionality of Article 263 of the Polish Code of Criminal Procedure. On 28 August 2007, the applicant’s legal-aid counsel informed the Gliwice District Court, and the applicant, that he had found no grounds for lodging a constitutional complaint.
On 27 October 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed a cassation appeal by the applicant against the judgment of 15 March 2007.
On 14 December 2007 the applicant lodged a claim for compensation and just satisfaction for unjustified detention. On 6 February 2008 the  dismissed the claim. The applicant’s legalaid counsel found no grounds for lodging an appeal against the judgment.
The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, defines pre-trial detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe) as one of the so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze). The other measures are bail (poręczenie majątkowe), police supervision (dozór policji), guarantee by a responsible person (poręczenie osoby godnej zaufania), guarantee by a registered organisation (poręczenie społeczne), a temporary ban on engaging in a given activity (zawieszenie oskarżonego w określonej działalności) and a prohibition on leaving the country (zakaz opuszczania kraju). A detailed description of the relevant domestic law and judicial practice concerning the imposition of pre-trial detention, the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other “preventive measures” is given in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 2733, 25 April 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 2223, 4 August 2006.
The relevant statistical data, recent amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure designed to streamline criminal proceedings and references to the relevant Council of Europe Documents can be found in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kauczor (see Kauczor v. Poland, no. 45219/06, §§ 27-28 and 30-35, 3 February 2009).
