The case originated in an application (no. 31917/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Vladimir Iosifovich Bocharov (“the applicant”), on 14 June 2007.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the proceedings for review of lawfulness of his pre-trial detention had not been compatible with the Convention standards.
On 12 September 2014 the complaints under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Nizhniy Tagil, the Sverdlovsk Region.
On 14 October 2005 the applicant voluntarily came to the police to report that he had stabbed his girlfriend Ms O. to death. On the same date he was charged with her murder.
On 15 October 2005 the applicant was placed in custody in remand prison no. 3 of Nizhniy Tagil.
On 15 November 2005 the applicant underwent an outpatient psychiatric expert examination, which established that he had committed manslaughter while in the state of temporary incapacity («состояние физиологического аффекта»).
On 9 December 2005 the investigation file was transferred for trial to the Leninskiy District Court of Nizhniy Tagil (“the District Court”).
On an unspecified date the District Court appointed counsel to the applicant, Mr K.
On 28 March 2006 the District Court ordered another outpatient psychiatric expert examination of the applicant upon the prosecutor’s request and ordered that the measure of restraint remain unvaried.
On 2 June 2006 the District Court held a hearing on extension of the term of the pre-trial detention in the applicant’s absence. As Mr K. was on leave, the District Court appointed Mr L. as the applicant’s counsel. The District Court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention until 2 September 2006.
On 29 June 2006 the applicant was served with a copy of the detention order of 2 June 2006. He appealed against it on 30 June 2006.
On 7 July 2006 the District Court ordered that the applicant be subject to an inpatient psychiatric expert examination and ordered that the measure of restraint remain unvaried.
On 24 August 2006 the District Court held a hearing on extension of the term of the pre-trial detention in the applicant’s absence. Given that Mr K. was again on leave, the District Court appointed Ms S. as the applicant’s counsel for the hearing. The District Court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention until 2 December 2006.
On 28 August 2006 the applicant was admitted to the regional psychiatric hospital to undergo an inpatient examination pursuant to the District Court’s order of 7 July 2006.
On 25 September 2006 a report of the inpatient psychiatric expert examination was drawn up stating that the applicant had been fully capable of understanding the consequences of his actions at the moment of the crime.
On 26 October 2006 the District Court, having examined the criminal case against the applicant, found him guilty of murder of Ms O. and sentenced him to eleven years’ imprisonment.
On 8 December 2006 the Sverldovsk Regional Court (“the Regional Court”) examined in the absence of the applicant or any counsel on his behalf the statement of appeal of 30 June 2006 against the detention order of 2 June 2006 and dismissed it. The delay in examining the appeal was not explained.
On 22 December 2006 the applicant was served with a copy of the detention order of 24 August 2006.
On 25 December 2006 the applicant requested the District Court to restore the timelimit for lodging an appeal against the detention order of 24 August 2006.
On 15 January 2007 the District Court granted the request noting that the applicant had been served with a copy of the detention order “untimely”.
On 23 January 2007 the applicant appealed against the detention order of 24 August 2006.
On 14 February 2007 the Regional Court upheld the applicant’s conviction of 26 October 2006 on appeal. The applicant was notified of the outcome of the appeal hearing on 5 April 2007.
On 30 March 2007 the Regional Court examined the applicant’s statement of appeal of 23 January 2007 against the detention order of 24 August 2006 in the absence of the applicant or any counsel on his behalf and dismissed it. The delay in examining the appeal remained unexplained.
The date on which the applicant was served with a copy of the appeal decision of 8 December 2006 is at dispute between the parties. According to the Government, the applicant was served with it on 7 June 2007. To support their claim, they enclosed a copy of acknowledgement of receipt dated 7 July 2006 stating that the applicant had been served on that date with a copy of a ruling of 7 July 2006. According to the applicant, he was served with the copy after the introduction of the present application before the Court, that is, after 14 June 2007.
On 2 April 2013 the Cherdynskiy District Court of the Perm Region released the applicant on parole.
A court may not examine a request to extend the term of a pretrial detention in a suspect’s absence, save for cases where a suspect is undergoing an inpatient psychiatric expert examination or where there are other circumstances excluding the possibility of summoning a suspect to a hearing. In such cases the suspect’s legal representative must participate in a hearing (Article 109 § 13 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”). In cases governed by Article 109 § 13 of the CCP, a judge shall make a ruling on examining the issue of extending the term of detention in a suspect’s absence noting the reasons for which a suspect cannot attend a hearing (Article 109 § 14 of the CCP).
