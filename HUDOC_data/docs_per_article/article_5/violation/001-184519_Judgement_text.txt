The case originated in an application (no. 43038/13) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Moldovan nationals, Mr Anatol Mătăsaru and Ms Djulieta Savițchi (“the applicants”), on 10 June 2013.
The applicants were represented by Mr V. Gribincea, a lawyer practising in Chișinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by their Agent ad-interim at the time Ms R. Revencu and later by their Agent O. Rotari.
The applicants alleged, in particular, a breach of their rights guaranteed by Article 5 § 1 and Article 11 of the Convention.
On 30 March 2017 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants, who are husband and wife, were born in 1970 and live in Chișinău.
On 29 January 2008 the applicants were involved in a street protest as a result of which they were arrested and detained for six hours and fortyfive minutes. On 18 December 2008 the first applicant was again involved in a street protest, as a result of which he was arrested and detained for approximately four hours and a half. Later both applicants were acquitted and the actions of the police were found to be unlawful. The facts concerning those protests were described in detail in Mătăsaru and Saviţchi v. Moldova, no. 38281/08, §§ 6-58, 2 November 2010.
On 29 January 2009 the first applicant organised again a street protest and was arrested again and detained for some six hours. Later the applicant was acquitted and the actions of the police were found to be unlawful.
On 2 November 2010 the Court adopted a judgment in the case of Mătăsaru and Saviţchi (cited above), in which it declared inadmissible the applicants’ complaints concerning the alleged breaches of their rights guaranteed by Articles 5 and 11 of the Convention on the ground of their failure to exhaust domestic remedies (see Mătăsaru and Saviţchi (cited above, § 75).
After that, the applicants brought a civil action under Law 1545 (on compensation for damage caused by illegal acts of the criminal investigation bodies, the prosecution authorities or the courts) seeking compensation in respect of the breach of their rights guaranteed by Articles 5 and 11 of the Convention in regard to all three street protests of 2008 and 2009.
By a final judgment of 6 February 2013 the Supreme Court of Justice acknowledged the breach of the applicnts’ rights guaranteed by Articles 5 and 11 of the Convention and awarded them the equivalent of 900 and 270 euros (EUR), respectively.
