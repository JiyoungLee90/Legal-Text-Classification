The case originated in seven applications (nos. 30441/08, 35835/08, 36481/08, 36482/08, 36483/08, 36484/08 and 36485/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by seven Turkish nationals, Erkan Aydoğan, Selaattin Demir, Nurettin Kılıçdoğan, Halil Keten, Binali Güney, Hüseyin Babayiğit and Atilla Yılmaz (“the applicants”), born in 1976, 1965, 1963, 1967, 1964, 1968, and 1974 respectively. The applications were introduced on 2 June 2008.
The applicants were represented by Mr F. Saygılı and Mr O. Durmaz, lawyers practising in İstanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 12 June 2009 the Court decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (former Article 29 § 3).
The applicants are Turkish nationals who were arrested on suspicion of founding an organisation for the purpose of committing crime, harming property, violating the right to peaceful work through coercion in order to obtain unfair pecuniary gain, obstructing enjoyment of union rights and subsequently detained pending judicial proceedings. They were released on 6 June 2008. The details of the date of the arrests, the date of the orders for the applicants' pretrial detention, the date of the indictment, the total period of pre-trial detention, total period of criminal proceedings, the date of release and the grounds for continued detention are set out in the appendix hereto.
A description of the relevant domestic law and practice prior to the entry into force of the new Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”) (Law no. 5271) on 1 June 2005 may be found in Çobanoğlu and Budak v. Turkey (no. 45977/99, §§ 29-31, 30 January 2007). The current practice under the CCP is outlined in Şayık and Others v.  (nos. 1966/07, 9965/07, 35245/07, 35250/07, 36561/07, 36591/07 and 40928/07, §§ 1315, 8 December 2009).
The current practice may be found in Section 1 of Article 141 of the CCP, which provides:
“Persons; ...
a)  who were unlawfully arrested, detained or held in continued detention,
b)  who were not brought before a judge within the period prescribed by law,
c)  who were detained without being informed of their rights or without being allowed to exercise these rights against their wishes,
d)  who were lawfully detained but not brought before a legal authority within a reasonable time and who were not tried within a reasonable time,
e)  who, after being arrested or detained in accordance with the law, were not subsequently committed for trial or were acquitted,
f)  who were sentenced to a period of imprisonment shorter than the period spent in police custody and detention or ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty because it was the only sanction provided for the crime concerned,
g)  who were not informed of the reasons for their arrest or detention in writing or where this was not immediately possible, verbally,
h)  whose close family were not informed of their arrest or detention,
i)  whose arrest warrant was implemented in a disproportionate manner,
j)  whose belongings or other property were confiscated in the absence of requisite guarantees or without the necessary measures being taken for their protection, or whose belongings and other property were used for unauthorised reasons or were not returned on time,
during criminal investigation or prosecution may demand compensation for all pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage they sustained from the State.”
Section 1 of Article 142 of the CCP further provides:
“Compensation may be demanded [from the State] within three months from the date of service of the final ... judgment and, in any case, within one year following the date on which the ... judgment becomes final.”
