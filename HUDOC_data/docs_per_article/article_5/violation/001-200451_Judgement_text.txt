The case originated in an application (no. 19/16) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Markha Idrisova (“the applicant”), on 30 December 2015.
The applicant was represented by Mr T. Shamsudinov, a lawyer practising in Grozny. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr M. Galperin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 16 May 2018 the Government were given notice of the application.
The applicant was born in 1993. She is the wife of Mr Mukhumad Magomadov, who was born in 1990.
Mr Mukhumad Magomadov’s brother was Mr Alik Magomadov (also referred as Alik Magomadov), a member of an illegal armed group killed in 2009.
On the night of 3 to 4 December 2014 members of an illegal armed group attacked a police station in Grozny, killing several police officers. They then occupied the “Press House” building in the city centre and a nearby school. In response, the authorities carried out a large-scale counterterrorist operation and killed a number of the attackers.
In the aftermath of the attack, on 4 December 2014, Mr Ramzan Kadyrov, the President of the Chechen Republic, gave a statement saying that the families of the members of illegal armed groups would be expelled from Chechnya and their houses demolished.
At around 10 p.m. on 6 December 2014 a group of men in a white Lada Priora car with a registration number containing the digits 646 95 arrived at Mr Alik Magomadov’s house in the Sadovoye settlement in the Grozny district of Chechnya and knocked on the door. At the time the applicant, Mr Mukhumad Magomadov, his mother (Ms Z.M.) and one of his brothers (Mr I.M.) were at home. Mr Mukhumad Magomadov, wearing only flip-flops and indoor clothing, opened the door and was immediately forced into the car and driven away to an unknown destination.
After the aforementioned events, Ms Z.M. made several calls to her son’s mobile telephone, but he did not answer. Later his telephone was turned off. On 9 December 2014 she received a text message from her mobile network stating that her son’s mobile telephone was on again. She tried to call him again, but to no avail.
On 7 December 2014 Mr I.M. asked the Grozny district police station to establish the whereabouts of Mr Mukhumad Magomadov. When questioned, he provided the police with a version of events similar to the applicant’s submissions to the Court and pointed out that his brother had been taken away in flip-flops even though it was winter.
On the same date the police examined the crime scene. No evidence was collected. They also questioned the applicant, Ms Z.M. and their neighbour, Mr K.U. The statements given by the applicant and Ms Z.M. were similar to the version of events submitted to the Court. Mr K.U. submitted that on the evening of 6 December 2014 he and his acquaintance Mr I.A. had seen a white Lada Priora car with a registration number containing the digits 646 95 travelling in the direction of the applicant’s house.
On 13 December 2014 Mr I.M. provided the investigators with Mr Mukhumad Magomadov’s mobile telephone number.
On 17 December 2014 the investigation was transferred to the Grozny inter-district investigative committee.
On 18, 19 and 22 December 2014 and 3 January 2015 respectively the investigators questioned Ms Z.M., Mr I.G., the applicant and Mr K.U. They confirmed their previous statements.
On 16 January 2015 the traffic police cooperated with the investigators’ request to provide them with the names of the owners of white Lada Priora cars with registration numbers containing the digits 646 95, officer R.T. and Mr R.S.
On 18 January 2015 officer R.T. was questioned by the investigators. In a short statement, he submitted in general terms that he was an officer of the security service of the Chechen Ministry of the Interior and that he did own a white Lada Priora car with the registration number noted by the investigators. When asked by the investigators if he had an alibi for the time of the abduction, he replied:
“Because of the events of 4 December 2014, that is to say the attack [by members of an illegal armed group] on the Press House, I had been on twenty-four-hour duty at my workplace with my colleagues. I had not left.”
The investigators did not ask any further questions regarding that night. Officer R.T. also stated that he had not lent his car to anybody that day.
That same day, the investigators refused to open a criminal case into the incident for lack of evidence of a crime. The applicant challenged that decision in court (see paragraphs 50 and 51 below).
On 10 August 2015 the applicant asked the investigators to allow her access to the case file. Her request was granted the next day.
On 17 November 2015 the decision not to open a criminal case was overruled by the deputy head of the Grozny inter-district investigative committee because the investigators had failed to question Mr I.A. and Mr R.S. and obtain information related to Mr Mukhumad Magomadov’s mobile telephone.
On 24 November 2015 the investigators questioned Mr I.A., who gave evidence similar to that given by Mr K.U. (see paragraph 11 above).
On 27 November 2015 the investigators again refused to open a criminal case.
On 25 March 2016 the deputy head of the Chechnya investigative committee overruled the above decision as unlawful and ill-founded. It ordered the investigators to take a number of steps, including a thorough examination of the crime scene (using a camera and GPS), collecting a DNA sample from Ms Z.M. and ordering a DNA test, questioning Mr  Magomadov’s neighbours and Mr R.S., searching the two Lada Priora cars, and checking if Mr Mukhumad Magomadov was suspected of any criminal activity.
On 6 April 2016 the investigators re-examined the crime scene and took photographs, which were joined to the case file.
Between 6 and 8 April 2016 the investigators sent a number of requests to various law-enforcement authorities to establish Mr Mukhumad Magomadov’s whereabouts. No new information was received.
On 14 April 2016 Ms Z.M. gave a blood sample to the investigators, who ordered a DNA test the same day.
On the same date the investigators refused to open a criminal case for a third time.
On 15 April 2017 the deputy Chechen prosecutor overruled that decision, criticising the investigators’ failure to verify the accuracy of officer R.T.’s statement and question Mr R.S.
On 21 April 2017 the investigators’ superiors ordered that the investigators take a number of steps, including a re-examination of the crime scene, obtaining a photograph of Mr Mukhumad Magomadov and information about his telephone calls, granting Ms Z.M. victim status in the proceedings, questioning Mr Mukhumad Magomadov’s neighbours, friends and colleagues, as well as Mr R.S., and obtaining information about Mr Mukhumad Magomadov’s personality.
On 24 April 2017 the investigators granted the applicant victim status in the proceedings and questioned her and Ms Z.M. They both confirmed their previous statements. Ms Z.M. pointed out that her son had had no intention of leaving the house. He had opened the door in flip-flops. His passport was still at home. The applicant added that her husband followed a traditional form of Islam.
On the same date the investigators examined the crime scene for a third time and also obtained a photograph of Mr Mukhumad Magomadov.
In May 2017 several of his neighbours were interviewed. None of them had seen the incident on 6 December 2014.
On 18 April 2017 the Grozny district police informed the investigators that Mr Mukhumad Magomadov had visited foreign countries, including Turkey in 2013, and “had a tendency to follow non-traditional forms of Islam”. Regard being had to the circumstances of his disappearance, and the above information, the Grozny district police suggested to the investigators that he might have joined an illegal armed group in Syria.
On 20 April 2017 the Grozny inter-district investigative committee opened a criminal case into the disappearance of Mr Mukhumad Magomadov under Article 126 § 2 of the Russian Criminal Code (aggravated abduction) under case no. 11702960008000021.
On 21 April 2017 the investigators drew up a plan of steps to be taken to verify several theories concerning the abduction – either that Mr Mukhumad Magomadov had been arrested by law-enforcement agencies, or had been abducted by private individuals (including members of an illegal armed group) on account of personal hostility, a blood feud, or an unpaid debt.
On 27 April 2017 the Grozny District Court granted the investigators’ request for access to Mr Mukhumad Magomadov’s mobile telephone data.
On 15 May 2017 the investigators questioned Mr I.M. again. He dismissed the theory that Mr Mukhumad Magomadov had joined an illegal armed group. He explained that Mr Magomadov had visited Turkey in 2013 to study Islam, however, owing to the civil unrest there, he had been unable to do so and had returned home.
On 18 May 2017 the investigators re-questioned Mr K.U. and Mr I.A., who confirmed their previous statements.
On various dates in May to June 2017 the investigators questioned residents of Sadovoye, who learned of the events of 6 December 2014 from Mukhumad Magomadov’s family.
On 22 May 2017 the investigators again questioned officer R.T. and invited him to undergo a psychophysiological examination (lie-detector test). He confirmed his previous statement (see paragraph 16 above) and refused to undergo the lie-detector test as he feared it would have a negative impact on his health. On 6 June 2017 the investigators requested the Chechen Minister of the Interior to launch an internal inquiry into the incident, noting that officer R.T.’s refusal to undergo the examination had breached professional ethics. The outcome of that inquiry is unknown.
On 23 May 2017 the investigators questioned Mr R.S., who confirmed that he had a Lada Priora car with a licence plate containing the digits 646 95, but that it was not white as it had a black roof and bonnet. He showed photographs of the vehicle to the investigators. He further stated that on the night of 6 to 7 December 2014 he had been at home. He did not know Mukhumad Magomadov and had never heard about his disappearance.
On 24 May 2017 the deputy head of the Grozny inter-district investigative committee ordered the investigators to question the head of the Grozny district police station, inspect the premises and check whether there were any CCTV cameras. The investigators were also instructed to examine the station’s detainee log books.
On 3 June 2017 the police informed the investigators that there was no one on their database of unidentified bodies matching Ms Z.M.’s DNA.
On 20 June 2017 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators.
On 30 June 2017 the investigation was resumed.
On 3 July 2017 the investigators received a list of the incoming and outgoing calls made to and from Mr Magomadov’s mobile telephone.
On 24 July 2017 the investigators questioned Mr R.S. for a second time, who confirmed his statement of 23 May 2017 (see paragraph 40 above).
On 26 and 28 July 2017 the investigators questioned officials from the local administration concerning Mukhumad Magomadov’s character. They stated that he was not a suspected member of any illegal armed groups.
In the meantime, the investigators sent several requests to establish whether travel tickets had been bought in Mr Magomadov’s name. The replies received did not confirm this.
On 30 July 2017 the investigation was suspended. It appears that it is still ongoing.
On 17 August 2015 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Grozny District Court challenging the investigators’ refusal to institute criminal proceedings on 18 January 2015. On the same date the court dismissed it on the grounds that she had failed to comply with the formal procedural requirements.
On 16 November 2015 the applicant lodged another complaint. On 20 November 2015 the court rejected it as the refusal of 18 January 2015 had already been overruled by the investigators’ superiors (see paragraph 19 above). On 15 December 2015 the Supreme Court of Chechnya upheld that decision on appeal.
