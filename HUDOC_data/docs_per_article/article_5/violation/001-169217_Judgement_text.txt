The case originated in applications against Russia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on the various dates indicated in the appended table.
The applications were communicated to the Russian Government (“the Government”).
The list of applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table.
The applicants complained of inadequate conditions of their detention.
In applications nos. 37198/09, 29657/10 and 14181/15 the applicants also raised other complaints under the provisions of the Convention.
Having studied the terms of the Government’s unilateral declarations made in some cases, the Court considers that the proposed declarations do not provide a sufficient basis for concluding that respect for human rights does not require it to continue its examination of these applications. The declarations are therefore rejected.
