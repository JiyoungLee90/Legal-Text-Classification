The case originated in three applications (nos. 12854/13, 28570/13 and 76329/13) against the Republic of Azerbaijan lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Azerbaijani nationals, Mr Shahin Sahil oglu Mirzayev (“the first applicant”), Turgut Isa oglu Gambar (“the second applicant”) and Mr Ilkin Bakir oglu Rustamzade (“the third applicant”), on 22 January 2013, 27 March 2013 and 9 September 2013 respectively.
The first applicant, who had been granted legal aid, and the second applicant were represented by Mr R. Mustafazade and Mr A. Mustafayev, lawyers practising in Azerbaijan. The third applicant was represented by Mr N. Karimli, a lawyer practicing in Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Ç. Asgarov.
On 19 May 2014 (application no. 12854/13), 23 January 2015 (application no. 28570/13) and 20 November 2015 (application no. 76329/13) the complaints concerning Articles 5, 6, 10 and 11 of the Convention, raised in all three applications, Article 3 of the Convention, raised only in application no. 12854/13, and Article 7 of the Convention, raised only in applications nos. 12854/13 and 28570/13, were communicated to the Government. On the same dates the remainder of all three applications were declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicants’ dates of birth and places of residence are given in the Appendix.
At the material time the second applicant was a member of an opposition group Nida. The third applicant was a member of an opposition group İctimai Palata; he was also one of the organisers of several demonstrations held in Baku.
The first and the second applicants participated in a demonstration organised by the opposition on 20 October 2012. Prior to that assembly, on 15 October 2012, the organisers gave notice to the relevant authority, the Baku City Executive Authority (“the BCEA”). The BCEA refused to authorise the holding of the demonstration at the place indicated by the organisers and proposed a different location on the outskirts of Baku – the grounds of a driving school situated in the 20th residential area of the Sabail District. Nevertheless, the organisers decided to hold the demonstration as planned.
The second applicant also participated in demonstrations held on 12 January and 26 January 2013. The third applicant participated in a demonstration held on 30 April 2013. The organisers of those demonstrations gave no proper prior notice to the BCEA. Information about the demonstrations was disseminated on the internet or in the press.
According to the applicants, the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were conducted in a peaceful manner. The participants of the demonstration of 20 October 2012 were demanding democratic reforms in the country and free and fair elections, and protesting against impediments on freedom of assembly. The demonstration of 12 January was aimed at protesting about the deaths of soldiers in the army, while the demonstration of 26 January 2013 condemned the use of force by the police against the participants of previous demonstrations. The participants of the demonstration of 30 April 2013 were commemorating the victims of a terrorist attack which had been committed in 2009 at the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy.
The police began to disperse the demonstrations of 20 October 2012, 12 January, 26 January and 30 April 2013 as soon as the protesters began to gather.
The circumstances related to the dispersal of the demonstration of 20 October 2012, the first and second applicants’ arrests and custody, and subsequent administrative proceedings against them are similar to those in Gafgaz Mammadov v. Azerbaijan (no. 60259/11, 15 October 2015) (see also Appendix).
The circumstances related to the dispersal of the demonstrations of 12 January, 26 January and 30 April 2013, the second and third applicants’ arrests and custody, and the subsequent administrative proceedings against them are similar to those in Bayramov v. Azerbaijan ([Committee] nos. 19150/13 and 52022/13, 6 April 2017) (see also Appendix).
After the amendments introduced by Law no. 135-IVQD of 31 May 2011, which entered into force on 1 July 2011, Article 410 of the Code of Administrative Offences 2000 (“the CAO”) provided as follows:
“... 410.3.  A copy of the administrative offence report shall be given to an individual who is subject to the administrative offence proceedings or to a representative of a legal entity.
4. ... An aggrieved person in administrative offence proceedings has the right to a copy of the administrative offence report.”
For a summary of the other relevant provisions concerning administrative proceedings, the relevant provisions concerning freedom of assembly, the organisation and holding of public assemblies, and the relevant extracts from international documents and press releases, see the judgments in the cases of Gafgaz Mammadov (cited above, §§ 27-30, 33-35 and 37-42) and Abbasli v. Azerbaijan ([Committee] nos. 5417/13 and 73309/14, §§ 23-25 and 28-29, 16 February 2017).
