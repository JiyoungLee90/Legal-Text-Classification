The case originated in an application (no. 30385/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Dr Szabolcs Szerdahelyi (“the applicant”), on 4 June 2007.
The applicant was represented by Dr M. Róth, a lawyer practising in . The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr L. Höltzl, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
The applicant complained about the frustration of his right to peaceful assembly.
On 13 July 2009 the applicant died. The Registry was notified of this only on 23 August 2011, when Mr Szabolcs Szerdahelyi, the applicant’s son and only heir, stated his intention to replace his father in the proceedings before the Court.
Meanwhile, on 9 February 2011 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
On 5 November 2011 the applicant’s lawyer submitted that Mr Szerdahelyi had joined the pending domestic proceedings (see paragraph 12 below).
The applicant was born in 1943 and lived in .
On 24 November 2006 the applicant announced, as required by the Assembly Act 1989, to the Budapest Police Department his intention to organise a demonstration on 9 December 2006 on  in , in front of Parliament.
On 26 November 2006 the Budapest Police Department refused to deal with the application. It observed that on 23 October 2006 the area in question had been declared, by the Police Department itself and for an indefinite period of time, a “security operational zone” (biztonsági műveleti terület), in view of the tumultuous events in Budapest in September 2006. It was as such outside the Police Department’s jurisdiction as regards the prohibition of, or acquiescence in, a demonstration. On 6 December 2006 the  dismissed the applicant’s request for judicial review, observing in essence that no decision on the merits of the case had ever been adopted by the administrative authorities – which excluded such a review.
On 11 December 2006 the Deputy Head of the National Police Department dismissed the applicant’s further complaint. On 19 December 2006 the applicant filed an action with the , challenging the decisions of both 23 October and 11 December 2006.
On 11 January 2007 the Head of Budapest Police dismissed the applicant’s renewed complaint. On 12 February 2007 the Deputy Head of the National Police Department partly reversed this decision and instructed the Budapest Police Department to substitute the indefinite measure in question with one of definite duration. On 5 March 2007 the  dismissed the applicant’s ensuing action, essentially endorsing the police authorities’ earlier reasoning. It pointed out that the proceedings only concerned the police’s decision on non-competence and did not constitute review of the police’s original decision declaring  a “security operational zone”.
Upon a further complaint, on 18 March 2008 the  quashed the decisions of 11 January and 12 February 2007 and remitted the case to the National Police Department. In reaction to the applicant’s petition for review, on 29 April 2009 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of 18 March 2008 and remitted the case to the . The latter’s procedure was then interrupted on 1 October 2009 on account of the applicant’s death. The applicant’s son and heir joined the proceedings as successor on 25 August 2011.
The Government submitted that the subject matter of the litigation pending before the  was the police’s original decision declaring  a “security operational zone”.
In another case concerning the same area, on 29 January 2007 a Mr K. challenged the police’s very decision to declare  a “security operational zone”. On 14 March 2007 the Budapest Police Commander rejected his complaint, but this decision was quashed by the National Commander on 16 April 2007. In the resumed administrative proceedings, on 22 June 2007 the Budapest Commander again rejected the complaint. On 19 July 2007 the National Commander upheld this decision. Mr K. challenged this ruling in court.
Mr K.’s action was dismissed by the . However, on appeal the Supreme Court quashed this decision, together with the one of 19 July 2007.
In the resumed second-instance administrative proceedings, on 23 December 2009 the National Commander again upheld the Budapest Commander’s decision. Mr K. requested judicial review.
On 11 November 2010 the  quashed, in judgment no. 27.K.31.354/2010/9., both the first- and the second-instance administrative decisions and remitted the case to the Budapest Commander. The court pointed out that the impugned decisions did not contain any concrete elements establishing the necessity and proportionality of maintaining the “security operational zone” after the prolongation of 22 November 2006. Nor did they address the plaintiff’s suggestion that the mere fencing-off of Parliament’s immediate vicinity – rather than the global ban on  – would have been sufficient in the circumstances.
In the resumed first-instance administrative proceedings, on 4 April 2011 the Budapest Commander partly sustained Mr K.’s complaint, noting that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the proportionality of the impugned measure had successfully been challenged.
