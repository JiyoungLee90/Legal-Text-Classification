The case originated in an application (no. 35127/08) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr István Patyi (“the applicant”), on 24 July 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr I. Barbalics, a lawyer practising in . The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr L. Höltzl, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
The applicant complained about the frustration of his right to peaceful assembly.
On 15 February 2011 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in .
The applicant intended to organise demonstrations in order to call attention to the situation of those having sustained damage originating in a major bankruptcy case which had attracted considerable media attention in . On 5 February 2007 he applied to the Budapest Police Department for acquiescence in a demonstration on 10 March 2007 and in another one, of ongoing nature, from 10 March until 31 October 2007, both scheduled in , in front of Parliament.
On 7 February 2007 the Budapest Police Department refused to deal with either of the applications. It observed that on 23 October 2006 the area in question had been declared by the Police Department itself a “security operational zone” (biztonsági műveleti terület) in view of the tumultuous events in  in September 2006. Consequently, the measure – which was, after a prolongation, in place for an indefinite period of time – remained as such outside the Police Department’s competence as regards the prohibition of, or acquiescence in, a demonstration.
On 5 March 2007 the National Police Commander upheld this decision.
On 14 January 2008 the  dismissed the applicant’s request for judicial review, endorsing in essence the police authorities’ reasoning. This decision was served on 26 January 2008.
In another case concerning the same area, on 29 January 2007 a Mr K. challenged the police’s very decision to declare  a “security operational zone”. On 14 March 2007 the Budapest Police Commander rejected his complaint, but this decision was quashed by the National Commander on 16 April 2007. In the resumed administrative proceedings, on 22 June 2007 the Budapest Commander again rejected the complaint. On 19 July 2007 the National Commander upheld this decision. Mr K. challenged this ruling in court.
Mr K.’s action was dismissed by the . However, on appeal the Supreme Court quashed this decision, together with the one of 19 July 2007.
In the resumed second-instance administrative proceedings, on 23 December 2009 the National Commander again upheld the Budapest Commander’s decision. Mr K. requested judicial review.
On 11 November 2010 the  quashed, in judgment no. 27.K.31.354/2010/9., both the first- and the second-instance administrative decisions and remitted the case to the Budapest Commander. The court pointed out that the impugned decisions did not contain any concrete elements establishing the necessity and proportionality of maintaining the “security operational zone” after the prolongation of 22 November 2006. Nor did they address the plaintiff’s suggestion that the mere fencing-off of Parliament’s immediate vicinity – rather than the global ban on  – would have been sufficient in the circumstances.
In the resumed first-instance administrative proceedings, on 4 April 2011 the Budapest Commander partly sustained Mr K.’s complaint, noting that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the proportionality of the impugned measure had successfully been challenged.
