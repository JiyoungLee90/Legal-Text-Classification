They were arrested during the gathering and convicted of administrative offences.
The applicants’ details are set out in the appended table. The applicants were represented before the Court by Mr A. Savelyev, a lawyer practising in Domodedovo (no. 47800/14), the lawyers of the Memorial Human Rights Centre and the European Human Rights Advocacy Centre (EHRAC) (no. 67936/14), and Mr N.

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On the morning of 24 February 2014 the applicants among some 150 people came to the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow to attend the public delivery of the judgment in the criminal case concerning mass disorders at Bolotnaya Square in Moscow on 6 May 2012. However, the court-house was cordoned off by the police and the applicants could not enter. They remained outside among other members of the public aspiring to attend the hearing, thus forming a gathering (for more details about the gathering see Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], nos. 29580/12 and 4 others, §§ 3542, 15 November 2018). At different times the applicants were arrested and transferred to a police station.
Details as regards the administrative proceedings against each applicant are outlined in the Appendix.
Article 20.2 § 5 of the Code of Administrative Offences (CAO) provides that violation by a participant in a public event of the established procedure for conducting a public event is punishable with a fine of 10,000 to 20,000 roubles (RUB) or up to forty hours of community work.
For a summary of other relevant domestic provisions see Navalnyy v. Russia [GC] (cited above, §§ 46-47); Lashmankin and Others v. Russia (nos. 57818/09 and 14 others, §§ 223 and 226, 7 February 2017); and Korneyeva v. Russia (no. 72051/17, §§ 22-26, 8 October 2019).
