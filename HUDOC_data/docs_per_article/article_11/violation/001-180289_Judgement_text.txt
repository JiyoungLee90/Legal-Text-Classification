The case originated in an application (no. 27810/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Özgür Bektaşoğlu (“the applicant”), on 2 May 2009.
The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 23 April 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Erzincan.
The applicant was a civil servant in the Erzincan Provincial Directorate of Environment and Forestry, and at the time of the events he was a member of the local branch of a trade union affiliated to KESK (Kamu Emekçileri Sendikaları Konfederasyonu – Confederation of Public Employees’ Trade Unions).
On 27 November 2004 and 12 December 2004 respectively, the applicant participated in a press statement and a demonstration organised by his trade union.
Subsequently, a disciplinary investigation was initiated against the applicant for his participation in the above mentioned trade union activities.
On 31 August 2005 a disciplinary sanction in the form of a reduction in salary was imposed on the applicant for having participated in trade union activities.
On 27 October 2005 the applicant filed a petition with the Sivas Administrative Court and requested the annulment of the disciplinary sanction that had been imposed on him.
On 18 May 2006 the Sivas Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s request, considering that the administrative decision was in accordance with law and there were no grounds for its annulment.
On 20 October 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Sivas Administrative Court.
