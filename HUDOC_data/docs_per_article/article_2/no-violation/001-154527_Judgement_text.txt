The case originated in an application (no. 527/07) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Nikolay Yemelyanovich Volovod (“the applicant”), on 24 November 2006.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Olga Davydchuk.
On 17 February 2011 notice of the application was given to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1929 and lives in Krasnyy Liman. He had a son, V., who lived in Severodonetsk, Lugansk Region.
On the evening of 11 August 2002, V. was sitting in the courtyard of the apartment block in which he lived. At about 7.45 p.m. a man approached V., shot him in the head, and ran away. Several people witnessed the incident. V. died an hour later in hospital.
On the same date the police instituted a criminal investigation into the murder and questioned the eyewitnesses, who stated that the killer had been 25-30 years old and around 175-180 centimetres tall. He had been wearing sunglasses, dark jeans, a red T-shirt and a cap.
On the same date the police examined the crime scene, found the bullet and sent it for forensic examination, and collected fingerprints and biological material.
On 12 August 2002 the police searched V.’s apartment and questioned his wife, T. She did not know who might have wanted to kill V. or for what reason. He never spoke to her about his business or other activities.
On the same date the forensic experts established that V. had been shot with a TT pistol.
On 13 August 2002 the police questioned K.Y., who had previously stolen money from V., and established that he had an alibi for the period of time when V. had been murdered. His fingerprints did not match those found on the crime scene. The police thus concluded that K.Y. was not involved in the murder.
On the same date the police questioned employees of the bar owned by V., who stated that on 10 August 2002 P. – a member of the criminal gang led by a certain Bo. – had been looking for the applicant’s son. P. was 25-30 years old and 180 centimetres tall.
The Severodonetsk Prosecutors’ Office established that P. had been wanted by the police since 1999 as they suspected that he had killed a certain L. with a TT pistol on Bo.’s instructions. The Office concluded that P. might have been involved in V.’s murder and declared P. and Bo. wanted.
On 14 August 2002 the police recognised T. as an injured party to the proceedings. The next day, it identified the telephone numbers from which V. had received calls on the day of his death and proceeded to identify the names and whereabouts of the people who had called him.
On 16 August 2002, V.’s business partner K. was questioned. He stated that Bo. had threatened V. with violence. On the same date a list of Bo.’s acquaintances was drawn up which included P. (see paragraph 11 above), Lu., Kl., Lit., Kr. and R.
In August 2002 the police established that there was no match between the fingerprints of Kl., Lit., Kr. and P. and those found on and near the crime scene. The police searched Lit.’s home and seized his clothes. The clothes were later destroyed, not being needed as evidence.
On 23 and 26 August 2002 the police searched the apartments of V.’s acquaintances, but found no evidence that they might have been involved in his murder.
On 27 August 2002 K. was questioned again. He said that a certain Vo. and Bu. both worked for Bo. After V.’s murder, Bo. had called K. and had threatened that he would be “broken”.
The police searched Vo.’s home, but found no evidence of his involvement in V.’s killing.
On 5 September 2002 the police showed the eyewitnesses several persons suspected of the murder, including Vo. The witnesses did not recognise the man who had shot V. amongst them.
By 2 October 2002 the police had identified and questioned everyone who had called V. on 10 and 11 August 2002. There was no evidence that any of them had been involved in the murder.
Later in October 2002, the police found the TT pistol with which V. had been killed in the possession of a certain Sh. The latter explained that he had bought the gun in September 2002 from A., a boy aged under 18.
The police questioned A., who stated that he had found the gun and some sunglasses on 12 August 2002 near garages in Lisichansk Town. He had subsequently sold the gun to Sh.
The police questioned the owners of the garages and individuals living near the garages. None of them had seen who had left the gun near the garages. There was no evidence that the boy, Sh., or the garage owners had known Bo. or V. or had had a motive for killing V.
On 22 October 2002 the police questioned Lit., who said that he knew nothing about the murder.
During November 2002 the police continued questioning V.’s acquaintances and checking whether their biological material and fingerprints matched those found at the crime scene.
On 14 November 2002 the police collected blood and saliva from Lu. and a certain Buk., whom the eyewitnesses had seen near the crime-scene on 11 August 2002. They also questioned Lu., who stated that on 11 August 2002 he had been in hospital, where many people had seen him. Lu. did not know anything about the murder.
The forensic medical examination established that both Lu. and Buk. might have smoked one of the cigarettes found near the crime scene.
On 22 November 2002 the police organised an identity parade and showed Sh. to the eyewitnesses of the murder. However, they did not identify him as the man who had shot V.
On 25 February 2003 the police suspended the investigation on the grounds that it had proved impossible to establish who had committed the murder.
On 5 August 2003 the investigation was resumed but suspended again on 8 August 2003.
On 27 October 2003 the Lugansk Regional Prosecutor quashed the decision to suspend the investigation, observing that it was necessary to carry out “additional investigative measures”. However, he did not specify what those measures were. The case was sent to the Severodonetsk Prosecutors’ Office for further investigation.
On 27 November 2003 the police arrested Bo. within the framework of the investigation into the murder of L. (see paragraph 12 above). In December 2003 it questioned Bo. in connection with the death of V. He stated that V. had been his friend, and he had known nothing about his killing.
In 2004 the Severodonetsk Prosecutors’ Office examined a number of witnesses who had been questioned earlier and collected information about people who had stayed in hotels in Severodonetsk on 11 and 12 August 2002.
On 29 September 2004 the prosecutors prepared a plan of additional investigative measures to be carried out. In particular, they suspected that V. had been involved in illegal metal trafficking and proposed finding his partners in that business. It was also planned to question Ly. with whom the applicant’s son had had “tense relations”, and to find and question Lu., Li. and R.
On an unspecified date the prosecutors questioned Ly. and K. and found no evidence that they had been involved in V.’s murder. K. and several other of V.’s acquaintances who were questioned by the police denied that the applicant’s son had been involved in any illegal business, including metal trafficking.
On 25 May 2005 the Severodonetsk Prosecutors’ Office suspended the investigation, stating that despite all the measures taken it had proved impossible to find V.’s killer.
On 2 August 2005 the police arrested P. within the framework of investigation into the death of L. (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above).

On 15 October 2005 it showed P.’s photo to the eyewitnesses of V.’s killing. They were unable to say whether it was P. who had shot V. because the murder had occurred a long time before.
The Severodonetsk Prosecutors’ Office informed the police that since July 2005 a certain F. had been wanted for killing H. with a TT pistol in the Lugansk Region. The prosecutors instructed the police to check whether F. could have been involved in V.’s murder.

The Severodonetsk Police were ordered to: i) show photos of F. to the eyewitnesses; ii) search the homes of R., Lu. and Li.; iii) investigate whether Sh. might have been involved in V.’s murder; iv) continue to search for persons who might have been involved in the murder.
On 2 June 2008 the Severodonetsk Police suspended the investigation, stating that it had proved impossible to find V.’s killer. On 1 September 2008 the proceedings were resumed but were suspended once again on 30 September 2008.
On 29 May 2009 the Lugansk Regional Prosecutor’s Office quashed the decision of 30 September 2008, stating that not all the necessary measures had been taken in order to investigate the murder. The case was submitted to the Severodonetsk Prosecutors’ Office for further investigation.
