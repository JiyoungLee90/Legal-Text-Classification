The applicants are all Romanian nationals. The applicants’ personal details and the dates of their respective applications are set out in the appended table.
The applicants were all represented before the Court by Mr Ionuț Matei, a lawyer practising in Bucharest. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 14 February 2014 the applicants’ complaints concerning the effectiveness of the criminal investigation, the length of criminal proceedings and the lack of an effective domestic remedy were communicated to the Government. The remaining complaints were declared inadmissible by the President of the Section, sitting in a single-judge formation. In so far as Ms Iulia Antoanella Motoc, the judge elected in respect of Romania, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 § 3 of the Rules of the Court), the President decided to appoint Mr Krzysztof Wojtyczek to sit as an ad hoc judge (Rule 29).
The parties submitted written observations.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, are similar to those in Association “21 December 1989” and Others v. Romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 May 2011). They have the same historical context and relate to the same domestic criminal proceedings.
Between 17 and 28 December 1989, many people, including the applicants and the close relatives involved in this case, took part in anticommunist demonstrations in Bucharest, Timișoara, Slobozia, Vișina and Țăndărei, which led to the fall of the communist regime. They were injured or killed by gunfire during the demonstrations, which took place on 17 December 1989 in Timișoara, and in Bucharest and other cities across the country from 21 to 28 December 1989.
In 1990, following the overthrow of the communist regime, the military prosecutor’s office opened a criminal investigation into the December 1989 armed crackdown on the anti-communist demonstrations in Bucharest and the other cities.
In a number of cases concerning the events in Timișoara, the investigations culminated in referral to the courts and the conviction of senior military officers (see Şandru and Others v. Romania, no. 22465/03, §§ 6-47, 8 December 2009).
As regards the events in other cities, the criminal investigation is still pending before the prosecuting authorities. The most important procedural steps were summarised in Association “21 December 1989” and Others (cited above, §§ 12-41). Subsequent developments in the investigation are as follows.
On 18 October 2010, the military prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice decided not to institute criminal proceedings with regard to the acts committed by the military, finding that the applicants’ complaints were partly statute-barred and partly ill-founded. The investigation into crimes committed by civilians, members of Patriotic Guards, members of militia and prison staff was severed from the case file and jurisdiction was relinquished in favour of the prosecuting authorities at the High Court of Cassation and Justice.
On 15 April 2011 the chief prosecutor at the military prosecutor’s office set aside the decision of 18 October 2010 on the grounds that the investigation had not yet been finalised and that not all the victims and perpetrators had been identified.
On 18 April 2011 the military prosecutor’s office relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice on the grounds that the investigation concerned both civilians and military personnel.
On 9 March 2012 - following the opening of the classified information in the criminal investigation file to the public in 2010 - the case was re-registered with a view to an investigation in the light of the newly available data.
Following the entry into force of the new Code of Criminal Procedure in February 2014, jurisdiction over the case was relinquished in favour of the military prosecutor’s office.
On 14 October 2015, the prosecutor’s office closed the investigation, finding that the applicants’ complaints were partly statute-barred, partly subject to an amnesty and partly ill-founded. It also found that some of the facts which had been investigated could not be classified as criminal offences; and that some of the facts were res judicata. The parties have not submitted any information on whether there was an appeal against that decision.
The legal provisions and relevant domestic practice in relation to the criminal proceedings in connection with the events of December 1989 and respectively to the statutory limitation of criminal liability are detailed in Acatrinei and Others v. Romania, (no. 10425/09 and 71 other cases, §§ 1617, 26 March 2013); Association “21 December 1989” and Others (cited above, §§ 101-107); Alecu and Others v. Romania, (no. 56838/08 and 80 other cases, §§ 15-17, 27 January 2015); and Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09, 45886/07 and 32431/08, §§ 193-196, ECHR 2014 (extracts).
The statutory provisions regarding military prosecutors in Law no. 54/1993 on the organisation of military courts and prosecutor’s offices have been abolished by Law no. 247/2005 on reforms in the field of property, justice and other ancillary measures, which came into force on 25 July 2005.
Currently, the statute of the military prosecutors is regulated by Law no. 303/2004, on the Statute of judges and prosecutors, and by Law no. 304/2004, on the organization of the judicial system, both amended by Law no. 255/2013, on enactment of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which also amended regulatory acts relating to provisions for criminal offences.
Conversely to Law no. 54/1993, pursuant to the current Statute of the judges and prosecutors, the appointment system in a function of military prosecutor provides that a person must meet the conditions set by law to enter the judiciary, on the confirmation of the Ministry of National Defence in respect of compliance with the legal prerequisites for undertaking duties of an active duty officer. The appointment as a military prosecutor, the transfer from a civil prosecutor’s office to the military prosecutor’s office and the conferment of military ranks are governed by joined Rules of the High Council of the Judiciary and the Ministry of National Defence, in force as of 6 February 2014 (Article 32). The career of the military prosecutors is regulated by the statute of the judges and prosecutors (Article 105). The military prosecutors are active duty officers and they enjoy the corresponding benefits (Article 74), they are disciplinarily liable based on the statutory provisions concerning judges and prosecutors, the military discipline not being applicable to them (Article 98).
Pursuant to Law no. 304/2004, the Ministry of National Defence is the manager of the budget of the military prosecutor’s office. The annual budget project is designed, after consulting the military prosecutor’s office, by the relevant section from the Prosecutor General Office of the High Court of Cassation and Justice and is transmitted to the manager of the budget; annually, the Government includes the necessary financial funds in the budget of the Ministry of National Defence (Articles 131 and 132).
