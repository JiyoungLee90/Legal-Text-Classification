The case originated in seventeen applications (nos. 24093/14, 24104/14, 24106/14, 24108/14, 24113/14, 24119/14, 24121/14 24124/14, 24127/14, 24149/14, 24159/14, 24160/14, 24170/14, 24185/14, 24214/14, 45779/14 and 45780/14) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by seventeen Romanian nationals. Their names and other details, as well as the date of lodging of each application, are specified in the appended table.
The applicants were represented by Mr I. Matei, a lawyer practising in Bucharest. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In so far as Ms Iulia Antoanella Motoc, the judge elected in respect of Romania, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 § 3 of the Rules of Court), the President decided to appoint Mr Krzysztof Wojtyczek to sit as an ad hoc judge (Rule 29).
The applicants alleged, in particular, that there had been no effective investigation into the violent suppression of anti-government demonstrations in December 1989 in which their relatives had been killed.
On 10 October 2014 and 10 February 2015 these complaints were communicated to the Government and the remaining complaints were declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The parties submitted written observations.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, are similar to those in Association “21 December 1989” and Others v. Romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 May 2011). They have the same historical context and relate to the same domestic criminal proceedings. They can be summarised as follows:
On 17 December 1989, following demonstrations against the Government and on the orders of President Nicolae Ceauşescu, military operations were conducted in Timișoara and, over the following days, in other towns, including Bucharest, Reșița and Braşov. These operations caused many civilian deaths and casualties.
According to a document of 5 June 2008, issued by the military prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice, “more than 1,200 people died, more than 5,000 people were injured and several thousand people were unlawfully deprived of their liberty and subjected to ill treatment”, in Bucharest, Timişoara, Reşiţa, Buzău, Constanţa, Craiova, Brăila, Oradea, Cluj, Braşov, Târgu Mureş, Sibiu and other towns in Romania. In addition, it appears from Ministry of Defence documents, declassified by Government decision no. 94/2010 of 10 February 2010, that thousands of servicemen, equipped with combat tanks and other armed vehicles, were deployed in Bucharest and other cities. During the period of 17 to 30 December 1989 they used considerable quantities of ammunition against the demonstrators.
The applicants are people whose relatives were shot and killed in the events which took place between 17 and 30 December in Bucharest, except for the applicant in application no. 45779/14, whose husband was killed in Reșița and the applicant in application no. 24127/14, whose son was killed in Braşov.
In 1990, military prosecutors in Bucharest, Timişoara, Oradea, Constanţa, Craiova, Bacău, Târgu Mureş and Cluj opened investigations into the use of force and the unlawful deprivation of liberty of the participants in demonstrations in the final days of December 1989. To date, the main criminal investigation into the use of violence, particularly against civilian demonstrators, both prior to and following the overthrow of Nicolae Ceauşescu, has been contained in file no. 97/P/1990 (current number 11/P/2014). The most important procedural steps undertaken between 1990 and 2009 were summarised in Association “21 December 1989” and Others (cited above, §§ 12-41). Subsequent developments are described below.
On 18 October 2010 the military prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice decided not to institute criminal proceedings with regard to the acts committed by the military, finding that the applicants’ complaints were partly statute-barred and partly ill-founded. The investigation into crimes committed by civilians, members of the Patriotic Guards, militia members and prison staff was severed from the case file and jurisdiction was relinquished in favour of the prosecuting authorities at the High Court of Cassation and Justice.
On 15 April 2011 the chief prosecutor at the military prosecutor’s office set aside the decision of 18 October 2010 on the grounds that the investigation had not yet been finalised and that not all the victims and perpetrators had been identified.
On 18 April 2011 the military prosecutor’s office relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice on the grounds that the investigation concerned both civilians and military personnel.
On 9 March 2012 – after classified material in the criminal investigation file had been opened to the public in 2010 – the case was
In February 2014, after the entry into force of the new Code of Criminal Procedure, jurisdiction was again relinquished in favour of the military prosecuting authorities and the file was registered under the domestic case file no. 11/P/2014.
By an ordinance of 14 October 2015, the prosecuting authorities at the High Court of Cassation and Justice discontinued the proceedings in relation to case file no. 11/P/2014. The parties have not submitted any information on whether there was an appeal against that decision.
The Court’s judgments in Association “21 December 1989” and Others (cited above, §§ 95-107) and Mocanu and Others v. Romania ([GC], nos. 10865/09, 45886/07 and 32431/08, §§ 193-196, 17 September 2014) describe in detail the relevant domestic law and practice in relation to the criminal proceedings in connection with the events of December 1989 and respectively to the statutory limitation of criminal liability.
The relevant legislative enactments concerning the independence and impartiality of military prosecutors are the following.
Article 105 specifies that the provisions of the above Law apply equally to civilian and military judges and prosecutors.
Article 3 provides that prosecutors enjoy stability of employment and are independent, by virtue of the law. Article 75 of the Law provides that the High Council of the Judiciary has the right and the obligation to defend all prosecutors and judges against any act which might affect their independence or impartiality or that might raise any suspicions in that regard. Judges and prosecutors who consider that their independence or impartiality has been affected in any way by acts which interfere with their professional activity can ask the High Council of the Judiciary to take the necessary measures, in accordance with the law.
Pursuant to Articles 31 and 32 of the Law, military prosecutors and judges are appointed by the State President, on a proposal by the High Council of the Judiciary, after obtaining the assent of the Ministry of Defence. Every aspect of the appointment, transfer and promotion of military prosecutors and judges is covered by a joint regulation of the High Council of the Judiciary and the Ministry of Defence.
Article 98 § 2 of the Law states that proceedings entailing any possibility of disciplinary action against military prosecutors and judges can only be pursued in accordance with the provisions of the Law. In accordance with Article 101, disciplinary measures are applied by the High Council of the Judiciary.
Article 65 states that prosecutors and judges can only be dismissed in accordance with the general conditions laid down in the Law.
Chapter I of Law no 304/2004 provides that the military court system is part of the Romanian judicial system. Articles 51 to 56 of the Law list the military courts and describe their structure and powers, whilst Articles 98 to 102 detail the structure and functioning of the military prosecutors’ offices.
Chapter I of the joint regulation provides that the High Council of the Judiciary is in charge of appointing military prosecutors and judges. Article 3 states that the assent from the Ministry of Defence is to be granted on the basis of a medical examination of the appointee, including a physical training assessment and a psychological evaluation.
Article 56 § 4 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure states that it is mandatory for military prosecutors to investigate crimes committed by military officers.
Article 339 § 4 states that an appeal against ordinances discontinuing proceedings can be made within twenty days of the date they are communicated.
The last decision concerning the execution of the judgment in the case of Association “21 December 1989” and Others (cited above), adopted by the Committee of Ministers on June 2014 at the 1201st meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies, invited the Romanian authorities to respond to the criticism made by the Court in its judgment concerning the impugned investigation. The relevant parts of the decision are worded as follows:
“The Deputies
noted that, in these cases, the European Court found that certain aspects of the national legislation governing the status of the military magistrates cast doubt on the institutional and hierarchical independence of military prosecutors, when the persons under investigation belong to the armed forces or to other military forces;
invited the Romanian authorities to carry out rapidly a thorough assessment of the consequences to be drawn from these findings, as regards the general and individual measures in these cases, and to keep the Committee of Ministers informed of the conclusions and of the measures that might be defined and adopted in the light of this assessment;
invited, moreover, the authorities to present an assessment of the general measures that might be necessary to ensure that, in the future, bodies holding information on facts that are the subject of such investigations, co-operate fully with the investigators; ...”
