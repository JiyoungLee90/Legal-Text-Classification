The case originated in an application (no. 19809/11) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by the seventy-six applicants listed in the appended table (“the applicants”) on 25 February 2011.
The applicants were represented by the Committee Against Torture, a nongovernmental organisation based in Nizhniy Novgorod. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr M. Galperin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 30 August 2017 the Government were given notice of the complaints under Articles 2 and 13 and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants are Russian nationals, except for the sixth and the eighth applicants who are the nationals of Kazakhstan. The applicants’ personal details and their respective complaints are set out in the appended table.
At the material time the applicants were resident in the village of Elistanzhi in the Vedeno district, the Chechen Republic. They submitted that they and their relatives were victims of the aerial attack by the Russian military on 7 October 1999. The Government did not contest the account of events as submitted by the applicants.
Aerial attacks in Chechnya have been examined by the Court in a number of judgments, such as Isayeva v. Russia (no. , 24 February 2005), Abuyeva and Others v. Russia (no. , 2 December 2010), Kerimova and Others v. Russia (nos. 17170/04 and 5 others, 3 May 2011), and Abakarova v. Russia (no. 16664/07, 15 October 2015). Those applications were lodged by residents of settlements in Chechnya, who alleged that their relatives had been killed or wounded and that they themselves had suffered injuries during airstrikes in 1999 and 2000.
Between midday and 1 p.m. on 7 October 1999 the village of Elistanzhi was subjected to an airstrike by Russian military forces. A number of buildings, including the local school, were destroyed in the attack. The applicants submitted a list of thirty-five residents of the village who were killed during the airstrike or died of wounds shortly afterwards, and a list of another sixty persons who survived the attack but sustained various injuries.
On 14 December 2000 the Vedeno district prosecutor’s office (hereinafter “the district prosecutor’s office”) opened criminal case no. 36039 to investigate the circumstances of the bombing on 7 October 1999, which had resulted in the death of a relative of the fourth to seventh applicants, Mr Ramazan Appazov.
From the documents submitted it is apparent that no steps were taken to investigate the case between 1999 and 2007 as the case file was either lost or destroyed by fire. According to some of the documents furnished to the Court, the district prosecutor’s office forwarded the criminal case file to the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20102 for investigation on 14 December 2000, and it was subsequently lost there. According to other documents submitted to the Court, there was a fire on the premises of the district prosecutor’s office on 17 December 2002 which destroyed, amongst other things, the investigation file in the criminal case.
On 24 November 2006 the Vedeno district prosecutor’s office requested the military prosecutor’s office that criminal case no. 36039 be restored. The letter referred to the enquiry of Mr B., a lawyer representing Mr Ramazan Appazov’s relative Ms A. Tasuyeva.
On various dates in 2007 Mr B. asked the prosecutor’s office to provide information on the progress of the proceedings.
On 5 September 2007 the case file was restored.
On 6 September 2007 the investigation of the criminal case was transferred to the Shali inter-district investigations department of the Investigative Committee of the prosecutor’s office (hereinafter “the investigators”).
On 9 September 2007 the investigators requested that the military commander of the Vedeno district and the Central Archive of Russian Ministry of Defence provide them with information indicating whether any special operations had been conducted in Elistanzhi on 7 October 1999 by the Russian military air force and, if so, which military units had been involved, and under whose command. No reply to these requests was forthcoming.
On an unspecified date in 2007 Ms Tasuyeva was granted victim status in the criminal case.
On 5 October 2007 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators.
On 22 December 2007 Mr B. requested that the investigators allow him to access the contents of the investigation file. On 22 February 2008 his request was granted and he was allowed access to the file on an unspecified date in March 2008.
On 2 April 2008 Mr B. lodged an appeal against the suspension of the proceedings with the investigators’ superiors, stating that it was unlawful and premature. In particular, he stated that the investigation had not established the full list of persons who had died as the result of the shelling and that numerous survivors had been neither questioned nor granted victim status in the proceedings nor informed of their progress. He pointed out that the only person questioned by the investigators had been Ms Tasuyeva and that neither the sixty-odd wounded persons nor the relatives of the more than thirty residents killed during the attack had been questioned. No information concerning the military units which had participated in the aerial attack had been provided, nor had their commanders been identified. He also pointed out that the medical documentation concerning the victims of the attack, certifying that their deaths and/or the injuries had been caused by bombing, had not been analysed and added to the investigation file. Referring to the Court’s caselaw concerning Article 2 of the Convention, the lawyer requested that the investigators take prompt steps to establish and prosecute those responsible for the aerial attack.
On 14 April 2008 the investigation was resumed.
On various dates between 14 April and 14 May 2008 seven applicants were granted victim status in the criminal proceedings and were questioned. They gave their account of the bombing of Elistanzhi and the losses they sustained in the attack of 7 October 1999.
On 14 May 2008 the investigation was suspended again. Seven applicants were informed about the suspension.
On an unspecified date between 15 May and 17 August 2008 the investigators received instructions from their superiors in the procedural control department of the Chechnya Investigative Committee ordering them to carry out a number of actions, including a crime-scene examination. Those orders were not complied with.
On 18 August 2008 the investigators resumed the investigation and decided to transfer the file to military investigations department no. 506 of military unit no. 68798 on the basis that it was a criminal case against military service personnel which fell within the jurisdiction of military investigations departments.
On 26 August 2008 the transfer of the investigation was overruled by the investigators’ superiors and the case file was returned to the investigators in view of their failure to carry out a number of essential actions, such as establishing the identity of all the village residents who had been killed during the bombing, obtaining medical documents certifying the injuries of those who had been wounded during the attack, questioning key witnesses, and the lack of forensic expert evaluations.
On 18 September 2008 the investigators suspended the proceedings again.
On 11 November 2008 (or on 19 November 2008, according to some documents) the Vedeno prosecutor criticised the investigation in the criminal case. He stated that it had been incomplete and that the decision to suspend the proceedings had been unlawful and premature. In particular, he stressed that the investigators had failed to execute their superiors’ orders, such as conducting a crime-scene examination, and ordered that the investigation be resumed. On 24 November 2008 it was resumed.
On various dates in 2008-14 a number of individuals including twenty-five applicants were granted victim status in the criminal case.
On 24 December 2008 the investigation was suspended again. Nine of the applicants were informed of the suspension. However, on 11 January 2009 it was resumed again on the orders of the investigators’ superiors, as it had been suspended prematurely. In particular, it was pointed out that the investigators had failed to carry out the actions ordered on 26 August 2008 such as establishing the identity of all the village residents who had been killed during the bombing, and obtaining medical documents certifying the injuries of those who had been wounded during the attack.
On 14 February 2009 the investigation was suspended again. It appears that some of the applicants were informed thereof.
On 25 March 2009 the deputy head of the Shali investigations department criticised the investigators for their failure to comply with the previously issued instructions and ordered that the proceedings be resumed. The relevant part of the decision stated as follows:
“ ... [A]lthough the investigation file contains information concerning the presence of an unexploded bomb, launched on the day of the attack from one of the aeroplanes, and lying on the property of Mr A. Artsuyev, at a depth of 2 metres below ground, the investigation has taken no steps to seize and examine that projectile; not all of the victims of the bombing have been identified and questioned, nor have expert forensic evaluations been commissioned in this regard. Moreover, the orders of 26 August 2008 have not been executed ...”
On 27 April 2009 the investigation was suspended. Nine of the applicants were informed of the suspension.
On 3 August 2009 the lawyer Mr B. appealed against the suspension of the investigation to the Vedeno District Court. He stated that the investigators had not established the identity of all of the thirty-five residents who had died as result of the attack or of the more than fifty people who had been injured; despite the fact that several residents had been granted victim status in the criminal case, they had not been informed of any of the developments in the proceedings. He further pointed out that the investigation had still neither examined the crime scene nor collected the unexploded projectiles lying in Mr Artsuyev’s (applicant no. 8) courtyard and the local school building. He pointed out that the victims of the attack had medical documentation confirming that their injuries had been sustained as a result of the bombing. Furthermore, referring to Article 2 of the Convention and the relevant case-law, the lawyer stated that the investigation had been ineffective, requested that it be resumed and the actions ordered by the investigators’ superiors be taken. Lastly, he stated that the victims would lodge an application with the Court should the authorities continue to fail to investigate the matter effectively.
On 21 August 2009 the Vedeno District Court allowed the lawyer’s complaint and ordered the investigators to establish the identities of all of the victims of the bombing, both killed and injured. It also ordered that the investigators examine the crime scene, seize the unexploded projectiles and obtain information from the Central Archives of the Ministry of Defence, from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and from the Federal Security Service concerning any special operation linked to the airstrike on Elistanzhi on 7 October 1999.
On 21 August 2009 the investigation was resumed. Nine applicants were informed about it. It was suspended again on 21 September 2009, of which ten applicants were informed. It appears that none of the actions ordered by the court were carried out.
On an unspecified date in October or November 2009 Mr B. appealed against that suspension to the Vedeno District Court. On 29 December 2009 the investigation was resumed again and on 30 December 2009 the Vedeno District Court therefore rejected the appeal as unsubstantiated.
On 28 January 2010 the investigation was suspended again.
On 31 March 2010 the lawyer Mr B. requested that the investigators allow him access to the investigation file. On 1 April 2010 his request was granted.
On an unspecified date between April and August 2010 Mr B. again appealed against the suspension of the proceedings, but this time to the head of the Chechnya investigations committee. He requested that the investigators’ supervisors examine the lawfulness and the grounds for the suspension. His complaint was left without examination.
On 25 August 2010 the investigation was resumed yet again and the case file was forwarded to the Chechnya investigations committee for a decision regarding its transfer to the military investigators.
On 17 December 2010 Mr B. requested that the investigators inform him of the outcome of his complaint concerning the unlawfulness of the suspension of the criminal proceedings.
On 22 December 2010 Mr B. was informed that the investigation of the criminal case had been transferred to military investigations department no. 506 of military unit no. 68798.
On 12 March 2011 the investigations committee transferred the criminal case no. 36039 for further investigation to the military investigations department of the Southern Military Circuit in Khankala (case file no. 14/90/0053-11).
On 14 March 2011, in reply to his request of 31 January 2011, Mr B. was informed by military investigations department no. 506 that on 11 January 2011 they had transferred the criminal case for further investigation to the 3rd military investigations department of the Southern Military Circuit in Khankala.
On 28 March 2011 Mr B. requested that the military investigations department of the Southern Military Circuit in Khankala inform him of the progress made in the investigation of the criminal case.
On 31 March 2011 the military investigations department in Khankala refused to provide any information concerning the investigation as the criminal case file did not contain an authority form certifying that the lawyer could represent victims of the bombing.
On 4 April 2011 the investigation in the criminal case was suspended again.
On unidentified dates in 2014 Major N., an investigator of the military investigations department of the Southern Military Circuit, ordered the forensic examination of several victims in criminal case no. 14/90/005311, including some of the applicants. On 13-21 May 2014 the experts issued the respective forensic reports confirming the injuries sustained during the airstrike of 7 October 1999. These forensic reports were relied on in the civil proceedings brought by the applicants indicated in the appended list.
On 28 March 2014 the Leninskiy District Court of Groznyy allowed a civil claim brought by Ms Gekhayeva (applicant no. 36), having established the circumstances of the airstrike of 7 October 1999. On various dates between 22 May and 5 June 2014 the same court examined civil claims for damages brought by a number of individuals including the applicants indicated in the annex. It referred to its judgment of 28 March 2014 as regards the circumstances of the airstrike, and on the basis of the death certificates it established that the plaintiffs had either lost close family members in the airstrike on 7 October 1999, or had been injured, or both. They were awarded compensation of between 400,000 Russian roubles (RUB) and RUB 1,400,000 on the basis of the Countering Terrorism Act and the Government’s Decree of 15 February 2014 no. 10 regulating budgetary allocations for disaster relief.
On 23 July 2014 criminal case file no. 36039 was classified as confidential. It appears that the investigation into the circumstances of the bombing of Elistanzhi on 7 October 1999 is still pending.
