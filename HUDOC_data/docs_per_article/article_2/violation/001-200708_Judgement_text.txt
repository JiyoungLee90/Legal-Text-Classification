The case originated in an application (no. 40394/10) against Georgia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Georgian national, Ms Mariam Sakvarelidze (“the applicant”), on 18 June 2010.
The applicant was represented successively by Ms T. Avaliani and Ms N. Londaridze, lawyers practising in Tbilisi. The Georgian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Meskhoradze, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant complained that the respondent State had been responsible for a road traffic accident which had cost the lives of her son and sister, and that the subsequent criminal investigation had been ineffective.
On 4 June 2013 the Government were given notice of the application under Article 2 of the Convention.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Tbilisi.
On 22 and 23 November 2003 widespread popular protests took place in Georgia. Together with the sequence of events surrounding the change of power, these became known as the “Rose Revolution” (see Georgian Labour Party v. Georgia, no. 9103/04, §§ 11-13, ECHR 2008). As the relations between the relevant political actors were tense at that time, various police forces were mobilised, often patrolling the streets of Tbilisi in their official vehicles. A state of emergency was formally declared by the relevant authorities during those two days.
At around 5.30 p.m. on 22 November 2003 an armoured military vehicle (AMV) driven by a State agent, who was either a law-enforcement or military officer at the material time (see paragraph 14 below), violently hit a car, in which the applicant and her family members were travelling, in a street in Tbilisi. As a result of the accident, the applicant’s son, who had been driving the car, and her sister died, while the applicant and her nephews, minor children, sustained serious bodily injuries.
According to the applicant’s version of the events, which was disputed by the Government, the driver of the AMV fled from the scene of the accident without informing the police, calling an ambulance or otherwise providing help to the passengers of the car.
On 23 November 2003 the Ministry of Defence opened a criminal case into the fatal road traffic accident. Various investigative measures were conducted in the course of the investigation.
In particular, on 28 November 2003 experts from a forensic unit of the Ministry of Defence, after having examined the scene of the accident and conducted a detailed on-site reconstruction of the events, issued a forensic report, establishing that the AMV had been travelling at above the permitted speed limit on the wrong side of the road.
Between 1 and 3 December 2003 the driver of the AMV, as well as the officers who had been seated inside the military vehicle when the accident had occurred, were interviewed as witnesses.
On 3 December 2003 the applicant was granted victim status in the on-going criminal investigation and was questioned by investigators from the Ministry of Defence for the first time.
A second forensic examination, conducted by experts from the Ministry of Defence on 16 January 2004, reached the same conclusion. It confirmed that the cause of the road traffic accident had been the fact that the AMV had been travelling on the wrong side of the road and that its driver, A.M., had therefore clearly breached the traffic regulations.
In the light of the parties’ conflicting submissions on that particular question, it was not possible to infer from the case file with certainty whether A.M. had been a military or police officer when the accident of 22 November 2003 had occurred (see paragraph 7 above).
On 10 February 2004 A.M. was charged with an offence under Article 400 §§ 1 and 3 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 38 below). When questioned as a suspect on 13 February 2004, he claimed that it had been the car driven by the applicant’s son which had been on the wrong side of the road, and that he had been unable to prevent the accident from occurring.
In order to assess the veracity of A.M.’s statements, on 17 February 2004 forensic experts from the Ministry of Defence conducted a third forensic examination. Its results excluded any possibility of the accident having occurred in the circumstances as described by A.M. On the contrary, the results of the third forensic examination confirmed again that it was the AMV which had been on the wrong side of the road and had exceeded the maximum permitted speed limit.
In February and March 2004 a number of witnesses were interviewed by the investigators from the Ministry of Defence, including the officers who had been travelling inside the AMV when the accident had occurred, and two police patrol officers who had been the first to arrive at the scene of the accident.
On 24 March 2004 the applicant enquired with the relevant authorities about progress in the investigation into the accident of 22 November 2003, urging the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office to speed up the proceedings. It is not clear from the case file whether she received any reply to her query.
On 1 April 2004 a fourth forensic examination was conducted, this time by experts from the National Forensic Bureau of the Ministry of Justice. According to the results, it was no longer possible, given the lapse of time, to reconstruct the exact circumstances surrounding the road accident of 22 November 2003 and to establish on which side of the road the AMV had been travelling when it crashed into the car.
On 19 April 2004 the investigation of the case was transferred from the Ministry of Defence’s military prosecutor’s office to the investigative department of the Ministry of State Security.
In June, July, November and December 2004 and February and March 2005, the applicant repeatedly enquired with the Ministry of State Security whether any progress had been made in the investigation. The ministry replied to some of her complaints in more or less similar terms, informing her that there were still various investigative measures to be conducted.
In March 2005 the Ministry of State Security was amalgamated with the Ministry of the Interior, and became a department within the latter ministry’s structure.
On 28 April 2005 the investigator of the Ministry of the Interior decided to discontinue the investigation for want of evidence of a criminal offence in the actions of the AMV driver. In this decision, the investigator referred exclusively to the results of the fourth forensic examination of 1 April 2004 (see paragraph 19 above).
On 16 May 2005 the applicant appealed to the Tbilisi City Court against the decision of 28 April 2005 to close the criminal investigation. On 5 July 2005 the court quashed the investigator’s decision and remitted the case for a fresh investigation. The court referred in particular to the forensic reports of 28 November 2003, and 16 January and 17 February 2004 (see paragraphs 10, 13 and 16 above), as well as to a statement made by the applicant that certain officers from the Ministry of the Interior had been trying to dissuade her from pursuing the criminal proceedings. The court concluded that the investigation had been ineffective and needed to be conducted anew.
The Tbilisi City Court’s decision was upheld by the Tbilisi Court of Appeal on 26 July 2005, and the case was thus remitted to the Ministry of the Interior. Subsequently, the applicant repeatedly enquired with the ministry about the progress in the investigation, but all her enquiries were left unanswered.
On 22 February 2006 the Tbilisi City Public Prosecutor’s Office (“the TCPPO”) took over the investigation of the case from the Ministry of the Interior. The TCPPO studied the case materials, conducted additional investigative measures, re-examined relevant witnesses (see paragraphs 11 and 17 above) and conducted a confrontation between the applicant and the driver of the military vehicle. On 23 February 2006, it issued another decision to discontinue the proceedings for want of evidence of a criminal offence.
The applicant appealed on 20 March 2006, and on 20 May 2006 the Tbilisi City Court quashed the TCPPO’s decision of 23 February 2006, reasoning that the investigation had been deficient. The court noted the applicant’s complaint that after the case had been transferred from the Ministry of Defence to the Ministry of the Interior, the investigation had started lacking in candour.
The Tbilisi City Court’s decision was upheld by the Tbilisi Court of Appeal on 22 May 2006, and the case was remitted to the TCPPO for further examination.
On 24 July 2006 the applicant enquired with the TCPPO about any progress made in the investigation, complaining about its unreasonable length. As a result, on 29 July 2006 the General Public Prosecutor’s Office, noting that the investigation was still ongoing, instructed the TCPPO to expedite the proceedings.
On 15 August 2006 the applicant requested that the TCPPO interview the driver of the AMV and the military officers who had been travelling in it when the road accident had occurred on 22 November 2003. The TCPPO replied on 17 August 2006 that there was no need to do so, as all of them had already been heard several times.
On 30 January 2007 the applicant lodged another application with the TCPPO, requesting a repeat interrogation of the suspect. The TCPPO rejected that request on 1 February 2007 for the same reasons as before (see the preceding paragraph).
On 23 January and 3 July 2008, and 16 January, 3 June, 8 July and 25 September 2009 the applicant repeatedly complained, in similar terms, of the ineffectiveness of the investigation conducted by the TCPPO. In some of her complaints she insisted that the hierarchically superior body, the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, should take over the investigation from the TCPPO. All her requests were rejected by the prosecutorial authority on various dates.
In April and May 2010 the applicant enquired again with the TCPPO about the progress in the investigation. In its replies of 19 April and 4 May 2010, the prosecution authority advised her that despite the investigative measures it had conducted, it had still been impossible to establish with certainty what had happened during the road traffic accident of 22 November 2003.
On 5 and 6 February 2013 the TCCPO interviewed the two police patrol officers who had been the first to arrive at the scene of the accident on 22 November 2003. Those two witnesses had already been interviewed by the investigators of the Ministry of Defence as early as 2004 (see paragraph 17 above). No other investigative measures were conducted thereafter.
On 1 March 2017 the TCPPO closed the investigation owing to the expiry of the relevant statute of limitation, under Article 71 § 1 (c) and Article 400 §§ 1 and 3 of the Criminal Code and Article 105 § 1 (e) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 37 and 39 below). The ten-year statutory limitation period had run out on 22 November 2013.
Article 12 § 3 of the Criminal Code stated that an offence committed without malicious aforethought would be qualified as serious if the minimum prison term it carried was five years.
Article 71 § 1 (c) of the Criminal Code provided that a person should be exempted from criminal liability if ten years had passed since the commission of an offence qualified as serious.
Under Article 400 §§ 1 and 3 of the Criminal Code, anyone who caused the death of two or more people by breaching the driving regulations or otherwise manoeuvring a military vehicle was guilty of an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of six to ten years.
Article 105 § 1 (e) of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided that a criminal investigation had to be discontinued once the offence became time-barred.
