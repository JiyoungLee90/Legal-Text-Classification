The application concerns complaints under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention regarding the ineffectiveness of the investigation into a traffic accident which the applicant survived, while sustaining bodily injuries.
The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Donetsk.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
In the evening of 17 March 2006, the applicant was hit by a car while crossing a street in the city of Donetsk. She was taken by ambulance to hospital, where she was diagnosed with fractures of the left thigh bone and of two bones in the lower part of her left leg; injuries to her left hand, head and neck; numerous bruises on her body; and second or third-degree traumatic shock. The applicant was treated in hospital until 7 April 2006, when she was discharged as her condition was considered stable. She was in the early stages of pregnancy at the time.
Throughout the following year the applicant had to undergo inpatient and outpatient treatment for her injuries. In June 2006 she had a miscarriage resulting in spontaneous termination of her pregnancy. Between 21 September 2006 and 1 November 2007 she was officially recognised as having the second (medium) degree of disability.
Between 20 December 2006 and 10 January 2007 the applicant was again admitted to hospital and had an operation on account of the injuries sustained in the traffic accident. She then underwent inpatient treatment and was discharged from hospital with medical prescriptions and recommendations for further outpatient treatment.
Following the accident, the investigative authorities inspected the scene in the presence of the driver of the car, questioned the driver, the applicant and witnesses, and carried out a forensic technical examination.
On 25 April and 4 August 2006, 5 February and 23 November 2007, 12 May and 21 August 2009 and 14 May 2010, having conducted pre-investigation inquiries, the police investigators refused to open criminal proceedings on account of the lack of constituent elements of a criminal offence in the driver’s actions. Those decisions were subsequently quashed by the supervising authorities as ill-founded and further inquiries were ordered. The investigators were repeatedly criticised for their failure to assemble the relevant evidence, remove the contradictions in the available evidence, and produce a substantiated decision on their inquiries.
On 31 January 2011 an investigator from the Donetsk police initiated criminal proceedings in relation to the traffic accident. In the course of the criminal investigation, the authorities carried out a range of investigative actions, including a reconstruction of the accident in the presence of the driver of the car, forensic medical and technical examinations, and questioning of the driver and witnesses.
On 12 April 2011 the forensic medical expert found no causal link between the accident and the applicant’s miscarriage, noting that the miscarriage had taken place three months after the accident.
On 19 May 2011 the forensic technical expert concluded that it had been impossible for the driver of the car to avoid hitting the applicant.
On 27 May and 28 September 2011 the investigator closed the criminal proceedings on account of the lack of a criminal offence in the driver’s actions, finding that it had been impossible for the driver to avoid hitting the applicant. Those decisions were reversed by supervising prosecutors because of the incompleteness of the investigation and further investigations were ordered.
On 21 November 2011, in response to a complaint by the applicant, the Prosecutors’ Office acknowledged various flaws on the part of the investigative authorities and informed her that disciplinary proceedings had been initiated against the investigator in charge. The applicant’s case was assigned to another investigator.
On 10 January 2013 the criminal proceedings were reinitiated under the new Code of Criminal Procedure of 2012. The applicant joined the proceedings as an injured party.
Because of the contradictory findings of the previous forensic technical examinations as regards the culpability of the driver of the car, on 19 April 2013 additional technical and trace examinations were ordered. On 12 July 2013 the expert found no causal link between the accident and the driver’s actions.
On 26 August 2013, on the basis of the findings of the above-mentioned expert report, the investigator terminated the criminal proceedings on account of the lack of constituent elements of a crime.
On 27 August 2013 that decision was reversed by the Donetsk regional prosecutor’s office as unlawful and a further investigation was ordered. Instructions were given on how to proceed with the investigation. In this connection disciplinary proceedings were instituted against the investigator.
On 15 October 2013 an additional forensic technical examination was ordered.
From April 2014 illegal armed groups associated with two self-proclaimed entities known as the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic” began operating in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, seizing control of certain parts of those regions by force. A ceasefire line was later put in place (see Vyshnyakov v. Ukraine, no. 25612/12, § 20, 24 July 2018 and Burgas v. Ukraine [Committee], no. 8976/07, § 26, 18 December 2018).
On 4 November 2015 the Ukrainian authorities decided to close the criminal case, as in the absence of the case file, it had not been possible to continue the investigation of the accident.
The relevant provisions of the domestic law can be found in Muravskaya v. Ukraine (no. 249/03, §§ 35-36, 13 November 2008) and Nagorskiy v. Ukraine ((dec.), no. 37794/14, § 38, 12 January 2016).
