The case originated in five applications against Russia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on the various dates indicated in the appended table.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were given notice of the applications.
The Government did not object to the examination of the applications by a Committee.
The applicants are Russian nationals who, at the material time, lived in either Chechnya or Ingushetia. Their personal details are set out in the appended table. They are close relatives of individuals who disappeared after allegedly being unlawfully detained by service personnel during special operations. The events concerned took place in areas under the full control of the Russian federal forces. The applicants have not seen their missing relatives since the alleged arrests. Their whereabouts remain unknown.
The applicants or other persons reported the abductions to lawenforcement bodies, and official investigations were opened. The investigation were repeatedly suspended and resumed, and have been ongoing for several years without any tangible results being achieved. The applicants lodged requests for information and assistance in the search for their relatives with the investigating authorities and various law-enforcement bodies. Their requests received either only formalistic responses or none at all. The perpetrators have not been identified by the investigating bodies. It appears that all of the investigations are still ongoing.
Summaries of the facts in respect of each application are set out below. Each account is based on statements provided by the applicants and their relatives and/or neighbours to both the Court and the domestic investigating authorities. The Government did not dispute the principal facts of the cases as presented by the applicants, but questioned the involvement of service personnel in the events.
The applicant is the mother of Mr Isa Kukayev, who was born in 1979.
On 2 April 2003 the Nazran Town Court of Ingushetia convicted Mr Isa Kukayev of illegal possession of a grenade, sentencing him to three years’ imprisonment.
At about 6 a.m. on 29 August 2003 two UAZ minivans and a VAZ 21099 car (all the vehicles had no registration plates) arrived at the house in Grozny which belonged to Mr A.K. and Ms L.S., who were hosting Mr Isa Kukayev at the time.
Several men in camouflage uniforms and balaclavas, armed with automatic weapons, left the vehicles and burst into the house. Having checked the identity documents of Mr A.K. and Mr Isa Kukayev, they took the latter to an unknown destination. During the operation several other armed men secured the surrounding area.
On an unspecified date the applicant’s family learned from unofficial sources that Mr Isa Kukayev had been detained on the premises of dairy farm no.15, where a military unit headed by Commander M. was stationed.
The applicant’s relatives informally asked Commander M. about Mr Isa Kukayev’s arrest, but he denied involvement of his unit in that operation.
On 8 April 2007 the applicant’s family was contacted by Mr S. He stated that on 17 August 2003 he had been arrested by service personnel and then placed in a cell in the basement of the dairy farm. Several days later Mr Isa Kukayev had joined him. He had been arrested on suspicion of participation in bombing attacks. Two weeks later the service personnel had taken Mr Isa Kukayev out of the cell. He had never returned.
On 29 August 2003 Mr A.K. informed the Zavodskoiy district prosecutor’s office in Grozny (“the investigators”) of Mr Isa Kukayev’s abduction.

Between September and November 2003 the investigators sent several requests to law-enforcement authorities to check if Mr Isa Kukayev had been arrested during a special operation. They replied that they had no information.
On 8 November 2003 the investigation was suspended for failure to establish the perpetrators. The investigation was resumed on 15 February 2004.
On 20 February 2004 the investigators examined the crime scene. No evidence was collected.
On 25 February 2004 the investigators questioned Mr A.K. again. He provided a more detailed description of the events of 29 August 2003, stating that several armed men had secured the surrounding area while others had taken Mr Isa Kukayev away.
On 20 February 2004 the investigators granted the applicant victim status in the criminal proceedings and questioned her. She confirmed her previous statement.
On 8 March 2004 the investigators questioned Ms L.S. Her account of the events was similar to those of Mr A.K.
The investigation was suspended on 15 March 2004 and then resumed on 26 December 2005.
On the same day the investigators questioned the applicant. Referring to information from Mr A.K.’s statement, she alleged that her son has been arrested by service personnel from a military unit stationed at dairy farm no. 15.
On 26 January 2006 the investigation was suspended. They were subsequently resumed on 14 March 2007.
On 10 April 2007 a member of Mr A.K.’s family informed the investigators about a visit by Mr S. (see paragraph 13 above).

In the meantime, on 25 May 2010 the Zavodskoy District Court of Grozny declared Isa Kukayev a missing person following an application by the applicant.
According to the applicant, at some point she complained to the Zavodskoy District Court of Grozny about the investigators’ inaction. The court dismissed her claim on an unspecified date in 2008.
The first and the second applicants are the mothers of Mr Rasmbek Saydulayev, who was born in 1984, and Mr Lom-Ali (also spelled as Lomali) Shoipov, who was born in 1982, respectively.
On 21 August 2003 Mr Rasmbek Saydulayev and Mr Lom-Ali Shoipov were visiting the hospital in the settlement of Ordzhonikidzevskaya in Ingushetia. Whilst both men were in the building a group of armed men in camouflage uniforms and balaclavas with shields arrived at the hospital in several vehicles with tinted windows and number plates indicating that they were from region “95” (Chechnya).
They surrounded the hospital, entered its courtyard and started firing gunshots. Six men broke into the surgical wing and hit Mr Saydulayev over the head with a gun, rendering him unconscious. They then ordered the nurses to tie his legs together. Meanwhile, other service personnel severely beat Mr Shoipov, breaking his arm. They then took both Mr Saydulayev and Mr Shoipov out of the hospital. Mr I.I. was in the room next to the room where Mr Saydulayev was subjected to a beating and witnessed it.
The service personnel handcuffed Mr Saydulayev, Mr Shoipov and Mr I.I., forced them into a white GAZelle minivan with number plates including the digits A632...95 and drove away. It appears that the armed men also took away several other people, including Mr A.S.
On 21 August 2003 the Sunzhenskiy district prosecutor’s office in Ingushetia opened criminal case no. 23600052 under Articles 222 (illegal use of weapons) and 126 (abduction) of the CC into the abduction of Mr I.I. and Mr A.S.

Their commander had introduced himself as Mr I.N. and had asked to provide them with the personal protective equipment needed to arrest a dangerous criminal in Ingushetia. Mr Ch. ordered that they be given helmets and shield no. 9207005.
On 25 August 2003 the investigators questioned the first deputy head of the special mobile unit, Mr K.Z. He stated that on 21 August 2003 his superior (Mr O.Ch.) had told him about a call which he had received from Khankala (Chechnya) from a person who had called had asked him to organise a briefing for officers from the regional operative headquarters of the Temporary United Group Alignment (Региональный Оперативный штаб Временной Объединенной Группировки Сил), based in Khankala, on account of a special operation which they had had to carry out in Ingushetia. Mr O.Ch. had asked Mr K.Z. to brief the officers. As soon as they had arrived Mr K.Z. had explained to them the situation in the region and recommended that they obtain personal protective equipment.
On 28 August 2003 the International Committee of the Red Cross requested the Chechnya Public Prosecutor’s Office’s assistance in establishing whereabouts of the applicants’ relatives and other persons presumed arrested on 21 August 2003. Following that letter the investigators included the applicants’ relatives Mr Rasmbek Saydulayev and Mr Lom-Ali Shoipov on the list of abducted persons and started an investigation in respect of them.
On 29 August 2003 the investigators requested that the headquarters of the Temporary United Group Alignment inform them of the special operation of 21 August 2003 and its results.
