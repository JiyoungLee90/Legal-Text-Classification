The case originated in an application (no. 30462/15) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Ms Maria Mateescu (“the applicant”), on 15 June 2015.
The applicant was represented by Mr I. Matei, a lawyer practising in Bucharest. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 16 December 2015 notice of the application was given to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Bucharest.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, refer to the same context and domestic criminal proceedings as those described in the case Association “21 December 1989” and Others v. Romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 May 2011).
During the events which led to the fall of the communist regime, on the night of 21/22 December 1989 the applicant’s son was killed by gunfire in Bucharest.
In 1990 the military prosecutor’s office opened several investigations into the December 1989 armed crackdown on the anti-communism demonstrations. A main criminal investigation concerning the use of violence against civilians in Bucharest and other cities was registered with the highest prosecutor’s office – the military prosecutors section − under no. 97/P/1990 (current number 11/P/2014). In the main criminal investigation the applicant raised civil claims and asked that the perpetrators of the offence of homicide committed against her son be identified and punished.
At the same time, another investigation concerning the offences of complicity in seriously aggravated homicide and complicity in attempted seriously aggravated homicide, committed against a large number of persons, including the applicant’s son, culminated in the committal for trial of public officials, members of the ruling political party, and their subsequent conviction by a final decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 20 April 1992.
The relevant procedural steps taken in the main criminal investigation were described in the cases Association “21 December 1989” and Others (cited above, §§ 12-41) and Sidea and Others v. Romania ([Committee] no. 889/15, §§ 8-11, 5 June 2018).
On 14 October 2015 the military prosecutor’s office closed the main criminal investigation, finding that the applicant’s complaint regarding the offence of homicide committed against her son was statute-barred and that a complaint concerning instigation of homicide was a matter of res judicata following the Supreme Court of Justice’s decision of 20 April 1992 (see paragraph 8 above).
The decision of 14 October 2015 was subsequently annulled by a Prosecutor General’s decision of 5 April 2016, confirmed by the High Court of Cassation and Justice on 13 June 2016. On 1 November 2016 the military prosecutor ordered the opening of a criminal investigation in rem for the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same factual circumstances.
According to the information submitted by the parties, the main criminal investigation is still ongoing (see Bănuțoiu and Ștefoglu v. Romania [Committee], nos. 64752/13 and 54607/14, § 12, 3 July 2018).
The legal provisions relevant to the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the events of December 1989 are referred to in the cases Association “21 December 1989” and Others (cited above, §§ 95-100) and Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC] (nos. 10865/09 and 2 others, §§ 19396, ECHR 2014 (extracts)).
