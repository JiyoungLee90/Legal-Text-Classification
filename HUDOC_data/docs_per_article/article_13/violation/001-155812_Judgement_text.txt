The case originated in two applications (nos. 4771/09 and 7170/09) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Moldovan nationals, Mr Victor Morari and Mr Oleg Spiridonov (“the applicants”), on 12 November 2008 and 10 January 2009 respectively.
Mr Spiridonov was represented by Mr A. Bîzgu, a lawyer practising in Chișinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Apostol.
The applicants complained about the failure to enforce judgments in their favour. They relied on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. Mr Morari also relied on Article 13 of the Convention.
On 4 June 2013 the applications were communicated to the Government following the adoption of the pilot judgment in the case of Olaru and Others (Olaru and Others v. Moldova, nos. 476/07, 22539/05, 17911/08 and 13136/07, 28 July 2009).
