The case originated in an application (no. 48398/17) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Borys Mytrofanovych Parinov (“the applicant”), on 30 June 2017.
The applicant was represented by Mr Y.L. Boychenko, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant complained under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention that the length of proceedings related to his share in a company had been excessive, and also complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention that as a result of those proceedings, he could not recover his share in a company.
On 27 March 2018 notice of the complaints concerning the alleged violation of Article 6 § 1 and Article 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the duration of the proceedings in his case was given to the Government, and the complaint about the alleged lack of impartiality of the liquidation manager raised under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee, but provided no reasons. Having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it (see, in respect of a similar approach, Lada v. Ukraine [Committee], no. 32392/07, § 4, 6 February 2018; Geletey v. Ukraine [Committee], no. 23040/07, § 4, 24 April 2018; and Braylovska v. Ukraine [Committee], no. 14031/09, § 5, 6 June 2019).
The applicant was born in 1953 and lived in Lugansk. He died on 16 September 2018. His son and wife expressed their wish to pursue the application in his stead (see paragraphs 40-43 below).
On 26 April 2000 the applicant became a shareholder in a limited liability company (“the company”). On 30 May 2005 the applicant withdrew from that company. However, the other shareholder in the company did not return the applicant’s share of the company’s funds to him, contrary to the law in force.
On 10 December 2007 the applicant lodged proceedings with the domestic courts, seeking an acknowledgment that he had withdrawn from the company. On 20 December 2007 the Bryankivskyy Local Court of the Lugansk Region allowed the applicant’s claim and acknowledged that he had withdrawn from the company. On 23 April 2008, by a final ruling, the Lugansk Regional Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the lower court.
Meanwhile, on 25 December 2007 and 22 January 2008 the company had sold two of its commercial buildings to company B., which had sold them to company K. on 10 January 2008 and 25 February 2008 respectively.
On 19 June 2008 the applicant lodged a claim for reimbursement of the value of his share.
On 19 June 2008 the Lugansk Regional Commercial Court (hereinafter “the Commercial Court”) opened the proceedings and ordered the seizure of the company’s assets, in order to guarantee the repayment of the applicant’s share. After learning that the other shareholder had sold the company’s immovable property to third parties, on 9 December 2009 the applicant changed his claim and sought reimbursement of the value of his share, as well as an acknowledgment that the above sale contracts of 25 December 2007, 22 January 2008, 10 January 2008 and 25 February 2008 were invalid.
On 2 February 2010 the Commercial Court allowed the applicant’s claim in part. On 27 April 2010 the Lugansk Commercial Court of Appeal amended the above-mentioned decision in part. On 18 November 2010 the Higher Commercial Court quashed the decisions of the lower courts and remitted the case for fresh examination.
As a result of the case being examined afresh, on 29 December 2011, by a final decision, the Higher Commercial Court terminated the proceedings with respect to the applicant’s claim for reimbursement of the value of his share in the company, as that issue had been examined in the course of the insolvency proceedings (see the “Insolvency proceedings” section below). The applicant’s claim for an acknowledgment that the sale agreements relating to the company were invalid was rejected on account of his lack of standing.
On 6 October 2010, upon the application of a fourth company, company P., the Commercial Court started insolvency proceedings against the company, imposing a moratorium on debt payments.
In December 2010 the applicant lodged his creditor’s claim with the Commercial Court.
On 28 February 2011 the Commercial Court adjourned the proceedings until 7 April 2011, as the applicant had failed to provide evidence for his monetary claim.
On 11 April 2011, by a final decision, the Commercial Court recognised the applicant’s entitlement, as a creditor, to 4,100,439 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH – around 356,560 euros (EUR) at the material time), an amount that corresponded to his share in the company.
On 28 April 2011 the Commercial Court allowed an application by the applicant’s representative to suspend the proceedings until the outcome of the other related proceedings was known.
On 5 January 2012 the Commercial Court resumed the proceedings.
On 12 March 2012 the Commercial Court allowed an application by the applicant’s representative to suspend the proceedings until the outcome of the other related proceedings was known.
On 17 June 2013 the Commercial Court resumed the proceedings.
On 11 November 2013 the Commercial Court adjourned the proceedings until 13 January 2014, as the case-file material was sent to the court of cassation so that the applicant’s objections to two procedural decisions of November 2010 and April 2011 could be considered.
On 3 February 2014 the Commercial Court declared the company insolvent, initiated the liquidation procedure, and appointed a liquidator, D.
On 17 April 2014 the Commercial Court considered a report prepared by D. which stated, among other things, that in terms of property, the company only had two vehicles, whose location was unknown. Since further actions relating to the liquidation procedure were necessary, the court adjourned the proceedings until 7 July 2014.
Between July 2014 and April 2015 the Commercial Court did not operate, owing to the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine.
On 2 April 2015 the Higher Commercial Court of Ukraine ordered that the Commercial Court resume its activity in Kharkiv.
On 2 July 2015 the Commercial Court reopened the proceedings of its own motion, upon restoring the case file concerning the insolvency proceedings.
On 17 August 2015 the liquidator wrote to the Commercial Court, asking to be dismissed from his position. The Commercial Court ordered the creditors’ committee to consider the liquidator’s request.
Between 20 October 2015 and 10 September 2019 the Commercial Court noted in several decisions that the creditors’ committee had not decided the issue of the liquidator wishing to withdraw, and on numerous occasions it ordered the liquidator to convene a meeting of the creditors’ committee and have a new liquidator designated by the latter.
In this connection, on 17 November 2015 the Commercial Court received a negative reply to an enquiry which it had made as regards selecting the name of a new liquidator via the automatic system, as no appropriate candidate had been found.
On 15 June 2018 the Commercial Court asked Y., a potential new liquidator whose name had been found via the automatic system, to submit written consent confirming her willingness or refusal to act as a liquidator. She did not reply.
On 23 June 2018 L. informed the Commercial Court that he would be unable to act as a liquidator, as he had a heavy workload.
On 20 July 2018 the Commercial Court asked P., a potential liquidator whose name had been found via the automatic system, to submit written consent confirming his willingness or refusal to act as a liquidator. He did not reply.
On 9 August 2018 the Commercial Court asked R., a potential liquidator whose name had been found via the automatic system, to submit written consent confirming his willingness or refusal to act as a liquidator.
On 30 July 2019 the Commercial Court allowed the applicant’s wife’s application to be admitted to the proceedings in her capacity as a creditor, as she was the applicant’s heir. It also asked R., a potential liquidator whose name had been found via the automatic system, to submit written confirmation of his willingness or refusal to act as a liquidator. The Commercial Court also stated that D., the liquidator (see paragraph 28 above), had provided a report dated 10 July 2019, which stated, among other things, that owing to the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine he had changed his place of residence from Lugansk to Odessa, and the liquidation of the company had been suspended. D. had stated that he had asked to be withdrawn from the case on 17 August 2015 owing to objective reasons which impeded the performance of his functions. He had convened a creditors’ committee meeting in Kyiv on 24 July 2019.
On 10 September 2019 the Commercial Court asked S., a potential liquidator whose name had been found via the automatic system, to submit written consent confirming his willingness or refusal to act as a liquidator.
On 31 October 2019 the Commercial Court adjourned the hearing to 10 December 2019, as D. and the creditors did not attend the hearing. The creditors’ committee did not decide on D.’s application to withdraw from the case, and did not provide a proposal with the name of a new liquidator.
On 16 April 2020 the Commercial Court adjourned the hearing to 17 June 2020, as D. and the creditors did not attend the hearing. The creditors’ committee did not decide on the D.’s application to withdraw from the case, and did not provide a proposal with the name of a new liquidator.
On 8 September 2011 the applicant filed a criminal complaint against the company’s officials with the Leninskyy district police department of Lugansk, and on the basis of that complaint a criminal fraud case was opened.
On 22 February 2014 the criminal case was closed for lack of corpus delicti. In 2014, due to the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, the criminal case-file material was left in Lugansk.
On 23 September 2016 the Svativ District Court quashed the decision of 22 February 2014. The criminal investigation is currently ongoing.
Section 114 of the Law of Ukraine on restoring a debtor’s solvency or declaring insolvency of 14 May 1992 (Закон України “Про відновлення платоспроможності боржника або визнання його банкрутом”) provides, inter alia, that following a liquidator’s request, a commercial court may dismiss a liquidator from the execution of his or her duties. A commercial court may appoint a liquidator following a request from a creditors’ committee, or, in the absence of such a request, may appoint a candidate of its own choice of its own motion. In the absence of written consent from a candidate who has been selected via the automatic system, a commercial court has to appoint a liquidator from the integrated register of arbitration administrators (asset managers, insolvency practitioners, liquidators).
The Code of Ukraine on Insolvency Proceedings of 18 October 2018 entered into force on 21 October 2019 and repealed the Law of Ukraine on restoring a debtor’s solvency or declaring insolvency of 14 May 1992. Article 28 § 4 of the Code provides that a commercial court may dismiss an arbitration administrator from executing his or her duties as a liquidator. Article 60 provides that in a decision declaring a debtor insolvent and opening the liquidation procedure, a commercial court has to appoint a liquidator from the integrated register of arbitration administrators.
