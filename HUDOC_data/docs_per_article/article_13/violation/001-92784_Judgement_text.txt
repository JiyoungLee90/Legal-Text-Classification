The case originated in an application (no. 12997/06) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Lyudmila Nikolayevna Filshteyn (“the applicant”), on 27 March 2006.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 11 September 2007 the Court decided to communicate the applicant’s complaints under Articles 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in .
On 16 November 2001, 6 March and 13 September 2002 the Leninskiy District Court of Kirovograd awarded the applicant 4,912.67 Ukrainian hryvnyas (UAH), UAH 4,967.66 and UAH 6,025.10, respectively, in salary arrears and other payments due to her by her former employer, the Municipal Company “Garantiya” (комунальне підприємство «Гарантія») owned and controlled by the city council.
All these judgments became final and the State Bailiffs’ Service instituted proceedings to enforce them. According to the Government, in the course of these proceedings the total amount of UAH 3,190.33 was paid to the applicant. According to the applicant, she had received UAH 2,366.02 only.
Being dissatisfied with the lengthy non-enforcement of these judgments, the applicant instituted proceedings in the same court against the State Bailiffs’ Service, claiming compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. On 28 March 2003 the court rejected her claim for pecuniary damage but awarded her UAH 500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. On 7 August 2003 the Kirovograd Regional Court of Appeal upheld this judgment and the latter became final. Subsequently the applicant unsuccessfully appealed against this judgment in cassation before the Supreme Court of Ukraine.
According to the Government, the applicant did not request the State Bailiffs’ Service to institute enforcement proceedings under the judgment of 28 March 2003. The applicant disagreed, providing in support the letter of the State Bailiffs’ Service of 7 June 2006 in which the latter informed her that the judgment of 28 March 2003 had not been enforced due to its lack of funds.
The applicant also complained to various State authorities but to no avail.
On 28 December 2004 the  instituted liquidation proceedings against the debtor company.
In this regard on 24 and 28 March 2005 the State Bailiffs’ Service terminated the enforcement proceedings against the debtor company and transferred the applicant’s writs of enforcement to the liquidation commission for further processing. The liquidation proceedings are apparently still pending.
All the above-mentioned judgments given in the applicant’s favour remain unenforced.
The general provisions of domestic legislation on enforcement of judicial decisions are set out in the judgment of 27 July 2004 in the case of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-18).
