The case originated in an application (no. 28662/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Stojan Maksimovič (“the applicant”), on 28 July 2005.
The applicant was represented by Mr Z. Lipej, a lawyer practising in Medvode. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney-General.
The applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts to which he had been a party had been excessive. In substance, he also complained of the lack of an effective domestic remedy in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings (Article 13 of the Convention).
On 20 February 2009 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Kranj.
On 7 July 2001 the applicant was injured in a car accident. The motorist responsible for the accident had taken out insurance with the insurance company Zavarovalnica Maribor d.d.
On 17 October 2001 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the insurance company in the Kranj District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Kranju) seeking damages in the amount of 1,187,433.00 Slovenian tolars (approximately 4,966 euros) for the injuries sustained.
Between 7 May 2002 and 20 September 2006 the applicant lodged four sets of preliminary written submissions.
Between 4 September 2002 and 8 October 2004 he made three requests that a date be set for a hearing.
Between 24 January and 21 September 2006 three hearings were held.
On 23 February 2007 the applicant informed the first-instance court that he wished to withdraw the claim.
On 30 March 2007 the Kranj District Court issued a decision that the proceedings be discontinued, following an out-of-court settlement between the parties.
