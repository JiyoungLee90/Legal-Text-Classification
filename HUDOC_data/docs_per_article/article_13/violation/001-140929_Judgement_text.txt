The case originated in an application (no. 25861/11) against the Portuguese Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Portuguese national, Mr Jorge de Jesus Ferreira Alves (“the applicant”), on 18 April 2011.
The Portuguese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. F. Graça de Carvalho, Deputy Attorney General.
On 17 October 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Matosinhos (Portugal).
On 3 June 2005 the Ethics Council of Porto (Conselho Deontológico do Porto) of the Portuguese Bar Association (Ordem dos Advogados) instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant, following a complaint introduced by a client for breach of professional secrecy on 29 May 2002.
On 4 March 2011 the case was dismissed on the ground that the facts had already been subject to a decision in 2009, which had been dropped as time-barred.
Article 125 of the Statute of the Portuguese Bar Association reads as follows:
“The disciplinary penalties are:
(...)
e) suspension up to ten years;
f) expulsion (...)”
