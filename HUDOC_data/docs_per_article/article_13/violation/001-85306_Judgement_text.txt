On 4 June 1948 another survey report was adopted according to which the “Kowalewko” property consisted of 53.13 hectares of arable land. The commission decided that the findings of the report of 20 March 1948 were erroneous, as part of the property had been flooded and had been considered in the earlier report to be swamps and not arable land.
By an administrative decision of the Warsaw Regional Office (Urząd Wojewódzki) of 3 September 1948 the property was expropriated pursuant to provisions of the Decree of 6 September 1944 on Agrarian Reform (“the 1944 Decree”).
On 16 October 1948 this decision was confirmed by the Minister of Agriculture, who upheld the findings of fact of the expropriation commission as to the surface area of the property concerned.
On 5 January 1993 the applicant lodged with the Ministry of Agriculture an application to have the expropriation decision declared null and void. The applicant maintained that the property should not have been subject to expropriation within the framework of the agrarian reform law as it did not attain the minimum threshold of 50 hectares of arable land. She referred to records dated 11 September 1948 and 11 January 1949 relating to the property.
On 15 November 1993 the applicant submitted the relevant documents in support of her claim.
On 9 December 1993 the Minister informed the applicant that her application would be examined towards the end of 1994.
On 21 December 1993 the applicant complained to the Cabinet Office about the inactivity of the Ministry of Agriculture and requested a speedy examination of her case.
On 7 January 1994 the Cabinet Office referred the complaint to the Ministry of Agriculture.
On 14 January 1994 the Minister of Agriculture requested the Ciechanów Regional Office to submit information concerning the current owners and possessors of the “Kowalewko” property.
On 28 March 1994 the Ciechanów Regional Office submitted the requested information.
On 9 September 1994 the applicant lodged a complaint with the  about the failure of the Minister to issue a decision in her case.
By a judgment of 19 December 1994 the  ordered the Minister of Agriculture to issue a decision concerning the applicant’s application within two months from the date of the judgment.
On 28 March 1995 the Minister decided to stay the proceedings on the grounds that the applicant had not submitted evidence required in support of her claim. The applicant appealed to the  arguing that she had already submitted the relevant documents on 15 November 1993.
On 18 June 1996 the  quashed the Minister’s decision to stay the proceedings.
On 4 December 1996 the applicant again complained to the  about the inactivity of the Minister.

On 20 April 1999 the applicant complained to the Cabinet Office about the inactivity of the Minister of Agriculture. On 5 May 1999 the Cabinet Office replied that the Minister had taken steps to obtain information concerning the property. On 14 June 1999 the Cabinet Office transferred the applicant’s reply to the Ministry of Agriculture.
On 30 June 1999 and 12 December 1999 the applicant inquired about her case.
On 10 April 2000 the applicant lodged a fresh complaint with the  about the failure of the Minister to issue a decision in her case (under section 17 of the Supreme Administrative Court Act).
By a judgment of 15 February 2001 the  ordered the Minister of Agriculture to issue a decision within one month from the date of the judgment. The court noted that seven years had passed since the applicant had lodged her motion with the Ministry and no decision on the merits had been delivered.
On 12 March 2001 the Minister of Agriculture issued a decision refusing to institute proceedings for annulment of the expropriation decision on the grounds that the applicant had not proved that she had a title to the property.
The Minister upheld the decision on 23 April 2001. The applicant appealed to the .
On 21 January 2002 the  quashed both decisions. The court found that the decisions had been issued in flagrant breach of administrative procedure and were inconsistent with the evidence obtained in the case. The court criticised the Minister for not complying with the instructions and legal opinion included in the previous judgments of the . Further, the court observed that in its judgment of 3 February 1999 it had quashed only the decision of 7 May 1997; consequently, the decision of 26 March 1997 remained valid and the Minister should have replied to the applicant’s appeal instead of issuing new decisions. Accordingly, the Minister could not have issued a decision refusing to institute the proceedings for annulment, since a decision on the merits had already been delivered.

By a judgment of 5 December 2005 the  ordered the Minister of Agriculture to issue a decision within one month from the date of the judgment. The court noted that the Minister had not taken any action in the case since the court’s judgment of 2 December 2004. Moreover, the authorities had summoned the applicant to complete unnecessary formalities, such as providing the address of a person whose death certificate had been included in the case file.
On 24 June 2006 the Minister of Agriculture stayed ex officio the proceedings for annulment and requested the parties to institute court proceedings to determine entitlement to the estate of a certain J.W.P. (one of the parties to the proceedings who had died).
On 18 January 2007 the Minister upheld the decision.
On 14 June 2007 the  quashed both decisions of the Minister.

Article 35 of the Code of Administrative Procedure lays down timelimits ranging from one month to two months for dealing with a case pending before an administrative authority. If these time-limits have not been complied with, the authority must, under Article 36 of the Code, inform the parties of that fact, explain the reasons for the delay and fix a new time-limit. Pursuant to Article 37 § 1, if the case has not been handled within the time-limits referred to in Articles 35 and 36, a party to administrative proceedings can lodge an appeal to the higher authority, alleging inactivity. In cases where the allegations of inactivity are wellfounded, the higher authority fixes a new term for handling the case and orders an inquiry in order to determine the reasons for the inactivity and to identify the persons responsible for the delay. If need be, the authority may order that measures be applied to prevent future delays.
On 1 October 1995 the Law of 11 May 1995 on the  (“the 1995 Act”) came into force. According to the provisions of section 17 of the 1995 Act, a party to administrative proceedings may, at any time, lodge with the  a complaint about inactivity on the part of an authority obliged to issue an administrative decision.
Section 26 of the Law provides:
“When a complaint alleging inactivity on the part of an administrative authority is well-founded, the  shall oblige that authority to issue a decision, or to perform a specific act, or to confirm, declare, or recognise a right or obligation provided for by law.”
Pursuant to section 30 of the Law, the decision of the  ordering an authority to put an end to its inactivity is legally binding on the authority concerned. If the authority has not complied with the decision, the court may, under section 31 of the 1995 Act, impose a fine on it and may itself give a ruling on the right or obligation in question.
Under the same provision, a party to the proceedings who sustains damage as a result of a failure of the administrative body to act in compliance with the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court given under section 17 of the Act, is entitled to claim compensation from the administrative authority concerned, according to principles of civil liability as set out in the Civil Code. Such a claim should be first lodged with that authority. A decision on the compensation claim should be taken by that administrative authority within three months. If the authority concerned fails to give a ruling in this respect within this time-limit, or if the party is not satisfied with the compensation granted, a compensation claim against the administrative body can be lodged with a civil court.
The 1995 Act was repealed and replaced by the Law of 30 August 2002 on Procedure before Administrative Courts (“the 2002 Act”) which entered into force on 1 January 2004. Section 3 § 2(8) and section 149 of the 2002 Act contains provisions analogous to section 17 and 26 of the 1995 Act. A party to administrative proceedings can lodge a complaint about inactivity on the part of an authority obliged to issue an administrative decision with an administrative court. Under section 149, if a complaint is well-founded, an administrative court shall oblige the authority concerned to issue a decision, or to perform a specific act, or to confirm, declare, or recognise a right or obligation provided for by law. Section 154 provides for a possibility of lodging a compensation claim against the administrative authority concerned if a party to the proceedings sustained damage as a result of a failure of that authority to act in compliance with the judgment of the administrative court. The principles of the Civil Code shall apply accordingly.
Articles 417 et seq. of the Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny) provide for the State’s liability in tort.
In the version applicable until 1 September 2004, Article 417 § 1, which lays down a general rule, read as follows:
“1.  The State Treasury shall be liable for damage caused by a State official in the course of carrying out the duties entrusted to him.”
Article 418 of the Civil Code, as applicable until 18 December 2001, provided for the following exception in cases where damage resulted from the issue of a decision or order:
“1.  If, in consequence of the issue of a decision or order, a State official has caused damage, the State Treasury shall be liable only if a breach of the law has been involved in the issue of the decision or order and if that breach is the subject of a prosecution under the criminal law or of a disciplinary investigation, and the guilt of the person who caused the damage in question has been established by a final conviction or has been admitted by the superior of that person.
The absence of the establishment of guilt by way of a criminal conviction or in a decision given in disciplinary proceedings shall not exclude the State Treasury’s liability for damage if such proceedings cannot be instituted in view of the [statutory] exception to prosecution or disciplinary actions.”
On 1 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on amendments to the Civil Code and other statutes (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy – Kodeks cywilny oraz niektórych innych ustaw) (“the 2004 Amendment”) entered into force. It introduced a new Article 417¹. Article 417¹ § 3 provides for a possibility of lodging a compensation claim for damages resulting from the unreasonable length of administrative proceedings after it was formally determined in the relevant proceedings that there had been an unlawful failure to issue an administrative decision within the relevant time-limits.
