The case originated in two applications (nos. 63582/13 and 18347/14) against the Portuguese Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Portuguese nationals, Ms Francelina Nunes Lucas Saraiva and Mr Duarte José Trigo Saraiva (“the applicants”), on 2 October 2013 and 21 February 2014 respectively.
The applicants were represented by Mr J. J. Ferreira Alves, a lawyer practising in Matosinhos. The Portuguese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M.F. da Graça Carvalho, Deputy Attorney General.
On 16 November 2015 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1950 and in 1949, respectively, and live in Matosinhos.
On 16 March 2005 A.C. and M.L. instituted civil proceedings against the applicants and other four defendants before the Matosinhos Court seeking the payment of 11,843.48 euros (EUR) due to the alleged sale of a part of the plaintiffs’ property.
On 29 March 2005 the applicants were summoned to challenge the action against them; which they did not. In the notification letter they were given notice that the lack of opposition would entail the confession of the facts pursuant to Article 484 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 11 below).
Between 21 April 2005 and 24 May 2013 several procedural steps took place either by action of the plaintiffs, the remaining defendants or the Matosinhos Court. In particular: on 21 April 2005 the remaining defendants contested the action; on 3 November 2005 the plaintiffs submitted observations in reply; on 17 October 2007 the plaintiffs lodged a request seeking the intervention of I.T. in the proceedings, which was admitted by the Matosinhos Court on 29 May 2009; on 15 December 2010 the judge gave directions concerning the matters to be discussed at the hearing (despacho saneador); on 21 March 2012, following I.T.’s death, the Matosinhos Court stayed the proceedings pending the outcome of inheritance proceedings.
On 24 May 2013 the applicants submitted a power of attorney and requested that the case-file be uploaded to the legal platform “CITIUS” for consultation.
On 10 January 2014 the applicants requested the participation of an expert of their own choosing in the preparation of the expert report which had been sought by the plaintiffs. On an unknown date the other defendants in the proceedings lodged an opposition to the applicants’ request.
On 16 October 2015 the Matosinhos Court adopted a judgment in which it ruled in favour of the applicants.
The relevant part of the Portuguese Code of Civil Procedure, in the version in force at the material time (Law Decree no. 44129, of 28 December 1961, as amended until Law Decree no. 226/2008, of 20 November 2008), provided as follow:
Article 483
“If the defendant, in addition to not challenging the action against him, does not give power of attorney to a legal representative nor does he intervene in any way in the proceedings, the court has to verify whether the notification has complied with all legal formalities; if irregularities are found, the court orders a new notification.”
Article 484
“1. In the event that the defendant was or should be considered regularly notified ... the absence of opposition to the action entails the confession of the facts as submitted by the plaintiff.
