The case originated in an application (no. 67534/01) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Viktor Petrovich Romashov (“the applicant”), on 21 November 2000.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms Valeria Lutkovska, succeeded by Ms Zoryana Bortnovska.
The applicant’s complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was communicated on 9 May 2003. On the same date the Court decided that Article 29 § 3 of the Convention should be applied and the admissibility and merits of the complaint be considered together.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant, Mr Viktor Petrovich Romashov, is a Ukrainian national, who was born in 1954 and currently resides in . The applicant is a pensioner.
In May 1998 the applicant filed an application with the labour disputes commission of the Lysychans’ke Derzhavne Shakhtobudivne Upravlinnia (the “DSU”) to recover unpaid salary from a State-run coal mine.
On 16 June 1998 the labour disputes commission of the DSU allowed his claims and ordered the DSU to pay the applicant UAH 8,783.39 in compensation. On the same date the commission issued a certificate to the applicant, which had the same status as a writ of execution.
On 27 July 1998 the DSU’s property was attached by the tax inspectorate.
On 9 June, 7 July and 19 November 1999 the applicant was paid UAH 500, UAH 300 and UAH 210 respectively.
On 30 April 2000 the Lysychansk Department of Justice informed the applicant that there was a tax lien over the DSU’s property and it was therefore not possible to attach it. It also informed the applicant that there was no funding in the State budget to execute the decision of 16 June 1998.
On 14 June 2000 the applicant was informed that the labour commission decision of 16 June 1998 could not be executed due to the Coal Mining Ministry’s lack of funds.
On 23 January 2002 the Lysychansk City Court awarded the applicant UAH 2,282.21 to compensate for the loss of value of the sum awarded to him due to inflation. The applicant submitted that this judgment has remained unenforced.
On 10 January 2003 the applicant informed the Court that the execution proceedings in his case were still pending.
On 28 November 2003 the DSU paid the applicant the full amount of the debt awarded by the decision of 16 June 1998.
On 1 December 2003 the Execution Service terminated the enforcement proceedings as the judgment of 16 June 1998 had been enforced in full (UAH 8,783.39).
Article 124 of the Constitution provided as follows:
“... Judicial decisions are adopted by the courts in the name of  and are mandatory for execution throughout the entire .”
Law of  of 21 April 1999 “on Enforcement Proceedings”
Law of  of 24 March 1998 “on the State Bailiffs’ Service”
Under clause 3.6 of the regulations, the forced recovery of funds must be executed from the same account as that of ordinary payments.
The applicant complains about the lengthy non-execution of the decision of the labour disputes commission of 16 June 1998 given in his favour. He also alleges that he was not provided with compensation for depreciation of the value of the sum awarded to him, as ordered by the judgment of the Lysychansk City Court on 23 January 2002. He alleges an infringement of Articles 13 and 17 of the Convention. In substance, however, he invokes Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
