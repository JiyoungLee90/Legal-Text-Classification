The applicant complained about a search-and-seizure operation carried out by the authorities without a prior judicial warrant in her home and the premises of a company managed by her on 19 October 2010.
The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Veliko Tarnovo. She was represented by Mr Y. Yordanov, a lawyer practising in Veliko Tarnovo.
The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V. Obretenov, of the Ministry of Justice.
At the relevant time the applicant and her partner lived together in a flat in Veliko Tarnovo.
At about 10 a.m. on 19 October 2010 police officers arrived at the flat, explaining that they were to search it. They did not present a search warrant and the applicant was allegedly unable to understand what they were going to search for and who and on what ground was being investigated.
The search of the applicant’s flat continued all day and was completed at about 6 p.m. After that, until about 9 p.m., the police officers searched the premises of a company managed by the applicant and her partner, seizing at the two places numerous items.
The searches had not been carried out upon a prior authorisation by a judge. Subsequently the applicant was informed by the Dobrich Regional Court that the two records of search and seizure of 19 October 2010 had been approved by a judge of that court on 20 October 2010. This was certified by the judge’s signature in the top right corner of the records’ first page, accompanied by a stamp and a mention of the date and time.
It also became clear subsequently that the applicant and her partner were being investigated by the prosecution authorities for tax evasion. The Government submitted that the ensuing criminal proceedings against them, in which a national court gave a judgment in 2019, were still pending.
The relevant domestic law and practice have been summarised in Gutsanovi v. Bulgaria (no. 34529/10, § 59-60, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).
