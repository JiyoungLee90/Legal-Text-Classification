The case originated in an application (no. 48499/08) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Holding Kompanija Koka Hybro Komerc DOO Brojler Donje Sinkovce, a limited liability company based in Serbia (“the applicant company”), on 30 September 2008. On 4 May 2012 the applicant company informed the Court that it had changed its name to DOO Brojler Donje Sinkovce.
The applicant company was represented by Mr M. Živković, a lawyer practising in Leskovac. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 19 October 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 25 April 2005 the Commercial Court (Trgovinski sud) in Leskovac ruled in favour of a company “KHK” (at that time the applicant company’s mother company – “matično preduzeće”), and ordered GP “Rad” (a company based in Grdelica – “the debtor”) to pay: (i) RSD 20,403,432.58 (EUR 250,515) plus statutory interest as of 28 February 2001; and (ii) RSD 947,142.00 (EUR 11,630) on account of the costs of civil proceedings.
On 26 April 2005 the company “KHK” transferred this entitlement to the applicant company.
The Commercial Court judgment became final on 24 November 2005 and enforceable on 27 December 2005.
On 27 December 2005 the applicant company filed with the Municipal Court (Opštinski sud) in Leskovac requests for the enforcement of the Commercial Court judgment and for an award of the statutory interest on the costs of the civil proceedings in line with Article 35 § 1 of the Enforcement Procedure Act 2004 (see paragraph 25 below).
On 19 January 2006 the Municipal Court ordered the enforcement by evaluation and sale of the debtor’s immovable assets and the registration of the enforcement order in the real estate registry. In addition, the court awarded the applicant company the statutory interest on the costs of the civil proceedings as of 25 April 2005 and set the costs of the enforcement proceedings at RSD 69,500 (EUR 790). On 3 October 2007 the Municipal Court partially amended the enforcement order in that the enforcement by sale of some of the land plots was terminated and the costs of the enforcement proceedings were set at RSD 267,150 (EUR 3,400). These decisions became final on 14 December 2007.
On 3 June 2008 the enforcement order was registered in the Land Registry (Katastar nepokretnosti) in Leskovac.
By 19 December 2008 the Municipal Court established that the value of the debtor’s seized immovable assets was RSD 121,403,430.00 (EUR 1,356,640) and referred a third party, who was disputing the debtor’s ownership in respect of certain plots of land, to institute separate civil proceedings in that respect against the applicant company.
By 4 February 2009 the Municipal Court suspended the enforcement in respect of certain plots of land the ownership of which was disputed.
On 10 February 2009 the Municipal Court partially amended the decision of 19 December 2008 in that it assessed the value of the debtor’s seized assets at RSD 108,654,410.00 (EUR 1,214,184). On 5 March 2009 the District Court (Okružni sud) in Leskovac quashed this decision and ordered a retrial.
On 27 April 2009 the Commercial Court (Privredni sud) in Leskovac instituted the insolvency proceedings (stečajni postupak) against the debtor.
By 11 June 2009 the Municipal Court stayed the enforcement proceedings due to the initiation of the insolvency proceedings.
On 18 May 2009 the applicant company duly submitted its claim to the Commercial Court within the insolvency proceedings against the debtor, seeking that it be recognized as a secured creditor (razlučni poverilac).
On 15 June 2009, at the first creditors’ hearing, attended also by the applicant company, the Assembly of Creditors agreed that the insolvency proceedings should lead to the debtor’s bankruptcy. On 7 September 2009 the Commercial Court initiated the proceedings for the sale of the debtor’s assets.
On 24 August 2009 the Insolvency Judge (stečajni sudija) recognized the applicant company’s claim and its secured creditor status. On 24 November 2009 the Insolvency Council (stečajno veće), upon an appeal of the Insolvency Administrator (stečajni upravnik), quashed this decision and referred the applicant company to institute civil proceedings for determination of its status as a secured creditor.
On 29 March 2010 the applicant company instituted civil proceedings in this regard. By 1 June 2012 the Commercial Court dismissed the applicant company’s claim as lodged out of time. The applicant company was ordered to pay for the costs of the proceedings in the amount of RSD 485,250.00 (EUR 4,250). It would appear from the case-file that this decision is not yet final.
On 15 August 2008 the applicant company lodged a constitutional appeal seeking redress in respect of the impugned non-enforcement. In particular, the applicant company sought that its secured creditor status be recognized and that it be paid the sums claimed in the insolvency proceedings.
On 29 March 2012 the Constitutional Court held that the applicant company had suffered a breach of its property right, as well as a violation of the “right to a trial within a reasonable time” with regard to the enforcement proceedings, and dismissed the remainder of the appeal. The court also declared that the applicant company was entitled to non-pecuniary damage in the amount of EUR 600, converted into the national currency at the rate applicable at the date of settlement.
Before the insolvency proceedings the debtor company was entirely socially-owned. It has remained to be registered as such in the relevant public registries throughout the insolvency proceedings.
The insolvency proceedings are still ongoing.
Article 5 provided that the enforcement proceedings were to be conducted urgently.
Article 35 § 2 specified that, on a creditor’s request, the court would grant the statutory interest on the costs of the proceedings awarded in the final court decision.
Article 37 provided that enforcement proceedings were also to be conducted at the request of a claimant not specifically named as the creditor in the final court decision, providing that the former could prove, by means of an “official or other legally certified document”, that the entitlement in question had subsequently been transferred to it from the original creditor.
Articles 98 – 153 set out details as regards the enforcement by sale of the debtor’s immovable assets. Article 99 in particular provided that the enforcement was to be carried out by registering the enforcement order in the real estate registry (zabeležba), evaluation and sale of the debtor’s immovable property, and paying off the creditors. Article 102 further specified the creditor’s right to be compensated from the sale of property in respect of which the enforcement order was registered in the land registry.
On 17 September 2011 the new Enforcement Procedure Act came into force thereby repealing the Enforcement Procedure Act 2004. Article 358 provides that the enforcement proceedings instituted before this Act came into force will be continued pursuant to the provisions of the Enforcement Procedure Act 2011.
Article 1 specified that the insolvency proceedings were to be conducted against an insolvent debtor with a view to paying off the creditors either through the debtor’s bankruptcy or its reorganization.
The insolvency proceedings were to be conducted urgently (Article 29), by a competent court (Article 7), through an insolvency judge and a council, while certain competences were granted to an insolvency administrator, as well as to an assembly (skupština) and a board (odbor) of creditors (Article 9). The assembly of creditors, excluding the secured creditors, was specifically entrusted with deciding whether the insolvency proceedings should lead to the debtor’s bankruptcy or reorganization on the basis of the debtor’s financial report and the insolvency administrator’s proposal (Articles 22-24). Should the Assembly chose the bankruptcy, the insolvency council would begin with the debtor’s sale (Article 23 § 5).
The secured creditors, unlike other creditors, had the right to be paid off from the funds obtained by the sale of assets in respect of which they had the security (Article 38). The unsecured creditors were to be paid proportionally and according to the tier in which they were placed. The payments on account of the costs of insolvency proceedings, the guaranteed salaries and related contributions and benefits, as well as public debts, respectively, had priority (Article 35).
Article 73 provided that “as of the day of institution of the insolvency proceedings” the debtor could not simultaneously be subjected to a separate enforcement procedure. Any ongoing enforcement proceedings were to be stayed and new enforcement proceedings could not be instituted as long as the insolvency proceedings were pending.
Upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings, the creditors had to report their claims to the court (Article 90). Claims that were not disputed by the insolvency administrator or the creditors were to be considered determined (Article 94). The insolvency administrator and the creditors had the right to appeal against a decision (zaključak) of the insolvency judge on the list of determined and disputed claims (Article 94).
The creditor whose claim was disputed in the insolvency proceedings was instructed to initiate civil or other proceedings requesting a determination of such a claim (Article 96). The claim so determined would have legal effect in respect of the debtor and the creditors (Articles 94 and 97).
The Insolvency Act 2009 entered into force on 24 January 2010, thereby repealing the Insolvency Act 2004. In accordance with Articles 207 however, all insolvency proceedings instituted prior to 24 January 2010 are, in principle, to be concluded pursuant to the legislation which was in force at the relevant time.
