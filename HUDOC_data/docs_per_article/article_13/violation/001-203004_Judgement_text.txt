The present case concerns the applicants’ property dispute with the local authorities and private companies over a flat and a building and the nonenforcement of final court decisions given in the applicants’ favour. The applicants invoke Articles 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
The applicants were born in 1973 and 1976 respectively. They currently live in Moscow.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna of the Ministry of Justice.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
In June 2001 the applicants instituted proceedings in the Yalta Court against the Yalta Town Council (“the Council”), seeking to declare as “suitable for living” a building (a former dormitory) at 39 “г” Kirova Street in Yalta (“the building”) in which they had been residing since 1982 and which, according to them, was owned by no one. They also invited the court to order the Council to transfer the building to municipal ownership and to issue them with a document permitting them to dwell in it (ордер на квартиру).
On 19 September 2001 the court allowed that claim. On 18 February 2002 the Court of Appeal of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (“the ARC Court of Appeal”) upheld the judgment.
On 24 January 2003 the Yalta Town Executive Committee (“the Committee”) gave a decision authorising the applicants to reside in flat no. 2 (“the flat”) in the aforementioned building.
On 5 October 2004, in accordance with a decision given by the same Committee, the applicants and their son became the owners of the flat and they were issued with the relevant privatisation certificates.
On 6 October 2004 the Yalta Technical Inventory Bureau (“the Inventory Bureau”) registered the applicants’ property rights over the flat.
On 7 September 2005 the Council excluded the building from municipal ownership as the flats had been privatised by their residents. It also transferred the building to the joint private ownership of the applicants and of the owners of the building’s other flats.
On an unspecified date the Company “Sanatoriy im. Kirova Ltd” (“Company 1”) requested the Yalta Court to reopen the proceedings and review the judgment of 19 September 2001 under newly-discovered circumstances. It claimed to be the owner of the building.
On 18 November 2005 the court allowed the request, quashed the judgment of 19 September 2001 and reopened the proceedings. In the course of the proceedings Company 1 submitted a counter-claim seeking to annul the decisions of 24 January 2003 and 7 September 2005, invalidate the applicants’ property certificates over the flat and evict them.
On 15 May 2007 the court rejected the applicants’ and Company 1’s claims. It found that the applicants had valid property title to the flat and their claim of June 2001 against the Council was therefore groundless. It further found no evidence to conclude that the building had belonged to Company 1.
On 15 October 2007 the ARC Court of Appeal quashed the above-mentioned judgment, rejected the applicants’ claim and partly allowed that of Company 1. It annulled the decisions of 24 January 2003 and 7 September 2005, invalidated the applicants’ documents of title to the flat and ordered the Inventory Bureau to register Company 1 as the owner of the building. Company 1’s claim for the applicants’ eviction was rejected.
The applicants appealed on points of law. In the meantime, Company 1 had registered its property rights over the building, and on 17 January 2008 had sold it to the Company “Topaz-K Ltd” (“Company 2”), but had failed to have the sale contract certified by a notary.
On 9 April 2008 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment of 15 October 2007 and sent the case for re-examination to the ARC Court of Appeal, which on 10 November 2008 upheld the judgment of 15 May 2007.
On 29 January 2009 the applicants applied to the Yalta Court to reverse execution of the judgment of 15 October 2007.
On 17 June 2009 the Supreme Court upheld the judgments of 15 May 2007 and 10 November 2008. Shortly thereafter, on 16 September 2009, Company 2 sold the building to the Company “Selbilliar Ltd” (“Company 3”).
On 4 November 2009 the Yalta Court reversed the execution of the judgment of 15 October 2007 and ordered the Inventory Bureau to register the applicants’ property rights to the flat. This judgment became final on 12 November 2009, but remained unexecuted.
On 20 January 2010 the Inventory Bureau informed the applicants that it was impossible to enforce the above judgment and to register their property rights over the flat, as that flat, as well as others in the building, had already been registered as the property of Company 3 on the basis of the sale contract of 16 September 2009.
On an unspecified date the applicants instituted administrative proceedings in the Yalta Court, challenging the Inventory Bureau’s failure to restore their registration as the owners of the flat.
On 16 February 2010 the court found for the applicants and ordered the Inventory Bureau to renew the registration of their property rights over the flat. In doing so, the court noted that Company 3 was registered as the owner of the building but not of the flat, which was a separate object of immovable property belonging to the applicants.
On 22 November 2010 the Sevastopol Administrative Court of Appeal upheld this judgment, which thus became final but remained unexecuted.
On an unspecified date Company 2 instituted court proceedings against Company 1, seeking validation of the sale contract of 17 January 2008 (see paragraph 14 above) and the acknowledgment of its property rights over the building.
On 21 May 2009 the ARC Commercial Court allowed Company 2’s claim and declared that Company 2 was the owner of the building.
On 11 September 2009 the Inventory Bureau registered Company 2 as the owner of the building.
On 22 February 2010 the Higher Commercial Court quashed the judgment of 21 May 2009 and referred the case back for re-examination.
On 3 March 2010 Company 3, which had bought the building from Company 2 on 16 September 2009, sold it to the Company “High Tech Group Ltd” (“Company 4”). On 2 April 2010 Company 4 registered its title to the building in the State registry.
On 7 June 2010 the ARC Commercial Court terminated the proceedings as Companies 1 and 2 had ceased to exist.
In March 2010 the applicants lodged a claim with the Yalta Court against Companies 2-4 and the Inventory Bureau, seeking the invalidation of the sale contracts of 16 September 2009 and 3 March 2010 (see paragraphs 17 and 27 above), confirmation of their property rights to the flat, restitution of the building from Company 4 and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. They stated that pursuant to the valid decision of 7 September 2005 (see paragraph 9 above), they had owned the building jointly with the other owners of flats in it. They further alleged that the building had been sold together with the flats in it, including their own (see paragraph 27 above).
On 14 April 2011 the court partly allowed the claim, invalidated the sale contracts at issue and ordered the defendants to pay non-pecuniary damages to the applicants. It found that the flat had been unlawfully included in those contracts. Having further noted that the applicants’ property title to the flat and the building had been confirmed by the relevant certificates issued by the Council, which had been valid, and that the applicants were still “using” the building, it found no need to reconfirm their property rights and dismissed the remainder of their claims.
On 4 July 2011 the ARC Court of Appeal quashed this judgment. It held that since there had been no evidence that the applicants’ property rights to the flat had been breached and they continued living in it, their claim for the protection of the right that had not been breached could not be allowed. In particular, it referred to the judgment of 16 February 2010 (see paragraph 21 above), which established that Company 3 had registered its property title to the building but not to the flat.
On 25 October 2011 the Higher Specialised Civil and Criminal Court (“the HSC”) upheld the judgment of 4 July 2011.
On 25 April 2012 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment of 25 October 2011 and referred the case back to the HSC for re-examination. It upheld the lower courts’ findings that the applicants owned their flat, lived in it and did not therefore require its restitution from Company 4. However, their claim also concerned their property rights over the building, which they had jointly owned pursuant to the decision of 7 September 2005, but the lower courts had disregarded that aspect of the claim.
On 14 November 2012 the HSC quashed the judgment of 4 July 2011 and sent the case to the ARC Court of Appeal for a new examination.
On 6 February 2013, following a request from Company 4, the latter court suspended the proceedings until a final decision was delivered in the fifth set of proceedings (see paragraphs 38-41 below).
The applicants appealed against the ruling of 6 February 2013 to the HSC, which on 1 March 2013 opened the cassation proceedings. They did not inform the Court of the outcome of the fourth set of proceedings.
With reference to the Law of 15 April 2014 on protection of the rights and freedoms of citizens and legal regime of the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine (“the 2014 Law”), the Government stated that it was for the Kyiv Court of Appeal to determine a court to examine cases normally examined by the courts located on the temporarily occupied territories. However, the applicants had not applied to that court for the resumption of the proceedings after the final decision had been delivered in the fifth set of proceedings (see paragraph 41 below). The Government submitted the above-mentioned court’s letter, which stated that it had not examined the issue of determination of the court in the applicants’ case.
On an unspecified date Company 4 instituted court proceedings against the Council and the Inventory Bureau, seeking to declare unlawful and invalid a decision of the Council of 16 January 2004 whereby the property of the Kirova sanatorium to which the building had allegedly belonged was transferred to the communal property of Yalta. It also requested that the Inventory Bureau refrain from making any change in the registration titles of the building. The applicants were involved as third parties in the proceedings.
On 26 March 2013 the ARC Administrative Court partly allowed Company 4’s claim and invalidated the decision of 16 January 2004 as unlawful. It also held in the same judgment that the question of the property title to the building was not the subject of examination in this case and that it would not therefore make any legal assessment of that question.
On 30 May 2013, following the appeals by the Council and another third party, the Sevastopol Administrative Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of 26 March 2013 and rejected Company 4’s claim.
According to the Government (no copy of the relevant decision was provided), on 2 April 2014 the Higher Administrative Court quashed the judgment of 30 May 2013 and upheld the judgment of 26 March 2013.
Article 331 of the Civil Code (2004) provides that property rights to real estate emerge from the moment of their State registration. Section 3 and the final provisions of the State Registration of Real Property Rights Act (2004) further provided at the material time that the State registration of property rights to real estate was carried out by technical inventory bureaus.
