The case originated in an application (no. 6387/10) against the Republic of Slovenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Aleksander Pečenko (“the applicant”), on 22 January 2010.
The applicant was represented by Odvetniška družba Matoz o.p., d.o.o., a law office practicing in Koper. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs N. Pintar Gosenca, State Attorney.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the conditions of his detention in Ljubljana prison amounted to a violation of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention, and that he had no effective remedy in this regard as required by Article 13 of the Convention.
On 30 August 2013 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Kamna Gorica.
The applicant served his prison sentence in the closed and semi-open sections of Ljubljana prison.
In the period from 7 June 2009 to 31 August 2009 he was held in the closed section: for five days in cell 117, measuring 17.66 square metres (not including a separate 1.68 square metre sanitary facility) shared with three to five other inmates and with 2.66 to 3.99 square metres of personal space and for eighty-one days in cell 7 measuring 16.7 square metres (not including a separate 1.68 square metre sanitary facility). The Government submitted that in cell 7 the number of prisoners varied between three and five and when there were three prisoners therein the applicant had 5 square metres of personal space.
In the period between 1 September 2009 and 12 November 2009 he was held in the semi-open section in cell 137, measuring 17.94 square metres (not including a separate 1.75 square metre sanitary facility) shared with two to four other inmates and with 3.2 to 5.4 square metres of personal space and cell 136, measuring 18.44 square metres (not including a separate 1.78 square metre sanitary facility) shared with two to four other inmates and with 3.3 to 5.6 square metres of personal space.
As regards the general characteristics of the cells in the closed and semi-open sections, material conditions inside the cells, sanitary conditions and health care, see the judgment in Štrucl and Others v. Slovenia, nos. 5903/10, 6003/10 and 6544/10, §§ 21 to 32, 20 October 2011.
As to the out-of-cell time in the closed section, the Court found in the aforementioned judgment that sentenced prisoners in the closed section of the prison were locked up in their cells and were only able to leave them if they applied for certain activities, most of which were to take place in the recreation room. There was, however, only one 50square-metre recreation room per floor, which was to be used by ten inmates at most (Štrucl and Others § 86).
As to the out-of-cell time in the semi-open section, the Government submitted that the cell doors in the semi-open section of the prison were unlocked, except from 9.45 p.m. (on Fridays, Saturdays and before holidays from midnight) until 6.00 a.m. (on Saturdays, Sundays and during holidays until 8.30 a.m.). During this time prisoners could move freely in the corridor (35.7 square metres), living quarters of co-prisoners or in the indoor or outdoor exercise areas, in accordance with prison rules. The Government contended that this regime had been in place for several years.
As regards the cell temperature, the data provided by the Government showed that the average temperature in the cells in the late afternoon (5- 5.30 p.m.) in the second half of July and August 2009 had been approximately 28oC, exceeding 30oC on seven days.
