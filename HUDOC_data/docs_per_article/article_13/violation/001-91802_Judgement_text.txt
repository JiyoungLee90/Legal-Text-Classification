The case originated in an application (no. 67149/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovakian national, Mrs Jarmila Berková (“the applicant”), on 4 August 2000.
The Government of the  (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Pirošíková.
On 24 November 2005 and 12 December 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the respective parts of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Poprad.
On 14 April 1993 the District Court in Poprad restricted the applicant’s legal capacity in that she was not allowed to act on her own before public authorities. The court relied on the opinion of several experts concluding that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder as a result of paranoid development of her personality. The applicant suffered from the delusion that she was being persecuted and on that ground she had made a considerable number of complaints and other submissions. The applicant’s mother was appointed guardian for the purpose of the proceedings concerning the limitation of the applicant’s legal capacity.
On 18 April 1994 the  in Košice upheld the first-instance judgment, which became final on 26 July 1994.
On 1 August 1994 the District Court in Poprad brought proceedings on its own initiative with a view to appointing a guardian for the applicant, whose legal capacity had been restricted by the above decisions. On 12 September 1994 the file was transmitted to the  in Košice for decision on an objection to the judges of the District Court.
On 30 December 1994 the  excluded the judges of the District Court in Poprad and transferred the case to the District Court in Prešov. The file was returned to the District Court in Poprad on 9 March 1995. The decision was served on the applicant on 20 March 1995. On 6 April 1995 the file was sent to the District Court in Prešov where the case was registered under number P 81/95.
On 12 July 1995 and 30 August 1995 the District Court asked the applicant’s husband to inform it about persons who could act as the applicant’s guardian. The mail was returned to the court with the explanation that the addressee was in hospital. On 19 September 1995 the Town Office in Poprad submitted information at the District Court’s request of 30 August 1995.
On 29 September 1995 the District Court asked the applicant’s mother whether she was willing to act as her daughter’s guardian. The mother replied in the negative.
On 5 October 1995 the court appointed a judicial secretary to act as the applicant’s guardian in the proceedings in issue.
On 18 October 1995 the applicant’s brother refused to act as guardian.
On 31 October 1995 the Town Office in Poprad informed the District Court that its employees were unable to identify a person willing to act as the applicant’s guardian. On 14 and 16 November 1995 the applicant’s sisters refused to assume that duty.
At a hearing held on 4 December 1995 the  proposed that its employee Mrs Ch. be appointed as the applicant’s guardian. That person stated that the applicant had no confidence in her. The case was adjourned and the court asked the municipality to indicate an employee of the Town Office who would act as the applicant’s guardian. On 18 December 1995 the  again proposed that Mrs Ch. should be charged with that responsibility. In a letter of 15 January 1996 the applicant replied that she disagreed.
On 29 January 1996 Mrs  informed the court that she had been unable to find any person willing to assume the duty in question. The District Court decided that Mrs K., a person who had represented the town of  at the previous hearing, should act as the guardian. Both Mrs K. and the applicant appealed in March 1996. On 1 April 1996 Mrs K.’s appeal was sent to the District Prosecutor’s Office.
On 20 June 1996 the  in Košice quashed the District Court’s decision of 29 January 1996.
On 16 July 1996 the first-instance court made five inquiries with a view to finding a suitable person. Those inquiries were unsuccessful.
On 5 September 1996 the District Court decided that the Town Office in Poprad should act as the applicant’s guardian. The decision was served on the applicant, after several unsuccessful attempts, on 3 December 1996. On 11 December 1996 the applicant appealed.
The file was sent to the  in Košice on 20 January 1997. On 13 March 1997 it was transmitted to the  in Prešov, due to a change in the jurisdiction of the courts of appeal.
On 21 March 1997 the  in Prešov quashed the first-instance decision on the ground that the Town Office lacked legal capacity and therefore could not act as the applicant’s guardian.
On 6 May 1997 the District Court appointed the  as the applicant’s guardian in respect of all actions involving the applicant’s relations with public authorities.
On 10 July 1997 the applicant appealed. She also challenged the District Court judges.
Between 17 July 1997 and 28 August 1997 the file was submitted to the  in Košice for consultation.
On 24 September 1997 the file was submitted to the  in Prešov for a decision on the applicant’s appeal. The  returned the file to the first-instance court with the instruction that the District Court judge should first comment on the request for her exclusion and that a mistake in the decision of 6 May 1997 should be rectified.
The District Court delivered a rectified decision on 24 October 1997. The court had difficulties in serving the rectified decision on the applicant, who received it on 8 December 1997.
On 26 January 1998 the  in Prešov upheld the decision on the appointment of a guardian and dismissed the applicant’s request for the withdrawal of the first-instance court judge. The decision became final on 14 April 1998.
On 21 October 1998 the  proposed to the Prešov District Court that legal capacity should be restored to the applicant.
On 18 January 1999 the District Court appointed an expert with a view to assessing the applicant’s health. On 22 January 1999 it asked a local authority to submit a report on the applicant.
On 2 February 1999 the applicant challenged the expert, alleging that drugs had been forcibly administered to her in the hospital department where the expert worked. On 28 April 1999 the District Court appointed a different expert, who was requested to submit an opinion within sixty days.
On 16 July 1999 the expert appointed by the court proposed that an expert in psychology should assist him. He also asked for an extension of the time-limit within which the opinion was to be submitted.
After they had examined the applicant as an outpatient on 7 and 10 August 1999 the experts submitted an opinion to the District Court on 29 August 1999. It comprised twenty-three pages. According to the opinion, the applicant had been suffering from a chronic disorder resulting in a querulous type of paranoia for many years. She had no critical approach to the disorder and she remained persuaded that her actions were correct. The applicant understood judicial proceedings only within the frame of her mental disorder, in that she remained convinced that courts and other authorities were doing harm to her. The illness was of a lasting character and had developed in a slow and latent manner. It had advanced as compared with 1993, when the applicant’s legal capacity had first been restricted. The experts did not recommend that the applicant be heard in person by a court or that judgments should be served on her, as she was unable to understand the scope of the proceedings and the judicial decisions correctly.
On 9 November 1999 the Prešov District Court heard the expert appointed and the representative of the authority acting as the applicant’s guardian. The latter stated that the proposal to restore full legal capacity to the applicant had been submitted as she had appeared well balanced at that time. However, officials of the  had encountered serious difficulties with the applicant during the subsequent period. The representative confirmed that the applicant had reacted in an inappropriate manner whenever authorities had failed to act in accordance with her wishes.
The District Court also heard a guardian whom it had appointed to represent the applicant in the proceedings. The guardian did not propose restoring full legal capacity to the applicant as her health had not improved.
Relying on the expert opinion the District Court decided not to hear the applicant. Reference was made to Article 187 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
In its judgment of 9 November 1999 the District Court referred in detail to the applicant’s situation and behaviour. With reference to the experts’ conclusion it held that numerous abusive complaints, submissions and appeals which the applicant had made proved that her personality disorder persisted, resulting in her querulous behaviour. The court therefore decided not to restore full legal capacity to the applicant.
As the applicant’s mental disorder was chronic and since it could not be expected that her health would improve, the court decided that the applicant was not to be allowed to make a fresh request for full legal capacity to be restored to her for three years from the date of the judgment. Reference was made to Article 186 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Following the explicit recommendation of the experts, the District Court decided not to serve the judgment on the applicant. It became final on 11 December 1999.
On 5 December 2000 the General Prosecutor lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law on the applicant’s behalf, in which he contested the decision that the applicant was not entitled to make a fresh claim concerning her legal capacity for three years. The General Prosecutor objected that the District Court had decided exclusively at the request of the applicant’s guardian and that it had failed to decide on the applicant’s requests seeking restoration of full legal capacity, which were included in the file.
The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on points of law on 19 December 2000. It held that the first-instance court had considered all relevant facts, including the applicant’s submissions.

On 6 June 1995 the proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of the above proceedings no. P 81/95 concerning the appointment of a guardian. A guardian was appointed to represent the applicant in the divorce proceedings. The decision to stay the proceedings was served on that guardian on 21 June 1995.
On 6 July 1995 the applicant appealed against the decision to stay the divorce proceedings. The file was transmitted to the Regional Court of Košice on 25 July 1995. On 22 December 1995 the  dismissed the appeal on the ground that the applicant lacked the standing to file it, as her legal capacity had been restricted on 14 April 1993.
The judge made inquiries as regards the progress of proceedings no. P 81/95 on 3 May 1995, 5 June 1997, 3 March 1998 and 27 April 1998.
On 15 May 1998 the District Court asked the  to inform it, as the applicant’s guardian, whether it was seeking determination of the applicant’s petition for divorce. The court reiterated that request on 19 August 1998 and 17 November 1998. On 7 December 1998 the  replied in the affirmative. On 19 January 1999 the  submitted further documents and information at the court’s request of 22 December 1998.

On 14 February 1994 the applicant claimed before the Poprad District Court that property she and her husband jointly owned as spouses should be divided. The judge decided to wait for the outcome of the proceedings on the applicant’s legal capacity, which were then pending before the court of appeal.
As the Poprad District Court judges considered themselves biased, due to the applicant’s past statements about them, the file was submitted to the  in Košice.

On 19 February 2001 the  withdrew the applicant’s action on the ground that the applicant and her husband had divorced in the meantime.

On 11 January 2005 the  declared admissible the complaint about a violation of the applicant’s right to a hearing by an independent tribunal and without unjustified delays in the proceedings concerning a labour dispute which had been pending since 1987. It rejected the remaining complaints for the following reasons.
The Constitutional Court rejected as having been lodged outside the statutory two-month time-limit complaints relating to (i) the claim for division of matrimonial property of 14 February 1994, (ii) the applicant’s claim for maintenance of 10 February 1994 and (iii) the proceedings concerning the placement of the applicant in a mental hospital for the purpose of examination of her health, in which the final decision had been given in 1996.
The  noted that the District Court in Poprad had failed to proceed with the applicant’s claims for compensation for movable property of 4 July 1996 and for custody of her children and their maintenance, lodged on 30 May 1996. It found no violation of her constitutional rights in that context, as the applicant’s legal capacity had been restricted and she had not been entitled to bring judicial proceedings herself. After examination of the relevant files, the  held that the authority appointed to act as her guardian had not failed to comply with any of its duties. In particular, the applicant’s guardian had acted with due care in the divorce proceedings in 1994 in the context of which both the custody and maintenance of the children and the division of marital property had been determined.
On 20 April 2005 the  gave a decision on the merits of the admissible part of the case. It found that the Poprad District Court had violated the applicant’s right to a hearing without unjustified delay. It noted that the proceedings had been pending for over seventeen years and that during the period falling within its jurisdiction (from 17 March 1993) there had been delays imputable to the District Court totalling 135 months. The  granted the applicant 90,000 Slovakian korunas (SKK) as just satisfaction. It ordered the District Court to proceed with the case without delay and to reimburse the costs of the applicant’s representation in the constitutional proceedings.
Article 10 §§ 2 and 3 entitles courts to restrict the legal capacity of individuals who, inter alia, are suffering from a lasting mental disorder and who are therefore capable of taking only certain legal actions. A restriction on a person’s legal capacity or his or her deprivation thereof has to be cancelled or its scope modified when the underlying grounds change or fall away.
Article 58 § 1 entitles courts to exempt a party from the obligation to respect a time-limit which that party has failed to respect for a justifiable reason. A request to that effect has to be made within fifteen days from the date the obstacle preventing the party from taking the relevant legal action has fallen away.
Under Article 186 § 3, as in force at the relevant time, a person who was deprived of legal capacity could claim that it should be restored to him or her. However, where a court dismissed such a request and where it could not be expected that the condition of the person concerned would improve, courts were entitled to prevent that person from making a similar request for an appropriate period, the length of which could not exceed three years.
With effect from 1 October 2004 Article 186 § 3 has been amended in that the period during which a person can be prevented from claiming restoration of his or her legal capacity was reduced to a maximum of one year.
In a commentary on the above amendment the view was expressed that the original three-year period had been excessively long and capable of seriously affecting a person’s human rights. In view of the progress of medical science, reduction of that period to a maximum of one year was considered appropriate (see Občiansky súdny poriadok, Nová práca, spol. s r.o., 2006, p. 265).
Article 187 § 2 provides that a court can refrain from hearing a person whose legal capacity is to be restricted where it is not possible to hear such a person at all or where a hearing would impair that person’s health.
Under Article 189 § 2, courts can refrain from serving a decision concerning a person’s legal capacity where its service can have a negative impact on that person because of his or her mental disorder or where the person concerned is not capable of understanding the meaning of the decision.
