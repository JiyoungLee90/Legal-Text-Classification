The case originated in two applications (nos. 38372/06 and 24572/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Gülpınar Adıyaman and Güllüzar Erman, who are Turkish nationals, born in 1974 and 1973 respectively. The introduction dates of the applications are indicated in the appended table.
The applicants were represented by Ms G. Tuncer and Mr F. N. Ertekin, lawyers practising in İstanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 19 May 2009 the Court decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants are Turkish nationals who were arrested and subsequently detained pending judicial proceedings. They are still in detention pending trial. The information concerning the dates of the arrests, the dates of the orders for the applicants' pretrial detention, the dates of the bills of indictment, the dates of the domestic court decisions, the total period of pre-trial detention, the total period of the criminal proceedings where relevant and the grounds for continued detention is set out in the appendix.
