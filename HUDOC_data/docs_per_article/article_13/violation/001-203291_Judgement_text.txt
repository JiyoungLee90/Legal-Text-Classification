The application concerns the compensation for a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in relation to the disproportionality of the rent received by the applicants. The domestic courts have acknowledged the violation and awarded compensation. The question arises as to whether the applicants remain victims of the violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and whether an issue arises as to the effectiveness of the domestic remedy.
The applicants were born in 1950 and 1947 respectively and live in Sliema. The applicants were represented by Dr I. Refalo, Dr M. Refalo and Dr S. Grech, lawyers practising in Valletta, Malta.
The Government were initially represented by their Agent, Dr P. Grech, Attorney General, and later by their Agent Dr V. Buttigieg, State Advocate.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The applicants own property No. 49, Old College Street, Sliema (“the property”) which they inherited from their parents who died on 4 February 2009 and 26 March 2010.
In 1957 the property had been requisitioned in favour of a third party. Upon agreement between the parties, as of 9 February 1958 the third party paid the applicants’ father 61 British pounds (GBP) annually under a lease agreement covered by the special laws concerning protected leases, in this case the Reletting of Urban Property (Regulation) Ordinance, Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta (which applied various restrictions on the lease agreement, such as the impossibility of increasing the rent and the obligation to renew the lease which was inheritable by the tenant’s descendants).
On 29 July 1958 the property was derequisitioned and remained in the tenant’s possession under title of lease according to the above-mentioned law and conditions.
In 1980, upon agreement between the parties, the rent was fixed at 100 Maltese liras (MLT) (approximately 233 euros (EUR)) annually). The same rent continued to be deposited in the court’s registry by the heir of the third party, who inherited the lease in 1998, but was not recognised as a tenant by the owners. Between 2004 and 2010 the rent had been accepted during negotiations between the parties in relation to the vacation of the property.
Amendments to the law improved the position of the owners from 2010 onwards in line with Article 1513C of the Civil Code which established a minimum rent of EUR 185 until 2013, of EUR 197 as of 2013 and EUR 210 as of 2016 until 2019.
The applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings claiming, inter alia, that the provisions of the Reletting Urban Property Ordinance, Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta  which imposed on them the obligation to renew the lease on a yearly basis without a possibility of increasing the rent was in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. They asked the court to award compensation for the damage suffered and to evict the tenants. In their submissions, they limited their claim to the period of 1987 onwards (when Malta introduced the right of individual petition).
By a judgment of 30 November 2015 the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional competence, inter alia, found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 [for the period 1987 onwards], refused the request to evict the tenants but awarded the applicants EUR 20,000 in compensation. The court also found a violation of Article 14 in this connection. Costs were to be paid by the Attorney General (except for those related to a firstinstance decision quashed in an interlocutory appeal).
The court noted that, according to the court-appointed expert, in 2012 the property had a sale value of EUR 560,000 and a rental value of EUR 16,800 annually (EUR 1,400 monthly) while in 1987 it had a rental value of EUR 2,703 annually. The court noted that the parties had not requested the appointment of additional experts. Thus, the rent payable to the applicants was substantially inferior to its market value and consequently a fair balance between the interests involved had not been reached. Bearing in mind the courtappointed expert’s valuations and that the applicants’ complaint concerned the period after 1987 as well as the legitimate aim pursued by the measure and the fact that the applicant only complained in 2010, it awarded EUR 20,000 arbitrio bon viri.
On appeal by both parties, by a judgment of 24 June 2016 the Constitutional Court, inter alia, upheld the finding of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, reduced the compensation to EUR 10,000 covering both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage and ordered that the tenants could no longer rely on the relevant law to retain the property. It noted that it was not for courts of constitutional competence to award material damage which could be obtained in ordinary proceedings, but rejected the Government’s argument that the applicants could have requested the Rent Regulation Board (RRB) to increase their rent since this would not have significantly improved their situation. It reversed the judgment in relation to the complaint under Article 14 which had been upheld by the lower court. Part of the costs of the appeal was to be paid by the applicants.
Following the Constitutional Court judgment the parties negotiated a new reduced rent on condition that the lease would terminate within eighteen months. On an unspecified date in 2017, the tenants vacated the property.
