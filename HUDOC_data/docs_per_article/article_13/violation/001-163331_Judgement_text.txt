The case originated in two applications (nos. 12878/10 and 74858/12), against the Republic of Albania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Albanian nationals. Details of the applicants are set out in Appendix No. 1 attached to the judgment.
The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms A. Hicka of the State Advocate’s Office.
On 20 December 2013 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants failed to submit claims for just satisfaction by the time-limit allowed (Rule 60 of the Rules of Court).
On 1 November 2002 the Durrës Commission on Restitution and Compensation of Properties (Komisioni i Kthimit dhe Kompensimit të Pronave) (“the Commission”) recognised, amongst others, the applicant’s inherited property rights over a plot of land measuring 8,000 sq. m. Since the plot was occupied, the applicant and other heirs would be compensated in kind with an equivalent plot of land.
On 23 November 2001 the Fier Commission recognised, amongst others, the applicant’s inherited property rights over a plot of land measuring 1,121 sq. m of which 598 sq. m were restored. Since the remaining plot measuring 523 sq. m was occupied, the applicant and other heirs would be awarded compensation in the sum of 251,040 Albanian Lek (“ALL”).
