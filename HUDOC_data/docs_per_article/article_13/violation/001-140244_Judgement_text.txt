The case originated in an application (no. 34939/12) against the Portuguese Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Portuguese national, Ms Maria do Sameiro Alves (“the applicant”), on 4 June 2012.
The applicant was represented by Mr J. J. F. Alves, a lawyer practising in Matosinhos (Portugal). The Portuguese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. F. Graça de Carvalho, Deputy-Attorney General.
On 17 October 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Porto.
On 31 May 2005 the applicant started criminal proceedings against several people before the Court of Fafe (domestic proceedings no. 310/05.0TAFAF), accusing them of illegally changing property boundaries.
On 2 October 2006 the Public Prosecutor (Ministério Público) filed the case. The applicant requested a judicial investigation to be opened (abertura de instrução).
On 23 October 2006 the applicant sought to intervene in the proceedings as an assistant to the public prosecutor (assistente).
On 20 June 2008 the applicant claimed damages under civil law against one of the defendants.
On 3 November 2008 the parties reached an agreement on the civil claim. On the same date the criminal proceedings ended with the withdrawal of the complaint by the applicant.
On 22 May 2009 the applicant started enforcement proceedings for the execution of the agreement.
On 20 July 2009 the defendant contested the enforcement. The claim was accepted by the court on 4 December 2009.
On 7 April 2011, after two appeals before the Guimarães court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Justice, the latter court determined that the enforcement proceedings should continue.
On 9 September 2011 the court ordered the attachment (penhora).
On 30 October 2012 the parties reached an agreement and the enforcement proceedings ended.
