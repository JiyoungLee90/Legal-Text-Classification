On 14 March 1994 the Elin Pelin District Prosecutor’s Office dropped the charges against the applicant’s coaccused and on 27 June 1994 indicted the applicant.
The Elin Pelin District Court examined the case in six hearings which took place between October 1994 and November 1995. It heard a number of witnesses. Three of the hearings were adjourned because certain witnesses, despite being duly subpoenaed, failed to appear.

Following a few additional inquiries, on 8 June 1999 the investigator sent the file to the Elin Pelin District Prosecutor’s Office with a proposal to drop the charges against the applicant. Finding that its instructions had not been complied with, on 4 October 1999 that Office once more referred the case back to the investigator.

The Elin Pelin District Court examined the case in six hearings which took place between September 2001 and June 2002. It heard a number of witnesses and one expert. Three of the hearings were adjourned because of the absence of witnesses who had not been duly subpoenaed. One hearing was adjourned because the applicant had not been summoned and consequently did not appear. One of the adjournments was also due to the applicant’s request to call additional witnesses.
In a judgment of 10 June 2002 the Elin Pelin District Court found the applicant guilty. It sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment, suspended – below the statutory minimum. In determining the sentence it took into account the applicant’s lack of prior convictions, the lack of information that he was of bad character, the long lapse of time between the commission of the offence and the handing down of the court’s judgment, and the fact that the offence had remained inchoate.
The applicant appealed.
