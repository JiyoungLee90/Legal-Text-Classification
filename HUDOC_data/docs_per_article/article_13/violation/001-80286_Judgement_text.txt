The Government submitted that on 16 October 2003 the debtor in the applicant's case had transferred the amount awarded by the judgment of 11 September 1998 to the Bailiffs Service's bank account. By letter of 30 January 2004 the applicant was requested to provide information necessary for a bank or postal transfer of this amount from the Bailiffs Service's account to the applicant. Since the applicant failed to provide such information the awarded amount remains unpaid to him.

On 2 June 2004 the Kirovograd Regional Court of Appeal quashed this decision and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. On 25 April 2005 the Leninskyy District Court found against the applicant. The applicant submitted that he had learned about this judgment only from the Government's observations submitted to the Court in September 2005. He did not request to renew a time-limit for lodging an appeal against it.

On 11 February 2004 the court found against the applicant. On 7 April 2004 the same court returned the applicant's appeal as he had failed to pay the court fee. On 8 July 2004 the Kirovograd Regional Court of Appeal upheld the decision of 7 April 2004. The applicant appealed against these decisions in cassation and proceedings are still pending.
