The case originated in an application (no. 70843/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Kostadin Stoyanov Balabanov (“the applicant”), on 23 April 2001.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Stoyanov, a lawyer practising in Pazardzhik. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Kotzeva, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 5 January 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the length of the criminal proceedings against the applicant. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the complaint at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Peshtera.
On 11 January 1990 the  district public prosecutor’s office opened criminal proceedings against the applicant for theft, embezzlement and other offences allegedly committed in 1989 and the beginning of 1990. On an unspecified date the applicant was formally charged.
At a later date the case was transferred to the  district public prosecutor’s office.
Subsequently, the scope of the investigation was widened to include thefts and other offences allegedly committed by the applicant after January 1990.
On an unspecified date it was established that almost the entire case file, which had consisted of thirty-two volumes, had been lost. Efforts were made to reconstruct the case file as far as possible.
On 9 April 1999 the  district public prosecutor’s office terminated the investigation on unknown grounds.
That decision was quashed by the  city public prosecutor’s office on 8 July 1999.
The decision of 8 July 1999 also contained instructions to the investigator as to the necessary investigative steps.
Between 1999 and 2002 the investigator examined several witnesses and commissioned an expert opinion by an economist to establish the value of the chattels allegedly stolen or appropriated by the applicant.
On 11 April 2005 the  district public prosecutor’s office terminated the proceedings on the ground that the prosecution of most of the offences was time-barred and that it had not been established that the applicant had committed the remaining offences.
In connection to these and other proceedings, the applicant was in pre-trial detention or in prison between May 1991 and August 1993, between 25 November and 7 December 1993 and between May 1994 and an unspecified date in 2002, 2003 or 2004.
A legislative amendment that entered into force in June 2003 introduced the possibility for an accused person to request that his case be brought for trial if the investigation had not been completed within a time-limit of one or two years, depending on the charges (Article 239a Code of Criminal Procedure, as in force until April 2006). That possibility applied with immediate effect in respect of investigations opened before June 2003. If the prosecution failed to introduce an indictment or terminate the proceedings, the trial court was under a duty to terminate the proceedings itself.
Under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988 (“the SMRDA”) individuals can in certain circumstances seek damages for unlawful acts of the authorities. The Act does not mention excessive length of proceedings as a ground for an action for damages. Nor is there any practice in the domestic courts of awarding damages for excessive length of proceedings.
