The case originated in an application (no. 36054/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Marjan Hriberšek (“the applicant”), on 20 September 2002.
The applicant was represented by the Verstovšek lawyers. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney-General.
The applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts to which he was a party was excessive. In substance, he also complained about the lack of an effective domestic remedy in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings (Article 13 of the Convention).
On 7 September 2004 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Mislinja.
On 28 March 1996 the applicant was injured in a car accident. The perpetrator of the accident had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZA.
On 30 December 1996 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZA in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 2,134,069 Slovenian tolars (approximately 8,900 euros) for the injuries sustained.
Between 1 September 1998 and 14 November 2003 the applicant lodged eleven preliminary written submissions.

During the proceedings, the court appointed four medical experts and a traffic expert. The applicant and the court several times urged that the expert opinions be submitted.
At the last hearing, the court decided to deliver a written judgment. The judgment, upholding the applicant’s claim in part, was served on the applicant on 5 January 2004.

On 28 October 2005 the applicant also appealed against the supplementary judgment.
