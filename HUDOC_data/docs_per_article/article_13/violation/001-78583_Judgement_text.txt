The case originated in an application (no. 14914/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Ms Pelaghia Moisei (“the applicant”), on 29 January 2003.
The applicant was represented by Mr Ştefan Urîtu, from The Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in , a non-governmental organisation based in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr A. Pârlog.
The applicant complained that the failure to enforce the judgment of 23 July 2001 violated her right to have her civil claims determined by a court within a reasonable time, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, and her right to peaceful enjoyment of her possessions, as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 8 October 2003 a Chamber of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant, Ms Pelaghia Moisei, is a Moldovan national, who was born in 1921 and lives in the .
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
In 2000 the applicant lodged with the Străşeni District Court a civil action against the Savings Bank and the Government. She sought compensation in connection with her deposits in the Savings Bank pursuant to the Parliament's decision of 29 July 1994 to revalue the savings of citizens in the Savings Bank in order to compensate for losses caused by inflation.
On 23 July 2001 the Straseni District Court found for the applicant and ordered the Government to pay her 7,696.23 Moldovan lei (MDL), (approximately 682 euros (EUR) at the time). No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final and enforceable 15 days later.
The court issued an enforcement warrant which it sent directly to the Bailiff for enforcement.
On 1 November 2001 the applicant's representative lodged a written request with the President of the Chişinău District Court asking for the enforcement of the judgment of 23 July 2001. By a letter of 15 November 2001 the President of that court replied that the enforcement of the decision was impossible because the Ministry of Finance did not have funds and advised the applicant to address the Government, the Parliament and the President of Moldova, because its own requests sent to these institutions remained unheeded.
On 28 March 2002 the applicant addressed the Ministry of Justice with a request for its assistance in enforcing the judgment. The Ministry forwarded the letter to the newly created Department for the Enforcement of Judicial Decisions (“the Department”). In a letter dated 2 July 2002, the Department informed the applicant that the enforcement warrant in her name for the sum of MDL 7,696 had been forwarded to the Central Treasury of the Ministry of Finance and added that the legislation did not provide for the forced execution of judgments against the State Budget.
On 19 September 2002 the applicant requested the assistance of the Minister of Finance in enforcing the decision. In a letter of 8 October 2002, signed by the Vice-Minister of Finance, the applicant was informed that the State Treasury, which was responsible for enforcing judgments against the State, had not received an enforcement warrant for the sum mentioned by the applicant. At the same time, it had registered another warrant for the amount of MDL 2,004. The applicant was further informed that the State Budget for the year 2002 did not provide for expenditure related to enforcement of her judgment and that therefore the judgment of 23 July 2001 could not be enforced. The applicant was advised to wait for the adoption of the State Budget for the year 2003 which might provide for such expenditure.
The Government submitted evidence of the fact that the Ministry of Finance had transferred a lump sum to the Department on 29 April 2003 for the purpose of enforcing a list of enforcement warrants, including the applicant's. The applicant received her money on 27 May 2003.
