The case originated in an application (no. 121/11) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr István Nagy (“the applicant”), on 14 December 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr P. Szabó, a lawyer practising in Eger. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Justice.
On 8 January 2015 the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Novaj.
In the context of the protraction of a former administrative procedure concerning a land dispute, the applicant brought an official liability action on 12 May 2003.
The Heves Regional Court rejected the action but, on appeal, the second-instance court quashed the decision and remitted the case to it.
The first-instance court dismissed the claim again on 13 September 2007.
On appeal, the Budapest Regional Court of Appeal considered the first-instance judgment as an interlocutory decision and reversed it.
The second-instance court found for the applicant by pronouncing the liability of the administrative authority on 31 January 2008.
Concerning the amount of damages, the first-instance court delivered a judgment on 23 December 2009.
On appeal, the Budapest Court of Appeal essentially upheld this decision on 3 June 2010.
