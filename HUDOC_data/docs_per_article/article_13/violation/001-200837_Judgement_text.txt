The case originated in an application (no. 36539/08) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by twelve Russian nationals, (see the appended table) (“the applicants”), on 24 March 2008.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 17 December 2015 the Government were given notice of the complaints under Articles 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of the Protocol No. 1 concerning the non-enforcement of the domestic decision given against a unitary enterprise (MUP) and the lack of any effective remedy in domestic law. The remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The list of applicants is set out in the appended table.
On 20 August 2007 the Novokhoperskiy District Court of Voronezh Region ordered the municipal unitary housing exploitation enterprise "Uyut", inter alia, to restore the central heating of the applicants’ houses, to pay each applicant 5,000 Russian roubles (RUB) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and further pay Ms Belova RUB 40,000 in court expenses. The judgment came into force on 9 October 2007.
On 3 December 2007 the bailiff of the Novokhoperskiy District Department of the Bailiffs’ Service opened the enforcement proceedings.
On 13 November 2008 the enforcement proceedings were terminated as the judgment could not be enforced.
On 3 December 2009 the bailiffs again initiated the enforcement proceedings. On 5 March 2009 they took formal note of the fact that the heating line leading towards the applicants’ houses had been cut off.
On 17 December 2013 the debtor company was liquidated.
The judgment remained unenforced in the part concerning the obligation to restore the central heating.
The applicants complained of the non-enforcement of the judgment of 20 August 2007 given against the unitary enterprise and of the lack of any effective remedy in domestic law.
The relevant provisions and case-law governing unitary companies with the right of economic control are summarised in Liseytseva and Maslov v. Russia (nos. 39483/05 and 40527/10, §§ 54-127, 9 October 2014)
