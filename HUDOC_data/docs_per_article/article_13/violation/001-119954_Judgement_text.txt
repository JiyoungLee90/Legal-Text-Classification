The case originated in an application (no. 27887/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Miroslav Sabev Sabev (“the applicant”), on 6 July 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms K. Boncheva, lawyers practising in Plovdiv. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Dimova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the conditions of his detention in Lovech Prison had been inhuman and degrading, that he had not had effective remedies for his complaints regarding those conditions and that the court fees in the actions for damages that he had brought against the authorities in relation to the conditions of his detention had been excessive.
On 21 September 2009 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give the Government notice of the application. Following the recomposition of the Court’s sections on 1 February 2011, the case was transferred to the Fourth Section.
The applicant was born in 1966. He is serving a life sentence without commutation in Lovech Prison.
On 4 October 1993 the applicant was placed in pretrial detention in Burgas Prison.
On 25 July 1995 the  found the applicant guilty of murder and robbery and sentenced him to death. On 30 May 1997 a threemember panel of the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld his conviction and sentence. On 22 July 1998 a fivemember panel of the Supreme Court of Cassation rejected the applicant’s petition for review. Throughout that time the applicant remained in Burgas Prison.
Following the abolition of the death penalty in December 1998, on 25 January 1999 the VicePresident of the Republic commuted the applicant’s sentence to one of life imprisonment without commutation. On 8 July 1999 the Burgas Regional Court ordered that the applicant’s sentence was to be served under the socalled “special regime” (see paragraph 41 below).
On 15 July 1999, when the Burgas Regional Court’s order of 8 July 1999 became final, the applicant was transferred to Lovech Prison, where he remains. Since that date he has been placed in different cells for different periods of time, each time with two or three other inmates.
The applicant alleged that because of his detention regime he had been subjected to isolation. He also alleged that his cell, which he shared with three other inmates, measured ten square metres. The inmates were allowed to go to the toilet and wash three times a day, for ten to fifteen minutes each time. During the rest of the time they had to relieve themselves in a plastic bucket as the cell was not equipped with toilet facilities or a sink.
The applicant also alleged that the food served in the prison was of poor quality and that he had found insects and other objects in it.
The witnesses heard in various proceedings for damages brought by the applicant, including inmates detained in the same prison (see paragraphs 20, 26 and 35 below) and kitchen staff, stated that during certain unidentified periods the applicant had had no access to newspapers or books, and had not been allowed to visit the prison chapel, go to concerts or attend rehabilitative courses. He had had no access to the prison canteen and his food had been served in his cell. One inmate stated that during a period of time there had been no fresh air or natural light in the applicant’s cell. The witnesses also corroborated the applicant’s allegations that he only had access to toilets and running water three times a day and had to use a plastic bucket the rest of the time. The kitchen staff stated that the food served in Lovech Prison met the applicable quality standards.
On 21 April 2004 the applicant complained to the prison governor about the conditions of his detention. The governor replied that in view of the applicant’s regime of detention, constant access to the toilet facilities could not be provided but inmates were allowed access to the communal toilets several times a day. As for the dimensions of the cells and their being overcrowded, the governor admitted that this was a problem in all Bulgarian prisons and stated that the administration of Lovech Prison was trying to provide the recommended minimum living space to every detainee. He disputed the allegation that prison food was of poor quality.
According to a report drawn up by the prison governor on 15 November 2009, the applicant was detained under the socalled “special regime” (see paragraph 41 below). During most of the time that he had spent in Lovech Prison the applicant had been held in cell no. 18, which measured 4 by 3.15 metres and had two windows. At first inmates had had access to toilets and running water three and, after October 2005, four times a day, in accordance with a schedule drawn up by the governor. In the autumn of 2008 toilet facilities had been installed in all life prisoners’ cells and all window frames had been changed.
The governor further stated, without specifying time periods, that the applicant had been entitled to go into the open air once a day, for one hour, and to visit the library and take part in literary and boardgame (chess and draughts) competitions. He had received an award in one such competition. According to the governor, the applicant had regular access to newspapers and magazines. He received food prepared in accordance with the applicable regulations and standards, as did all other prisoners. He had access to medical assistance, which he could receive in his cell or in the prison’s medical wing.
The governor also stated that the applicant’s “special regime” had not yet been changed to a lighter one because of numerous breaches of prison discipline on his part.
The applicant did not dispute those statements.
The Court has not been provided with information as to the conditions of the applicant’s detention after the refurbishment of Lovech Prison in the autumn of 2008. Nor has the applicant provided information about the regime under which he was placed after November 2009.
On 27 October 2004 the applicant brought a claim against the Ministry of Justice under section 1(1) of the State Liability for Damage Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act” – see paragraph 61 below). He sought 4,000 Bulgarian levs (BGN) (2,045.17 euros (EUR)) in damages in respect of the distress and humiliation resulting from the poor conditions of his detention in Lovech Prison between August 1999 and October 2004.
The judges who dealt with the case visited the prison and inspected the cells in which the applicant had been held. They also heard witnesses, ordered expert reports and gathered other evidence.
On 8 July 2005 the Lovech District Court partly allowed the claim. It found, by reference to this Court’s caselaw, that the failure to ensure that inmates had access to toilet facilities and running water amounted to inhuman treatment and was incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention and domestic law. It held that having to use a bucket for toilet needs, in a cell measuring about ten square metres, without sufficient ventilation and in the presence of others, diminished human dignity and posed a serious risk to health. The court went on to say that the applicant’s allegations that the food was of poor quality and did not meet the minimum standards were unsubstantiated as the food served in prison was prepared in compliance with the Ministry of Health requirements and portions were of the recommended size.
In assessing the quantum of damages, the court noted that the applicant had failed to establish the extent to which he had been affected psychologically and the degree to which he had suffered morally as a result of the conditions of his detention. Ruling in equity, the court awarded the applicant BGN 280 (EUR 143.16) in respect of nonpecuniary damage for the period between August 1999 and October 2004, finding that the claim in relation to the period before August 1999 had become timebarred. It applied section 10(2) of the 1988 Act (see paragraph 65 below) and ordered the applicant to pay BGN 158.80 (EUR 81.19) in court fees in respect of the part of his claim which it had dismissed.
In a final judgment of 6 January 2006 the  upheld the lower court’s judgment.
In abovementioned proceedings, the applicant acted together with a coclaimant, Mr Plamen Radkov, who was detained in the same prison and for whom the outcome of the proceedings was similar. The courts examined the applicant’s and Mr Radkov’s claims jointly and the judgments rendered were in respect of both of them. In a judgment of 10 February 2011 this Court found breaches of Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention on account of the conditions of Mr Radkov’s detention in Lovech Prison between March 2000 and October 2004 and the lack of effective remedies in that respect (see Radkov v.  (no. 2), no. 18382/05, §§ 4556, 10 February 2011).
On 20 September 2004 the applicant brought another claim against the Ministry of Justice under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act (see paragraph 61 below). He sought BGN 20,000 (EUR 10,225.84) in damages in respect of the anguish suffered as a result of his isolation between October 1993 and September 2004, initially as a prisoner on death row and then as a life prisoner under the “special regime”.
The courts heard witnesses, one of whom had been detained in Burgas Prison and the others in Lovech Prison, and gathered other evidence.
On 14 April 2005 the  dismissed the claim, finding, inter alia, that the “special regime” applied to the applicant had been prescribed by law and that the conditions of his detention did not amount to inhuman and degrading treatment.
On an appeal by the applicant, on 14 November 2005 the Veliko Tarnovo Court of Appeal quashed the lower court’s judgment. It found that the applicant had been kept in very strict isolation from October 1993 until September 2004, initially as a prisoner on death row and then under the “special regime” applicable to life prisoners. It also found that, during the applicant’s pretrial detention in Burgas Prison, his cell had had no toilet facilities but he had had free access to toilets outside the cell. Since 1999, when the applicant had been transferred to Lovech Prison, he had shared a cell with one or two inmates and had been allowed to use the toilet facilities three times a day; the rest of the time he had had to relieve himself in a bucket in the cell. The cell had had only one window, which had constantly remained closed, preventing the flow of fresh air. Furthermore, until 2001 the window had been covered with tin blinds, which had not allowed natural light into the cell. The applicant had not been given any newspapers. The court found that none of the above measures had been required under the legislation or regulations governing the execution of sentences; in particular, the requirement that life prisoners be kept under heightened supervision (see paragraph 41 below). Those conditions had been attributable to unlawful omissions of the prison administration, had amounted to illtreatment, and had caused the applicant harm.
The court ordered the Ministry of Justice to pay the applicant BGN 2,000 (EUR 1,022.58) in damages. In assessing the quantum of damages, the court noted that as a result of the poor conditions of his detention the applicant had endured, in particular, “negative feelings caused by the humiliation and debasement”. He had however failed to prove that those conditions had adversely affected his health.
On appeal, in a final judgment of 7 August 2007 (реш. № 330 от 7 август 2007 г. по гр. д. № 92/2006 г., ВКС) the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the lower court’s judgment.
The courts ordered the applicant to pay a court fee of BGN 1,080 (EUR 552.20) in respect of the part of his claim which they had dismissed, in accordance with section 10(2) of the 1988 Act (see paragraph 65 below).
On 15 October 2007 the applicant obtained a writ of execution and on 26 November 2007 requested payment.
As he did not receive payment, on 9 April 2009 the applicant brought proceedings before the Sofia City Administrative Court, requesting the court to order the Ministry of Justice to pay the sums due under the writ of execution. At the time when the applicant filed his observations in the present case (25 March 2010) the proceedings were, following a dispute between various courts as to which was competent to deal with the case, still pending at first instance before the Sofia City Administrative Court.
On 12 April 2006 the applicant brought a third claim under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act (see paragraph 61 below). He sought BGN 10,500 (EUR 5,368.56) in damages in respect of the distress and humiliation resulting from the poor conditions of his detention in Lovech Prison between October 2004 and April 2006.
The Sofia City Court heard witnesses and gathered other evidence.
On 28 December 2007 the Sofia City Court found that during the period in question the applicant’s cells had not had toilet facilities or access to running water. The applicant had been allowed to go out of his cell and use such facilities three or four times a day, and had been required to use a bucket the rest of the time. The court found that that practice was in breach of domestic law and Article 3 of the Convention. It partly allowed the applicant’s claim, ordering the Ministry of Justice to pay him BGN 750 (EUR 383.47) in damages. It noted that applicant had been awarded damages in the two previous sets of proceedings in respect of the period preceding October 2004. In assessing the quantum of damages, the court took into account the duration of the period during which the applicant had lived in the conditions described above (one year and five months), the severity of the damage sustained, the applicant’s age and the lack of permanent or temporary damage to his health as a result of those conditions. Applying section 10(2) of the 1988 Act (see paragraph 65 below), the court ordered the applicant to pay BGN 390 (EUR 199.40) in court fees in respect of the part of his claim which had been dismissed.
The applicant appealed.
It appears that, on 9 April 2009, the Sofia Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment in so far as the award of damages was concerned. As the applicant has not submitted a copy of that judgment, it is not clear whether the court quashed the part of the judgment which concerned the court fees (see paragraphs 6769 below).
In a decision of 6 December 2010 (опр. № 1189 от 6 декември 2010 г. по гр. д. № 905/2010 г., ВКС, III г. о.) the Supreme Court of Cassation refused leave to appeal on points of law and the Sofia Court of Appeal’s judgment of 9 April 2009 became final.
Until June 2009 the regime of life prisoners was governed by sections 127a127e of the Execution of Punishments Act 1969 (“the 1969 Act”), added in 1995, when life imprisonment was introduced as a form of punishment, as well as by the Act’s implementing regulations. Following its amendment in June 2002, the Act expressly provided for prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment without commutation to be placed under the same regime as those serving a life sentence with commutation (new section 127d). The implementing regulations had been amended to the same effect a year earlier, in June 2001 (new regulation 167c).
Section 127b(1) provided that, when imposing a life sentence, the court had to order the prisoner’s placement under the strictest regime, the socalled “special regime”. Prisoners placed under that regime were to be kept in locked single cells and subjected to heightened security and supervision (regulations 56(1) and 167d(1)).
Section 127b(2) provided that, if they were of good conduct, after five years life prisoners could be placed under a more lenient regime. The time spent in pretrial detention did not form part of that fiveyear period (regulation 167d(2)). The decision to place a life prisoner under a more lenient regime was, following the amendments outlined above, taken by a commission composed of prison staff and various other officials (section 17). Under section 58, the commission’s decisions could be challenged by the Minister of Justice, acting of his or her own motion or on the application of a prisoner, filed through the prison governor (regulation 65). Once under a lighter regime, life prisoners could, under certain conditions, be placed with the general prison population (section 127b(4)).
In June 2009 and February 2010 the 1969 Act and the regulations for its implementation were superseded by, respectively, the Execution of Punishments and PreTrial Detention Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”) and its implementing regulations, issued on 2 February 2010.
Section 61(1) of the 2009 Act provides that, when sentencing a convict to life imprisonment with or without commutation, the court must order that he or she be placed under the “special regime” (the three regimes applicable in prisons are the “special regime”, the “severe regime” and the “general regime” – section 65(2)). By section 71(2), persons placed under the “special regime” must be kept in constantly locked cells and be under heightened supervision. Section 71(3), which was inserted in December 2012 and came into effect on 1 January 2013, provides that persons sentenced to life imprisonment with or without commutation and placed under the “severe regime” are similarly to be kept in constantly locked cells and be placed under heightened supervision unless it is possible, having regard to the requirements of section 198(2), to place them with the general prison population. According to the explanatory note to the draft bill laid before Parliament, this new provision was necessary to prevent legal challenges brought by lifers to their being kept constantly under lock and key even though their regime had been changed from “special” to “severe” (see paragraphs 5660 below).
Sections 197199 specifically deal with the regime of life prisoners with or without commutation.
Section 197(1) provides that life sentences are to be served in purposebuilt prisons or, failing such prisons, in separate units of other prisons. Section 197(2) provides that, in the absence of special provisions applicable to the regime of life prisoners, the provisions governing other forms of imprisonment apply to them as well.
Section 198(1) provides that a life prisoner may be placed under a more lenient regime if he or she has shown good behaviour and has served not less than five years of his or her sentence. Section 198(2) provides that life prisoners may be placed with the general prison population and take part in common work, training, educational activities, sport, or other activities by decision of the Execution of Sentences Commission on the basis of a personality assessment, provided that they were already in the “severe regime”. That commission comprises the prison governor, a member of a supervisory board, the prison deputy governor in charge of security, the head of the prison’s social and educational department, and the prison psychologist (section 73(1)). It deliberates at least twice a month (regulation 55(1)).
Section 199(1) provides that life prisoners cannot be placed in the “general regime” and cannot be given awards that cannot be used inside the prison. Section 199(2) provides that persons sentenced to life imprisonment with commutation whose sentence has been commuted by a court to a fixed term of imprisonment, may be transferred from prison to an open penitentiary facility, where they may be placed under the “general regime” or the “light regime” (which is available only in open penitentiary facilities – section 65(3)).
The regime applicable to life prisoners is, in addition, governed by regulations 213220 of the 2009 Act’s implementing regulations. The regulations in respect of prisoners serving a sentence of life imprisonment without commutation are the same as for those serving a sentence of life imprisonment with commutation (regulation 220).
Regulation 213 provides that life prisoners are to be kept in purposebuilt prisons or separate highsecurity units in other prisons. It also provides that life prisoners are to be kept in constantly locked cells under heightened supervision, and can take part in communal activities only with other prisoners of the same category.
Regulation 214 provides that life prisoners have to be kept isolated from other prisoners also during transfers, medical treatment, visits, open air activities or other occasions when they leave their cells.
Regulation 216(1) provides that life prisoners may work in their cells or in purposebuilt workstations, if available. Records have to be kept of their work days (regulation 216(2)).
Regulation 217, which reproduces section 198(2) of the Act (see paragraph 47 above), provides that life prisoners may be placed with the general prison population and take part in common work, training, educational activities, sport, or other activities by decision of the Execution of Sentences Commission on the basis of a personality assessment, provided that they have already been placed under the “severe regime”.
Regulation 218, which reproduces section 198(1) of the Act (see paragraph 47 above), provides that a life prisoner may be placed under a more lenient regime if he or she has shown good behaviour and has served not less than five years of his or her sentence (periods of pretrial detention do not count).
Regulation 219(1), which reproduces section 197(1) of the Act (see paragraph 46 above), provides that, for a period of five years after their sentence has become final, life prisoners may be placed in special units of existing prisons or in a purposebuilt prison, designated by the Minister of Justice. During that period, a special team is in charge of the prisoner (regulation 219(2)). After the expiry of the period, and following an overall assessment of the prisoner, he or she may be placed in another prison and under different conditions (regulation 219(3)).
In 2010 two life prisoners detained in Sofia Prison brought a legal challenge to regulations 213, 214 and 219 of the 2009 Act’s implementing regulations. They argued that they ran counter to the provisions of the Act.
In a judgment of 28 March 2011 (see реш. № 4373 от 28 март 2011 г. по адм. д. № 10758/2010 г., ВАС, І о.) a threemember panel of the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the challenge. It found that the Minister of Justice had failed to follow the proper procedure for issuing the regulations. In particular, he had not published the draft regulations on the Ministry’s website with a view to making them available to the public and obtaining comments, as required under section 26(2) of the Normative Acts Act 1973. This had been a serious omission. The panel went on to find that regulation 213, in as much as it required that life prisoners be kept constantly under lock and key, ran counter to section 197(1) of the 2009 Act (see paragraphs 46 and 50 above). It laid down a requirement that did not flow from the text of the statute, which was impermissible for an implementing regulation; such a regulation could only particularise the manner in which the statute was to be applied. Regulation 213 could not be regarded as based on any other section of the 2009 Act either. The remaining part of regulation 213, as well as regulations 214 and 219 (see paragraphs 50, 51 and 55 above), were not contrary to the provisions of the 2009 Act.
On an appeal by the Minister, in a final judgment of 14 September 2011 (see реш. № 11411 от 14 септември 2011 г. по адм. д. № 6341/2011 г., ВАС, петчл. св) a fivemember panel of the Supreme Administrative Court overturned the threemember panel’s findings. It held that the failure to publish the draft regulations on the Ministry’s website had not amounted to a material breach of the rules of procedure. It went on to state that regulation 213 did not run counter to the provisions of the 2009 Act. It could be regarded as based on section 197(1) read in conjunction with section 71(1) of the Act (see paragraph 44 above). The latter section applied to all prisoners placed under the “special regime” and required that they be kept in separate and constantly locked cells.
Two judges dissented from the fivemember panel’s conclusions, saying that the failure of the Ministry to publish the draft regulations on its website had indeed been a serious omission and had vitiated the procedure for the adoption of the regulations.
As a result of the dismissal of that legal challenge, two claims for damages brought by the same life prisoners under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act (see paragraph 61 below) and based on the suffering allegedly endured as a result of their impoverished regime were rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court as inadmissible (see опр. № 3355 от 7 март 2012 г. по адм. д. № 3154/2012 г., ВАС, петчл. св, and опр. № 5065 от 6 април 2012 г. по адм. д. № 14339/ 2011 г., ВАС, петчл. св). The court held that those claims could only be pursued if the statutory instrument against which they were directed had been set aside in prior proceedings, which was not the case.
Section 1(1) of the 1988 Act provides that the State is liable for damage suffered by individuals or legal persons as a result of unlawful decisions, actions or omissions by civil servants, committed in the course of or in connection with administrative action. If a claim relates to an administrative decision (or statutory instrument, as the case may be), it can be brought only if the decision has been duly set aside; if the claim relates to an unlawful action or omission, or to a decision which is null and void, the unlawfulness may be established by the court hearing the claim (section 1(2) of the 1988 Act, superseded in July 2006 by Article 204 §§ 1, 3 and 4 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2005).
Since 2003 the Bulgarian courts have began awarding compensation under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act to persons claiming to have suffered nonpecuniary damage as a result of poor material conditions of detention (see the domestic cases cited in Hristov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 36794/03, 18 March 2008; Kirilov v. Bulgaria, no. 15158/02, §§ 4348, 22 May 2008; Shishmanov v. Bulgaria, no 37449/02, §§ 5862, 8 January 2009; Titovi v. Bulgaria, no. 3475/03, § 34, 25 June 2009; Simeonov v. Bulgaria, no. 30122/03, §§ 4347, 28 January 2010; Georgiev v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 27241/02, 18 May 2010; Iliev and Others v. , nos. 4473/02 and 34138/04, §§ 11 and 15, 10 February 2011; and Radkov (no. 2), cited above, § 14).
However, in a final judgment of 23 February 2009 (see реш. № 82 от 23 февруари 2009 г. по гр. д. № 6452/2007 г., ВКС, III г. о.) the Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed a claim for damages brought by a life prisoner in relation to the failure of the prison administration to allow him to engage in work, educational and cultural activities and sport together with other inmates. The court held that the “special regime” applicable to life prisoners and the requirement of that regime that they be isolated from the general prison population made such activities impossible. It went on to say that the claimant had been able to engage in individual educational activities.
The general rule in civil proceedings in Bulgaria is that the court fee is payable by the claimant upon submission of the claim (Article 55 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952, superseded on 1 March 2008 by Article 73 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure 2007, and sections 14 of the State Fees Act 1951). The fee in respect of money claims is four per cent of the amount claimed (point 1 of Tariff No. 1 to the State Fees Act, superseded on 1 March 2008 by section 1 of the Tariff of fees collected by the courts under the Code of Civil Procedure). If the claim succeeds in full or in part, the defendant is ordered to reimburse the claimant’s costs, including court fees, in direct proportion to the success of the claim.
Under section 10(2) of the 1988 Act, as originally enacted, in proceedings under the Act, no court fees or costs were payable by the claimant upon submission of the claim. However, if the claim was eventually wholly or partly dismissed, the court was to order the claimant to pay “the court fees and costs due”. The courts construed that provision as meaning that the claimant should pay fees calculated pro rata the part of the claim which had been dismissed. As a result, where a court held that a claim for damages under the Act was wellfounded but excessive as to quantum, it ordered the defendant State authority to pay damages to the claimant and at the same time ordered the claimant to pay court fees to the State budget. Where the claimant indicated too high an amount in the statement of claim, the fee could exceed the sum awarded in damages. As a result, the overall financial award could be in favour of the State despite the finding that the claimant had suffered damage that called for compensation under the Act (see реш. № 1095 от 25 юли 2000 г. по гр. д. № 139/2000 г., ВКС, and реш. № 805 от 1 август 2005 г. по гр. д. № 56/2004 г., ВКС). There was no provision for judicial discretion and considerations of equity played no role in fixing the fees’ amount; those fees were fixed by reference to the sums indicated in the statement of claim, even if in the course of the proceedings the claimant withdrew part of the claim (see тълк. реш. № 3 от 22 април 2004 г. по тълк. гр. д. № 3/2004 г., ВКС, ОСГК, т. 12).
Following this Court’s judgment in the case of Stankov v. Bulgaria (no. 68490/01, 12 July 2007), which found that the statutory scheme outlined above had, on the facts of the case, resulted in a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the Bulgarian Government laid before Parliament a bill for the amendment of the 1988 Act. Parliament enacted the bill on 17 April 2008 and the amending Act came into force on 30 May 2008. Section 10(2) was changed and now deals solely with costs. Court fees are presently governed by a newly added section 9a(1), which provides for a fixed fee, at a level to be set by the Government. Under the tariff of fees collected by the courts under the Code of Civil Procedure, as currently in force, the fee is BGN 10 (EUR 5.11) in respect of firstinstance proceedings, BGN 5 (EUR 2.56) in respect of appellate proceedings, and BGN 5 (EUR 2.56) in respect of cassation proceedings. Unlike the previous scheme, the fee is payable upon submission of the claim (see опр. № 12420 от 4 октомври 2011 г. по адм. д. № 12302/2011 г., ВАС, III о.).
Paragraph 9 of the transitional and concluding provisions of the amending Act provided that the new rule on court fees applied to proceedings which had not been concluded at the time when the new section 9a(1) came into force, and that the fee was to be charged at the close of the proceedings in each instance.
In its caselaw under paragraph 9, the Supreme Court of Cassation in some cases held that the new rule on court fees applied not only in respect of fees charged by the cassation court after the rule had come into effect, but also in respect of fees charged by the lower courts before that, as long as the proceedings as a whole were pending at the time when the rule had come into effect (see реш. № 974 от 7 ноември 2008 г. по гр. д. № 2980/2007 г., ВКС, I г. о.; опр. № 201 от 28 декември 2009 г. по гр. д. № 3270/2008 г., ВКС, I г. о.; and реш. № 54 от 22 февруари 2010 г. по гр. д. № 5217/2007 г., ВКС, I г. о.). In one case the court went as far as to set aside a writ of execution issued in respect of a court fee charged before the new rule had come into force (see опр. № 28 от 10 януари 2012 г. по ч. гр. д. № 700/2011 г., ВКС, IV г. о.).
However, in other cases the Supreme Court of Cassation held that, since it referred to the close of the proceedings “in each instance”, the new rule could not serve as a basis for reducing fees charged by the lower courts before it had come into effect (see реш. № 158 от 15 април 2009 г. по гр. д. № 6217/2007 г., ВКС, I г. о., and реш. № 1410 от 24 април 2009 г. по гр. д. № 4946/2007 г., ВКС, I г. о.). In some cases the court held that the rule did not apply to fees charged by the lower courts before it had come into effect because it did not have retrospective effect (see опр. № 34 от 6 март 2009 г. по гр. д. № 4149/2007 г., ВКС, ІІІ г. о., and опр. № 92 от 26 ноември 2008 г. по гр. д. № 4603/2008 г., ВКС, IV г. о.).
The CPT has visited only  (in 1995, 1999 and 2010) but not the premises of the prison itself (see CPT/Inf (97) 1, CPT/Inf (2002) 1 and CPT/Inf (2012) 9). During its visits to other prisons in Bulgaria, the CPT noted the use of buckets for sanitary needs by prisoners. Characterising that practice as “unacceptable”, it recommended its discontinuation (see CPT/Inf (97) 1, §§ 122 and 125, in relation to Stara Zagora Prison; CPT/Inf (2002) 1, § 103, again in relation to Stara Zagora Prison; CPT/Inf (2004) 21, §§ 79, 82, 84, 87 and 95, in relation to Burgas and Pleven prisons; CPT/Inf (2008) 11, §§ 73, 75, 85 and 90, in relation to Sofia and Sliven prisons; and CPT/Inf (2012) 9, §§ 97, 101, 108, 110, 117 and 120, in relation to Plovdiv and Varna prisons).
In its reports on its 2006, 2008 and 2010 visits to Bulgaria (CPT/Inf (2008) 11, § 102; CPT/Inf (2010) 29, § 78; and CPT/Inf (2012) 9, § 119) the CPT examined the situation of life prisoners in Sofia, Plovdiv, Pleven and Varna prisons, and expressed concern about the statutory and regulatory provisions requiring those prisoners to be systematically segregated from the general prison population for an initial period of five years (see paragraph 41 above). It recommended a review of those provisions to ensure that the segregation of life prisoners was based on an individual risk assessment and was not applied for longer than was strictly necessary. In relation to Pleven Prison, the CPT noted the following, in CPT/Inf (2008) 11, § 99:
“Since 2004, Pleven Prison had embarked on an ‘experiment’ of integrating certain lifesentenced prisoners into the general prison population. At the time of the 2006 visit, three such prisoners were being accommodated in a unit for prisoners serving sentences under strict regime (and one more was expected to be moved there soon). They were held in a cell measuring some 22 [square metres] with three other prisoners. Conditions in the cell were generally adequate (large windows, various items of furniture, elements of personalisation). One of the prisoners had a job as a cleaner and the other two occasionally made gift bags in the cell. The cell doors were open throughout the day and lifesentenced prisoners enjoyed the same rights as the remainder of prisoners under strict regime. It appeared from conversations with other prisoners and staff that the arrival of the lifesentenced prisoners in the unit had not caused any particular dissatisfaction or problems.”
