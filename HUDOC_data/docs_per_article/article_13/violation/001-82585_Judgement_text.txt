The case originated in an application (no. 41513/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Serbian nationals, Mr Miroslav Mikuljanac, Mrs Vesna Mališić and Mr Željko Šafar (“the applicants”), on 4 November 2005.
The applicants were represented by The Committee of Lawyers for Human Rights - Yucom, a non-governmental organisation with its seat in Beograd. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 28 August 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicants were born in 1963, 1958 and 1966, respectively, and live in Beograd.
On 23 May 2001 the applicants were dismissed from their work.
On 6 June 2001 they instituted civil proceedings in the Beograd Third Municipal Court against their former employer, seeking reinstatement and salary arrears.
Sometime after the respondent State's ratification of the Convention on 3 March 2004, the applicants' case was assigned to another judge.
The next hearing in the case was held on 26 October 2004, when the court decided to hear several witnesses.
The hearing scheduled for 23 December 2004 was adjourned by the judge. Subsequently, the case was yet again assigned to another judge and the next hearing was scheduled for 9 September 2005, but did not take place because the witnesses had not been duly summoned.
The next hearing, scheduled for 23 November 2005, was adjourned because the summoned witnesses failed to appear.
On 24 February 2006 the court held a hearing and heard the applicants and a witness. The applicants requested the court to obtain an additional expert opinion concerning the amount of their salary arrears. The court held two more hearings – on 31 March and 15 May 2006.
On 18 May 2006 the court ordered the applicants to advance the costs of the proposed expert opinion and to suggest an expert. The applicants did so on 1 June. At the next hearing held on 16 June 2006, the court ordered that the expert opinion be obtained. The appointed expert submitted the opinion on 5 October 2006.
The court held further hearings on 13 October and 15 November 2006. The respondent then filed a request for a transfer of jurisdiction, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 6 December 2006.
The court held further hearings on 2 and 16 February and on 16 March 2007. On the last mentioned date the court gave judgment, accepting the applicants' claim. The applicants appealed against the decision on costs and the proceedings are currently pending before the second-instance court.

Article 122 § 3 provided that all employment-related disputes were to be resolved by the courts within a period of 6 months from the date of institution of the proceedings.

This Constitution was repealed on 8 November 2006, which is when the “new” Constitution (published in OG RS no. 98/06) entered into force.
