The municipal unitary enterprise Sysolskoye proizvodstvennoye obyedineniye “Zhilkomkhoz” (МУП Сысольское производственное объединение «Жилкомхоз», hereinafter “the company”) was set up by a decision of the administration of the Sysolskiy District. It provided maintenance services in respect of municipal housing, including heating and water supply, maintenance of the sewage systems and renovation and maintenance of the municipal housing stock.
