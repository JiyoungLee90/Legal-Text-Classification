The case originated in an application (no. 66142/01) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovakian national, Mr Jozef Číž (“the applicant”), on 18 January 2001.
The Slovakian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Vršanský, succeeded by Mr P. Kresák as from 1 April 2003.
On 18 June 2002 the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Žiar nad Hronom. At the relevant time he was a police investigator. On 29 October 1996 a private TV company broadcast a statement by a Member of Parliament in which the applicant was accused of covering up crime.
On 29 November 1996 the applicant sued the Member of Parliament before the Žiar nad Hronom District Court. He claimed that the above statement was defamatory and sought protection of his reputation. On 3 December 1996 the applicant was requested to pay the court fees. On the same day the defendant was asked to submit his observations.
On 11 December 1996 the case file was transferred to the Banská Bystrica Regional Court as the District Court judges considered themselves biased. On 30 December 1996 the Regional Court excluded two District Court judges from dealing with the case. The decision was transmitted to the District Court on 7 February 1997. On 7 March 1997 the President of the Žiar nad Hronom District Court returned the case file to the Regional Court with a more detailed explanation as to why all District Court judges considered themselves biased. The Regional Court was requested to transfer the case to another court.
On 30 April 1997 the Regional Court excluded the Žiar nad Hronom District Court judges and transferred the case to the District Court in Veľký Krtíš. The case file was transferred to the latter court on 2 June 1997.
On 12 June 1997 the District Court in Veľký Krtíš discontinued the proceedings on the ground that the applicant had failed to pay the court fees. On 30 June 1997 the applicant appealed. On 3 July 1997 the District Court quashed the decision as the applicant had paid the fees in the meantime.

On 4 May 2000 the applicant explained that he had not requested that the case be transferred to a different court for reasons of convenience. He argued that the case fell outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Bratislava I District Court and that the determination of that issue was not subject to payment of court fees and fell within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
On 12 July 2000 the vice-president of the Bratislava I District Court admitted, in reply to the applicant’s complaint, that there had been delays in the proceedings in the course of 1999. The letter further stated that the applicant had contributed to the overall length of the proceedings in that he had failed to co-operate with the court.

Article 48 (2) of the Constitution provides, inter alia, that every person has the right to have his or her case tried without unjustified delay.
Pursuant to Article 130 (3) of the Constitution, as in force until 30 June 2001, the Constitutional Court could commence proceedings upon the petition (podnet) presented by any individual or corporation claiming that their rights have been violated.
According to its case-law under the former Article 130 (3) of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court lacked jurisdiction to draw legal consequences from a violation of a petitioner’s rights under Article 48 (2) of the Constitution. It could neither grant damages to the person concerned nor impose a sanction on the public authority liable for the violation found. In the Constitutional Court’s view, it was therefore for the authority concerned to provide redress to the person whose rights were violated.
The right to protection of a person’s dignity, honour, reputation and good name is guaranteed by Article 11 et seq. of the Civil Code.
Article 200i (4) of the Code of Civil Procedure, as in force at the relevant time, provided that courts were under the obligation to decide on claims for protection of one’s reputation within one year after the introduction of the action.
The above provision was quashed with effect from 1 January 2003 following the Constitutional Court’s finding of 7 November 2002 declaring it contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
