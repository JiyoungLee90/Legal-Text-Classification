.  The cell was not equipped with a washstand. Instead, the inmates had to use the water running from a tap over the toilet.
.  The dining table was situated a metre away from the toilet. It could seat about ten inmates. The rest of the inmates had to eat sitting on the concrete floor.
.  The food was of low quality. The drinking-water tanks were placed on the floor.

.  The applicant was transported from the remand prison to the courthouse and back more than a hundred times between 2001 and 2008. Prisoners were transported between the remand prison and the courthouse in a prison van – a metal freight vehicle comprising three compartments: two designed for twenty inmates and the third one for single occupancy. The van had no windows and offered no access to natural light or air. It had no artificial lighting or ventilation either. There were no seat belts or other safety equipment to prevent inmates from falling and hitting themselves against the walls. It was stiflingly hot in the van in the summer and freezing cold in the winter.
.  There were four cells in the holding area of the District Court where the applicant was taken. Each cell measured about three square metres and accommodated five to six inmates. The cells were equipped with one bench each, which could seat only three inmates. Those suffering from hepatitis, tuberculosis, HIV and other diseases were placed together with the rest of the inmates. On each occasion the applicant spent as long as seven or eight hours in such conditions.
