The case originated in two applications (nos. 1805/03 and 6717/03) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Ukrainian nationals, Mr Mykola Yegorovych Ryzhenkov (no. 1805/03), the first applicant, and Mr Ivan Mykolayovych Zaytsev, the second applicant (no. 6717/03), (“the applicants”), on 21 November 2002 and 23 January 2003, respectively.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms Valeria Lutkovska, succeeded by Ms Zoryana Bortnovska.
On 24 October 2003 the Court decided to communicate the applications to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to join the applications and to examine their merits at the same time as their admissibility.
The first applicant was born in 1959. The second applicant was born in 1947. They both reside in Kharkiv.
On 4 October 2000 the Moskovsky District Court of Kharkiv ordered the Kharkiv enterprise “Serp i Molot”, which is an enterprise in which the State owns 90% of the shares (hereafter referred to as the “KESM”), to pay the first applicant UAH 23,963.78 for salary arrears, and compensation for the delay in that payment (for the period between March 1998 and 1 August 2000) and moral damage.
On 16 October 2000 the Moskovsky District Bailiffs’ Service initiated the enforcement proceedings.
On 5 November 2002 the Commercial Court of the Kharkiv Region initiated bankruptcy proceedings against the KESM and, therefore, the Bailiffs’ Service suspended the execution of the judgment.

On 7 March 2003 the Kharkiv Regional Department of Justice informed the applicant that the enforcement was still pending because of these bankruptcy proceedings.

On 8 November 2004 the applicant informed the Court that he had received payment for the remainder of the debt (UAH 16,434.73) on 6 October 2004. The enforcement proceedings were terminated on the same date. The payment was made on the basis of funds transferred to the account of the KESM, as approved by the Head of the Kharkiv Regional Administration on 10 March 2004.
