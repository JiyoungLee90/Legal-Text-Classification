The case originated in an application (no. 6987/07) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Ms Lyubov Viktorovna Guseva (“the applicant”), on 18 January 2007.
The applicant was represented by Mr N. Runevski, a lawyer practising in Sofia. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Liliana Gyurova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged in particular that the failure of the mayor of Vidin to enforce three final administrative court judgments ordering him to provide public information to her breached her right to freedom of expression, given in particular that she had sought the information in order to contribute to public debate in the field of animal protection.
On 19 February 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
Ms Zdravka Kalaydjieva, the judge elected in respect of Bulgaria, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Ms Pavlina Panova to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 26 § 4 of the Convention and Rule 29).
The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Vidin. She is a member of the Board of Directors of the Animal Protection Society in Vidin. On 16 September 2002 she was authorised to represent the organisation before any and all institutions in Bulgaria in relation to its activities.
On 11 April 2002 the applicant asked the mayor of Vidin for access to information about an agreement, concluded between the municipality and the municipal company “Cleanliness” EOOD, for the collecting of stray animals on the territory of Vidin municipality.
The mayor sought the explicit consent to that effect of the head of “Cleanliness” EOOD, considering that that was a statutory condition under section 31 (2) of the Access to Public Information Act 2000. The head of “Cleanliness” EOOD refused to give consent on 28 May 2002. The mayor issued a decision on 4 June 2002 in which he refused to provide the applicant with access to the information she sought. The mayor referred to section 37 (1) (2) of the Access to Public Information Act 2000, which at the time listed the absence of a third interested party’s explicit written consent for the provision of information among the grounds for refusal to grant access to information.
The applicant brought court proceedings against the decision of the mayor refusing access to the information. The Vidin Regional Court allowed the applicant’s claim on 27 June 2003, finding that the information sought did not affect the rights of “Cleanliness” EOOD and therefore section 37 (1) (2) was not applicable. The court accordingly ordered the mayor to provide the information to the applicant.
Following a cassation appeal by the mayor, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court’s judgment on 25 May 2004. It held that the information was of high public interest, the rights of third parties were not affected and the mayor’s decision denying access to information to the applicant was not reasoned.
On 20 January 2003 the applicant again asked the mayor of Vidin for information. This time the information she sought concerned the annual statistics for 2001 and 2002 about animals held in an animal shelter called “Municipal Care”. In particular she asked how many animals were placed there, how many of them died or were put to death, and how much their care had cost the municipal budget.
The mayor sought the explicit consent to that effect of the head of the public utilities company concerned, “Titan Sever” OOD, considering once again that that was a statutory condition under section 31 (2) of the Access to Public Information Act 2000. In a letter of 10 February 2003 the head of “Titan Sever” OOD refused to give consent. On 14 February 2003 the mayor refused to provide the applicant with access to the information, referring to section 37 (1) (2) of the Access to Public Information Act 2000.
The applicant brought court proceedings against the decision of the mayor refusing access to the information. The Vidin Regional Court allowed the applicant’s claim on 27 June 2003. It found that, if third parties objected to the provision of information concerning them, section 31 (4) of the Access to Public Information Act 2000 obliged the mayor to grant access to that information in a manner not disclosing the parts related to the third party. It then sent the case back to the municipality ordering it to provide the information to the applicant.
Following a cassation appeal by the mayor, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court’s judgment on 25 May 2004. It held that the information was of high public interest, the rights of third parties were not concerned and that, even if they were, the information could be provided without disclosing the parts concerning the third parties. Finally, that court found that the mayor’s decision denying access to information to the applicant was not reasoned.
On 17 June 2003 the applicant once again asked the mayor for information. The information concerned a public procurement procedure which had been organised by the mayor and aimed at reducing the number of stray dogs in Vidin. The applicant wanted to know the number of the organisations which had tendered for a contract with the municipality, which ones had passed the pre-selection stage, and - in respect of those who have - the following information: the type and number of qualified staff they employed; the infrastructure and facilities they had for humane catching and transportation of dogs; the proof they had presented for their capacity to deliver quality services; and, the price they asked for providing the services.
On 1 July 2003 the mayor refused to provide that information in a reasoned decision. The explanation he gave was that the information requested concerned solely the participating candidates in that procurement procedure and their bids in accordance with the Public Procurement Act 2004; that it was of an economic nature; that it was related to the preparation of the mayor’s administrative actions in relation to the procurement procedure; and, that it had no significance of its own.
The applicant brought court proceedings against the decision of the mayor refusing access to the information. On 10 December 2003 the Vidin Regional Court allowed the applicant’s claim and overturned the mayor’s refusal to provide the information sought. The court found that the information in question had not been classified, that the mayor’s decision was not issued within the statutory time-limit and that its content was not in conformity with the requirements of section 38 of the Access to Public Information Act 2000. The court sent the case back to the mayor, specifically ordering him to provide information to the applicant about the organisation which had won the municipal contract at the end of the public procurement procedure and the conditions of that contract.
Following a cassation appeal by the mayor, on 20 October 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court partly upheld the lower court’s judgment. It quashed the judgment’s part which ordered the mayor to provide the applicant with information about the organisation which had won the municipal contract and the conditions of that contract. It held that the mayor had to provide the rest of the requested information.
On 10 June 2004, referring to the two decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court of 25 May 2004 which concluded the proceedings in her first two requests for information, the applicant asked the mayor of Vidin to provide her with the information requested.
On 10 December 2004, referring to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court of 20 October 2004 which concluded the proceedings in her third request for information, the applicant asked the mayor to provide her with the information requested.
On 27 December 2004, the mayor refused in a written decision to provide the information sought by the applicant following the Supreme Administrative Court’s judgment of 20 October 2004. In particular, he repeated the findings of the Supreme Administrative Court that he was not expected to provide information about the company which had won the municipal contract and remained silent in respect of the rest of the information he had been ordered to provide. It would appear that the mayor did not react to the applicant’s request for information following the two Supreme Administrative Court’s judgments of 25 May 2004.
In a letter of 15 September 2010, the applicant informed the Court that there were no further developments and the information she sought had not been provided to her.
Access to public information was regulated at the time in the Access to Public Information Act 2000, which is also currently in force. That Act defines “public information” as any information related to public life in Bulgaria and allowing people to form a personal opinion about the acts of State or municipal bodies. Every Bulgarian citizen has the right of access to public information under the conditions and procedure of this Act, unless a lex specialis provides for a special procedure for the seeking, receiving and disseminating of such information.
Enforcement of administrative court judgments was regulated at the time by the Administrative Procedure Act 1979, as in force until July 2006, and – as regards judgments of the Supreme Administrative Court – by the Supreme Administrative Court Act 1997 (the Act 1997), as in force until 1 March 2007. The latter’s section 30 provided that the decisions of that court had an obligatory force vis-à-vis the parties. Its section 32 provided that a decision of that court was subject to an immediate enforcement by the administrative body concerned. Its Chapter IV contained administrativepenal provisions which envisaged the imposition of a pecuniary sanction of between 100 Bulgarian leva (BGN) and BGN 500 in cases in which administrative bodies did not enforce the court’s decisions.
Insofar as time-limits are concerned, it is to be noted that the Supreme Administrative Court held in a decision of 2001 (see decision no. 2572 of 17 April 2001, case no. 4047/2000) that the applicable legislation at the time (Administrative Procedure Act 1979 and the Act 1997) did not provide for time-limits within which the administrative body had to comply with judicial decisions. The decision as to when the judgment should be enforced was entirely in the hands of the administrative body concerned. The only procedure for the enforcement of administrative court decisions was an administrative pecuniary sanction (in accordance with section 53 and following of the Administrative Procedure Act 1979, and section 51 and following of the Act 1997). The party seeking enforcement did not need to appeal against a tacit or explicit refusal to enforce a judgment, but instead had to bring a separate complaint before the courts asking for the imposition of a pecuniary sanction on the administrative body which had not complied with the court’s judgment.
The Code of Administrative Procedure 2006 (the Code), which is currently in force, was adopted in 2006 and, with effect as from 1 March 2007, it repealed the Act 1997. Article 290 of the Code regulates the enforcement of administrative court judgments vis-à-vis an administrative official obliged in a court judgment to deliver a non-substitutable action. If the responsible official fails to act, the bailiff imposes on him or her weekly pecuniary sanctions (изпълнителна глоба), in the amount of between BGN 50 and BGN 1200, for so long as the act remains uncompleted. The bailiff’s decisions, actions or failure to act can be challenged before the administrative court (Article 294 of the Code). If the administrative court quashes a bailiff’s decision or action, or declares unlawful his or her failure to act, the court either decides the matter itself or orders the bailiff to act within a deadline it determines for it.
Article 304 of the Code provides that, in cases which do not concern enforcement of administrative or judicial decisions under Chapter V of the Code and where a responsible official does not comply with a final judgment, the official could be fined with between BGN 200 and BGN 2000. In case of a repeated failure to act, the official could be fined with BGN 500 for every week of non-enforcement, unless his or her inaction is objectively impossible. The fine is imposed by the president of the administrative court and is subject to appeal before a three-member bench of the same court (Article 306).
In two decisions taken in 2008 and 2013 respectively (see реш. № 8487 от 9 юли 2008 г. на ВАС, І отделение; реш. № 83 от 23 май 2013 г. на Адм. Съд Кюстендил), the domestic courts fined the Minister for Internal Affairs in the first case and the mayor in the second case for having failed to act in order to comply with final judgments which had ordered the Minister to reply to the complainant’s request for access to public information and to the mayor to grant such access. Both decisions were taken in application of Article 304 of the Code. No information is available if these fines led to the Minister’s or mayor’s complying with their obligation to enforce the judgments.
Section 1(1) of the State and Municipality Responsibility for Damage Act 1988 (SMRDA) provides, as of July 2006, that the municipalities, and not only the State as was the case until then, are liable for damage caused to private individuals and legal entities as a result of unlawful decisions, acts or omissions by their own authorities or officials while discharging their administrative duties. Section 4 of the SMRDA provides that compensation is due for all damage which is the direct and proximate result of the unlawful act or omission. The State’s liability is strict, i.e. no fault is required on the part of the civil servants in the commission of the unlawful acts. A claim for damages could be made after the administrative act in question had been quashed in prior proceedings. The lawfulness of administrative actions of failure to act is established by the court in the context of the proceedings for damages (Article 204 (4) of the Code). Persons seeking redress for damage occasioned in circumstances falling within the scope of SMRDA have no claim under the general law of tort, as the SMRDA is a lex specialis and excludes the application of the general regime (реш. № 1370/1992 г. от 16 декември 1992 г. по гр.д. № 1181/1992 г. на ВС, ІV г.о.; реш. от 29 юли 2002 г. по гр.д. № 169/2002 г. на СГС, ГК, ІVб отд.).
The domestic courts have sometimes accepted that public authorities could be responsible for damages under section 1 of SMRDA in cases where they delay or fail to enforce a final judgment (see реш. № 7088 от 31.05.2010 г. по а. д. № 12358/2009, ВАС, confirming реш. № 1075 от 10.11.2008 г. по а. д. № 6339/2007, адм. съд София; see also реш. от 27.04.2009 г. по гр. д. № 71/2009, ОС Разград, in respect of situations where an administrative body had to comply with a final judgment ordering it to open privatisation proceedings). However, in other cases the courts awarded damages not as a result of the lack of enforcement of the judgment, but because of the initial quashing of the unlawful administrative act by the court (see реш. № 8204 от 09.06.2011 г. на ВАС; реш. № 2 от 16.07.2010 на адм. съд Габрово; реш. № 782 от 20.12.2008 на адм. съд София област; реш. № 1365 от 10.05.2010 на адм. съд София град; реш. № 4529 от 30.03.2011 на ВАС, in respect of situations where medical commissions’ decisions were quashed as unlawful). Yet, in a number of other cases the courts rejected such claims, finding that the responsibility of the authorities could not be engaged. The reasons were either that the applicants had omitted to use the enforcement procedure under Articles 290 and 294 of the Code (see реш. № 4730 от 15.08.2012 г. по а. д. № 9471/2010, адм. съд София) or because the authorities were only responsible for damages stemming from their actions or failure to act but not from their tacit refusal to issue an administrative act (see реш. № 1706 от 3.02.2011 г. по а. д. № 9953/2010, ВАC; опр. № 7877 oт 7.06.2013 г. по а. д. 7001/2013, ВАС), or ─ further still ─ because no damage could be established as a result of the refusal to provide information (see реш. № 7425 от 30.05.2011 г. на ВАС).
