The case originated in an application (no. 2722/10) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Ms Dudu Gamze Özdemir Gürcan (“the applicant”), on 30 December 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Erdoğdu, a lawyer practising in Mersin. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 26 April 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Mersin.
The applicant is a teacher in primary school and at the material time she was a member and secretary of the local branch of the trade union of Education and Science Workers (Eğitim ve Bilim Emekçileri Sendikası).
On 28 November 2008 the applicant participated in a demonstration organised by the above mentioned trade union on the theme “No to violence against women”.
On 29 June 2009 the District Directorate of National Education imposed a disciplinary sanction in the form of a reprimand on the applicant for her participation in the aforementioned demonstration under Article 125 of the Law no. 657 on Civil Servants.
On 10 July 2009 the applicant objected to this decision and requested its annulment.
On 29 July 2009 the Disciplinary Board of the Yenişehir district governor dismissed the applicant’s objection considering that the contested decision was in accordance with law and there were no grounds for its annulment.
