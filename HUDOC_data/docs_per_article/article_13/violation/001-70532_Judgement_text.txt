The case originated in an application (no. 4773/02) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Viktor Grigoryevich Sychev (“the applicant”), on 12 March 2001.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Valeria Lutkovska.
On 7 September 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the non-execution of the judgments given in favour of the applicant and the lack of effective remedies in this respect to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in , the Donetsk Region.
On 14 September 1999 the Tsentralny District Court of Gorlovka awarded the applicant UAH 10,798.45 (approximately EUR 1,800) against the Lenina coal-mine (a State-owned entity, hereafter “the LCM”) for arrears in industrial disablement benefits. The judgment became effective and was sent for execution to the Gorlovka City Bailiffs’ Service (hereafter “the Bailiffs’ Service”). On 5 October 1999 the Bailiffs’ Service instituted enforcement proceedings in the applicant’s case.
On 31 October 2000 the Tsentralny District Court of Gorlovka, referring to the decision of the Donetsk Regional Court of Arbitration (hereafter “the Court of Arbitration”) of 21 December 1998, whereby the LCM was declared bankrupt, ordered the Bailiffs’ Service to transfer the writ of execution to the LCM’s liquidation commission. According to the aforementioned decision of the Court of Arbitration the liquidation commission in issue was to be comprised of representatives of the LCM’s main creditors, including the State Pension Fund, the State Property Fund, the State Tax Administration and several State owned companies.
On 17 November 2000 the applicant was informed by the Donetsk Regional Department of Justice that it was impossible to transfer the writ of execution to the liquidation commission as no such commission had in fact been created.
On 26 January 2001 the Court of Arbitration’s judge, at the applicant’s request, informed him that the commission had not produced the liquidation balance, as it was supposed to do under the bankruptcy law. The court, however, indicated that the national legislation envisaged no time-limit for that, neither did it provide any sanctions for the commission’s inactivity.
On 8 February 2001 the Court of Arbitration ordered the liquidation commission to produce the abovementioned balance.
On 26 February 2001 the meeting of the LCM’s creditors acknowledged that no liquidation commission had been established.
On 20 March 2001 the Court of Arbitration, at the request of the Ordena Zhovtnevoy Revolutsiyy State Company, suspended the bankruptcy proceedings pending the supervisory review of its decision of 21 December 1998.
On 27 March 2001 the applicant’s writ of execution was sent to the newly created liquidation commission.
On 2 July 2001 the supervisory court quashed the decision of 21 December 1998 and remitted the case for fresh consideration.
On 29 August 2001 the  (a former Donetsk Regional Court of Arbitration) extended the term of office of the liquidation commission and, following its proposal appointed a new trustee to run the bankruptcy programme. However, the writs of execution issued against the LCM were returned to the Bailiffs’ Service without enforcement.
The Bailiffs’ Service recommenced the enforcement proceedings in the applicant’s case. On numerous occasions in 2001 and 2002 they attached the assets belonging to the LCM. In 2002 the applicant was paid a total of 7,533.55 (approximately EUR 1,245) in several instalments.
On 28 December 2002 the Ministry of Fuel and Energy ordered that several coal-mines, including the LCM, merge into the Artemvugillia State Company. Accordingly, the Bailiffs’ Service undertook to replace the debtor in the applicant’s enforcement case. The proceedings resumed in 20 May 2003 when the Bailiffs’ Service levied on the Artemvugillia’s bank accounts.
On 29 November 2004 the Bailiffs’ Service terminated the enforcement proceedings as the judgment in the applicant’s favour had been enforced in full. In his letter of 28 January 2005 the applicant alleged that that was not the case since the LCM still owed him UAH 927 (approximately EUR 155).
Under Article 22 of the Law (Закон України “Про відновлення платоспроможності боржника або визнання його банкрутом”), the decision to commence the liquidation proceedings is taken by the .
According to Article 24 of the Law the  appoints a trustee to run the liquidation programme and members of the liquidation commission. The  also considers the complaints about the actions and omissions of the trustee and the liquidation commission and performs other duties, conferred upon it by virtue of this Law.
Article 25 of the Law provides that the trustee controls the bankrupt’s property, chairs the liquidation commission and directs the liquidation programme.
Under Article 32 of the Law, after having completed the liquidation programme, the trustee produces to the Commercial Court the account of his administration of the bankrupt’s property and the liquidation balance.
