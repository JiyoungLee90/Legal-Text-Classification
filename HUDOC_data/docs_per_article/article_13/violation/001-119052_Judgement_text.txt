On 18 December 2006 the applicant asked the court to resume the proceedings. The court did so and scheduled the next hearing for 10 January 2007.
On 23 December 2006 the applicant asked for transfer of jurisdiction from the Gospić Municipal Court to the Zagreb Municipal Court but her request was eventually dismissed. That decision was served on her on 22 February 2007.

Following an appeal by the applicant, on 27 May 2008 the  (Županijski sud u Gospiću) reversed the first-instance decision and allowed the applicant’s request to restore the proceedings to their previous position.
