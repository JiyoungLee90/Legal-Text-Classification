The case originated in applications against Russia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on the various dates indicated in the appended table.
The applications were communicated to the Russian Government (“the Government”). The Government objected to the examination of the applications by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The list of applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table.
The applicants complained of the inadequate conditions of their detention, which were incompatible with their disabilities, and of the lack of an effective remedy in that regard. Some applicants also raised other complaints under the provisions of the Convention.
