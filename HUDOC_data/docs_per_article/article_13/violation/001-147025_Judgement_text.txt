The case originated in an application (no. 40160/04) against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by twenty two Macedonian nationals (“the applicants”), on 29 September 2004.
The applicants were represented by Mr T. Torov, a lawyer practising in Štip. The Macedonian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Mrs R. Lazareska Gerovska, and subsequently by their present Agent, Mr K. Bogdanov.
On 17 May 2011 the application was communicated to the respondent Government.
The applicants’ personal details are listed in the appendix below.
On 16 March 1982 five people (“the predecessors”), the ninth and the twenty-second applicants initiated civil proceedings for determination of title to plots of land.
Between 1984 and 2001 the predecessors died. The first, second, third and fourth applicants stepped in the proceedings on behalf of their late predecessor. The fifth to eighth and the tenth to twenty-first applicants did not step in the proceedings on behalf of their late predecessors.
On 12 May 2004 the ninth applicant died.
On 23 April 2005 the twenty-second applicant died and his heirs, Mr Stojan Kostov and Mr Mite Kostov, applied to continue the application in his name.
On 17 April 2009 the fourth applicant died and her heirs, the second and third applicants, applied to continue the application also in her name.
The impugned proceedings, which were reconsidered on one occasion, ended on 31 August 2007 when the final decision of the Štip Court of Appeal was served on the applicants. This decision listed the following as plaintiffs: the first, second, third, fourth, ninth and twenty-second applicants as well as the predecessors of the remaining applicants.
