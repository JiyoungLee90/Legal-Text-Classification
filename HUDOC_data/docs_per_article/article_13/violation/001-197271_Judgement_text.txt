The case originated in an application (no. 26007/17) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Myroslava Zabara (“the applicant”), on 29 March 2017.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna.
On 22 May 2018 the Government were given notice of the application.
The applicant was born in 1988 and lives in Kozelne, Sumy Region.
On 13 September 2008 the applicant married I. The couple lived at I.’s residence in the village of Murafa, Kharkiv Region.
In 2009 and 2010 the applicant gave birth to two girls.
Relations between the applicant and I. deteriorated and in 2012 they decided to separate. In July 2012 the applicant moved to live with her parents in another village. I. prevented the applicant from taking the children with her.
In October 2012 I. initiated court proceedings for divorce, requesting that the court rule that the children should live with him. The applicant lodged a counterclaim, arguing that the children should live with her.
On 19 February 2013, the Krasnokutskyy District Court of the Kharkiv Region (“the first-instance court”), allowed I.’s request and ordered a forensic psychiatric examination of the applicant. The experts produced their report on 1 April 2013.
On 23 May 2013 the first-instance court dissolved the marriage and determined that the children should live with I. Following an appeal by the applicant, on 17 September 2013 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. Following an appeal on points of law by the applicant, on 15 January 2014 the Higher Specialised Court on Civil and Criminal Matters quashed those decisions in so far as they concerned the determination of the children’s place of residence and remitted the case to the first-instance court for fresh consideration of that issue in view of the fact that the case file contained contradictory evidence.
On 24 March 2014 the first-instance court ordered, at the applicant’s request, a second forensic psychiatric examination of her. The experts produced their report on 26 November 2014.
On 29 March 2016 the first-instance court ordered, at I.’s request, a further forensic psychological examination of the applicant. The experts produced their report on 23 December 2016.
On 31 January 2017 the first-instance court ruled that the children should live with I. The applicant appealed. On 22 June 2017 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. On 19 June 2018 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law and upheld the decisions of the lower courts.
