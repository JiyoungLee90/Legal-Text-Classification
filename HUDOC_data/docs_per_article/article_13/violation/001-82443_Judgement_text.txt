The case originated in an application (no. 38106/02) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mrs Todorka Petrova Nalbantova (“the applicant”) who was born in 1950 and lives in , on 3 October 2002.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Neikov and Mr Z. Zahariev, lawyers practising in .
The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Kotzeva, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 14 December 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
In 1991 part of the production facilities of the cooperative “Maritza” were spun off and the cooperative “Rodina” (“the cooperative”) was established. The applicant was appointed to be its executive officer.
On unspecified dates, a tax audit was performed of the activities of the cooperative for the period from June 1991 to June 1992, which established that certain funds were missing.
On 15 February 1993 a preliminary investigation was opened against the applicant for embezzlement and failure to exercise supervision over the activities of subordinates responsible for managing and accounting of funds, which resulted in the cooperative suffering losses in the amount of 14,587 old Bulgarian levs (approximately 918 German marks on that date).
On 16 January, 9 April and 8 August 1994 the Plovdiv District Prosecutor's Office sent reminders to the investigator in charge of the case to conclude the investigation as quickly as possible because the period for its completion had long since expired.
On 21 May 1997 the Plovdiv Regional Prosecutor's Office requested the case file from the investigator, which it obtained on an unspecified date. It established that, in spite of the express instructions to that effect, absolutely no investigative procedures had been conducted in the case. The Plovdiv Regional Prosecutor's Office remitted the case on 1 July 1997.
Five witnesses were questioned on 22 and 23 February 2000.
On 2 March 2000 the applicant was questioned and charged with embezzlement and failure to exercise supervision over the activities of subordinates responsible for managing and accounting of funds, which resulted in the cooperative suffering losses in the amount of 14,587 old Bulgarian levs (approximately 7 euros on that date). A restriction was also imposed on her not to leave her place of residence without the authorisation of the Prosecutor's Office.
Another ten witnesses were questioned between 6 March and 16 April 2000, an accounting expert's report was commissioned on 22 May 2000 and the applicant was further questioned on 20 and 26 June 2000.
The case file was then forwarded to the Plovdiv Regional Prosecutor's Office, which on 3 November 2000 remitted the case with instructions for further investigative procedures to be conducted.
Another witness was questioned on 12 December 2000 and a supplementary accounting expert's report was commissioned on the 27th.
On 12 April 2001 the charges against the applicant were amended and she was again questioned.
On 19 February 2002 the Plovdiv District Prosecutor's Office requested the case file from the investigator, which it obtained on an unspecified date
On 27 March 2002 the Plovdiv Regional Prosecutor's Office again remitted the case with further instructions for concluding the investigation.
On 16 April 2002 the cooperative joined the criminal proceedings against the applicant as a civil claimant.
The findings of the investigation were presented to the applicant on 29 April 2002, which were then forwarded to the Plovdiv Regional Prosecutor's Office on an unspecified date.
In a decision of 11 May 2002 the Plovdiv Regional Prosecutor's Office terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicant due to lack of sufficient evidence of an offence.
The relevant part of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988 (the “SMRDA” : title changed in 2006) provided that the State was liable for damage caused to private persons by the organs of the investigation, the prosecution and the courts for, inter alia, having unlawfully charged a private person with an offence if the initiated criminal proceedings were terminated because the deed was not perpetrated by the said person or the perpetrated deed was not an offence (section 2 (2)).
Persons seeking redress for damage occasioned by decisions of the investigating and prosecuting authorities or the courts in circumstances falling within the scope of the SMRDA have no claim under general tort law as the Act is a lex specialis and excludes the application of the general regime (section 8 (1) of the Act; решение № 1370 от 16.XII.1992 г. по гр.д. № 1181/92 г., IV г.о. and Тълкувателно решение № 3 от 22.04.2005 г. по т. гр. д. № 3/2004 г., ОСГК на ВКС).
