PROCEDURE
“Yesterday Mr Büyükşahin, the deputy secretary-general of the HADEP (the People’s Democracy Party), drew attention to the illegal pressure and threats directed at the HADEP and stated that the authorities have still not provided an explanation as to the whereabouts of Serdar Tanış and Ebubekir Deniz, who have disappeared in Silopi. He went on to state that such threats and abductions had been carried out in BingölKarlıova and Şırnak-Cizre. Various people, identifying themselves as members of the security forces, had raided houses in Karlıova and detained Mustafa Boylu, Mehmet Özen, Remzi Genç and Selahattin Oge. Büyükşahin added that, subsequent to his detention, Selahattin Oge had been found lying in a coma next to a school. Following applications made to the prosecutors by the detainees’ relatives, the authorities had acknowledged these detentions. He further said that Mehmet Dilsiz, chairman of the HADEP’s Cizre branch, had been threatened, arrested and detained by the Gendarmerie Command on the basis of fake documents and without any evidence. Mr Büyükşahin stressed that the life of Mehmet Dilsiz, who had been threatened by the Şırnak Gendarme Brigade Colonel L.E, was in danger. Mr Büyükşahin speculated as to whether those who were currently threatening Mehmet Dilsiz were the same persons as those who had caused  and Deniz to disappear. Alleging that the commander was threatening Mehmet Dilsiz, just as he had previously threatened , he asked what L.E.’s role had been in the disappearances of the HADEP’s Silopi members. Mr Büyükşahin condemned these incidents and called on the authorities to take up the victim’s cause and reveal the truth.”
