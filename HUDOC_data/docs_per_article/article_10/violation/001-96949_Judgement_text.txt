The case originated in seven applications (nos. 55036/07, 55564/07, 1228/08, 1478/08, 4086/08, 6302/08 and 7200/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by nineteen Turkish nationals (“the applicants”), whose names appear in the appendix.
The applicants were represented by Mr Ö. Kılıç, a lawyer practising in . The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 6, 11 and 27 December 2007 and 18 , 25 and 29 January 2008 the applicants' representative requested that the respondent Government be notified of the introduction of the applications in accordance with Rule 40 of the Rules of Court and that the cases be given priority under Rule 41. On 18 January, 4 and 13 February and 3 March 2008, the President of the Second Section granted that priority to the cases.
On 10 April 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
At the material time the applicants were the owners, executive directors, editors-in-chief, news directors and journalists of two daily and three weekly newspapers published in : Gündem, Yedinci Gün, Haftaya Bakış, Yaşamda Demokrasi and Gerçek Demokrasi. The publication of all five newspapers was suspended pursuant to section 6(5) of Law no. 3713 (the Prevention of Terrorism Act) by various Chambers of the  between 9 October and 15 December 2007, for periods ranging from fifteen days to a month, on account of various news reports and articles. The impugned publications were mainly deemed to be propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation, the PKK/KONGRA-GEL, and to constitute the approval of crimes committed by that organisation and its members.
Neither the applicants nor their representative participated in these ex parte procedures, and their written objections to the suspension orders were dismissed. Consequently, the orders were executed.
The applicant Lütfi Ürper, the owner of Gündem, was prosecuted under sections 6(2) and 7(2) of Law no. 3713, as well as Articles 215 and 218 of the Criminal Code, for disseminating propaganda in favour of the aforementioned organisation and for praising crimes committed by that organisation and its members, on account of various articles published in the said newspaper. According to the limited information in the case file, the applicants Ali Turgay, Hüseyin Aykol and Hüseyin Bektaş were similarly prosecuted.
It appears that the criminal proceedings brought against the aforementioned applicants are still pending.
