The case originated in an application (no. 42728/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Engin Babayiğit (“the applicant”), on 13 August 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Erbil a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 21 November 2008 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1983 and at the time of lodging his application he was serving his prison sentence in Bolu F-type prison.
On 10 December 2007 the applicant wrote a letter to a member of parliament, in which he had praised the imprisoned leader of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan by using “Kürt Halk Önderi”, meaning the leader of Kurdish people.
Pursuant to the Regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicant was found guilty of breaching prison order by the Kocaeli F- type Prison Disciplinary Board (referred hereafter as “the Board”) and on 24 December 2007 the applicant was sentenced to 13 days’ solitary confinement, on account of his statements in the above mentioned letter.
On 17 January 2008 the Kocaeli Enforcement Judge rejected the applicant’s objection.
On 14 February 2008 the Kocaeli Assize Court upheld the judgment of 17 January 2008.
