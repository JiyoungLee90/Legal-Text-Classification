.  The case originated in eleven applications (nos. 14495/11, 14531/11, 26274/11, 78923/11, 8408/12, 11848/12, 12078/12, 12103/12, 14745/12, 21910/12, 41087/12) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by twenty two Turkish nationals (“the applicants”), whose names appear in the appendix.
The applicants were represented by Mr Ö. Kılıç and Ms A. Taşdemir, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
.  On 10 January 2013 the applications were communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
.  The applicants, whose names appear in the appendix hereto, are Turkish nationals who live in Istanbul. They are the owners, executive directors, editors-in-chief, editors and members of the technical staff of nine publications which were issued on daily, weekly, biweekly or bimonthly basis: Haftalık Yorum, Politik Yorum, Ülkede Yorum, Yeni Demokratik Toplum, Yeni Demokratik Yaşam, Yeni Demokratik Ulus, Azadiya Welat, Demokratik Ulus, and Özgür Mezopotamya. They are represented before the Court by Mr Ö. Kılıç and Ms A. Taşdemir, lawyers practising in Istanbul.
.  On various dates between 23 June 2010 and 15 February 2012, the Istanbul Assize Courts decided to suspend the publication and distribution of the abovementioned nine newspapers for periods ranging from fifteen days to one month under section 6 (5) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713), on the ground that the newspapers had published propaganda in favour of various illegal organisations. All copies of the relevant issues were seized. The applicants raised objections to the suspension orders but these objections were dismissed shortly afterwards by the Istanbul, Assize Courts. Neither the applicants nor their representatives were permitted to participate in any of the proceedings held before the Assize Courts.
.  The details of the proceedings may be found in the appended table.
.  A description of the relevant domestic law and practice may be found in the case of Ürper and Others v. Turkey (nos. 14526/07, 14747/07, 15022/07, 15737/07, 36137/07, 47245/07, 50371/07, 50372/07 and 54637/07, §§ 12-14, 20 October 2009).
Within the context of the “Judicial Reform Strategy Action Plan”, on 5 July 2012 a new law amending various laws with a view to rendering judicial services more effective and to suspending cases and sentences given in cases concerning crimes committed through the press and media (Law no. 6352) entered into force. Section 105 (2) of Law no. 6352 abolished section 6 (5) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713).
