The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
Between 12 December 2016 and 10 May 2017 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants were serving their prison sentences in various establishments at the time when the applications were lodged.
All of the applicants were found guilty of breaching prison order by decisions of the respective disciplinary boards of prisons in which they were held. Pursuant to the Regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicants were sentenced respectively between 11 to 15 days’ solitary confinement on the orders of the respective Prison Disciplinary Boards (referred hereafter as “the board”).
Their objections were subsequently rejected by the Enforcement Judges and the Assize Courts, on the basis of the case files, without hearing the applicants or their lawyers, pursuant to Law no. 4675 on Enforcement Judges, dated 16 May 2001.
