The case originated in an application (no. 25834/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr İzzet Çelik (“the applicant”), on 27 April 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr S. Gözkıran and Mr B. Benek lawyers practising in Şanlıurfa. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 25 August 2014 the complaints concerning Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Şanlıurfa.
On 17 July 2008 the applicant sent a letter to the Halfeti (Şanlıurfa) public prosecutor’s office which contained the following passage:
"If using the word of “sayın” (esteemed) is an offense, then I also say “Sayın Abdullah Öcalan”, I commit this offense and denounce myself."
On 9 October 2008, the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Halfeti Magistrates’ Court in Criminal Matters against the applicant. He was charged with praising an offence and offender, prescribed by Article 215 of the Criminal Code (Law no. 5237), on account of his statements in the above mentioned letter.
On 29 December 2008, in a final judgment, the Halfeti Magistrates’ Court in Criminal Matters found the applicant guilty of praising the imprisoned leader of the PKK, an illegal armed organisation, on account of his statements in the aforementioned letter and accordingly sentenced him to two months and fifteen days’ imprisonment. In accordance with Article 50 of the Criminal Code, this prison sentence was commuted to a fine of 1,500 Turkish Liras (TRY).
