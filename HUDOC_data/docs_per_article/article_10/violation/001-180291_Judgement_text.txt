The case originated in an application (no. 51497/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by fifteen Turkish nationals (“the applicants”) on 7 September 2009.
The applicants, whose names, dates of birth and places of residence are set out in the attached table, were represented by Mr Sedat Gözkıran, a lawyer practising in Şanlıurfa. Following the communication of the case, the applicants’ representative informed the Registry that two of the applicants, namely Mr Ali Öcalan and Mr Mustafa Akşahin, died on 15 November 2009 and 25 July 2011 respectively, and that their heirs, Ms Fatma Öcalan, Mr Mehmet Öcalan, Mr Abdullah Öcalan, Mr İlhami Öcalan, Ms Hacer Eyibilen (Öcalan), Mr Erol Öcalan, Mr Orhan Öcalan, Mr Vediha Öcalan, Mr Belkız Öcalan, Ms Naziha Akşahin, Ms Fatma Taştan, Mr Halis Akşahin, Mr Mehmet Akşahin, Ms Leyla Yavuz, Ms Aysel Büyükertaş indicated their wish to continue the application before the Court.
The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 25 August 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants, whose names are listed in the appendix, are Turkish nationals.
On 17 and 18 July 2008, each of the applicants sent a letter to the Halfeti (Şanlıurfa) public prosecutor`s office which contained the following passage:
 "If using the word of “sayın” (esteemed) is an offense, then I also say “Sayın Abdullah Öcalan”, I commit this offense and denounce myself."
On 19 September 2008, the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Halfeti Magistrates’ Court in Criminal Matters against the applicants. They were charged with praising an offence and offender, prescribed by Article 215 of the Criminal Code (Law no. 5237), on account of their statements in the above mentioned letters.
On 9 March 2009 the Halfeti Magistrates’ Court in Criminal Matters found the applicants guilty of praising the imprisoned leader of the PKK, an illegal armed organisation, on account of their statements in the aforementioned letters and accordingly, sentenced them each to two months and fifteen days’ imprisonment. In accordance with Article 50 of the Criminal Code, this prison sentence was commuted to a fine of 1,500 Turkish Liras (TRY).
The applicants appealed against this judgment. On 20 June 2012 the Court of Cassation, holding that the amount of the fine that had been imposed on the applicants did not attain the minimum requisite level, dismissed the appeal request.
