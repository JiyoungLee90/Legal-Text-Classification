The case originated in three applications (nos. 32869/08, 35022/08 and 39904/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by twenty-three Turkish nationals (“the applicants”), whose names appear in the appendix.
The applicants were represented by Mr Ö. Kılıç, a lawyer practising in . The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 20 June, 30 June and 21 July 2008 the applicants’ representative requested that the respondent Government be notified of the introduction of the applications in accordance with Rule 40 of the Rules of Court and that the cases be given priority under Rule 41.
On 23 October 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give priority to the applications under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court and to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
At the material time the applicants were the owners, executive directors, editors-in-chief, news directors and journalists of one weekly and two daily newspapers published in : Yeni Bakış, Alternatif and Gelecek. The publication of these newspapers was suspended pursuant to section 6(5) of Law no. 3713 (the Prevention of Terrorism Act) by the Istanbul Assize Court on 8 May, 25 May and 30 June 2008, respectively, for a period of one month on account of various news reports and articles. The impugned publications were mainly deemed to be propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation, the PKK/KONGRA-GEL, and to constitute the approval of crimes committed by that organisation and its members.
Neither the applicants nor their representative participated in these ex parte procedures, and their written objections to the suspension orders were dismissed. Consequently, the orders were executed.
The applicant Ali Turgay, the owner of Yeni Bakış, was prosecuted under sections 6(2) and 7(2) of Law no. 3713, as well as Articles 215 and 218 of the Criminal Code, for disseminating propaganda in favour of the aforementioned organisation and praising crimes committed by that organisation and its members, on account of various articles published in the said newspaper (case no. 2008/162). According to the information in the case file, this case is pending before the first-instance court.
The applicant Cevat Düşün, the owner of Alternatif and Gelecek, was similarly prosecuted on two occasions. The first case concerning the former newspaper (case no. 2008/190 E.) resulted in his conviction under sections 6(2) and 7(2) of Law no. 3713. According to the information in the case file, this case is currently pending before the Court of Cassation. The second case (case no. 2008/182) is apparently still pending at first instance.
