The case originated in an application (no. 16624/12) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Ziya Aydemir and Mr Kenan Karavil (“the applicants”), on 13 February 2012.
The applicants were represented by Ms S. Aracı Bek a lawyer practising in Adana. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 6 September 2013 the complaint concerning the alleged breach of the applicants’ right to freedom of expression was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
On 26 February 2014 the Government submitted their observations on the admissibility and merits of the applications. By a letter dated 12 March 2014, the applicants were requested to submit by 22 April 2014 any written observations which they might wish to make in reply to those of the Government, together with any claims for just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention. On 22 August 2014 the applicants sent a letter to the Court enclosing their observations in reply to the Government’s observations, together with their claims for just satisfaction. By a letter dated 9 October 2014 the parties were informed that the President of the Section had decided, pursuant to Rule 38 § 1 of the Rules of Court, to admit the applicants’ observations and claims for just satisfaction, submitted outside the time-limit, to the case file.
The applicants were born in 1957 and 1981 and live in Diyarbakır and Adana respectively.
On 17 August 2006 the Adana public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with Adana Magistrate’s Court charging the applicants and five other persons with praising an offence and an offender under Article 215 of the Criminal Code. The public prosecutor alleged that the applicants had signed a petition in September 2005 which had been drafted in order to be sent to several institutions. The petition read as follows:
“As a person from Kurdistan, I consider and accept Mr/Esteemed Abdullah Öcalan of Kurdistan as a political actor.”
On 19 January 2007 the Adana Magistrate’s Court decided that it lacked jurisdiction in the case due to the possibility of application of section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) proscribing disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation. The court then sent the file to Adana Assize Court.
On 24 March 2008 the Adana Assize Court convicted the applicants of disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section 7(2) of Law No. 3713 and sentenced them each to two years’ imprisonment. In its judgment, the first-instance court found it established that the above-mentioned petition had been prepared for the purpose of disseminating propaganda in favour of the PKK and its leader and that by signing that petition the applicants had committed the offence proscribed in section 7(2) of Law no. 3713.
On 13 July 2011 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 24 March 2008. On 24 August 2011 the Court of Cassation’s judgment was deposited with the first instance court’s registry.
On an unspecified date the second applicant started serving his prison sentence.
On 19 October 2012 the Adana Assize Court decided to suspend the execution of the applicants’ prison sentence in accordance with Law no. 6352 which had entered into force on 5 July 2012 and which had amended certain provisions of Law no. 3713. The suspension was for a period of three years, on condition that they did not commit an offence through the press, media or other methods of expressing ideas and opinions.
Between 7 August 2003 and 18 July 2006, section 7(2) of Law no. 3713 read as follows:
“Any person who assists members of the aforementioned organisations [terrorist organisations] or who disseminates propaganda inciting others to violence or other methods of terrorism shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of one to five years and a judicial fine of five million liras to one billion liras ...”
The first sentence of section 7(2) of Law no. 3713 was amended by Law no. 5532, which entered into force on 18 July 2006, as follows:
“Any person who disseminates propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of one to five years ...”
The first sentence of section 7(2) of Law no. 3713, amended on 30 April 2013 by Law no. 6459, currently reads as follows:
“Any person who disseminates propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation by justifying, praising or encouraging the use of methods constituting coercion, violence or threats shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of one to five years ...”
