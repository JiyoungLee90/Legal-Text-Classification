The case originated in an application (no. 64375/12) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Ms Hüsniye Düzel (“the applicant”), on 10 August 2012.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Beştaş a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
The applicant complained under Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention that her conviction had constituted a breach of her rights to freedom of thought and to freedom of expression.
On 20 December 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Diyarbakır.
On 30 September 2007 a reading out of a press statement and a march were held in Diyarbakır in order to protest about the conditions of detention and alleged poisoning of Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party), an illegal armed organisation. The protesters gathered in front of the building of the Diyarbakır branch of the Democratic Society Party (Demokratik Toplum Partisi) (DTP) where a press statement was read out. They then marched. The applicant, as a member of the DTP, participated in the gathering and the ensuing march. According to a police report dated 9 October 2007, the applicant was seen while carrying a banner which read “İnsanlık zehirleniyor” (“The humanity is being poisoned”) and applauding together with other demonstrators in the police video footage.
On 9 October 2007 the applicant was taken into police custody. On the same day she was detained on remand.
On 17 October 2007 the Diyarbakır public prosecutor charged the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) on account of the content of the banner she had carried during the demonstration of 30 September 2007.
On 4 December 2007 the applicant was released pending trial.
On 18 March 2008 the Diyarbakır Assize Court convicted the applicant as charged. The court found it established, on the basis of an expert report on the police video footage, that the applicant had been together with other persons who had chanted the slogan “Be Serok Jiyan Nabe” (“There is no life without the leader”) and that she had carried a banner which read “The humanity is being poisoned”. The applicant was sentenced to ten months’ imprisonment.
On 9 January 2012 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 18 March 2008.
On an unspecified date the applicant started serving her prison sentence. On 17 July 2012, upon the applicant’s request, the Diyarbakır Assize Court ordered her release from prison, in accordance with Law no. 6352 which had entered into force on 5 July 2012 and which had amended certain provisions of Law no. 3713.
The relevant domestic law applicable at the material time can be found in Belge v. Turkey (no. 50171/09, § 19, 6 December 2016).
In particular, at the time of the events giving rise to the present application, section 7(2) of Law no. 3713 read as follows:
“Any person who disseminates propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation shall be liable to [serve] a term of imprisonment of one to five years ...”
