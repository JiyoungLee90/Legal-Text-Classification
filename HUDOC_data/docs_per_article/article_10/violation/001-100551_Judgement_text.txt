The case originated in three applications (nos. 13710/08, 16345/08 and 19652/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by twenty Turkish nationals (“the applicants”), whose names appear in the appendix.
The applicants were represented by Mr Ö. Kılıç, a lawyer practising in . The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 25 February, 21 March and 9 April 2008 the applicants' representative requested that the respondent Government be notified of the introduction of the applications in accordance with Rule 40 of the Rules of Court and that the cases be given priority under Rule 41.
On 2 June 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give priority to the applications under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court and to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
At the material time the applicants were the owners, executive directors, editors-in-chief, news directors and journalists of three weekly newspapers published in : Haftaya Bakış, Yaşamda Demokrasi and Yedinci Gün. The publication of all three newspapers was suspended pursuant to section 6(5) of Law no. 3713 (the Prevention of Terrorism Act) by various Chambers of the Istanbul Assize Court on 2 February, 17 February and 3 March 2008, respectively, for a period of one month on account of various news reports and articles. The impugned publications were mainly deemed to be propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation, the PKK/KONGRA-GEL, and to constitute the approval of crimes committed by that organisation and its members.
Neither the applicants nor their representative participated in these ex parte procedures, and their written objections to the suspension orders were dismissed. Consequently, the orders were executed.
The applicants Ali Turgay and Hüseyin Bektaş, the owners of Haftaya Bakış, Yedinci Gün and Yaşamda Demokrasi, respectively, were both prosecuted under sections 6(2) and 7(2) of Law no. 3713, as well as Articles 215 and 218 of the Criminal Code, for disseminating propaganda in favour of the aforementioned organisation and praising crimes committed by that organisation and its members, on account of various articles published in the said newspapers.
It appears that the criminal proceedings brought against the aforementioned applicants are still pending.
