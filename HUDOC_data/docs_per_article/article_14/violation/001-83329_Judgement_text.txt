The case originated in an application (no. 60274/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Humphrey Wood (“the applicant”) on 9 June 2000.
The applicant was represented before the Court by Pierce Glynn Solicitors, . The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, .
The applicant complained under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, because he was a man, he was denied social security benefits equivalent to those received by widows.
By a partial decision of 15 January 2002 the Court decided to communicate this application, and to join it to other applications (nos. 58370/00, 60940/00, 61019/00, 61394/00, 61398/00, 61781/00, 62966/00, 63471/00, 63476/00, 63478/00, 63481/00, 63507/00).
On 6 May 2003, after obtaining the parties' observations, the Court declared this application admissible in so far as the complaint concerned Widowed Mother's Allowance as from the date of the applicant's second claim and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in .
His wife died on 27 November 1990, leaving one child born in 1990. His second claim for widows' benefits was made in October 1999 and was rejected on 12 January 2000 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows' benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under  law.
The relevant domestic law and practice is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV.
