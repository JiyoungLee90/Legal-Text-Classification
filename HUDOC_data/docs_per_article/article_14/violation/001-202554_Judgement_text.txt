The case originated in an application (no. 34168/11) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Moldovan nationals, Ms Rodica Munteanu and Mr Cristian Munteanu (“the applicants”), on 1 June 2011.
The applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Ms D. Străisteanu, a lawyer practising in Chișinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented successively by their Agents, Mr L. Apostol and R. Revencu.
The applicants alleged, in particular, that the authorities had condoned the domestic violence against them, and that the first applicant had been subjected to discrimination.
On 3 January 2012 the Government were given notice of the application.
The first applicant was born in 1971. The second applicant was born in 1998 and is the first applicant’s son. They both live in Durlești.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
At the time of the events the first applicant was married to I.M. After I.M. lost his job, he started drinking heavily, became violent towards the applicants and sold items from the family home in order to purchase alcohol.
On 27 August 2007 I.M. severely beat the first applicant, which resulted in her being in hospital for three weeks. The violence, both verbal and physical – she was punched and hit with various objects  continued thereafter. The second applicant was allegedly also regularly beaten and insulted, and would often go to his friends’ houses to prepare for school or simply stay away from the trouble at home and avoid further violence being used against him.
On 18 April 2011 the first applicant asked the police to take action against I.M., who had assaulted her. The police instead fined her, because I.M. had already called the police that weekend to complain that she had verbally and physically attacked him. The first applicant explained that she had been out of the city over the weekend. She added that, in any event, it was difficult for anyone to imagine that she could assault a man weighing 120 kilograms.
After being beaten again on 19 April 2011, the first applicant called the police and an officer spoke to I.M.
On 21 April 2011 the first applicant applied for a protection order. On 3 May 2011 the Buiucani District Court (“the District Court”) issued an order requiring I.M. to leave the family home for ninety days and not approach the applicants. On the same day the order was forwarded to the local police, the Buiucani Social Welfare Agency and the Buiucani Agency for the Protection of the Rights of Children.
On 11 May 2011 the police officer responsible for the case informed the applicants that he had informed I.M. of the protection order on 6 May 2011 and warned him against any further abuse. I.M. left the same day.
However, I.M. returned home the next day and refused to move out. The first applicant made several calls to the police, who spoke to I.M. but did nothing to remove him from the house.
On 19 May 2011 the applicants’ lawyer asked the Buiucani prosecutor’s office to launch a criminal investigation against I.M. for domestic violence and to ensure that the protection order was enforced.
On 20 May 2011 the applicants’ lawyer asked the Buiucani Social Welfare Agency to assess I.M. in order to verify whether he had an alcohol problem.
On 24 May 2011 the first applicant was again insulted and pushed by I.M. When she called the local police, she was allegedly told by an officer that he was tired of the applicants’ family’s problems and would not be giving her any assistance.
On 25 May 2011 the first applicant was invited to the Buiucani Social Welfare Agency, where two social workers allegedly told her to “be nice” to her husband to keep their family together.
On 26 May 2011 the first applicant made a complaint against the two social workers for victimising a victim of domestic violence. She made a further complaint the same day to the Ministry of Internal Affairs about the behaviour of the officer who had refused her assistance on 24 May 2011.
On 26 June 2011 I.M. beat the first applicant again. A forensic report of 27 June 2011 concluded that she had injuries on her torso, left shoulder and left leg. She called the police, but the officer who came did not take any measures and only took notes, asking the two of them to calm down and stop causing trouble. There was no reaction when she reminded the officer that the protection order of 3 May 2011 was still in force and that I.M. was still in the family home. She made a complaint about the behaviour of the police officer on 28 June 2011. On 6 July 2011 the Buiucani police replied that they could not take a decision concerning a complaint of domestic violence pending a court decision on the matter.
On 2 and 3 July 2011 I.M. again beat the first applicant and lightly cut her right arm with a knife. A medical report of 5 July 2011 concluded that she had injuries on the left side of her torso, her right arm and her head, including a knife wound. She called the police, but the officer who came only took notes and left. She submitted a complaint on 6 July 2011 about the officer’s attitude. She also asked the police to initiate a criminal investigation for domestic violence.
On 21 July 2011 the first applicant applied to the District Court for another protection order, this time within the criminal proceedings started on 14 July 2011 (see paragraph 41 below). Since the court did not adopt a decision within twenty-four hours as prescribed by law, she sent it again. On 29 July 2011 the District Court rejected the request, stating that since the case file was with the prosecutor’s office, the applicants had to ask it to make the relevant request to the court.
On 3 August 2011 the first applicant lodged another request for a protection order with the District Court. The request was allowed the same day, and I.M. was ordered to leave the family home and not approach or contact the applicants.
On the same date the applicants’ lawyer asked for criminal proceedings to be initiated against two prosecutors (M.P. and C.V.) who, in her opinion, were responsible for failing to enforce the protection order of 3 May 2011 and inform the applicants of the measures taken to date.
On the same date the applicants’ lawyer was informed, further to a request by her, that from March to July 2011 ten calls had been made from the family home to the local police. On the same day the Buiucani police were informed by a specialist medical facility that I.M. had been registered with them since 2010 as a chronic alcoholic.
On 5 August 2011 the first applicant asked the Buiucani police to inform her how the protection order of 3 August 2011 was being enforced, notably who was responsible for its enforcement and what action had been taken in that regard. On 7 September 2011 she was informed that on 11 August 2011 the local police had gone to the family home and informed I.M. of the protection order of 3 August 2011. They had also warned him not to breach the order and evicted him.
On 7 October 2011 the District Court fined I.M. 1,000 Moldovan lei (MDL  approximately 62 euros (EUR)) for failing to abide by the protection order.
On 31 October 2011 the District Court issued a new protection order in favour of the applicants. The first applicant complained about the nonenforcement of the order on 27 and 29 December 2011, as well as on 4 and 11 January 2012.
On 5 December 2011 the divorce between the first applicant and I.M. was pronounced by the District Court. It was decided that the second applicant would live with his mother, the first applicant.
On 2 February 2012 the first applicant applied for a new protection order. The District Court allowed the request the same day.
On 8 February 2012 Amicul (part of the National Centre for the Prevention of Child Abuse) issued a psychological report concerning the second applicant, finding that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.
On 19 March 2012 the first applicant applied for a new protection order. She submitted copies of her complaints of domestic violence after I.M.’s conviction on 2 March 2012 (see paragraph 46 below). The District Court issued a protection order the same day, and the judge recommended that the first applicant look for alternative accommodation until the division of the couple’s property had taken place.
On 8 May 2012 I.M. came home drunk and beat up the first applicant. She called the police, but the officers were allegedly unable to do anything. That evening I.M. called the police and complained that he had been beaten by the first applicant. They both had bruises confirmed by medical reports.
On 18 May 2012 the first applicant applied for and obtained a new protection order for ninety days ordering I.M. to leave the family home and not approach the applicants. That evening I.M. hit the applicant in the face, fracturing her lower jaw, as subsequently established in a medical report filed between 21 and 25 May 2012. According to the first applicant, this happened right after the police had left without doing anything. She screamed and the officers then returned and took I.M. to the police station.
In response to a request by I.M., on 29 May 2012 the District Court issued a protection order in his favour, valid for thirty days. The judge referred to the fact that a criminal investigation had been opened against the first applicant for causing bodily harm to I.M. on 8 May 2012. The protection order was extended by another thirty days on 12 July 2012. On 14 August 2012 the first applicant was charged, but on 28 December 2012 the charges were dropped.
On 30 May 2012 the first applicant complained about the inaction of the police officers in allowing I.M. to remain in the family home on 18 May 2012.
On 15 July 2012 I.M. beat up the first applicant, as confirmed by a medical report of 27 July 2012.
During the criminal proceedings against I.M., on 23 July 2012 the first applicant applied for and obtained a court order changing the preventive measure against I.M. into custody.
Following a request by the first applicant, on 5 December 2012 the District Court deprived I.M. of his parental rights over the second applicant. The court referred to the second applicant’s statements that his father had been violent and insulting and had driven him out of his own home. His statements were supported by the local social services and a psychologist, who established that the second applicant was suffering emotional stress and a high level of anxiety and fear, provoked by his powerlessness against his father’s violent behaviour. Specific examples were given, such as an incident when I.M. had hit the second applicant on the head with a hammer, stabbed him with a fork and jammed his fingers in the door.
On 11 December 2014 and on 5 August 2015 the District Court issued two new protection orders, valid for ninety days, ordering I.M. not to approach the applicants.
On 2 and 16 June 2011 the first applicant asked for criminal proceedings to be initiated against I.M. for domestic violence. She updated her request on 6 July 2011, referring to new instances of abuse by I.M. on 26 June, 2 and 3 July 2011.
On 14 July 2011 a prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against I.M. for causing bodily harm (medium gravity injuries) to the first applicant on 27 August 2007.
On 17 July 2011 the prosecutor refused to open an investigation against I.M. for domestic violence. That decision was upheld by a higher- ranking prosecutor on 11 August 2011. On 23 September 2011 the District Court annulled both decisions and sent the case back to the prosecutor’s office.
On 21 July 2011 the first applicant complained that criminal proceedings should not only have been brought against I.M. for causing bodily harm, as there was ample evidence of systematic abuse on his part amounting to domestic violence. She asked that I.M. be prosecuted for domestic violence in addition to causing bodily harm. She also complained that on 13 and 15 May 2011 proceedings had been initiated against I.M. for administrative offences for not observing the protection order but that the courts had not yet taken a decision. On 2 August 2011 the prosecutor’s office replied that because I.M.’s actions had been properly assessed as causing bodily harm, there was no need to reclassify his actions. It added that since the case was already with the first-instance court, all requests had to be addressed there.
On 4 August 2011 the first applicant again asked that a criminal investigation be initiated against I.M. for domestic violence. She repeated her request on 22 August 2011.
On 26 October 2011 the prosecutor’s office initiated criminal proceedings against I.M. for domestic violence.
On 2 March 2012 the District Court convicted I.M. of causing bodily harm to the first applicant and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment, suspended for one year. It also ordered him to pay the first applicant compensation of MDL 500 (EUR 32).
On 15 March 2012 the prosecutor charged I.M. with several counts of domestic violence, relating to incidents occurring on 26 June and 2, 3 and 6 July 2011.
On 22 February 2013 the District Court convicted I.M. of domestic violence and making death threats to the first applicant, as well as for failing to abide by the court orders. He was sentenced to one year and two months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay the first applicant MDL 7,000 (EUR 437) and the second applicant MDL 3,000 (EUR 187) in compensation. The court held that it was an aggravating factor that I.M. had already been convicted for bodily harm against the first applicant and had not changed his behaviour. It also held that “the immorality of the victim’s actions, who [had] provoked the offence” was a mitigating factor. In determining the amount of damages to be paid by I.M., the court noted that the first applicant was also responsible for victimising the second applicant.
The applicants appealed, disagreeing with the imposition of the minimum sentence on I.M. and the court’s reference to the first applicant’s “immoral actions”.
On 15 April 2013 the Chișinău Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of 22 February 2013 in part. It found I.M. guilty and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment, ordering him to pay each of the applicants MDL 10,000 (EUR 620) in compensation. The court stated in its decision, inter alia, that the first applicant had provoked I.M.’s violence, including by her failure to leave the family home after the protection order was adopted in favour of I.M.
In July 2014 I.M. was released from prison.
On 14 September 2015 a prosecutor initiated a criminal investigation against I.M. for violence against the first applicant on 23 July 2015, referring to an ecchymosis and skin abrasion documented in a medical report dated 25 July 2015. In rejecting the investigator’s proposal not to initiate a criminal investigation, the prosecutor stated that the information gathered to date indicated that there was evidence of domestic violence. He added that “in order to ensure an efficient investigation and thus establish the objective truth, it is necessary to use all the evidentiary means provided by the Code of Criminal Procedure, something which can be done only within a criminal investigation.” The investigation was eventually discontinued on 31 October 2016.
On 15 December 2016 I.M. died.
