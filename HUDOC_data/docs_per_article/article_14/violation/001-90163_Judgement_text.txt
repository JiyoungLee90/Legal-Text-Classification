The case originated in an application (no. 28071/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr David Shireby (“the applicant”), on 18 January 2002.
The applicant was represented by Royds Rdw, solicitors in . The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, .
By a partial decision of 12 November 2002  the Court decided to communicate the application. Subsequently, under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Sheffield.
His wife died on 3 April 2001. His claim for widows’ benefits was made in June 2001. On 22 June 2001 the applicant was informed that he was entitled to Widowed Parent’s Allowance (“WPA”). However, on 14 January 2002 he was informed that he was not entitled to a Bereavement Payment on the ground that the benefit did not exist at the time of the applicant’s wife’s death. The applicant did not appeal as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under  law.
The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court’s judgment in the case of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV.
