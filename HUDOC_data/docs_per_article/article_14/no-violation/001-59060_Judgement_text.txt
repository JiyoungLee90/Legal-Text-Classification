The case originated in an application (no. 15919/89) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Edoardo Palumbo (“the applicant”), on 23 November 1989.
The applicant was represented by Mr Michele Pazienza, a lawyer practising in Rome. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented first by their former Agent, Mr Luigi Ferrari Bravo, and subsequently by their Agent Mr Umberto Leanza and their Co-Agent, Mr Vitaliano Esposito.
The applicant alleged that the prolonged impossibility to recover possession of his flat, owing to the implementation of emergency legislative provisions on residential property leases, infringed his right under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Invoking Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, he further complained about the duration of the eviction proceedings. He finally complained under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that he had suffered discrimination in respect of his tenant.
On 5 April 1993, the Commission (First Chamber) decided to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and invited them to submit their observations on its admissibility and merits. The Government submitted their observations on 6 July 1993, to which the applicant replied on 30 July 1993.
On 28 February 1995, the case was adjourned awaiting the judgments of the Court in the cases Spadea and Scalabrino v. Italy and Scollo v. Italy. The judgments having been delivered on 28 September 1995, on 13 March 1996 the parties were requested to submit their additional observations, which they did on 2 and 3 April 1996 respectively.
On 4 September 1996, the Commission declared the application admissible.
On 28 May 1997, the Commission decided to adjourn the case pending the examination of the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy. On 27 May 1998, the Commission resumed consideration of the case and invited the parties to submit further observations on the merits, which the applicant did on 17 June 1998 and the Government on 19 June 1998.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1999 in accordance with Article 5 § 3, second sentence, of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, the Commission not having completed its examination of the case by that date.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr B. Conforti, the judge elected in respect of Italy, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government waived their right to appoint an ad hoc judge to sit in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 2).
The applicant is the owner of a flat in Rome, which he had let to Mrs A.B. The lease had been extended until 31 December 1983 by the operation of Law no. 392 of 12 July 1978.
In a writ served on the tenant on 13 October 1983, the applicant communicated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Rome Magistrate.
By a decision of 7 October 1983, which was made enforceable on 27 October 1983, the Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 December 1984.
On 6 March, 8 April, 9 May, 17 June, 22 July, 1 October and 5 November 1986, the bailiff unsuccessfully attempted to evict the tenant without police assistance.
Pursuant to Law no. 899 of 23 December 1986, the enforcement proceedings were suspended until 31 March 1987.
On 6 March 1987 the applicant made a statutory declaration that he urgently required the premises as accommodation for himself.
On 21 April and 28 May 1987, the bailiff made two other unsuccessful attempts to evict the tenant.
On 24 June 1987 the applicant was granted police assistance in evicting his tenant; on that day, however, the latter claimed to be ill and no officially appointed doctor was available to check her allegations. The bailiff arranged to make his next visit to the premises on 14 July 1987. However, on this occasion the applicant was not granted the police assistance and the tenant refused to vacate the premises.
Pursuant to law-decree no. 551 of 30 December 1988 and to Laws no. 108 of 8 April 1988 and no. 61 of 21 February 1989 the enforcement of the order for possession was suspended until 31 April 1989.
In June 1992, after a number of unsuccessful attempts by the bailiff, the applicant recovered possession of his flat.
The relevant domestic law is described in the judgment Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V.
