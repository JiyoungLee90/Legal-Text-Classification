The case originated in an application (no. 67591/12) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Mr Dumitru Mardare (“the applicant”), on 29 August 2012.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr A. Grigoriu, a lawyer practising in Bucharest. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged that the physical conditions of his detention in all the prison facilities in which he had been detained, including the lack of separation between smokers and nonsmokers, the repeated transfers from one prison to another within a short period of time and the lack of adequate medical care for his illnesses had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention. He also alleged that he had been unable to obtain copies from his personal file in order to submit them to the Court together with the application.
On 7 May 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1955 and is currently detained in Iași Prison.
By a final decision of 2013 the applicant was convicted of fraud and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. He had been detained in several prisons since 18 October 2011.
In respect of the establishments in which he had been detained, the applicant alleged that he had been kept in overcrowded cells with poor conditions of hygiene. The food he had received had been of poor quality and had not been adapted to his medical condition. He also claimed that despite the fact that he was a non-smoker, he had had to share the cells with smokers. He also claimed that the cells in which he was detained in Iași Prison were infested with bugs, and the mattresses were old and dirty.
The Government submitted that in all the cells occupied by him, the applicant had had his own bed. The cells had natural and artificial light and were ventilated through windows. The detention cells were disinfected daily with chlorine. The detainees were provided with cleaning materials and they were responsible for cleaning the cells. At least every trimester the prison authorities or specialised contractors carried out work to eradicate rodents and insects. The detainees were entitled to two showers per week.
The applicant received a special diet for his diabetes.
