The case concerns a complaint under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention. The applicant is a prisoner serving a life-sentence under the “special regime”. He complained about having been continually held in almost complete isolation, in the absence of purposeful activities for physical and mental stimulation, and in poor material conditions, without there being an effective remedy in this connection.
The applicant was born in 1982 and is detained in Pazardzhik. The applicant was represented by Mr V.S. Stoyanov, a lawyer practising in Pazardzhik.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Dimitrova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant has been serving a life sentence under the “special regime” since 14 October 2013, having been in detention intermittently since 1999 for various offences. He was detained in Plovdiv Prison until 4 November 2013. On that date he was transferred to Pazardzhik Prison, where he has been serving his sentence ever since.
According to the applicant, in Pazardzhik Prison he has not had ready access to a toilet and running water, has not been provided with the opportunity to work or participate in other activities aimed at his resocialisation, and has had no opportunity to do any sports, apart from an hour of outdoor exercise daily.
According to information provided by the Chief Directorate for the Execution of Sentences, the applicant has not been engaged in work in the prison because there has been no work available to inmates held in the high-security part of the prison where he has been serving his sentence. Between 9 May and 30 June 2016 he took part in an integrated basic skills training course for life prisoners. He also participated in a football tournament organised for life prisoners. In August 2017 he asked to be transferred to another prison in order to continue his education. As he did not apply within the given deadline, his request was refused. He failed to appeal against that decision.
In the first half of 2016 the applicant brought a claim for damages in the Pazardzhik Administrative Court under section 1 of the State and Municipality Responsibility for Damage Act (“the SMRDA”), in connection with various periods of his detention starting in 1999. As regards his time in Pazardzhik Prison after 4 November 2013, he complained that his rights under the Execution of Sentences and Pre-Trial Detention Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”) had been breached, and sought damages in that connection.
In particular, with regard to the material conditions of his detention, he emphasised in his claim that he had been using a bottle to drink from and a bucket as a toilet, owing to the lack of sanitary facilities and running water in his cell.
Furthermore, he pointed out that in accordance with the 2009 Act and the Convention, he had the right to be included in social, educational, cultural, creative and work-related activities aimed at his rehabilitation, as well as in sports activities lasting longer than the time allocated daily for being outdoors. He complained that in actual fact he had been isolated for almost twenty-four hours a day, with the exception of the time spent outdoors in an area measuring 7 by 14 metres. He had to share this area with up to seven other inmates at a time when he was allowed outdoors and could not use it when it rained. He also claimed that there had been no work available in the prison, and that he had been unable to continue his education as the prison only catered for classes up to third or fourth grade of primary school, and he had already finished fifth grade.
The Pazardzhik Administrative Court examined his claim under the SMRDA and dismissed it on 20 July 2016. He challenged that decision before the Supreme Administrative Court (“the SAC”), which quashed the judgment and remitted the case to the lower court for a new examination.
On 25 May 2018 the Pazardzhik Administrative Court heard the case under the new section 284 of the 2009 Act in conjunction with the amended section 3 (see paragraphs 32 and 18 respectively). The court allowed the claim in part and awarded compensation to the applicant in the amount of about 500 euros (EUR) for his detention in Pazardzhik Prison between 4 November 2013 and 24 April 2018. The court referred to the Court’s pilot judgment in the case of Neshkov and Others v. Bulgaria (nos. 36925/10 and 5 others, 27 January 2015), observing that any assessment of the conditions of detention had to be made by examining their cumulative effects on the detainee. The court also explicitly held that, according to the Court’s caselaw, the mere fact of placing a detainee in inadequate conditions was presumed to cause him or her non-pecuniary damage even in the absence of specific evidence about the negative emotions experienced. The court then acknowledged that the absence of running water and lack of ready access to a toilet must have exposed the applicant to a level of suffering beyond what was normal in detention. In particular, the fact that he had been dependent on the availability and goodwill of a prison guard to let him out of his cell so that he could use the toilet was in itself demeaning.
As regards the applicant’s complaint concerning the lack of purposeful activities, the Pazardzhik Administrative Court briefly observed as follows. According to one witness (a detainee), the applicant had asked to work and to continue his education, while according to another witness (a prison inspector) there had been no work available to life prisoners in Pazardzhik Prison, and the applicant had not even made a request to that effect. The court concluded that, in the light of the witness statements and written evidence, it could not be proven that the applicant had asked the prison administration whether he could participate in either work or further studies. Furthermore, he had had the possibility of choosing a book from among those brought to his cell once a week, and a psychologist had been working with him. The court did not deal with the applicant’s allegation concerning his almost complete isolation.
The SAC upheld that judgment on 24 January 2019 in a final decision.
In the meantime, on 15 March 2018 the prison governor considered the need to change the applicant’s prison regime from the most stringent “special regime” to the lighter “severe regime”, but decided against it and issued an order to that effect. The applicant did not challenge the order in court (see paragraph 23 below).
According to the latest information available in the file, on 11 January 2019 the applicant was placed with another life prisoner in a shared cell, pending the completion of repair works in their usual cells. The new cell measures just under 15 square metres and is equipped with a toilet and a shower separated from the rest of the living space. Hot water is available twice a week for two hours.
The relevant domestic law in force before amendments in 2017 to the Execution of Punishments and Pre-Trial Detention Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”) is set out in Harakchiev and Tolumov v. Bulgaria (nos. 15018/11 and 61199/12, §§ 165-74, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). In that judgment, the Court concluded under Article 46 of the Convention that Bulgaria was required to reform the legal framework governing the prison regime applicable to persons sentenced to life or whole-life imprisonment, to ensure, among other things, that the regime was applied for no longer than strictly necessary (ibid., § 280).
An amending Act was published in the State Gazette on 7 February 2017 (ДВ, бр. 13/2017 г.). Most of its provisions came into force the same day, and some provisions came into force on 1 May 2017.
It amended a number of provisions of the 2009 Act. In particular, it amended the definition of inhuman and degrading treatment in relation to conditions of detention (amended section 3), and introduced dedicated preventive and compensatory remedies in respect of poor conditions of detention (new sections 276 to 286 of the 2009 Act).
Following amendment, section 3 of the 2009 Act, which came into force on 7 February 2017 and set out a general prohibition on subjecting convicted prisoners (and pre-trial detainees) to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, reads:
“1.  Convicted prisoners and pre-trial detainees shall not be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
Placing [a convicted prisoner or a pre-trial detainee] in unfavourable conditions consisting of a lack of sufficient living space, food, clothing, heating, light, ventilation, medical care, conditions for physical activity, prolonged isolation without opportunities to socialise, unjustified use of measures of restraint, as well as other similar actions, omissions or circumstances that demean human dignity or engender fear, helplessness or inferiority, shall also be regarded as a breach of subsection 1.”
The explanatory note to the Government bill which led to these specific amendments concerning life sentences indicated that they were required in order to avoid future breaches of Article 3 of the Convention, found in the past by the Court in several cases in respect of Bulgaria, including Chervenkov v. Bulgaria (no. 45358/04, 27 November 2012), Harakchiev and Tolumov (cited above), and Manolov v. Bulgaria (no.23810/05, 4 November 2014). In particular, such breaches were found as a result of the effects of the conditions of detention under the “special regime” on individuals sentenced to life or whole-life sentences, including the complete isolation of that category of prisoners without the prison authorities being able to change or alleviate the effects of the restrictions of the regime for five years after its imposition.
Following the amendment of sections 57 to 64a and 66 to 69 of the 2009 Act, it is no longer the sentencing court but the prison authorities which determine the type of correctional facility to which a convicted prisoner is to be committed.
The sentencing court, however, places individuals sentenced to life or whole-life imprisonment under the “special regime” for the first year of their sentence (section 57(1)(1) of the 2009 Act).
Subsequent changes from one prison regime to a more lenient one are no longer decided by a special commission attached to each prison, but by the prison governor (amended section 66(1)).
The amended version of section 198(1), which came into force on 7 February 2017, stipulates that, after a life prisoner has served a year of his or her life or whole-life sentence, the prison governor must decide whether to continue the application of the regime, or whether to lift it and apply the lighter regime for which such prisoners are eligible, namely the “severe regime”. The prison governor must then issue an order, which has to contain reasons and be based on reports prepared for that purpose by the head of the department for reform and rehabilitation, the deputy head of security and the prison psychologist. A decision refusing to change the regime from “special” to “severe” can be challenged by the prisoner in the administrative court within fourteen days of the order being served on him or her. The decision of that court is final.
The prison governor must carry out such an assessment and decide on the continued application of the “special regime” at least once a year (section 198(3)).
Under section 198(5), prisoners serving life or whole-life sentences may, subject to the approval of the prison governor, take part with other prisoners in work, rehabilitation, education, and sports activities, or any other type of activities organised for those categories.
As set out in the Court’s decision in the case of Atanasov and Apostolov v. Bulgaria, ((dec.), no. 65540/16, § 23, 27 June 2017), the new sections 276 to 283 of the 2009 Act, which came into force on 1 May 2017, put in place a dedicated preventive remedy with respect to conditions of detention. Those provisions read:
Section 276
“1.  Any convicted prisoner or pre-trial detainee may request:
The absence of a specific statutory obligation to carry out a particular action shall not be a bar to allowing an application under subsection 1 intended to end a breach of section 3.
Section 277
The application shall be made in writing to the administrative court competent with respect to the place of execution of the sentence or of enforcement of the pre-trial detention.
The application may also be lodged through the prison governor or the respective regional or district service for the execution of sentences, which shall forward it to the administrative court competent with respect to the place of execution of the sentence or of enforcement of the pre-trial detention within three days of receiving it, along with information concerning the grounds on which the action or omission has been challenged.
The application shall be recorded in a special court register, with a note of the exact time of its receipt and its author.
In cases under subsection 1, the court requires the authority [responsible for the execution of sentences] to immediately provide information about the actions or omissions in question.
Section 278
Within fourteen days of receiving the application the judge shall verify the actions or omissions whose cessation is being sought, and the grounds for them, through the police, the prosecuting authorities, the Ombudsman, an expert, non-governmental organisations, or by any other means.
Section 279
The court shall examine the application in a public hearing.
The hearing shall take place in the presence of the prison governor or the head of the respective regional or district service for the execution of sentences, the [applicant], and his or her representative. Failure by the governor or the applicant’s representative to appear without good cause does not prevent the examination of the case. The case is examined in the [applicant’s] absence if he or she expresses a wish not to attend or his or her presence is impossible for health-related or other good reasons.
Section 280
The court shall rule in a decision within the time-limit set out in section 278(1).
In its decision, the court may:
Section 281
The decision may be challenged within three days of its delivery before a three-member panel of the same court.
The challenge shall be examined in the manner laid down in Chapter 13 of the Code of Administrative Procedure [which deals with interlocutory appeals] and shall not stay enforcement of the decision.
Section 282
The decision shall be enforced in the manner laid down in Chapter 17 of the Code of Administrative Procedure.
Section 283
All matters not dealt with in this Chapter shall be governed by the provisions set out in Chapter 15, Part I of the Code of Administrative Procedure.”
In a number of decisions adopted since the introduction of these provisions, the administrative courts have upheld applications for injunctions by inmates and ordered the prison authorities, for example, to immediately send an inmate to an external hospital for surgery and treatment, to ascertain within ten days whether the necessary dental treatment could be provided in the prison or should be done elsewhere, and to put an end to situations such as (i) keeping a (life) prisoner handcuffed to his hospital bed without a prior individual risk assessment, (ii) having insufficient living space in cells, (iii) exposure to passive smoking in shared cells, and (iv) a lack of timely and adequate medical care. In those cases, the domestic courts found that the prisoners’ rights under section 3 of the 2009 Act had been breached (see разпореждане № 2361 от 18.06.2018г. по адм. д. № 508/2018 на адм. съд Плевен; разпореждане № 661 от 26.07.2018г. по адм. д. № 394/2018 на адм. съд Враца; разпореждане № 3178 от 18.05.2018г. по адм. д. № 1331/2018 на адм. съд Пловдив; разпореждане № 4281 от 26.6.2017г. по адм. д. № 5079/2017 на адм. съд София; разпореждане № 5857 от 24.8.2017г. по адм. д. № 4817/2017 на адм. съд София; определение № 2740 от 27.4.2018г. по адм. д. № 4445/2018 на адм. съд София; разпореждане № 3303 от 28.5.2018г. по адм. д. № 4433/2018 на адм. съд София).
In other decisions the court, ruling in cassation, ordered the lower court to examine on the merits a request by an inmate to have the prison governor determine a rota for using the bathroom in order to prevent conflict and violence between inmates (определение № 2542 от 9.2.2018г. по к. ч. адм. д. № 379/2018 на адм. съд Варна) and refused a request by a life prisoner serving his sentence under the “severe regime” to be detained separately from life prisoners serving their sentence under the “special regime” (see определение № 518 от 8.2.2018г. по к. адм. н. д. № 44/2018 на адм. съд Варна).
In other decisions, the administrative courts, after examining in detail the merits of applications for injunctions concerning the provision of specific medical procedures, living space, and the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables in prison, refused the applications on the grounds that the information collected demonstrated that they were without merit (see разпореждане № 1022 от 31.05.2018г. по адм. д. № 496/2018 на адм. съд Пазарджик; разпореждане № 1755 от 30.01.2018г. по адм. д. № 159/2018 на адм. съд Варна; разпореждане № 715 от 9.08.2018г. по адм. д. № 423/2018 на адм. съд Враца; разпореждане № 4608 от 13.07.2018г. по адм. д. № 1892/2018 на адм. съд Пловдив).
In a decision concerning a request under section 276 of the 2009 Act by a (non-life) prisoner serving his sentence under the “special regime” to be allowed to leave his cell three times a day to walk in the corridor for thirty minutes each time, the court dismissed the request for the following reasons. The prisoner had not shown that he had approached the prison administration with his request prior to bringing his case to court. In addition, the request could not be granted because of the characteristics of the “special regime” under which he was serving his sentence, which required cells to remain permanently locked and security to be high, and which did not include the possibility to walk in the corridor. Finally, allowing the prisoner to leave his cell would be wrong because of the numerous disciplinary offences which he had committed, most of which had been violence-related. The court added that, in any event, the prisoner had the ability to do regular physical exercise twice a day (see разпореждане № 2135 от 8.05.2018г. по адм. д. № 972/2018 на адм. съд Бургас).
Chapter 17 of the Code of Administrative Procedure governs, among other things, the enforcement of obligations incumbent upon the administrative authorities. Article 290 deals with the enforcement of the duty of officials to carry out non-substitutable actions due under, inter alia, judicial decisions. If the relevant official culpably fails to comply with a decision requiring action to be taken, he or she can be fined between 50 and 1,200 Bulgarian levs per week until he or she carries it out (Article 290 § 1). Each failure to comply with a decision requiring inaction may result in a fine in the same range (Article 290 § 2). The fines are imposed by the competent enforcement authority, which in such cases is the bailiff’s office (Article 290 § 3 read in conjunction with Article 271 § 1 (2)).
As set out in the Court’s decision in the case of Atanasov and Apostolov (cited above, §§ 26-28), the new sections 284 to 286 of the 2009 Act, which came into force on 7 February 2017, put in place a dedicated compensatory remedy with respect to conditions of detention. Those provisions read as follows:
Section 284
“1.  The State shall be liable for any damage caused to convicted prisoners or pretrial detainees by the authorities [responsible] for the execution of sentences as a result of breaches of section 3.
In cases under section 3(2), the court shall take into account the cumulative effect of the conditions in which the person concerned has served the sentence of imprisonment or has been subjected to the pre-trial detention measure, their duration, as well as other circumstances which may be of relevance for correctly disposing of the case.
The court shall require the authorities [responsible] for the execution of sentences to provide information of relevance for correctly disposing of the case. If they do not comply with that obligation, the court may regard the respective facts as proven.
The court may of its own motion call officials from the respective penal establishment, or any other person whose testimony might shed light on the facts of the case.
In cases under subsection 1, non-pecuniary damage shall be presumed until proved otherwise.
Section 285
Claims under section 284(1) shall be examined in the manner laid down in Chapter 11 of the Code of Administrative Procedure [which governs the procedure applicable to claims for damages against the administrative authorities].
Claims shall be brought in the administrative court competent with respect to the place where the damage occurred or the current address of the aggrieved person, [and] against the authorities under section 284(1) whose decisions, actions or omissions have caused the damage.
Claims under this part shall be subject to a simple [court] fee in the amount set out in the tariff under Article 73 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Court costs and enforcement costs need not be deposited in advance.
Section 286
“1.  All cases under this part shall be examined with the participation of a public prosecutor.
If it dismisses the claim in its entirety, the court shall order the claimant to bear the costs of the proceedings. Costs will also be borne by the claimant if he or she fully withdraws the claim or fully renounces it.
If it allows the claim in whole or in part, the court shall order the defendant to bear the costs of the proceedings and reimburse the claimant for the [court] fee paid by him or her. The court shall order the defendant to pay the claimant the fees of his or her counsel, if he or she had any, in proportion to the part of the claim which has been allowed.”
In a number of decisions adopted since the introduction of these provisions, the administrative courts have allowed requests for compensation by inmates in relation to past breaches of section 3 of the 2009 Act as a result of inadequate conditions of detention, including a lack of sufficient physical activity (see решение № 497 от 23.07.2018г. по адм. д. № 814/2017 на адм. съд Плевен; решение № 1563 от 3.08.2018г. по адм. д. № 3469/2017 на адм. съд Бургас; решение № 1815 от 10.08.2018г. по адм. д. № 3729/2017 на адм. съд Пловдив; решение № 206 от 17.07.2018г. по адм. д. № 203/2018 на адм. съд Стара Загора; решение № 232 от 2.08.2018г. по адм. д. № 81/2017 на адм. съд Стара Загора; решение № 300 от 31.07.2018г. по адм. д. № 264/2018 на адм. съд Враца; решение № 302 от 31.07.2018г. по адм. д. № 257/2018 на адм. съд Враца; решение № 1548 от 27.07.2018г. по адм. д. № 463/2018 на адм. съд Бургас; решение № 585 от 24.07.2018г. по адм. д. № 480/2018 на адм. съд Хасково; решение № 223 от 24.07.2018г. по адм. д. № 21/2018 на адм. съд Стара Загора).
As regards the calculation of the limitation period applicable to such situations, the courts have held that the five-year general limitation period for tort under Bulgarian law starts to run from the moment when the situation complained of (inadequate conditions of detention) comes to an end (see, among other authorities, тълкувателно решение № 3 от 22.04.2005г. по тълк. д. № 3/2004 на ОСГК на Върховен Касационен Съд). Thus, in situations where inmates have been freed after serving their sentence, the five-year period starts to run from their release (решение № 1563 от 3.08.2018г. по адм. д. № 3469/2017 на адм. съд Бургас).
As regards how far back prisoners can retrospectively claim damages for poor detention conditions under the new remedy, the courts have varied in their findings: some, appearing to consider inadequate conditions of detention as a continuing situation, examined them irrespective of their duration or whether they concerned periods dating back more than five years (see решение № 206 от 17.07.2018г. по адм. д. № 203/2018 на адм. съд Стара Загора; решение № 1815 от 10.08.2018г. по адм. д. № 3729/2017 на адм. съд Пловдив; решение № 2135 от 7.11.2018г. по адм. д. № 909/2018 на адм. съд Варна), while another court held that compensation claims were only admissible for the five years preceding the date of bringing the claim (решение № 1667 от 6.08.2018г. по адм. д. № 2924/2015 на адм. съд Варна).
The domestic courts have also delivered reasoned decisions not to award compensation following a detailed examination and finding that the alleged circumstances at the origin of the claim were not proven (see решение № 175 от 6.08.2018г. по адм. д. № 113/2018 на адм. съд Кюстендил; решение № 1019 от 14.05.2018г. по адм. д. № 113/2018 на адм. съд Варна; решение № 176 от 7.08.2018г. по адм. д. № 128/2018 на адм. съд Кюстендил; решение № 120 от 3.08.2018г. по адм. д. № 92/2018 на адм. съд Габрово).
Paragraph 49 of the amending Act’s transitional and concluding provisions, which prescribes the manner in which already pending claims for damages in relation to poor conditions of detention – which were previously examined under section 1(1) of the SMLDA – are to be examined following the introduction of the new compensatory remedy, reads:
“Claims in relation to damage caused to convicted prisoners or pre-trial detainees as a result of detention in poor conditions lodged before this Act entered into force shall be examined in the manner laid down in section 284(1).”
