The case originated in twenty-seven applications against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on the various dates set out in the table appended to the judgment which was delivered on 8 March 2018.
The Court held in that judgment that there had been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of inadequate conditions of detention. The Court also decided to award the applicants non-pecuniary damage in the amounts set out in the table appended to the judgment.
On 15 May 2018 the Government informed the Court that they had learned that Mr Cătălin Vasile Brumă, the applicant in application no. 32843/14, had died on 28 June 2016. They accordingly requested that the judgment be revised within the meaning of Rule 80 of the Rules of Court.
On 12 June 2018 the Court considered the revision request and decided to give Mr Brumă’s potential heirs six weeks to submit any observations. No observations were received.
