The case originated in an application (no. 57502/12) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Dmitriy Borisovich Bogomolov (“the applicant”), on 17 August 2012.
The applicant was represented by Ms Y. Gazizova, a lawyer practising in Naberezhnyye Chelny in the Republic of Tatarstan. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 21 December 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1976 and lived in Solnechnogorsk of the Moscow Region prior to his arrest.
Between 30 June 2011 and 13 June 2012 the applicant was held in remand prison IZ-50/3 in the Moscow Region in connection with the criminal proceedings against him. The prison was overcrowded. Thus, cell 29 measuring 30 sq. m was equipped with 10 sleeping places and accommodated up to 15 inmates. In support of his allegations, the applicant submitted statements by two cellmates and a plan of the cell he had drawn up.
On 9 December 2011 the Balashikha Town Court of the Moscow Region found the applicant guilty of drug-related offences and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment.
On 16 December 2011 the applicant lodged a preliminary statement of appeal. The full statement was introduced on 29 December 2011 and contained the following paragraph:
“I request that the appeal complaint be examined in my absence”.
On 21 February 2012 the Moscow Regional Court held an appeal hearing and upheld the conviction. The applicant was absent from the hearing, but his counsel was present and made oral submissions.
