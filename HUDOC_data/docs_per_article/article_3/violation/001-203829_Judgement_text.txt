The case originated in three applications against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on the various dates indicated in the appended table.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr M. Galperin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
Notice of the applications was given to the Government.
The Government did not object to the examination of the applications by a Committee.
Mr Shishkin and Mr Kramchaninov are Russian nationals. Mr Martyshev is an Uzbek national.
Between 2006 and 2012, the applicants were arrested on suspicion of having committed crimes in different regions of Russia. They alleged, among other things, that they had been ill-treated by the police. The criminal proceedings opened into the ill-treatment of Mr Kramchaninov and Mr Martyshev resulted in the convictions of perpetrators.
On 2 March 2006 officers of the Department of the Interior in the Kstovskiy District of the Nizhegoroskiy Region searched the applicant’s flat. On the same day the applicant and his sister, Ms O., went to the Department to enquire about the items seized during the search. According to the applicant, the officers took him to an office and ill-treated him, forcing to confess to a crime. They tied his legs, handcuffed him, kicked and punched him on the body and in the chest, and threatened to kill him. The ill-treatment lasted for about four hours. The applicant signed the confession and was then released.
On the following day the applicant went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with a contusion of the lumbar area and right kidney, and a hematoma of the left eye. The applicant explained to a doctor that he had been beaten by the police officers. The hospital staff informed the police about the origins of the applicant’s injuries.
On 16 March 2006 an investigator decided not to open a criminal case. On 18 March 2006 the decision was quashed as incomplete by a superior authority.
Between April 2006 and June 2007 the investigators issued ten decisions, including the decision of 22 June 2007, the latest at the time, refusing to open a criminal case for the absence of evidence of a crime. The decisions were mainly based on the explanations of the police officers, denying the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment. They were all quashed as incomplete.
On 5 June 2007 the applicant underwent a forensic medical examination. According to report no. 433, the applicant’s injuries recorded at the hospital on 3 March 2006 could have resulted from blows by hands and legs between one and three days before the examination at the hospital.
On 21 December 2007 the applicant challenged the refusal of 22 June 2007 at the Kstovskiy District Court.
Meanwhile, on 23 April 2008 the Kstovskiy District Court convicted the applicant and dismissed his allegations of ill-treatment as unfounded.
On 18 February 2008 the Kstovskiy District Court granted the applicant’s complaint against the refusal. It found that the investigator had failed to explain why he had relied on the explanations of the police officers and dismissed the explanations of witnesses supporting the applicant’s version of the events, including the explanations of Ms O., and that the investigator had not assessed the conclusions of the applicant’s forensic examination.
On 9 December 2008 the investigator again refused to open a criminal case for the absence of evidence of a crime.
On 19 January 2010 the Kstovskiy District Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint about the refusal, referring to his conviction of 23 April 2008.
On 23 April 2010 the Nizhegorodskiy Regional Court quashed the court decision of 19 January 2010. It found that the trial court had addressed the issue of admissibility of his confession statements as evidence in the case, but not his allegations of ill-treatment. It also noted that the investigator had failed to correct deficiencies which the court had indicated in its decision of 18 February 2008. The Regional Court remitted the case to the first instance court for a new examination.
On 16 June 2010 the Kstovskiy District Court granted the applicant’s complaint, referring to its own decision of 18 February 2008.
On 1 October 2010 the investigator issued the latest refusal to open a criminal case. The decision was quashed. Further outcome is unclear.
On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a civil claim against the Russian Ministry of Finance. The applicant complained about the investigators’ inactivity and procrastination in his case. He claimed compensation of 500,000 Russian roubles (RUB) (about 6,944 euros (EUR)).
On 3 December 2014 the Nizhegorodskiy District Court partially granted his claim. The court found that the investigators had failed to take all the necessary measures to investigate the case. It noted that the latest decision of 1 October 2010 not to open a criminal case had been eventually quashed as incomplete. The court decided that the amount of RUB 10,000 (about EUR 140) would constitute sufficient compensation for the applicant’s grievances.
On 21 April 2015 the Nizhegorodskiy Regional Court upheld the court decision on appeal.
On 15 July 2010 police officers of the Shakhunskiy Department of the Interior of the Nizhegorodskiy Region arrived to the applicant’s home and invited him to the police station. The applicant followed. According to the applicant, at the station the officers punched him in his face, chest and kidney area, forcing him to confess to a crime. They squeezed his little finger with pliers, put a gas mask on him and forced him to squat. They also punctured his neck with a needle. The applicant was released after he had confessed.
On 15 July 2010 the applicant went to a hospital where he stayed until 2 August 2010. He was diagnosed with a craniocerebral injury.
On 16 July 2010 the applicant underwent a forensic medical examination. According to report no. 198, he had a closed craniocerebral injury, brain concussion, bruises on his left eye, right temple, back of his head, a punctured wound to his neck, and bruises on his left little finger.
On 16 July 2010 the applicant complained to an investigator about the ill-treatment.
Between August 2010 and March 2016 the investigators issued at least nine decisions refusing to open a criminal case for the lack of evidence of crime.
On 29 May 2017 a criminal case against police officer T. was opened under Article 286 § 3 (a) of the Criminal Code (the CC) for abuse of power with the use of violence. The applicant was granted victim status.
On 17 January 2018 the Shakhunskiy District Court convicted police officer T. The court found, among other things, that with a view to extracting a confession, officer T. had kicked and punched the applicant causing a brain concussion, put a gas mask on him, squeezed his little finger with pliers, forced him to squat, and punctured his neck with a needle. It sentenced T. to a suspended sentence of four years and banned him from working in lawenforcement bodies for two years and six months. The court considered that it was possible to commute the sentence given the defendant’s excellent police service and positive references from his superiors, the absence of previous criminal or administrative records, and due to him having a minor child. On 30 January 2018 the conviction became final.
On 25 October 2016 the applicant lodged a civil claim against the Investigation Committee and the Ministry of Finance, seeking to obtain compensation of non-pecuniary damage caused by the ill-treatment. He claimed in total RUB 570,000 (about EUR 7,917).
On 16 August 2017 the Nizhegorodskiy District Court partially granted the applicant’s claim awarding RUB 30,000 (about EUR 417). On 13 February 2018 the Nizhegorodskiy Regional Court upheld the decision on appeal.
On 12 February 2019 the applicant appealed against the court decision of 16 August 2017 and the appellate court decision of 13 February 2018 to the Nizhegorodskiy Regional Court on points of law. Further outcome is unclear.
On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a civil claim against the Ministry of Internal Affairs for compensation of non-pecuniary damages of RUB 700,000 (about EUR 9,722).
On 31 May 2018 the Shakhunskiy District Court partially granted the applicant’s claim awarding RUB 350,000 (about EUR 4,860).
The Ministry of Internal Affairs appealed against the court decision. On 5 February 2019 the Nizhegorodskiy Regional Court upheld the decision of 31 May 2018 on appeal.
On 9 March 2012 at around 2 p.m. police officers of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Voronezh Region (Управление уголовного розыска ГУ МВД России по Воронежской области) arrested the applicant and took him to the police department.
According to the applicant, officers M. and K. applied electric shocks to his fingers, kicked and punched him, stepped on his head and on the back of his knees, forcing him to confess. The ill-treatment lasted until 1 a.m. on 10 March 2012.
On 10 March 2012 at around 2.30 a.m. the applicant was taken to a hospital where he stayed until 19 March. He was diagnosed with a liver rupture, intra-abdominal haemorrhage, and a fracture of the fourth to seventh right ribs and multiple bruises on his body.
Between 22 and 28 March 2012 the applicant underwent a forensic examination. According to report no. 308.12, the applicant had multiple surface injuries to his fingers which did not exclude the impact of electric shock. The liver rupture was qualified as serious harm to health. The ribs fracture was qualified as significant harm to health.
On 8 July 2013 the Head of the Department of Migration (УФМС России по Воронежской области) ordered the applicant’s expulsion to Uzbekistan and a ban to enter Russia until 22 October 2015. On 12 December 2013 the applicant left Russia.
On 22 March 2012 a criminal case was opened against police officer M. The applicant was given victim status. Officer M. was charged, among other things, with the infliction to the applicant of serious and lifethreatening injuries (liver rupture) and abuse of power with the use of violence under Article 111 § 3 (a) and Article 286 § 3 (a) (b) of the CC. He was also charged with other crimes in respect of several other victims.
On 15 July 2014 the Buturlinovskiy District Court convicted police officer M. as charged. As to the applicant’s ill-treatment, the court relied on the applicant’s statements given as a victim during the investigation since he could not be questioned in trial due to his expulsion from Russia. According to his statements, officers M. and K. had arrested him and took him to the police department where he had been ill-treated. The conviction judgment also cited witness statements given at the trial by officer K. that officer M. had hit the applicant several times in the car on the way to the police department. The court sentenced officer M. to two years and six months of imprisonment in a colony of strict regime.
On 17 November 2014 the Voronezh Regional Court quashed the conviction of officer M. in part concerning the applicant’s ill-treatment and remitted the case for a new examination. The court found that the authorities had failed to verify whether the applicant had in fact left Russia and to ensure his presence in trial in order to confirm his statements given during the investigation. It changed M.’s sentence to be served in a colony of general regime.
On an unspecified date the prosecutor dropped charges under Article 111 § 3 (a) against M. for the infliction of liver rupture for the lack of evidence that it had been M. who had inflicted it to the applicant.
On 30 November 2015 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court convicted officer M. under Article 286 § 3 (a) (b) of the CC for abuse of power with the use of violence. It relied on witness statements of officer K. and the applicant’s statement given during the investigation. The court also heard other police officers who had been on-duty at the police department on 9 March 2012. They submitted that no violence had been applied to the applicant at the department and that he had been taken to the hospital in view of his bad state of health. The court concluded that, following the applicant’s arrest, M. had handcuffed the applicant and had inflicted at least two blows in his chest in the car on the way to the police station.
By a separate decision of 30 November 2015 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court terminated criminal proceedings against M. under Article 111 § 3 (a). It found that following the applicant’s arrest, M. and an unidentified person had inflicted several blows in his chest, stomach, and subjected him to electric shocks at the police station. The court further noted that, as a result of the joint actions of officer M. and an unidentified person, the applicant had sustained liver rupture and multiple bruises on the body. It was unable to conclude definitively that the liver rupture had been caused by officer M.
On 31 December 2015 the applicant appealed against the judgment and the decision on the termination of the criminal proceedings of 30 November 2015.
In the appeal against the judgment, the applicant argued that the sentence was disproportionate to the gravity of charges. In the appeal against the termination of the proceedings, he argued that there were no grounds to terminate the proceedings under Article 111 § 3 (a) since the charges of infliction of liver rupture were based on the same set of facts and evidence as the charges of infliction of other injuries, and apart from officers M. and K., there had been no other officers who had ill-treated him.
By two separate decisions both dated 18 April 2016, the Voronezh Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeals against the judgment and the court decision of 30 November 2015.
Regarding the judgment, the appellate court found that the sentence was adequate to the charges. As to the termination of the criminal proceedings, the court found that there was no evidence that the applicant’s liver rupture had been inflicted by officer M.
