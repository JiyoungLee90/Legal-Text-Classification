The case originated in an application (no. 62553/15) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Roman Aleksandrovich Tretyakov (“the applicant”), on 28 November 2015.
The application was communicated to the Russian Government (“the Government”).
The relevant details of the application are set out in the appended table.
The applicant complained of the inadequate conditions of his detention in two detention facilities in St Petersburg during two separate periods: in facility no. IZ-1 from 10 May 2011 to 25 April 2012 and in facility no. IZ-4 from 25 April 2012 to 24 June 2015.
The Government submitted a declaration with a view to resolving the issues raised by the application. In particular, they acknowledged that the conditions of the applicant’s detention in facility no. IZ-1 in St Petersburg from 10 May 2011 to 25 April 2011 violated his right guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention. They offered to pay the applicant 4,935 euros and invited the Court to strike the application out of the list of cases in accordance with Article 37 § 1 (c) of the Convention. The amount would be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable on the date of payment, and would be payable within three months from the date of notification of the Court’s decision. In the event of failure to pay that amount within the above-mentioned three-month period, the Government undertook to pay simple interest on it, from the expiry of that period until settlement, at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points. The Government did not comment on the applicant’s complaint about the conditions of his detention in facility no. IZ-4 from 25 April 2012 to 24 June 2015.
The applicant informed the Court that he agreed to the terms of the declaration.
