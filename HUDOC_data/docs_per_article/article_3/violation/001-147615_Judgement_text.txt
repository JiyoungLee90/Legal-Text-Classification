The case originated in an application (no. 6687/10) against the Republic of Slovenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Anže Faganel (“the applicant”), on 18 December 2009.
The applicant was represented by Odvetniška Družba Matoz O.P. D.O.O., a law office practicing in Koper. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs N. Pintar Gosenca, State Attorney.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the conditions of his detention in the remand section of Ljubljana prison amounted to a violation of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention, and that he had no effective remedy in this regard as required by Article 13 of the Convention.
On 14 November 2013 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Ljubljana.
The applicant was detained in the closed section of Ljubljana prison from 5 May 2009 to 26 May 2009, in the remand section from 25 August 2009 to 11 February 2010, from 11 March 2011 to 22 March 2011 and from 8 June 2011 to 11 January 2012 and again in the closed section from 24 August 2012 to 4 December 2012.
On 25 August 2009 he was held in cell 90 measuring 18.07 square metres (not including a separate 1.75 square metre sanitary facility), shared with four other detainees and with 3.2 square metres of personal space. From 26 August 2009 to 11 February 2010 he was held in cell 50 measuring 8.07 square metres (not including a separate 1.23 square metre sanitary facility) and cell 52 measuring 8.04 square metres (not including a separate 1.25 square metre sanitary facility), alone with almost 7 square metres of personal space or with another detainee with 3.4 square metres of personal space.
The cell for two detainees, where the applicant was held in the remand section, contained one bunk bed, one bigger and one smaller table, two chairs, two wardrobes and two 89 x 54 cm windows, which detainees could freely open or close.
As regards the general characteristics of the cells in the remand section of Ljubljana prison, material conditions inside the cells and sanitary conditions, see the judgment in Mandić and Jović v. Slovenia, nos. 5774/10 and 5985/10, §§ 10 to 23, 20 October 2011.
As to the out-of-cell time in the remand section, the Court found in the aforementioned judgment that detainees in the remand section were confined to their cells day and night, save for two hours of daily outdoor exercise, and an additional two hours per week in a recreation room (Mandić and Jović, cited above, § 78). The Government stated that from 9 February 2011 on detainees could spend three hours per day outdoors.
On 18 December 2009 the applicant lodged the application complaining about the prison conditions of his detention from 25 August 2009. In the supplement to his application of 17 September 2013, he complained also about the conditions of his detention from 5 May 2009 to 26 May 2009, from 11 March 2011 to 22 March 2011, from 8 June 2011 to 11 January 2012 and from 24 August 2012 to 4 December 2012.
