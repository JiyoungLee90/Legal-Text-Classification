The case originated in five applications against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on the various dates indicated in the appended table.
Notice of the applications was given to the Russian Government (“the Government”).
The Government did not object to the examination of the applications by a Committee.
The applicants are Russian nationals who, at the material time, lived in Chechnya, Ingushetia or Dagestan. Their personal details are set out in the appended table. They are close relatives of individuals who disappeared after allegedly having been unlawfully detained by service personnel during special operations. The events concerned took place in areas under the full control of the Russian federal forces. The applicants have not seen their missing relatives since the alleged arrests. Their whereabouts remain unknown.
The applicants reported the abductions to lawenforcement bodies, and official investigations were opened. The proceedings were repeatedly suspended and resumed, and have remained pending for several years without any tangible results having been achieved. The applicants lodged requests with the investigating authorities and various law-enforcement bodies for information and assistance in the search for their relatives. Their requests received either only formulaic responses or none at all. The perpetrators have not been established by the investigating bodies.
Summaries of the facts in respect of each application are set out below. Each account is based on statements provided by the applicants and their relatives and/or other witnesses to both the Court and the domestic investigating authorities. The Government did not dispute the facts of the case, as presented by the applicants and submitted only preliminary objections as to the admissibility of the applications.
The applicant is the mother of Mr Salikh Saidov who was born in 1979.
In January 2005 the applicant’s son-in-law, Mr Shamil D., was killed during a special operation carried out by the State authorities in Kizil-Yurt, Dagestan. In October 2005 the applicant’s son, Mr Rustam S., also was killed during a special operation carried out in Makhachkala, Dagestan. The applicant’s other son, Mr Abdurakhman S., and daughter, Ms Sakinat S., (the wife of Mr Shamil D.) were suspected by the authorities of involvement in illegal armed groups. In 2005 the applicant asked the authorities to institute proceedings into abuse of power and other alleged illegal actions taken by the law-enforcement authorities against her son, Abdurakhman S., and her daughter, Sakinat S. Her requests were dismissed in 2006.
In 2004 Mr Salikh Saidov moved to Moscow. In July 2005 three friends of Mr Saidov from Dagestan informed the applicant that they had been arrested with her son Salikh in Moscow. They were released, whereas her son remained under arrest. The applicant found out that following a request by an investigator, Mr E.A., from the Dagestan prosecutor’s office, on 17 July 2005 Mr Saidov had been arrested by the police in Moscow and taken for questioning to Makhachkala by aeroplane. According to the applicant, in Makhachkala her son was held for three days in the police station where the Organised Crime Unit was based and then transferred to police operational-search bureau no. 2 (ORB-2) in Grozny, Chechnya. Since his detention in July 2005 Mr Saidov has been missing.
On 18 July 2006 in reply to the applicant’s request, Investigator E.A. informed the applicant’s lawyer that no criminal case had been opened against Mr Saidov and that he had not been either arrested or detained by the Dagestan police.
On 30 August 2006 the deputy prosecutor of Dagestan informed the applicant that on 14 July 2005 a decision to question Mr Saidov had been taken and a request for its execution forwarded to Moscow. However, that request remained unexecuted. At the same time, in his letter of 3 April 2006 Mr V.K, the head of the Department of Organised Crime of the Eastern Administrative Circuit in Moscow, and Mr V.R., the deputy head of the Internal Security Department of the Russian Ministry of the Interior, in their letter of 18 July 2006, both admitted that the applicant’s son had been detained in Moscow on 17 July 2005 following a request by an investigator from Dagestan to be questioned in criminal case no. 558754 opened by the Dagestan prosecutor’s office.
On 21 January 2006 the applicant requested information from various authorities concerning her son’s whereabouts. All her requests were forwarded to the investigators but to no avail.
On 27 July 2007 a local newspaper published an article on missing individuals; Mr Saidov was mentioned as one of them. The Dagestan prosecutor’s office forwarded this information to the investigators ordering them to take measures to investigate the allegations contained therein.
On 16 August 2007 the Sovetskiy district prosecutor’s office refused to open a criminal case into the abduction of Mr Saidov owing to the lack of corpus delicti. On 23 October 2007 the investigators’ superior annulled that decision.
On 2 November 2007 the investigators again refused to institute criminal proceedings under Article 286 of the Criminal Code (abuse of power) owing to the lack of corpus delicti. This decision was annulled on 23 April 2008 by the investigators’ superior and the material was sent back for additional enquiries.
On 28 April 2008 the applicant yet again asked the investigators in Dagestan and in Moscow to open a criminal case into her son’s disappearance.
On 29 April 2008 the Dagestan prosecutor’s office refused to open a criminal case for lack of corpus delicti.
On 29 May 2008 the refusal was annulled and the material was returned for additional enquiries. The applicant was informed.
On 9 June 2008 the Dagestan prosecutor’s office again refused to open a criminal case into the disappearance of Mr Saidov on the same grounds.
On 16 June 2008 the superior investigator annulled the refusal and instituted criminal proceedings (no. 802476) under Article 105 of the Criminal Code (murder). The applicant was informed.
On 24 June 2008 Investigator E.A. was questioned. He stated that in July 2005 criminal case no. 558754 had been opened into an assault on a police officer by Mr Rustam S. and two others. The investigators had decided to question Salikh Saidov about the whereabouts of his brother Rustam S. As Mr Saidov had left Dagestan for Moscow, on 14 July 2005 the investigator had ordered Mr Saidov’s arrest and subsequent transfer to Makhachkala for questioning by the police officers from T unit. Following a telephone conversation, a person named K. had confirmed to him that T unit had arrested Mr Saidov and had taken him to Makhachkala. However, neither he nor any other investigators had ever seen or questioned Mr Saidov.
On 4 July 2008 the applicant was questioned. She stated that she had heard from a man who had been arrested with Mr Saidov, that her son Salikh had been detained in Khankala, Chechnya. In 2006 she had received the same information from a lawyer, Ma., based in Grozny. She had contacted Mr Ya., a local military commander, who had agreed to release Salikh Saidov in exchange for 300,000 Russian roubles (RUB). Subsequently, it had turned out that Salikh Saidov had been detained by Mr R.K. and had absconded from detention along with several Chechens.
On 4 July 2008 the transport police in Makhachkala informed the investigators that at 3 p.m. on 17 July 2005 Mr Saidov had left Moscow for Makhachkala by aeroplane.
On 10 August 2008 the supervising prosecutor criticised the investigation and pointed out a number of defects in the proceedings to be remedied. The documents submitted show that the orders were not complied with.
On 10 September 2008 Ma. was questioned. He stated that his client, Mr Ch.U., who had been detained in Khankala, had confirmed that a person, whose name he had not been able to remember, had been detained with him in the same cell.
On 12 September 2008 A.I., a lawyer, was questioned. He stated that he had requested information concerning the whereabouts of Salikh Saidov from the Chechnya Prosecutor’s Office, the commander of the Vostok military unit and the head of the Chechen Government, Mr R.K., but to no avail.
On 16 September 2008 the investigation was suspended and then resumed on 31 October 2008.
On 24 December 2008 the applicant was granted victim status in the criminal case and questioned. She stated that Mr Saidov had been among the individuals detained in Khankala, but refused to disclose the source of information.
On 31 December 2008 the investigation was suspended again.
On 30 August 2009 the investigators’ superior annulled that decision and resumed the proceedings.
In September 2009 the investigators sent a number of requests to various law-enforcement authorities asking to question Mr Ch.U.
On 30 September 2009 the investigation was suspended again. The applicant was informed thereof.
On 11 November 2009 Mr Ch.U. was questioned in the correctional colony where he was serving his sentence. He stated that between 14 September and 10 October 2005 he had been detained in ORB-2 in Grozny. He had been in the same cell with Mr Saidov, who had later been moved to another cell. He then had been transferred to SIZO 20/1 (remand prison) whereas Mr Saidov had stayed in ORB-2. He had informed his lawyer about Mr Saidov and had asked to contact his relatives. Later he had learned from other detainees of ORB-2 that at around 11 p.m. on 10 October 2005 Mr Saidov had been blindfolded and taken to an unknown destination by prison officers of ORB-2.
On 4 February 2010 the investigation was resumed, then suspended and then resumed again on 27 March 2010. The applicant was informed of those decisions.
On 29 March 2010 the investigators examined the journals of registration of remand prison SIZO 20/1 and ORB-2 in Grozny. No information on Mr Saidov was obtained.
On 30 March 2010 officer S.A. from ORB-2 was questioned. He stated that he had never seen or heard of either Mr Saidov or Mr Ch.U. He further stated that individuals who were arrested by the police were not usually taken to ORB-2.
On the same day the lawyer Ma. was questioned. He reaffirmed his previous statements.
On 31 March 2010 another officer from ORB-2, Mr D.M., was questioned. He did not provide any relevant information.
On 27 March 2010 the investigators’ superior criticised the investigation and pointed out a number of defects in the proceedings to be remedied, but to no avail.
On 9 April 2010 Mr A.B., a former officer of the T police unit was questioned. He stated that following an order of the Dagestan prosecutor’s office he had arrested Mr Saidov in Moscow and transferred him to P. and T., officers of the special police unit. The latter then had taken Mr Saidov to Makhachkala. On arrival at Makhachkala Airport they had left Mr Saidov with the Dagestan police officers. No transfer document had been signed, given that Mr Saidov had had the status of a witness only.
On 12 April 2010 Mr Ch.U. was questioned again and reiterated his earlier statements. On the same day the investigators conducted photoidentification and Mr Ch.U. identified Mr Saidov as his cellmate in ORB-2.
The investigators requested from the police information on the whereabouts of P. and T., officers of the special unit, but to no avail.
On 20 April 2010 Mr A.B. was questioned again. In addition to his earlier statements he stated that Officers P. and T. could have been transferred to the Centre for Control of Special Units of the Ministry of the Interior (Центр по регулированию деятельности специальных подразделений МВД РФ). He further stated that he had seen them for the last time in 2007 or 2008 in the investigator’s office in Moscow, where they had been asked to give statements concerning Salikh Saidov.
On 28 April 2010 Officer T. was questioned and denied knowing either Mr A.B. or Officer P. He did not recognise Salikh Saidov by photograph either. According to his statements, on 17 July 2005 he had arrived in Makhachkala alone for a holiday. He further stated that at the material time he had been a student of the Police Academy and could not have been on a mission. In any event, if the aforementioned people had happened to be on the same flight with him, it must have been a coincidence.
From the documents submitted to the Court it transpires that Officer T. started his service as the police officer in 2006.
On 6 May 2010 the applicant was questioned again. She stated that another man had been in the same detention centre with Mr Saidov. The applicant, however, told the investigators that she would disclose her source of information only if the case were transferred to the Southern Federal Circuit investigators.
On the same day the applicant’s daughter was questioned. No new information was obtained.
On 20 April 2010 the head of the police of the Southern Federal Circuit informed the investigators that between 17 July and 31 December 2005 Mr Saidov had not been detained in ORB-2. From the documents submitted it transpires that the applicant’s son never officially registered as a detainee of the detention centre.
On 14 May 2010 the applicant’s representative requested that the investigators transfer the case to the Main Investigations Department of the Investigative Committee of Russia on the grounds that the investigators were partial and had not been able to remedy deficiencies in the proceedings. No reply followed.
On 1 and 19 June 2010 a number of witnesses were questioned. No new information was obtained.
On 27 June 2010 the investigation was suspended and then resumed on 27 July 2010. The applicant was informed.
Meanwhile, on 8 July 2010 the head of the Rys special task force unit of the Ministry of the Interior (Отряд милиции специального назначения “Рысь” МВД РФ), Mr E., informed the investigators that Officer P., who had allegedly taken Mr Saidov to Makhachkala, had been questioned. However, a copy of his statement was not furnished to the Court.
On 11 August 2010 the investigation transferred to the Chechen Investigative Committee.
On 27 August 2010 the investigators suspended the proceedings, resumed and then suspended them again on 17 June 2011. It appears that the investigation is still pending.
The applicant is the brother of Mr Kazbek Machigov, who was born in 1974.
On 29 September 2000 Mr Kazbek Machigov was arrested on his way to the Central Market in Grozny by three officers, Mr A.S., Mr A.G. and Mr V.S., on suspicion of alleged drug use. He was taken in their UAZ vehicle to Oktyabrskiy district police station in Grozny. He has been missing since.
For relevant information on disappearance of individuals after their detention in that police station, see also Magomadov and Magomadov v. Russia, (no. 68004/01, § 76, 12 July 2007).

On 22 January 2009, the applicant appealed against the suspension of the investigation in case no. 61878. He subsequently complained to the human-rights defender of the Chechen Republic of the shortcomings in the investigation and asked for assistance in the search for his brother. This request was forwarded to the investigators.
On 10 February 2009 the investigation was resumed and then suspended again on 24 May 2009 for failure to identify the perpetrators. The proceedings are still pending.

On 21 August 2003 the three cousins went to the Sunzhenskiy District Hospital in Ingushetia, where Mr Idigov was to have a wound bandaged. At about 2 p.m. two GAZelle minivans arrived at the hospital. A group of about fifteen to twenty armed men in camouflage uniforms and balaclavas shouted to those present to get on the ground. They kept shooting in the air and running around, looking for someone. Six of the armed men ran into the surgical unit, where they beat unconscious Mr R.S., who was having a wound dressed, and Mr Shaipov, who was there with him, breaking Mr Shaipov’s arm. Then they forced Mr R.S. and Mr Shaipov into one of their vehicles.
Meanwhile, Mr Idigov saw the armed men beating Mr R.S. and Mr Shaipov. He tried to escape from the skirmish through the courtyard, but was shot in the shoulder. Mr Patsuyev and Mr Kerimov wanted to help Mr Idigov, but were beaten by the armed men. Then all three of them were forced into the white GAZelle minivan, which had a registration number containing digits A-63 and region 95.
According to eyewitnesses, the armed men dragged several other men out of the hospital, and one of them was shot dead on the porch. After that the abductors drove off. At about 60 m from the hospital they pushed Kh., a surgeon whom they had forced into their vehicle along with other abducted individuals, out of the vehicle. The abductors drove next to the local police car; it had been responding to a call from the hospital’s security staff. The police officers did not take any steps to stop the abductors.

They cordoned off the village, carried out identity checks, searched houses and questioned local residents. They abducted the applicants’ relatives from their homes.
One of the officers told the first applicant that her son would be taken to the local office of the FSB for an identity check and released afterwards. After that the abducted individuals had been taken to the police station in Alleroy and then transferred to the police station in Khankala.
On 22 and 26 April 2002 the applicants complained to the Nozhay Yurt District Prosecutor’s office of the abductions and asked to assist them in the search for their missing relatives.

On 15 June 2002 the first applicant applied to the Special Representative of the Russian President on Human Rights in Chechnya for assistance in the search for her missing son. Her request was forwarded to local law-enforcement authorities.
On 20 June 2002, the Nozhay-Yurt district prosecutor’s office instituted criminal proceedings into the abduction of Mr Khamdula Gayrbekov (no. 71030), Mr Musa Adisov, (no. 71031) and Mr Ashab Aliyev (no. 71032) under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (abduction). Subsequently, on 18 July 2002 the prosecutor merged all three criminal cases under the joint number 71030.
In June and July 2002 the investigators sent several requests to the lawenforcement authorities concerning the whereabouts of the abducted men.
On 16 July 2002 the head of the Nozhay-Yurt district police, in reply to the prosecutor’s inquiry, stated that Mr Adisov, Mr Aliyev and Mr Gayrbekov had been taken to the premises of the joint special-force group (сводная специальная группа), to check their possible affiliation with illegal armed groups.

On 11 May 2004 the investigators joined criminal case no. 7130 (see paragraphs 139 and 154 above) to criminal case no. 36024.
On the same day the investigators requested the head of the military unit stationed in the Nozhay-Yurt district whether that unit had carried out the special operation on 12 April 2002 in Alleroy. In reply, the officer informed the investigators that joint special-force group SSG-6 (сводная специальная группа-6) along with the FSB and special police units had conducted a special operation in the Nozhay-Yurt district and set up a checkpoint in the Alleroy village. During the operation Mr Gayrbekov, Mr Adisov and Mr Ashab Aliyev had been arrested on suspicion of participation in illegal armed groups.

According to the witness, the operation had been supervised by the Nozhay-Yurt military commander.

Their requests were forwarded to the investigating authorities. In reply, the investigators informed the applicants of the progress in the investigation.

It appears that the criminal proceedings are still pending.
On 11 December 2013 and 13 February 2014 the Leninskiy District Court in Grozny allowed claims lodged by the applicants and awarded each of them RUB 1 million (about 13,000 euros) as compensation in respect of the non-pecuniary damage caused by the abduction of their relatives.
The applicant is the husband of Ms Serizha Dzhalilova, who was born in 1960.
Between 5 December 2004 and 6 January 2005 five people were arrested at the Yarag-Kazmalyar checkpoint in Derbent district in Dagestan on suspicion of involvement in illegal armed groups. The checkpoint was located about 50 km from another larger checkpoint called “Dagestan”, situated in Derbent, Dagestan.
On 6 January 2005, during her shopping trip to Azerbaijan Ms Dzhalilova was arrested at the Yarag-Kazmalyar checkpoint on the border between Dagestan and Azerbaijan. Her identity was checked as she was suspected of being a suicide bomber. It appears that shortly after her arrest at Yarag-Kazmalyar, she was taken to the Dagestan checkpoint and then, on the following day, to the FSB headquarters in Khankala in Chechnya (Оперативное управление ФСБ России по координации проведения конттеррористической операции н.п. Ханкала). It appears that her arrest at Yarag-Kazmalyar and subsequent placement in detention at the Dagestan checkpoint were carried out by officers from military unit no. 2087, Col. Ab., Lt. Col. R., Maj. Is. and Capt. B.
It appears that the FSB headquarters in Khankala was disbanded in July 2005. All the documents were destroyed. The FSB officers who arrested the applicant’s wife were never subjected to identification.
On 24 March 2005 the applicant asked the Derbent district prosecutor’s office to assist him with the search for his missing wife.
On 24 March 2006 the applicant asked the head of the Gudermes police to assist him with the search for his wife.
In July, October and November 2006 the ten officers who had been manning the Yarag-Kazmalyar and Dagestan checkpoints at the material time, including Col. Ab., Lt. Col. R., Maj. Is. and Capt. B., were interviewed. They stated that Ms Dzhalilova had been arrested following an FSB request. Another woman, Ms T., who had been accompanying Ms Dzhalilova, had been also arrested. The next day they had both had been transferred by Lt. Col. R. to the Dagestan checkpoint in Derbent. Subsequently, two FSB officers had arrived at the checkpoint in a GAZelle minivan and had taken Ms Dzhalilova away with them.
On 19 April 2007 the officers of the Yarag-Kazmalyar and Dagestan checkpoints were interviewed. They reiterated their earlier statements.
On 12 June 2007, following an application by the applicant, the Gudermes District Court declared Ms Dzhalilova a missing person.
On 6 December 2007 the applicant complained to the Russian President of Ms Dzhalilova’s abduction and asked for assistance in the search for his wife. In reply, he was informed that his complaint had been transferred to the Chief Military Prosecutor’s Office.
On 14 November 2007 Mr R. and Mr A.M., drivers from the FSB, were interviewed by the prosecutor of the Makhachkala Military Garrison. They stated that they had never driven a GAZelle minivan through the Dagestan checkpoint and suggested that the vehicle could have been used by other members of the FSB staff with a special permit.
On 6 December 2007 the investigators examined the Dagestan checkpoint. No evidence was collected.
On the same day Ms T., who had been arrested with Ms Dzhalilova, was interviewed by the military prosecutor. She stated that Ms Dzhalilova was her relative. After their arrest at the checkpoint they had been taken to Derbent and questioned by officer Kh. On the next day Ms Dzhalilova had been taken for questioning, while Ms T. had been given her documents and released. Officer Kh. had told her that Ms Dzhalilova had left for Gudermes.
On 21 June and 4 August 2008 the military prosecutor interviewed Lt. Col. R., Col. Ab., Maj. Is. and Capt. B., none of whom provided new information. Col. Ab., Maj. Is. and Capt. B. stated that the detention of Ms Dzhalilova had not been officially registered in the Dagestan checkpoint since she had not been detained in a cell.
On 20 October 2008 the applicant requested that the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 505 institute proceedings into the abduction of his wife.
On 1 February 2010 the North-Caucasus military district prosecutor’s office transferred the case file in respect of the disappearance of Ms Dzhalilova to military investigations department no. 315 for further examination. Subsequently, the case was transferred to the Derbent prosecutor’s office. The latter sent the case file back to military investigations department no. 315. It appears that until July 2011 the case file was transferred back and forth between various prosecutors’ offices in Dagestan.
On 7 July 2011 the Dagestan Investigative Committee opened criminal case no. 104268 into the abduction of Ms Dzhalilova and five other individuals under Articles 105 (murder) and 126 (abduction) of the Criminal Code.
On 8 July 2011 the military investigations department no. 315 refused to institute criminal proceedings against the suspected abductors Col. Ab., Lt. Col.R., Maj. Is. and Capt. B. for lack of corpus delicti. There is no evidence that the applicant was informed thereof.
On an unspecified date in 2011 the relatives of the other abducted individuals lodged complaints with the Makhachkala Garrison Military Court against the refusal of 8 July 2011.
On 13 July 2011 the military court upheld the refusal in respect of Capt. B. Then on 15 July 2011 the same court upheld the refusal in respect of two other officers – Col. Ab. and Maj. Is. It is unclear whether any appeal was lodged against the refusal to initiate an investigation in respect of Lt. Col. R.
In August and September 2011 Col. Ab., Maj. Is., Capt. B. and two other officers were questioned. They reaffirmed their earlier statements.
On 2 November 2011 the investigators’ superior annulled the decision of 7 July 2011 to open criminal case no. 104268 on the grounds that the investigators had not taken steps to verify the extent of the involvement of the FSB officers in the alleged abduction. He also ordered additional enquiries into the abduction, and, depending on its results, instructed that the case file be forwarded to the military investigators in accordance with the rules of jurisdiction. The document stated, in particular, that the investigators had failed to verify whether the missing individuals had been kept in a remand prison or a temporary detention centre; they had not obtained registration logs from the Dagestan checkpoint. Nor had they requested the FSB operative reports on the missing individuals. The applicant was not informed of that decision.
On 10 November 2011 the case file was transferred to the Southern Circuit investigations department for additional enquiries and then to military investigations department no. 315. Until February 2012 the case file was transferred between various prosecutors’ offices.
On 15 February 2012 the Dagestan Investigative Committee refused to institute criminal proceedings into the abduction and murder of six individuals including Ms Dzhalilova owing to the absence of the elements of a crime (отсутствие события преступления). The applicant was not informed of that decision.
On 12 January 2014 the applicant complained to the Chechnya Prosecutor’s Office of the shortcomings in the investigation. No reply followed.
On 2 March 2014 the applicant lodged a request with the Dagestan Investigative Committee, asking to be provided with information about the investigation.
On 23 May 2014 the investigators’ superior annulled the refusal of 15 February 2012 and sent the file for a fresh examination.
On 27 June 2014 the Dagestan Investigative Committee again refused to institute criminal proceedings into the abduction and murder of six individuals including Ms Dzhalilova owing to the absence of the elements of a crime.
On 13 March 2015 the investigators’ superior annulled that refusal and ordered a fresh examination of the case file.
On 23 March 2015 the Dagestan Investigative Committee refused on the same grounds yet again to institute criminal proceedings into the abduction and murder of six individuals including Ms Dzhalilova. That decision was annulled on 18 September 2015 by the investigators’ superior and the case file was sent back for a fresh examination.
Subsequently, between October 2015 and June 2016 two more refusals to open a criminal case were issued. The investigators’ superior annulled both of them and ordered a new pre-investigation inquiry. The last decision to annul the refusal was issued on 11 May 2018.
From the documents submitted it appears that no criminal case has been opened into the abduction of Ms Dzhalilova.
