The case originated in an application (no. 33946/15) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Sebastian Walasek (“the applicant”), on 6 July 2015.
The applicant was represented by Mr P. Rał, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska, who was later replaced by Ms A. Mężykowska, the Co-Agent, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged that the conditions of his detention had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment.
On 23 November 2016 the complaint concerning the conditions of his detention in Kielce Remand Centre from 6 September to 4 October 2012 was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1985 and lives in Łatanice.
The facts of the case may be summarised as follows.
The applicant was detained in Kielce Remand Centre from 6 September to 4 October 2012 (28 days).
The applicant submitted that throughout his detention in Kielce Remand Centre, he had been held in overcrowded cells in which the space per person had been below the Polish statutory minimum standard of 3 m².
In their observations, the Government admitted that the applicant had been detained in an overcrowded cell. However, they emphasised that the space in each cell had exceeded 2 m² per person and that the hardship caused by staying in an overcrowded cell had been compensated by adding 30 minutes to his daily walk as well as additional cultural and educational classes or sports activities.
In the course of civil proceedings instituted by the applicant, the domestic courts established that for twenty-eight days the applicant had been detained in an overcrowded cell (see also paragraph 13 below).
Regarding the conditions of detention, the domestic courts established that the overall conditions in cells were adequate. Cells were equipped in compliance with the relevant law; they were properly ventilated and the toilet area had been separated from the rest of the living space in the cells.
On 12 August 2013 the applicant brought a civil action against the State Treasury for infringement of his personal rights and for compensation on account of his detention in overcrowded cells in various penitentiary facilities. He claimed 35,000 Polish zlotys (approximately 8,750 euros) in just satisfaction.
On 28 May 2014 the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed the applicant’s action. It confirmed, however, that temporarily (from 6 September to 4 October 2012) the applicant had been detained in cells in which the space per person had been below the Polish statutory minimum standard of 3 m², but not below 2 m².
On 1 April 2015 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) dismissed the applicant’s appeal.
A detailed description of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning general rules governing the conditions of detention in Poland, and domestic remedies available to detainees alleging that the conditions of their detention were inadequate, is set out in the Court’s pilot judgments in the cases of Orchowski v. Poland, no. 17885/04 and Norbert Sikorski v. Poland, no. 17599/05, 22 October 2009 (see §§ 75-85 and §§ 45-88 respectively). More recent developments are described in the Court’s decision in the case of Łatak v. Poland, no. 52070/08, 12 October 2010, §§ 25-54.
