The case originated in two applications (nos. 2297/15 and 21260/16) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by the eight Russian nationals listed below (“the applicants”), on 13 January 2015 and 12 April 2016 respectively.
The applicants were represented by lawyers from the Stichting Russian Justice Initiative and Legal Assistance Organisation Astreya, NGOs operating in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 16 May 2018 notice of the applications was given to the Government. On 7 January 2020 Court decided to grant the applicants and their relatives referred to in this judgment anonymity and the case-files confidentiality under Rules 33 § 1 and 47 § 4 of the Rules of Court.
The applicants in both applications live in the settlement of Rubezhnoye in the Naurskiy district of Chechnya. At the material time, the population of that settlement, situated about 90 km from Grozny, the Chechen capital, was about 2,500.
On the night of 3 to 4 December 2014 members of illegal armed groups attacked a police station in Grozny, killing several police officers. As a result, the authorities carried out a large-scale counterterrorist operation and killed a number of the attackers (see ,  and ).
In the aftermath of the attack, on 4 December 2014, Mr Ramzan Kadyrov, the President of the Chechen Republic, gave a statement saying that the families of the members of illegal armed groups would be expelled from Chechnya and their houses demolished.
The applicants are:
Ms S.A., who was born in 1953,
Ms M.K., who was born in 1962,
Ms L.I., who was born in 1990, and
Ms I.L., who was born in 1992.
The first applicant is the mother of Mr B.A., who was born in 1989, and the fourth applicant is his wife. The second applicant is the mother of Mr K.K. who was born in 1988, and the third applicant is his wife.
On 4 December 2014, shortly after the terrorist attack in Grozny, Mr B.A. and Mr K.K. were taken to the Naurskiy police station (ROVD) for an identity check and released.
At about 7 p.m. on 5 December 2014 a local police officer arrived at one of the applicants’ houses and told Messrs B.A. and K.K. that they needed to accompany him to the police station in order to clarify some information.
At about midnight Mr A.Az. (the first applicant’s husband and the father of Mr B.A.) telephoned the same police officer on the latter’s mobile telephone. The officer told him that his son and Mr K.K. would be released soon, on the order of a commanding officer who was due to arrive at the police station shortly. However, the applicants’ relatives did not return home.
On 5 January 2015 officers from the ROVD arrived at the applicants’ houses and took the applicants to the police station. They informed them that on 6 December 2014 Messrs B.A. and K.K. had been released from the ROVD and had not been seen since. Their whereabouts remain unknown.
The applicants are:
Ms Z.I., who was born in 1958,
Ms Y.S., who was born in 1961,
Ms Z.S., who was born in 1967, and
Ms T.Y., who was born in 1962.
The first applicant is the mother of Mr L.U., who was born in 1991. The second applicant is the mother of Mr S.S., who was born in 1987. The third applicant is the mother of Mr R.A. and Mr A.A., who were born in 1986 and 1989 respectively. The fourth applicant is the mother of Mr Z.Y., who was born in 1983.
On the night of 3 to 4 December 2014, shortly after the terrorist attack in Grozny, police officers from the ROVD took the applicants’ relatives Messrs L.U., S.S., R.A., A.A. and Z.Y. to their police station for an identity check. After a short interview, they were released.
On 5 December 2014 police officers from the Second Road Patrol Regiment (also known as the Kadyrov Regiment) arrived at the arrived at the third applicant’ s family home, searched it, and took R.A. and A.A. with them to the ROVD.
On the morning of 5 December 2014 a police officer from the ROVD, Umar Ezh., arrived at the fourth applicant’s house and asked questions about Z.Y. Later that day, at about 6 p.m., Mr Z.Y. was taken to the ROVD for questioning.
At about 6 a.m. on 6 December 2014 police officers from the ROVD arrived at the first applicant’s house and took L.U. to the police station for questioning. Later that day, Mr S.S. was also taken to the station for questioning.
On 5 January 2015 the police summoned the applicants to the ROVD. They told them that their sons had been released immediately after their interviews on 5 and 6 December 2014 and had left the police station.
The whereabouts of the applicants’ sons remain unknown.
The applicants in both applications made joint efforts to persuade the authorities to investigate the disappearance of their relatives.
On 12 January 2015 the fourth applicant in Z.I. and Others (no. 21260/16) complained to the Naurskiy district prosecutor that her son had been abducted by police officers on 5 December 2014, stating that he had gone missing along with other men after being taken to the police station. The wording in her complaint was similar to the applicants’ submissions to the Court.
On 13 or 14 January 2015 the first two applicants in S.A. and Others (no. 2297/15) complained to the Chechnya Prosecutor about their sons’ disappearance after they had been taken to the police station. On 29 January 2015 that complaint was transferred to the Chechnya Investigative Committee.
On 28 January 2015 the applicants complained to the Naurskiy district investigative committee and the Chechnya Investigative Committee about their relatives’ disappearance after they had been taken to the police station. The description in their complaint of the factual circumstances and events was similar to their submissions to the Court.
On 29 January 2015 N.B., an investigator from the Naurskiy department of the Chechnya Investigative Committee, issued a “decision on transferring the crime report to the investigating body with jurisdiction” (постановление о передаче сообщения о преступлении по подследственности), which stated as follows:
“... having examined the crime report [filed] under Article 105 of the Criminal Code [murder], which was received by the Naurskiy investigative department ... on 19 January 2015, it has been established that:
On 19 January 2015 the Naurskiy investigative department received the inquiry file concerning the disappearance of Z.Y.
The inquiry material shows that between 3 and 6 p.m. on 5 December 2014 Mr Z.Y. was taken away from his official place of residence by unidentified police officers from the Naurskiy ROVD ... and his whereabouts have not been established since.
Also, in the same manner, on 5 December 2014 the following residents of Rubezhnoye were taken to the police station: Messrs B.A., K.K., R.A., A.A., L.U. and S.S., and their whereabouts remain unknown ...
In connection with the above, the crime report should be transferred to the appropriate investigative [body with] jurisdiction  OVD no. 3 of the Chechnya Investigative Committee [ОВД-3 СУ СК РФ по Чеченской Республике]”.
On 3 February 2015 the Chechnya Investigative Committee replied to the applicants’ complaint of 28 January 2015 by letter (see paragraph 22 above), confirming that confirming that Messrs B.A., K.K., L.U., S.S., R.A., A.A. and Z.Y. had been taken to the police station between 4 and 6 December 2014, but had all been released “after their involvement in illegal armed groups had been checked”.
On 2 March 2015 the Chechnya Investigative Committee forwarded the applicants’ complaint of 28 January 2015 to the Chechnya Prosecutor’s Office for transfer to the Naurskiy ROVD for investigation, as the same police station was already investigating criminal case no. 74507 opened against the applicants’ missing relatives (see paragraph 35 below).
On 2 April 2015 Major E.G. issued a “conclusion concerning the internal inquiry into the policemen of the Naurskiy ROVD”. The document stated that the applicants’ complaint regarding their relatives’ detention at the police station between 4 and 6 December 2014 had been verified and confirmed by the inquiry. The applicants had given their statements concerning the events, which were similar and concordant and described the taking of their relatives to the police station on 4 December and again on 5 December 2014, the date they had all failed to return and had gone missing. According to three police officers questioned during the inquiry, Mr As.A., Mr A.M. and Mr A.D., on 5 December 2014 the applicants’ relatives had been taken to the police station “for a preventive talk” before being released. The inquiry concluded that the applicants’ complaints of abduction were not “substantiated by objective evidence”. No documents substantiating the contents of the report, such as the statements referred to, were enclosed.
On 10 April 2015 the Deputy Chechnya Prosecutor issued a decision on “determination of the jurisdiction” of the applicants’ complaints of abduction. The decision stated that the complaints should be joined to the case file in criminal case no. 74507 opened against the applicants’ missing relatives (see paragraph 34 below).
On 20 August 2018 the police interviewed the applicants, all of whom gave statements similar to their submissions to the Court and confirmed that their relatives had been missing since they had been taken to the police station in December 2014.
On 27 April 2015 the applicants appealed to the Staropromyslovskiy District Court in Chechnya against the decision of 2 March 2015 on transferring the case to the Naurskiy ROVD (see paragraph 25 above) and requested that a criminal case be opened into their relatives’ disappearance. They stated, in particular, that their relatives had gone missing after they had been taken to the police station and stressed that their complaints of abduction had not been examined. They requested that the decision of 2 March 2015 be overruled as unlawful, that tangible steps be taken to investigate the disappearance, and that a criminal case be opened into the incident.
On 27 April 2015 the Staropromyslovskiy District Court dismissed the complaint on procedural grounds.
The applicants appealed against the above decision and on 9 June 2015 the Chechnya Supreme Court quashed it on appeal, remitting their complaint to the Staropromyslovskiy District Court for fresh examination.
On 3 July 2015 the Staropromyslovskiy District Court again dismissed the applicants’ complaint, this time on jurisdictional grounds.
The documents submitted show that neither an independent preliminary inquiry nor a criminal case into the alleged abduction of the applicants’ relatives has been opened to date.
On 1 February 2015, almost two months after the applicants’ relatives were taken to the police station and went missing, the Naurskiy district investigative committee opened criminal case no. 74507 against them and other individuals (including Mr A.Kh.) for suspected membership of an illegal armed group (Articles 33 and 208 of the Criminal Code).
On 31 March 2015 Messrs B.A., K.K., L.U., S.S., R.A., A.A. and Z.Y. were charged in absentia with membership of an illegal armed group and their names were put on a wanted list.
On an unspecified date in April 2015 the investigation of the criminal case was suspended as “the suspects had absconded”. From the documents submitted it appears that no tangible steps, other than putting the names of Messrs B.A., K.K., L.U., S.S., R.A., A.A. and Z.Y. on a wanted list, were taken to establish their whereabouts.
On 27 or 28 April 2015 the applicants requested that the investigators allow them access to the criminal case file. On 29 April 2015 their request was rejected.
On 3 August 2015 the applicants appealed against that refusal to the Naurskiy District Court.
On 21 August 2015 the court allowed the applicants’ request in part, ordering that the applicants be provided with copies of three documents from the investigation file: the decision to open the criminal case, the decision to put their relatives’ names on a wanted list and the decision to suspend the investigation.
On an unspecified date prior to July 2015 it was decided that the part of criminal case no. 74507 concerning Mr A.Kh. would be dealt with in separate proceedings. On 30 July 2015 he was convicted of membership of an illegal armed group. At the trial, he gave evidence to the effect that the applicants’ disappeared relatives had been involved in an illegal armed group.
On 6 September 2015 the investigation in the criminal case was suspended on the same grounds, as “the suspects had absconded”.
On 28 April 2015 the applicants complained to the Naurskiy District Court that the opening of criminal case no. 74507 against their relatives was unjustified.
On 5 May 2015 the Naurskiy District Court rejected their complaint.
On 14 May 2015 the fourth applicant in S.A. and Others (no. 2297/15) appealed against that decision to the Chechnya Supreme Court, stating that Messrs B.A., K.K., L.U., S.S., R.A., A.A. and Z.Y. had not been involved in illegal activities and had not absconded from the authorities.
On an unspecified date in June 2015 the Chechnya Supreme Court upheld the decision of 5 May 2015.
