The case originated in an application (no. 18506/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Eduard Yuryevich Vershinin (“the applicant”), on 14 January 2009.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 17 January 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
On 13 April 2012 the Government submitted a unilateral declaration inviting the Court to strike out the application. They acknowledged that a part of the applicant’s detention did not comply with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention and offered to pay a sum of money. They further submitted that the complaints about the remaining period of the detention were inadmissible.
On 5 March 2013 the Court decided not to accept the unilateral declaration as it did not cover the entire period of the applicant’s detention. It invited the Government to submit observations on the admissibility and the merits of the case.
The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Irkutsk.
During several periods between 21 May and 11 December 2008 the applicant was held in the temporary detention facility (IVS) of Angarsk in the Irkutsk Region, which was severely overcrowded, with up to eight detainees occupying a 12 sq. m cell. According to the applicant, the cell was not equipped with either tables or benches. Bed linen was not distributed. Drinking water and daily walks were not available.
On 23 November 2011 the Irkutsk Regional Prosecutor, in response to the applicant’s complaint, acknowledged that the conditions of his detention in the Angarsk IVS between May 2008 and May 2009 had violated the relevant domestic legislation.
