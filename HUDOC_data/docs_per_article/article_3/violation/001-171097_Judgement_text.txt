The case originated in an application (no. 257/14) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Mr Sănducu Barbu (“the applicant”), on 12 December 2013.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Ms C. Boghină, a lawyer practising in Bucharest. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs C. Brumar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 11 July 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1977. He has served sentences in several prisons. On 21 April 2015 he was released from Târgu-Jiu Prison.
The applicant alleged that while detained in cell no. 5 of TârguJiu Prison for eight days, between 1 October and 9 October 2013, he had not had an individual bed and had therefore been forced to sleep on the cold floor on two blankets. As a consequence, the renal disease from which he suffered had been re-activated and he had experienced intense pain.
On 3 October 2013 he had been examined by a prison doctor and had been prescribed medical treatment. However, he had been unable to submit any evidence in this connection as the prison authorities had rejected his requests for a copy of his medical records. He submitted instead an old medical certificate stating that on 23 September 2012 he had been hospitalised in the Nephrology Department of Slatina Hospital suffering from renal colic.
The applicant lodged a complaint with the postsentencing judge asking for an individual bed.
His complaint was examined on 15 October 2013. The applicant informed the judge that he had eventually been given a bed, but only after nine days. The post-sentencing judge took note that the applicant had obtained an individual bed; he did not draft an interlocutory judgment, but merely noted that the complaint had been withdrawn.
The applicant lodged a complaint with the Gorj District Court seeking compensation in connection with the lack of an individual bed for eight days in cell no. 5 of Târgu-Jiu Prison.
On 12 November 2013 the Târgu-Jiu District Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint as inadmissible without examining its merits on account of the fact that the applicant had not submitted an interlocutory judgment by the post-sentencing judge in connection with his complaint.
Law no. 275/2006 of 20 July 2006 on the execution of sentences, as in force at the material time, stated in Article 38 that prisoners had the right to lodge complaints with a post-sentencing judge delegated by the court of appeal to supervise the observance of the prisoners’ rights. An appeal could be brought in the court of first instance in whose district the prison facility was located against the post-sentencing judge’s decisions. The court could either cancel the impugned measure or reject the complaint but it could not award compensation for the reason that an infringement of the prisoners’ rights was found.
Law no. 275/2006 has been repealed and replaced by Law no. 254/2013, which entered into force on 31 January 2014. The new law has restated the content of Article 38 mentioned above in Article 56.
.  The report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”), published on 11 December 2008, following a visit to different police detention facilities and prisons in Romania, indicated that the lack of beds remained a constant problem, not only in the establishments visited but also at a national level, and that this had remained so since CPT’s first visit to Romania in 1995 (see Artimenco v. Romania no. 12535/04, § 23, 30 June 2009; and Vartic v. Romania, no. 12152/05, § 35, 10 July 2012).
