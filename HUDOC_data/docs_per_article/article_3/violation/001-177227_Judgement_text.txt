The case originated in an application (no. 26107/13) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Dmitriy Aleksandrovich Kramarenko (“the applicant”), on 26 February 2013.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Kramarenko, his father. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 20 November 2014 the complaints under Articles 3, 5 § 1 (c) and 13 of the Convention were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1992 and lived, prior to his arrest, in Voronezh.
On 9 October 2011 the applicant had an altercation with S., a security guard at his place of work. The applicant stabbed S. thirty-four times and then fled the scene. When Z. tried to stop him, the applicant stabbed him too. Both S. and Z. died.
