The case originated in an application (no. 22661/06) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Mr Nicolae Ioan Onaca (“the applicant”), on 26 May 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr K. S. Kolozsi, a lawyer practising in . The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu.
As Mr Corneliu Bîrsan, the judge elected in respect of , had withdrawn from the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court), the President of the Chamber appointed Mr Mihai Poalelungi to sit as ad hoc judge (Article 26 § 4 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1 of the Rules of Court).
Relying on Article 3 of the Convention, the applicant alleged that he received inhuman treatment from 28 November 2005 to 31 January 2006 while imprisoned in the Bihor Investigation Service detention facility.
On 28 January 2010 the President of the Third Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the alleged inhuman conditions in which the applicant was detained. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant and the Government each submitted observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in .
On 28 November 2005 the applicant was placed in the custody of the Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Bihor County Court, accused of receiving a bribe while working as a sub-officer at the Romanian border with Hungary.
On 29 November 2005 the prosecutor ordered the applicant to be remanded in custody for fifteen days. Subsequently, the applicant’s pretrial detention was periodically extended by the Bihor County Court until 1 August 2006, when the applicant was released from prison.
The applicant was detained on the premises of the Bihor Investigation Service detention facility (Arestul Preventiv al Inspectoratului de Poliţie Bihor) between 28 November 2005 and 31 January 2006.
On 31 January 2006, the applicant was transferred to Oradea Maximum Security Prison, where he was detained until 1 August 2006.
The applicant complained about the conditions of detention on the premises of the Bihor Investigation Service detention facility. He claimed that he shared a cell with five other detainees and that the toilet was in the middle of the cell, offering no privacy.
The cell also had no source of natural light, but was lit only by artificial light.
The applicant also alleged that the cell was not heated even when the outside temperature reached minus twenty degrees and that hot water was only available for ten minutes per week for all six detainees.
Furthermore, the applicant, a non-smoker, was detained with inmates who smoked cigarettes all day long inside the cell. He claimed that his health had worsened because of the conditions in which he had been kept. Thus, his ulcer had worsened and, although he had had no previous history of asthma, in a medical report of 6 January 2006, it was recorded that he was now suffering from asthma and bronchial hyperactivity.
He also claimed that there had been no television or any other source of information at the detention centre.
The opportunity to exercise outside was limited to one ten–minute walk per day, in a twelvesquaremetre space, with the other five detainees. Furthermore, he contended that he was not permitted to exercise outside at all for the period between 23 December 2005 and 6 January 2006.
The applicant contended that he had had no visits from or telephone conversations with his family until 27 December 2005. On 21 December 2005 the applicant wrote a letter of complaint to the Chief Prosecutor’s Office in this respect and only then were visits permitted.
The Government provided official information, submitted by the prison authorities, concerning the facilities of the cell that the applicant had occupied during his detention.
He stayed in a cell that accommodated five other detainees, each having his own bed. However, the Government did not state what the area of the cell was.
The cell had a loudspeaker allowing the detainees to listen to the radio. The toilet and a basin were installed in a corner of the cell. The applicant was allowed at least thirty minutes of outdoor exercise per day, with the exception of Saturdays and Sundays. Bathing was once a week for thirty minutes. The temperature in the cell was adequate, as the cell was connected to the city heating network. Natural light and ventilation were provided by two windows.
The domestic legislation on the execution of sentences, in particular Emergency Ordinance 56/2003 (“Ordinance 56/2003”) and Law no. 275/2006, is described in Petrea v. Romania, no. 4792/03, §§ 2123, 29 April 2008. (Both laws are applicable not only to the detainees sentenced to prison but also to the detainees on remand).
The relevant legal provisions of Law 349/2002 concerning prevention and combat of the effects of tobacco consumption are described in Florea v. Romania, no. 37186/03, § 29, 14 September 2010.
The relevant findings and recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”) are described in Bragadireanu v. Romania (no. 22088/04, §§ 73-75, 6 December 2007), and Artimenco v. Romania (no. 12535/04, §§ 22-23, 30 June 2009).
In particular, the Court notes that in the report on its June 2006 visit to , the CPT expressed concern about the conditions of detention at the Bihor Investigation Service detention facility. According to this report, the cells were equipped only with beds, the toilets were in the cell without any separation from the rest of the cell, and the detainees did not receive any personal hygiene products.
