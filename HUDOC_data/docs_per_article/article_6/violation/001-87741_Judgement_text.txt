The case originated in an application (no. 16407/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Gusztáv Sztergár (“the applicant”), on 15 April 2005.
The applicant was represented by Ms E. Slezák, a lawyer practising in Pécs. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr L. Höltzl, Agent, Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement.
On 15 January 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the liquidation proceedings to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Pécs.
The applicant's employer went into liquidation on 8 October 1991. On 14 December 1991 the applicant was dismissed from his job and he received 174,135 Hungarian forints (approximately 690 Euros) in severance pay. The applicant's further claims against his former employer were channelled into the ongoing liquidation procedure. Ultimately, the review bench of the Supreme Court awarded him HUF 124,480 (approximately EUR 494) in compensation in 1997, which, as far as it can be determined from the case file, was never paid to him. Because of his abovementioned pending and registered claim (hitelezői igény), he remained a “creditor” and, therefore, a party to the proceedings.
On 23 January 2006 the  deleted the applicant's former employer from the Company Register. In April 2006 the Pécs Court of Appeal ordered the stay of the proceedings until the legal successor of the debtor joined the proceedings. The applicant appealed against this decision.
In October 2006 the Supreme Court quashed the order and remitted the case to the Court of Appeal. In January 2007 the Court of Appeal indentified the legal successor of the debtor and continued the liquidation proceedings which are still pending.
