The case originated in an application (no. 52468/99) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Tadeusz Sienkiewicz (“the applicant”), on 30 March 1999.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the proceedings in his case had not been conducted within a reasonable time.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 10 September 2002 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Szczecin, Poland.
In 1989 the applicant, who worked as head of a department in a state-owned enterprise dealing with conservation of old buildings, was dismissed. Subsequently, he filed with the Szczecin District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) an action in which he requested that his dismissal be declared null and void, as well as that he be reinstated in his former post.
On 16 February 1990 the court dismissed his action. The applicant appealed, but on 22 June 1990 the Szczecin Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) dismissed his appeal.
On 7 June 1993 the Ombudsman lodged an extraordinary appeal against the Regional Court’s judgment.
On 14 July 1993 the Supreme Court quashed that judgment and remitted the case for re-examination.
In his pleadings of 28 March 1994 the applicant withdrew his claim for reinstatement in his former post and raised a compensation claim.
The District Court held hearings on 9 May and 28 November 1994, as well as on 2 and 25 January 1995.
On 25 January 1995 it dismissed the action again.
On 30 June 1995 the Szczecin Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the District Court’s judgment.
On 2 August 1996 the Ombudsman lodged a cassation appeal against that judgment.
On 13 December 1996 the Supreme Court quashed the Regional Court’s judgment and remitted the case for re-examination.
On 23 April 1997 the Szczecin District Court stayed the proceedings, because of the fact that insolvency proceedings concerning the defendant were pending. The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision. On 30 June 1997 it was dismissed by the Szczecin Regional Court.
On 21 September 1998 the District Court resumed the proceedings.
On 22 October 1998 it held a hearing.
On 26 October 1998 the court awarded the applicant a partial compensation. The applicant appealed against that judgment.
On 17 February 1999 the Szczecin Regional Court held a hearing.
On 24 February 1999 it quashed the judgment of 26 October 1998 and remitted the case for re-examination.
The District Court held hearings on 23 July, as well as on 15 and 29 November 1999.
On 29 November 1999 it gave a judgment, in which it awarded the applicant compensation. The applicant appealed.
The Szczecin Regional Court held hearings on 10 and 31 May 2000.
On 31 May 2000 it amended the judgment under appeal in that it increased the amount of the compensation.
Articles 417 to 424 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as applicable at the material time, provided that the Ombudsman could lodge with the Supreme Court an extraordinary appeal against any final judicial decision. A party to the proceedings could file a request to have such an appeal lodged. On 1 July 1996 that appeal was replaced with a cassation appeal and the procedure for its lodging by the Ombudsman remained largely unchanged for the following two years.
At present, the Ombudsman has a six months’ time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal on behalf of a party to the proceedings (Article 393 - 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure).
