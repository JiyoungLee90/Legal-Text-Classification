The case originated in an application (no. 17878/04) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Mrs Evelyne Deiwick
The applicant was represented by Mr Hans-Jürgen Deiwick, her husband. The German Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, Ministerialdirigentin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.
On 9 January 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
On 7 February 2008, on account of the fact that Judge Renate Jaeger, the judge elected in respect of Germany, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court), the respondent Government, pursuant to Rule 29 § 1 (a), informed the Court that they had appointed in her stead another elected judge, namely Judge Mark Villiger.

On 31 August 1993 the review board at the Hamburg Regional Medical Association (Prüfungsausschuss bei der Kassenärztliche Vereinigung Hamburg), after having examined the applicant’s economic efficiency (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below), decided to reduce by 15% the fees payable to her for the first quarter of 1993 and as far as initial check-ups were concerned. It argued that the fees claimed for her initial check-ups exceeded the average for that category by 72% and that there was thus a presumption of a lack of economic efficiency which the applicant had failed to rebut. Instead of 33,200 euros (EUR) the applicant was therefore awarded a reduced sum of EUR 32,200 in quarterly fees.
By a letter dated 8 November 1993 the applicant lodged an administrative appeal.

Section 88 of the Social Courts Act provides:
“(1) Where no decision has been made regarding an application for the performance of an administrative act within a reasonable time and without sufficient grounds, a court action shall be admissible six months after an application for the performance of the administrative act has been submitted. ...
(2) The same applies where no decision on an administrative appeal was made, providing that three months shall apply as a reasonable time-limit.”
Remuneration of panel doctors does not involve a direct transaction between the doctor and the insured patient, or between the doctor and the patient’s statutory health-insurance fund, but between the doctor and the competent Regional Medical Association. On a quarterly basis the doctor submits an invoice for services rendered, which are worth a certain number of points (indicated in the uniform assessment standard (einheitlicher Bewertungsmaßstab – “EBM”)). The fees actually paid depend on the amount the relevant Regional Medical Association has received from the public health-insurance funds and further factors such as practice budgets and case group averages.
In order to ensure the proper allocation of the (limited) financial means, the review board at the Regional Medical Association, which is composed of three members of the Regional Medical Association and three members of the statutory insurance funds, reviews the economic efficiency of general practitioners by assessing whether the services rendered have been medically necessary, effective, in line with the recognised quality standards and proportionate to the costs produced (section 106 §§ 1 and 2 of the Fifth Book of the German Social Code). Section 106 § 3 of the Code furthermore provides for possible reduction of the fees payable, in particular in cases of repeated inefficiency.
