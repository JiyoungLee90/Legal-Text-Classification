The case originated in three applications (nos. 337/04, 36022/04 and 45219/04) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Čedomir Pejaković, Mr Dragomir Kusić and Ms Ružica Pejić (“the applicants”), between 8 December 2003 and 16 November 2004.
The applicants, two of whom had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr P. Radulović, Ms D. Glušac and Mr M. Pjević respectively (all three lawyers practise in Banja Luka). The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Mijić.
The applicants complain about non-enforcement of final and enforceable judgments in their favour.
On 14 December 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
The applicants were born in 1932, 1944 and 1942 respectively. Mr Pejaković and Mr Kusić live in Bosnia and Herzegovina, whereas Ms Pejić lives in .
Prior to the dissolution of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (“SFRY”) the applicants deposited foreign currency in their bank accounts at the then Privredna banka Sarajevo Filijala Banja Luka (Mr Pejaković), Jugobanka Sarajevo Ekspozitura Gradiška (Mr Kusić) and Jugobanka Sarajevo Ekspozitura Brčko (Ms Pejić). In , as well as in other successor States of the former SFRY, such savings are commonly referred to as “old” foreign-currency savings (for the relevant background information see Jeličić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 41183/02, ECHR 2005-...).
Following several unsuccessful attempts to withdraw their funds, the applicants instituted proceedings, seeking the recovery of their entire “old” foreign-currency savings and accrued interest.
By a decision of the Banja Luka Court of First Instance of 4 November 1999, the Banjalučka banka (the legal successor of the Privredna banka Sarajevo Filijala Banja Luka) was ordered to pay Mr Pejaković 18,952.59 German marks (DEM), default interest on the above amount at the rate applicable in Germany to overnight deposits from 1 January 1998, legal costs in the amount of 250 convertible marks (BAM) and default interest on the last-mentioned amount at the statutory rate from the date of the judgment. The judgment entered into force on 7 March 2001. On 6 June 2001 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju). On 18 January 2002 the judgment debt became a public debt pursuant to section 20 of the Opening Balance Sheets Act 1998.
By a decision of the Gradiška Court of First Instance of 5 July 2000, the Kristal banka (the legal successor of the Jugobanka Sarajevo Ekspozitura Gradiška) was ordered to pay Mr Kusić 38,779.48 pounds sterling (GBP), 5,758.18 US dollars (USD) and 193,609.28 Australian dollars (AUD), default interest on the above amounts at the annual rate of 9% from 29 January 1993 and legal costs in the amount of BAM 6,500. The judgment entered into force on 8 September 2000. On 28 March 2001 the Gradiška Court of First Instance issued a writ of execution. On 17 April 2002 the judgment debt became a public debt pursuant to section 20 of the Opening Balance Sheets Act 1998.
By a decision of the Banja Luka Court of First Instance of 28 May 2001, the Kristal banka (the legal successor of the Jugobanka Sarajevo Ekspozitura Brčko) was ordered to pay Ms Pejić DEM 227,445.47, USD 3,964.17, 1,765.11 Dutch guilders and 13,735.84 French francs, default interest on the above amounts at the rate applicable to overnight deposits from 1 January 1998 until 5 August 1999 and at the statutory rate thereafter, legal costs in the amount of BAM 4,360 and default interest on the last-mentioned amount at the statutory rate from the date of the judgment. The judgment entered into force on 28 July 2001. On 19 October 2001 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance issued a writ of execution. On 17 April 2002 the judgment debt became a public debt pursuant to section 20 of the Opening Balance Sheets Act 1998.
On 14 December 2001, 29 May 2002 and 17 February 2004 Mr Kusić converted a part of his savings (AUD 26,436.35, AUD 5,903.99 and GBP 1,536.40 respectively) into privatisation coupons pursuant to section 19 of the old Privatisation of Companies Act 1998. He subsequently sold those coupons on the secondary market. The price which he thereby obtained has not been indicated.
On 24 January 2002 and 7 August 2002 Mr Pejaković converted a part of his savings (in total 810 euros) into privatisation coupons pursuant to section 19 of the old Privatisation of Companies Act 1998. When purchasing a State-owned apartment at a later date, the applicant paid a price reduced by the nominal value of those coupons pursuant to section 33 of the Privatisation of Apartments Act 2000.
On 15 April 2006 the Old Foreign-Currency Savings Act 2006 entered into force (“2006 Act”). Former section 27 of the 2006 Act, which was in force until 27 September 2007, effectively amended the awards made by the domestic courts: for example, interest accrued from 1 January 1992 was to be calculated afresh at an annual rate of 0.5% instead of the significantly higher interest rates awarded by the domestic courts.
On 5 July 2006 the Human Rights Commission within the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“Human Rights Commission”) dismissed the application brought by Mr Kusić (together with those brought by a number of other “old” foreign-currency savers) on the ground that, following the entry into force of the 2006 Act, the matter had been resolved.
It would appear that the judgments at issue have not yet been enforced.
The relevant law and practice were outlined in the admissibility decision in Jeličić (cited above), Suljagić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina ((dec.), no. 27912/02, 20 June 2006) and the judgment in Jeličić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (no. 41183/02, ECHR 2006...).
Following the judgment in Jeličić (cited above), section 27 of the 2006 Act has been amended. It now reads as follows:
“The courts shall send all their enforceable judgments ordering the release of “old” foreign-currency savings either to the Ministry of Finance of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, or the Ministry of Finance of the Republika Srpska or the Directorate for Finance of the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina.”
