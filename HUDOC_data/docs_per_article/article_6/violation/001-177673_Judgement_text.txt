The case originated in an application (no. 4867/16) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Junuz Kahriman (“the applicant”), on 8 January 2016.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Maksimović, a lawyer practising in Bijeljina. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Deputy Agent, Ms S. Malešić.
On 16 December 2016 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1935 and lives in the United States.
On 18 August 2003 the applicant initiated civil proceedings against private persons concerning some contracts. On 6 June 2007 the Bijeljina Court of First Instance rendered a judgment. On 10 April 2009 the Bijeljina District Court quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the first-instance court for a retrial. On 19 May 2011 the Bijeljina Court of First Instance rendered a new judgment. That judgment was amended by the Bijeljina District Court on 23 September 2011 and by the Supreme Court of the Republika Srpska on 16 August 2012.
The applicant introduced a claim before the Constitutional Court, alleging that the above proceedings had been excessively long and requesting a financial compensation. On 17 June 2015 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina found a breach of the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time. It did not award any damages.
