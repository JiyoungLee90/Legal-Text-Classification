The case originated in an application (no. 21175/13) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Dragan Milinković (“the applicant”), on 13 February 2013.
The applicant was represented by Ms R. Plavšić, a lawyer practising in Banja Luka. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Mijić.
The case is, like Momić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 1441/07 et al., 15 January 2013, about the non-enforcement of a final and enforceable domestic judgment which falls under a special legal regime of the Republika Srpska’s general obligations.
On 7 May 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Banja Luka.
By a judgment of the Banja Luka Court of First Instance of 23 February 2009 which became final on 11 May 2009, the Republika Srpska (an Entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina) was ordered to pay, within 15 days, 34,000 convertible marks (BAM) in respect of non-pecuniary damage together with default interest at the statutory rate and BAM 4,667 in respect of legal costs together with default interest at the statutory rate to the applicant.
The Banja Luka Court of First Instance issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju) on 29 June 2009.
The applicant complained of non-enforcement to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Constitutional Court”). On 16 January 2013 the Constitutional Court found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The final judgment in favour of the applicant remains unenforced to this day.
The relevant domestic law and practice were outlined in Momić and Others (cited above, §§ 11-13).
