The case originated in an application (no. 20264/12) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Zoltán András Rácz (“the applicant”), on 27 March 2012.
The applicant was represented by Ms E. Tóth, a lawyer practising in Kecskemét. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent at the Ministry of Justice.
On 26 May 2015 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Kiskunfélegyháza.
The applicant initiated a labour lawsuit against his employer on 1 July 2005 for unpaid remunerations. After remittals on 15 November 2006 and on 8 July 2009, on 25 February 2010 the Kecskemét Labour Court adopted a judgment in which it partly found for the applicant.
On 10 March and 16 November 2011, respectively, the Bács-Kiskun County Court and the Kúria upheld this judgment.
