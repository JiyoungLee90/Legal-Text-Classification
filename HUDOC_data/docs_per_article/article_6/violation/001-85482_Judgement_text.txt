She asserted that there had been a violation of her right to a hearing without unjustified delay (Article 48 § 2 of the Constitution) and claimed 100,000 Slovakian korunas (SKK) in damages.
On 2 April 2003 the  found that the District Court in Žilina had violated the applicant’s right to a hearing without unjustified delay, ordered acceleration of the proceedings and awarded the applicant SKK 20,000 by way of compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage and reimbursement of her legal costs. It found that the subject-matter of the proceedings was complex owing to the number of defendants, which moreover had changed in the course of the proceedings, and the change in the land referencing system. The applicant had caused some delay by failing to identify clearly the defendants and the land. The District Court had been inactive without justification for some 27 months between 13 May 1998 and 22 August 2000.
On 16 June 2005 the applicant filed a fresh constitutional complaint based on the recurring unjustified delays in the proceedings. She claimed SKK 600,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.
On 30 November 2005 the  found that, in the period after its judgment of 2 April 2003, there had been a further violation by the District Court in Žilina of the applicant’s right to a hearing without unjustified delay. It ordered acceleration of the proceedings and awarded the applicant SKK 50,000 by way of just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage and reimbursement of her legal costs.
The  found that in the relevant period the subjectmatter of the proceedings was of no particular legal complexity. Even assuming that the case was to some extent complex on its facts, this provided no justification for the length of the proceedings. No delays could be imputed to the applicant. As for the conduct of the proceedings, the District Court had acted inefficiently throughout the relevant period. Reference was made also to the overall length of the proceedings which had exceeded 13 years.
