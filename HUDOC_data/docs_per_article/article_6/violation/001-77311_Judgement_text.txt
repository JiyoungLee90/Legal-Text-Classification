On 27 February 1996 the applicant, on behalf of herself and her three children, lodged a civil action with the  (Sąd Wojewódzki). She claimed compensation for her husband’s death and directed her action, inter alia, against the company that owned the truck and the “Warta” Insurance Company.
On 9 October 1996 the trial court held the first hearing.
Subsequently, hearings were held once a year on 8 December 1997, 27 September 1998 and 26 November 1999. In 2000 no hearings were held.
On 19 December 2001 and 13 February 2002 the trial court held hearings. On the latter date the court stayed the proceedings. They were resumed on 18 August 2003. Subsequently, the court ordered that an expert opinion be prepared. The court scheduled two hearings but they were adjourned.
On 24 October 2004 the applicant lodged with the Łódź Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) a complaint about a breach of the right to have her case heard within a reasonable time. She relied on the 2004 Act. On 22 December 2004 the Court of Appeal dismissed her complaint. The court examined the course of the impugned proceedings and held that there were no delays for which the  could be held responsible. Some delays were caused by the actions of the defendant. The court finally held that the case was complex and required the taking of expert evidence.
In May and June 2005 the experts submitted their opinions to the court.

On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings.
Section 2 of the 2004 Act reads, in so far as relevant:
“1.  Parties to proceedings may lodge a complaint that their right to a trial within a reasonable time has been breached [in the proceedings] if the proceedings in the case last longer than is necessary to examine the factual and legal circumstances of the case ... or longer than is necessary to conclude enforcement proceedings or other proceedings concerning the execution of a court decision (unreasonable length of proceedings).”
Section 5 reads, in so far as relevant:
“1.  A complaint about the unreasonable length of proceedings shall be lodged while the proceedings are pending. ...”
Section 12 provides for measures that may be applied by the court dealing with the complaint. It reads, in so far as relevant:
“1.  The court shall dismiss a complaint which is unjustified.
If the court considers that the complaint is justified, it shall find that there was an unreasonable delay in the impugned proceedings.
At the request of the complainant, the court may instruct the court examining the merits of the case to take certain measures within a fixed time-limit. Such instructions shall not concern the factual and legal assessment of the case.
If the complaint is justified the court may, at the request of the complainant, grant ... just satisfaction in an amount not exceeding PLN 10,000 to be paid by the State Treasury. If such just satisfaction is granted it shall be paid out of the budget of the court which conducted the delayed proceedings.”
A more detailed rendition of the relevant domestic law provisions is set out in the Court’s decision Charzyński v. Poland (dec.), no. 15212/03, §§ 1223, ECHR 2005-....
