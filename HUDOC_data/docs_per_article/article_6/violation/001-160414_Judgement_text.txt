.  The case originated in eighteen applications (nos. 24130/04, 24916/04, 38108/04, 43535/04, 1711/05, 13825/06, 14070/06, 14101/06, 17664/06, 25722/06, 25798/06, 45413/06, 19942/07, 39661/07, 47465/07, 8295/08, 52271/08 and 55432/08) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by thirtyfour Russian nationals (“the applicants”). The applicants’ names and the dates of their applications to the Court appear in the Appendix.
.  The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
.  The applicants complained of, inter alia, the quashing of binding and enforceable judgments by way of supervisory review procedure in force between 2003 and 2008.
.  On various dates these complaints were communicated to the respondent Government.
.  By a letter of 20 December 2010 the widow of Mr Oleg Anatolyevich Kozlovskiy, Mrs Tatyana Yuryevna Kozlovskaya, informed the Court that her husband had died on 27 September 2007 and that she wished to pursue the application on his behalf.
.  By a letter of 1 October 2012 Mr Kuzmin Juriy Vladimirovich, the son of the applicant, informed the Court that Mr Kuzmin Vladimir Yakovlevich died after having lodged his application under Article 34 of the Convention, and stated his wish to pursue the application.
On 18 December 2012 the Court decided that Mr Kuzmin Juriy Vladimirovich had standing to continue the present proceedings.
.  In all cases the applicants brought civil proceedings before Russian courts of general jurisdiction, claiming various monetary sums (unpaid salaries, pensions, compensation payments and/or other benefits) in relation to their military or police service.
.  On various dates the domestic courts found for the applicants and these judgments became final and enforceable (for more details see the Appendix).
.  The defendant authorities applied for supervisory review of those judgments. On the dates indicated in the Appendix, the supervisory review courts allowed the authorities’ applications and quashed the final judgments in the applicants’ favour. Their claims were dismissed either by the same judgments of the supervisory review courts or by lower courts in subsequent proceedings, except in the two cases of Mr Bochkarev and Mr Umanets, whose claims were partially granted.
In the Baranov case, on 8 June 1998 the applicant brought proceedings against the local military authority. The proceedings were concluded on 22 September 2004, when the Amur Regional Court upheld the judgment of 17 June 2004 in which the Svobodnyy Town Court of the Amur Region had dismissed all the applicant’s claims. During this period, the case was examined nine times by the domestic courts (four times by the first-instance court, four times by the appeal court and once by the supervisory review court).
.  In some of the cases (Zaytsev, Kudryavtsev, Polusmyak, Russkikh, Stepanov and Others, Mochalov, Barkov, Kozlovskiy and Martynov) the authorities complied with the judgments fully or partially prior to their quashing. In the rest of the cases (Baranov, Sitnikov, Belyasov, Umanets, Bochkarev (the judgment of 15 March 2004), Kuzmin, Korchagin, Gafarova and Others and Dudov) the judgments in the applicants’ favour were never complied with.
.  In the Bochkarev case, the judgment of 1 June 2006, delivered as a result of a new round of proceedings conducted after the supervisory review, became binding on 25 October 2006. On 30 August 2007 the authorities complied with this judgment by putting the applicant’s family on the priority housing list.
.  In the Kudryavtsev case the pension paid to the applicant following the quashed judgments was recovered from him after the supervisory review.
The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure in force between 2003 and 2008 is summed up in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007).
