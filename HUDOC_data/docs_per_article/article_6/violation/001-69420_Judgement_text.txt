The case originated in an application (no. 74432/01) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mrs Raisa Petrovna Bulynko (“the applicant”), on 18 January 2001.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms Valeria Lutkovska, succeeded by Ms Zoryana Bortnovska.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
The applicants’ complaint under Articles 6 § 1 of the Convention about the non-enforcement of the judgment of the Torez City Court of 7 August 2000 were communicated to the respondent Government on 9 May 2003.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits (Rule 54A).
The applicant was born in 1935 and currently resides in Torez, the Donetsk Region.
On 30 November 2000 the applicant was dismissed from her position in the State Holding Company “Torezantratsit” (the “SHC”).

On 7 August 2000 the Torez City Court allowed her claims and ordered the SHC to pay the applicant UAH 2,379.76 in compensation.
On 14 June 2001 the Torez Execution Service informed the applicant that the judgment of 7 August 2000 could not be executed due to the SHC’s lack of funds.
On 10 October 2002 the applicant informed the Court that the judgment of 7 August 2000 had still not been executed.
The Government stated that between 9 November 2000 and 15 April 2003 the bailiffs conducted 8 inspections of the company’s accounts and found that there were no funds available to enforce the judgment. They also stated that the bailiffs were enforcing 92 writs of execution against the company, with a total debt of UAH 213,526.
On 2 July 2003 the applicant received UAH 2,379.76 in execution of the judgment of 7 August 2000.
On 3 July 2003 the enforcement proceedings on the applicant’s writ of execution were discontinued as the amount awarded by the judgment had been paid.
