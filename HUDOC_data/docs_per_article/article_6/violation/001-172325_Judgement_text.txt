The case originated in an application (no. 63113/13) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Veroljub Blagojević (“the applicant”), on 25 September 2013.
The applicant was represented by Mr L. Uljarević, a lawyer practising in Kragujevac. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Ms V. Rodić, being more recently substituted by their current Agent, Ms. N. Plavšić.
On 18 December 2014 the complaint concerning the length of criminal proceedings was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Kragujevac.
On 13 July 2006 the applicant filed a civil suit together with 18 other persons with the Kragujevac Municipal Court against his former employer Telekom Srbija AD Beograd requesting the payment of funds from profit made in 2005.
The applicant’s previous representative did not attend first preliminary hearing fixed for 15 November 2006, since he had been deleted from the register of the attorneys–at-law in May 2006. The applicant appointed the present representative on 25 January 2007.
The preliminary hearing was held on 13 February 2007.
On 27 August 2007 the proceedings were split to separate proceedings for each of the plaintiffs concerned.
The preliminary hearing was held on 21 March 2008.
Within the period from 21 October 2008 until 29 April 2011 seven out of eight hearings were postponed for various reasons, mainly because the representatives on the both sides provided new submissions and evidence and on the proposal of both sides due to the cost-efficiency of the proceedings.
On 29 April 2011 the Kragujevac First Instance Court ruled against the applicant.
On 20 February 2012 the Kragujevac Appeals Court upheld that judgment.
On 27 June 2013 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s appeal.
