The applicant inherited a property from his ancestors (now divided into two plots of land - no. 209/1 and no. 224/1) located in Podkowa Leśna, Poland, at the crossroad of 11 Listopada Street and Wiązowa Street. It appears that on an unspecified date after World War II the possession of the land was transferred to the State.
On 1 January 1999 the applicant's land, which had remained, as of 31 December 1998, in the possession of the State and which had been expropriated for the purposes of constructing roads became ex lege the property of the local self-government authority in accordance with section 73 of the Act of 13 October 1998 – introductory provisions concerning acts reforming public administration (Ustawa - przepisy wprowadząjace ustawy reformujące administrację publiczną).

On 6 July 2005 the applicant yet again requested compensation from the Podkowa Leśna Municipality Office.
On 9 August 2005 the Municipality Office informed the applicant that some uncertainty had arisen as to whether the compensation for the expropriated plots of land was to be paid by the Municipality or by the State Treasury. The applicant was further informed that the municipality had not yet lodged an application with the Governor (Wojewoda) for a decision confirming the transfer of ownership, which was necessary for the determination and payment of compensation.
On 6 February 2007 the applicant requested the Mazowiecki Governor to issue a decision confirming the transfer of ownership.

On 17 December 2007 the Mazowiecki Governor gave a decision refusing to confirm the transfer of ownership of the plot of land no. 224/1.
On 9 January 2008 the applicant appealed against the decision of 17 December 2007.
On 11 January 2008 the Mayor of the  (Burmistrz Gminy) appealed against both decisions of the Governor.
On 22 February 2008 the Minister of Infrastructure (Minister Infrastruktury) quashed the Mazowiecki Governor's decisions of 14 and 17 December 2007 and remitted the case.
On 21 March 2008 the applicant requested the Mazowiecki Governor to consider speeding up the proceedings.
On 25 April 2008 the Mazowiecki Governor informed the applicant that his case would be examined once the case file was delivered from the Ministry of Infrastructure.
On 5 May 2008 the applicant yet again requested the Governor to accelerate the proceedings. He stressed that the Governor had significantly exceeded the time-limit laid down in the Code of Administrative Procedure (Kodeks Postępowania Administracyjnego) for handling a case.
