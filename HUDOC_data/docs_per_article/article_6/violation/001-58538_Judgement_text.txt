The case was referred to the Court by a Slovak national, I.S. (“the applicant”) on 4 February 1999 pursuant to former Article 48 § 1(e) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). It originated in an application (no. 25006/94) against Slovakia lodged by the applicant with the Commission under former Article 25 of the Convention, on 3 May 1994. The Slovak Government are represented by their Agent, Mr R. Fico.
The case concerns the duration of the proceedings instituted by the applicant and whether they were terminated within a “reasonable time” as required by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
On 31 March 1999 a Panel of the Grand Chamber decided, in accordance with Article 5 § 4 of Protocol No. 11 taken together with Rules 100 § 1 and 24 § 6 of the Rules of Court, that the case should be dealt with by a Chamber constituted within one of the Sections of the Court. Subsequently, the President of the Court assigned the case to the Second Section. The Chamber constituted within the Section included ex officio Mrs V. Strážnická, the judge elected in respect of Slovakia (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 26 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court), and Mr C. L. Rozakis, the President of the Section (Rule 26 § 1 (a)). The other members designated by the latter to complete the Chamber were Mr M. Fischbach, Mr B. Conforti, Mr G. Bonello, Mr A. Baka and Mr E. Levits (Rule 26 § 1 (b)).
On 27 April 1999 the President invited the parties to submit memorials on the issues arising in the case (Rule 59 § 3). The applicant was further invited to submit his claim for just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention (Rule 60 § 1). The Government replied on 7 July 1999. The applicant failed to respond.
The applicant is a Slovak citizen, born in 1956 and resident in Žilina.
On 19 November 1991 the applicant and four other persons lodged an action for restitution of land with the Žilina District Court (okresný súd)1 against two state enterprises pursuant to Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act no. 87/1991. On 24 January 1992 a judge of the District Court invited the defendants to submit written observations on the merits of the action. On 11 March 1992 the judge fixed a hearing for 23 March 1992 and then adjourned it requesting the applicant to present a copy of his letter to the Ministry of Administration and Privatisation of National Property (Ministerstvo pre správu a privatizáciu národného majetku) concerning his compensation claims. The applicant presented the letter on 8 September 1992.
On 21 January 1993 the judge ordered an inspection of the site for 9 February 1993. During the inspection it was established that the first defendant, a business enterprise, had been in proceedings of dissolution since 1 January 1992 and its property had been transferred to the Žilina Town (Mesto Žilina). The judge therefore asked the applicant to amend his restitution action and designate a new defendant.
On 7 April 1993 the applicant, with reference to sections 5 and 6 of Court and Judges Act no. 335/1991 and to Article 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, complained of delays in the proceedings to the President of the District Court. He also requested that the judge of this court dealing with his case be disqualified on the ground that she was involved in the complaint about the delays in the proceedings. The complaint was considered as a complaint of bias and was referred, together with the court-file, to the Banská Bystrica Regional Court (krajský súd)2 on 25 May 1993 which, on 31 May 1993, decided that the judge concerned was not disqualified. On 16 July 1993 the case-file was remitted to the District Court.
A search for the case-number of succession proceedings relating to one of the co-plaintiffs who had died on 15 May 1993 had to be carried out.
On 27 August 1993 the decision of 31 May 1993 was served on the applicant who appealed on the same day notwithstanding that no appeal lay against the decision. The Regional Court referred the case-file to the District Court which, on 26 October 1993, instructed the applicant that any appeal would be inadmissible. The applicant insisted and the case-file was sent to the Regional Court by which it was referred to the Supreme Court (Najvyšší súd) which, on 25 November 1993, rejected the appeal for lack of jurisdiction holding that the Regional Court’s decision was final. On 1 February 1994 the case-file was sent back to the District Court.
In the meantime, as the applicant had received no reply to his complaint of 7 April 1993 about delays in the proceedings, he lodged another complaint with the Ministry of Justice on 10 August 1993 where he also mentioned that the first co-plaintiff had died. The complaint was referred to the President of the District Court, who, on 29 September 1993, informed the applicant that his complaint had been considered as a request for disqualification of a judge and that it had been dealt with without undue delay.  He also noted that the restitution proceedings could not be pursued as one of the co-plaintiffs had died and separate succession proceedings relating to her estate had to be terminated first. On 19 October 1993 the Regional Court confirmed, in reply to the applicant’s complaint of 10 August 1993, the position of the President of the District Court.
On 8 February 1994 the judge of the District Court requested the applicant for the second time to amend his action for restitution and designate the Žilina Town as a new defendant. The applicant did so on 16 February 1994 indicating, at the same time, that one of the co-plaintiffs had died on 15 May 1993 and that the second and third co-plaintiffs became her successors. On 12 August 1994 the judge informed the applicant that his amended claim was presented improperly and requested him to rectify it within seven days. The applicant did so on 19 August 1994 submitting that as the first defendant was in dissolution, its property had been transferred to the Žilina Town which had taken over all the first defendant’s rights and obligations. He therefore asked the District Court to accept the Žilina Town as a defendant to the restitution proceedings. The original action for restitution was enclosed with the amended claim.
On 25 November 1994 the judge requested the applicant to clarify whether the Žilina Town was intended to replace the first defendant or whether it was a new defendant and asked him to submit a new action for restitution properly designating the Žilina Town as a party to the proceedings.
On 12 April 1995 the judge invited the applicant to submit further information on the succession proceedings concerning the estate of the deceased plaintiff.
On 26 April, 25 and 31 May and 7 and 27 June 1995 the District Court held five hearings adjourning them having requested the parties to clarify different facts relating to the property in issue. The applicant and his lawyer were not present at the hearing of 7 June 1995.
On 15 September 1995 the District Court appointed an expert to establish the boundaries and draw a plan of the plot at issue. On 9 January 1996 the expert presented his report.
On 18 January 1996 the District Court, after hearing the co-plaintiffs’ submissions, adjourned the hearing and on 30 January 1996 it decided in favour of the applicant.
On 30 May 1996, upon the defendants’ appeal, the Regional Court, after a public hearing, quashed the judgment of the District Court and referred the case back to it. The Regional Court held that the District Court had not considered evidence in a sufficient extent and had committed some procedural errors. The court-file was sent to the District Court on 3 October 1996. The written judgment was served on the District Court and on the applicant on 4 October and 26 November 1996, respectively.
On 19 February 1997 the District Court received the applicant’s detailed summary of his action for restitution, and on 3 April 1997, the Žilina Town submitted its observations on the merits of the action.
On 27 June 1997 the judge of the District Court fixed a hearing for 8 July 1997 and then adjourned it for procedural reasons until 9 September 1997. On 9 and 23 September 1997 hearings were held at the District Court. On 23 September 1997 the judge adjourned the hearing ordering the parties to produce further documentary evidence and requesting the applicant to submit the address of an enterprise sitting in Prague which was to be involved in the restitution proceedings.
On 22 January 1998 the applicant informed the District Court that one piece of the documentary evidence requested by the District Court had not been found in the District Records Office.
A subsequent hearing was scheduled for 23 January 1998. However, the applicant’s lawyer, having been notified only on 22 January 1998, could not properly prepare his submissions and sent his apologies. The hearing was held on 17 February 1998. By judgment of 20 February 1998 the District Court rejected the applicant’s action for restitution. On 18 June 1998 the judgment was served on the applicant who appealed on 2 July 1998 to the Žilina Regional Court. On 23 July 1998 the Regional Court received a report concerning the applicant’s case together with the case-file from the District Court. On 23 November 1998 a judge of the Regional Court fixed a hearing for 3 December 1998.
On 3 December 1998 the Regional Court adjourned the hearing, and on 8 April 1999, after a public hearing, it changed the District Court’s judgment deciding in the applicant’s favour. On 31 May 1999 the judgment was sent to the parties and on 7 June 1999 it became final.
According to section 17(1) of State Administration of Courts Act no. 80/1992, any natural person or corporation can turn to State authorities responsible for the administration of the courts (the Ministry of Justice, president and vice-president of the Supreme Court and presidents and vice-presidents of regional and district courts) with complaints about delayed proceedings or misconduct caused by improper performance and/or undignified interference with the proceedings by officers of the court.
According to sections 24-27 of the Act, the responsible authority is required to establish all relevant facts and, if necessary, hear the persons concerned. Examination of a complaint is to be terminated within two months, and an applicant is to be informed in writing about the conclusion. After the complaint has been dealt with by the President of a district court, the applicant is entitled to request a review of the conclusion by the president of an appropriate regional court.
Pursuant to Article 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the courts shall examine cases in co-operation with all participants so that the protection of rights is expeditious and effective.
According to section 5(1) of Courts and Judges Act no. 335/1991, as amended, judges are required to decide without delay.
Under section 6 a complaint about delays in court proceedings may be lodged with the authorities responsible for the State administration of courts.
The applicant applied to the Commission on 3 May 1994. He complained about the length of the restitution proceedings and lack of impartiality and independence of the courts acting in these proceedings. He alleged a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The Commission declared the application admissible as regards the length of the proceedings and inadmissible for the remainder on 4 March 1997. In its report of 27 October 1998 (former Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1.
