The case originated in three applications (nos. 16254/08, 53679/13 and 22243/14) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Serbian nationals, Mr Radosav Momčilović (“the first applicant”), Mr Livius Lapadat (“the second applicant”) and Mr Dragan Radin (“the third applicant”). Their further personal and other relevant details are set out in the appended table.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Ms V. Rodić, who was subsequently substituted by their current Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 20 October 2015 the second applicant’s representative informed the Court that the applicant had died on 25 May 2014, and on 14 January 2016 that his heirs were his wife, Ms Dojnica Lapadat, and son, Mr Livius Lapadat. On 30 January 2016 designated heirs expressed their wish to pursue the proceedings on behalf of the second applicant and submitted powers of attorney for the same lawyer. For practical reasons, Mr Livius Lapadat will continue to be referred to as the second applicant in this judgment, although his heirs are now to be regarded as such (see Tomašević v. Montenegro, no. 7096/08, §§ 13-16, 13 June 2017).
On 20 October 2015 the applications were communicated under Article 6 § 1 and 13 to the Government and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicants complained about the failure of the domestic courts to enforce final court judgments rendered in their favour.
All applicants obtained decisions of the Constitutional Court, which found a violation of their right to a hearing within a reasonable time and awarded them certain sums in respect of the non-pecuniary damage suffered (see the appended table).
The Court further notes that the proceedings in question are still pending before domestic courts as regards the first applicant. With respect to the second applicant, the Court will consider that the proceedings have been terminated on 30 November 2015. Namely, on that day the Zrenjanin Court of First Instance informed the Government that on an unspecified date the second applicant’s heirs had transferred their claim to their attorney and that they were therefore no longer parties to the domestic proceedings. Lastly, regarding the third applicant, the proceedings were terminated on 8 May 2013.
