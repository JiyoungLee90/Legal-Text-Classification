On 29 September 1999 the District Inspectorate for the Supervision of Construction ordered the housing co-operative to bring the existing situation of the premises into conformity with the law by submitting a set of required documents (post-construction documentation and expert opinions).

On 13 December 2000 the Mayor of Wrocław granted the housing co-operative the requested permission. Relying on all the documents collected in the case, the Mayor found that the premises met all the technical requirements and could be converted into a grocery shop.
On 3 January 2001 the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against that decision.
On 28 February 2001 the Dolnośląski Governor quashed the impugned decision and remitted the case to the first-instance body for reconsideration, finding the proceedings to be tainted with procedural shortcomings. He stressed, in particular, that no on-site inspection had been carried out.

By a letter of 23 July 2007 the applicant asked the Municipality Office whether the lessee of the premises had a licence to sell alcoholic beverages in the grocery shop. In reply, on 22 August 2007, the applicant was informed that the licence had been granted in 2006 following consultations with the relevant authorities.
On 29 August 2007 the District Inspectorate for the Supervision of Construction decided to reinitiate administrative proceedings.
On 30 January 2008 the District Inspectorate decided that the obligations imposed by the decision of 29 September 1999 had been complied with and that the construction works carried out in the premises had been brought into line with the law.

It awarded the applicant PLN 1,000 (approx. EUR 294) in just satisfaction. In determining the amount of just satisfaction the court relied on the nature of the case and the period of time the applicant had had to wait to have his case examined, but also on the “lack of initiative on the part of the applicant in terms of requesting the court to give his case priority or to examine the case under the simplified procedure”.
The  examined only the part of the administrative proceedings which had been held before the . It did not take into account the period during which the case had been handled by administrative bodies, because the 2004 Act referred only to “judicial proceedings”.
