The case originated in an application (no. 21199/03) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian company, S.C. Apron Dynamics SRL Baia Mare (“the applicant”), on 16 May 2003.
The applicant company was represented by Mr Georg Valentin Coza, its administrator. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 2 April 2009 the President of the Third Section decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the alleged lack of access to court and the length of the civil proceedings as well as the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention relative to the proceedings mentioned above. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant company was founded in 1992 and is based in Baia Mare.
On 14 March 1996 the applicant company lodged an action seeking to compel company A. (a State-owned private company) to return 2,934,854,487 Romanian lei (ROL), representing the price of merchandise delivered by the applicant and not paid by A., plus interest. The defendant objected, claiming that the debt had already been paid.
The applicant paid ROL 10,000 in court fees but was asked by the court to make a supplementary payment to cover a percentage of the total claim. On 31 May 1996 the court calculated the fee at ROL 270,162,136.
On 28 June 1996 the company contested the new court fee and argued that according to the law, as interpreted by the higher courts, it should only pay ROL 10,000.
On 4 October 1996 it reiterated its position on the matter.
On the same day the court started deliberations in the case.
On 11 October 1996 the court restored the case to its list and summoned the parties to a hearing on 29 November 1996 to discuss the need for an expert evaluation of the claims.
On 20 January 1997 company A. accepted the calculation of the debt.
An evaluation of the debt was ordered and the report was submitted to the court on 11 December 1997.
On several occasions during the proceedings the defendant asked that the applicant company be requested to pay court fees. Several adjournments were granted to this end.
On 26 September 1997 the defendant informed the court that insolvency proceedings had been initiated against it (see paragraph 19 below).
On 5 February 1998 the  cancelled the action for failure to pay the court fees. It also noted that the applicant company had never contested the level of the court fee.
The applicant company appealed, arguing that according to the law on which it based its initial action the court fee was set at a lump sum of ROL 10,000 irrespective of the amount claimed, a sum which it had already paid over at the start of the proceedings. The applicant paid the court fees for the appeal in the amount of ROL 10,000 and ROL 3,000 in judicial stamps.
On 27 May 1998 the Cluj Napoca Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal as unfounded. The decision was enforceable.
On 24 June 1998 the applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law.
On 9 May 2006 the applicant company sought information on the proceedings from the Maramureş County Court. In reply, on 12 May 2006 the County Court informed the applicant company that due to an administrative error the appeal on points of law had only been forwarded to the Supreme Court of Justice on 12 May 2006.
In a final decision of 15 February 2008 the High Court of Cassation and Justice dismissed the appeal as ill-founded. It noted that in so far as the debtor contested the claim, the firstinstance court was correct in seeking court fees proportionate to the value of the claim.
On 5 April 1995 one of company A.'s creditors sought institution of insolvency proceedings against company A., under the relevant Articles of the Commercial Code.
From 10 May 1995 to 25 June 1997 the proceedings were stayed at company A.'s request, as the Government had adopted programmes for the financial rehabilitation of the company (Government Ordinance no. 13/1995 on restructuring State-owned companies).
On 18 March 1998 the  declared company A. insolvent. Following the reports on the company's financial situation, on 9 July 1998 it started winding-up proceedings.
On 11 June 1998 the applicant company requested the inclusion in the creditors' list of its claim of 1,474,012.64  dollars (USD). The claim was contested by the “debtor”, company A.
On 9 February 1999 the applicant reiterated its claim, which was included provisionally in the creditors' list pending examination of the objections raised.
On 16 February 2000 the County Court rejected the applicant company's claim as no longer enforceable (prescrisă). It considered that enforcement time had not been interrupted by the action for recovery of debt, in so far as that action had been annulled for failure to pay the court fees.
On 22 November 2000 the Cluj Napoca Court of Appeal upheld the judgment. It reiterated that the claim was no longer enforceable. It also considered that the claim, which had been contested by the debtor, had not been certified and quantified in the proceedings for recovery of debt, because the applicant's action had been cancelled.
On 20 November 2002 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the decision, which thus became final.
On 30 May 2000 the Oradea Customs Office (Direcţia Generală Vamală Oradea) sought the winding up of the applicant company's business for an unpaid debt of ROL 458,121,902.
On 26 June 2000 the proceedings were stayed as the applicant company contested the debt (the applicant company won that action on 18 September 2002).
On 3 November 2003 the  started the winding-up proceedings. On 21 January 2004 the Cluj Napoca Court of Appeal quashed the decision and rejected the 30 May 2000 request.
The relevant legislation on court fees is described in Iorga v. Romania, no. 4227/02, §§ 2225, 25 January 2007.
The relevant articles of the Commercial Code, as in force before the 1995 amendments (see paragraph 31 below), read as follow:
Article 717
“From the date the insolvency is declared no action shall be allowed against the insolvent entity concerning its movable or immovable property or any enforcement action concerning the same property, unless the action is lodged before the insolvency judge (judecătorul sindic). Such actions that have already started against the insolvent entity shall continue before the insolvency judge.”
Article 780
“Even after the expiration of the time-limits ... creditors who have not presented their claims may ask the judge to verify them ...”
The insolvency procedure regulated by the Commercial Code was replaced by the Insolvency Act (Law no. 64/1995) published in 1995 and amended and republished in 1999. Its relevant articles, after republication, read as follows:
Article 42
“When the procedure is started all judicial or extrajudicial actions aimed at recovering debts from the debtor or his possessions shall be suspended.”
Article 131
“Insolvency proceedings started before the present law has entered into force shall continue under the provisions of the Romanian Commercial Code.”
The text of Article 131 was present in the initial version of the law as well, under Article 130.
Law no. 64/1995 has been replaced by Law no. 85 of 20 July 2006.
