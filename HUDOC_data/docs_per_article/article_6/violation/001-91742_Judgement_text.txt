The case originated in an application (no. 36772/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Vladimir Petrovich Krasovskiy (“the applicant”), on 1 October 2004.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev
On 6 December 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant, Mr Vladimir Petrovich Krasovskiy, is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1942 and lives in the town of Dniprodzerzhynsk, .
On 28 October 2003 the Dniprovsky District Court of Dniprodzerzhynsk awarded the applicant 2,199 Ukrainian hryvnas (UAH) in salary arrears and UAH 2,743.29 in other payments, to be paid by the open joint stock company Dniprovsky Mineral Fertilizers Plant (“the debtor”).
On 4 November 2003 the Bagliysky District Bailiffs’ Service of Dniprodzerzhynsk initiated enforcement proceedings.
On 25 October 2004 the debtor paid the applicant UAH 2,199 in salary arrears.
On unspecified date the debtor paid the applicant UAH 106,19.
On 7 April 2004 the  initiated bankruptcy proceedings against the debtor.
By a letter of 22 December 2005, the bailiffs notified the applicant that they were unable to collect the full amount of the award, referring to the fact that financial assets of the debtor were insufficient. They further explained that other assets could not be sold, as the State owned 40 % of the debtor’s share capital. The debtor was therefore subject to the Law of 29 November 2001 “on the Introduction of a Moratorium on the Forced Sale of Property”.
The judgment remains partly unenforced.
On an unspecified date the applicant instituted proceedings against the debtor in the Dniprovsky District Court of Dniprodzerzhynsk claiming payment of UAH 4,775.90.
On 16 December 2004 the court found against the applicant.
On 17 February 2005 the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld this judgment. On 20 July 2007 the Court of Appeal of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea dismissed the applicant’s appeal in cassation.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Sokur v. Ukraine (no. 29439/02, § 17-22, 26 April 2005).
