The case originated in an application (no. 40892/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by forty­seven Romanian nationals, Ms Andrea AnnaMaria Ţuluş and forty-six other applicants, on 9 November 2004.
The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr RăzvanHoraţiu Radu, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicants alleged that their right to a fair hearing had been breached in so far as the final decision of 2 July 2002 of the Cluj Court of Appeal was quashed and reversed by means of an extraordinary appeal (recurs în anulare).
The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicants, Ms Andrea AnnaMaria Ţuluş and forty-six other applicants are Romanian nationals. They are judges and auxiliary personnel of the Cluj County Court.
Twenty of the forty-seven applicants have two given names. However, only one of these names appeared in the decisions of the domestic courts. For example, the main applicant's full name is Andrea AnnaMaria Ţuluş, while in the domestic decisions she is referred to as Andrea Ţuluş.
In a judgment of 17 May 2002, the Cluj County Court allowed an action concerning the restitution of the amounts retained as health insurance contributions from the salaries of the applicants for the period between 1 January 2000 and 30 March 2001. The action was lodged by the applicants against the County Court of Cluj and the Ministry of Justice.
In a final decision of 2 July 2002, the Cluj Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal filed by the Ministry of Justice against that judgment.
At the end of 2003, the applicants obtained the restitution of the amounts retained from their salaries through forced execution.
On 2 July 2003, the Procurator-General lodged an application with the High Court of Cassation and Justice to have the final decision quashed (recurs în anulare) on the ground that the decision had seriously infringed the law and that it was, in any case, manifestly ill-founded.
In its decision of 11 May 2004, the High Court allowed the extraordinary appeal, quashed the final decision of 2 July 2002 and the judgment of 17 May 2002 and, as a result, rejected the applicants' action, on the ground that the ordinary court had incorrectly interpreted the applicable law.
In their last letter addressed to the Court, on 7 August 2008, the applicants stated that the High Court's decision of 11 May 2004 had never been executed and consequently they had not returned the amounts obtained through forced execution.
The relevant legal provisions are described in the judgment Brumărescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, §§ 32 and 33, ECHR 1999VII).
