The case originated in an application against Slovakia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovak national Mr Martin Smolko on 25 October 2016.
The applicant was represented by JUDr. Michal Polák, a lawyer practising in Bratislava.
On 9 February 2017 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government of the Slovak Republic (“the Government”).
The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Trnava.
He complained of the excessive length of civil proceedings concerning the alleged discrimination in remuneration and the claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The proceedings were initiated on 5 May 2008 before the Bratislava I District Court, have been processed before two levels of jurisdiction, and are still pending.
