The case originated in an application (no. 18696/08) against the Republic of Azerbaijan lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Azerbaijani national, Ms Yagut Rashid qizi Ismayilova (Yaqut Rəşid qızı İsmayılova - “the applicant”), on 4 March 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr N. Ismayilov, a lawyer practising in . The Azerbaijani Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr. Ç Asgarov.
The applicant alleged that the failure to enforce the judgment of 9 June 1999 violated her rights to a fair trial and to an effective remedy as guaranteed by Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention and her property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
On 4 September 2009 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in .
On 22 January 1998 the applicant was issued an occupancy voucher (yaşayış orderi) to an apartment in a recently constructed residential building in  on the basis of the Baku City Executive Authority's order of 19 January 1998.
At the same time, the applicant became aware that the apartment was occupied by M. and his family, who were internally displaced persons (“IDP”) from Lachin, a region under occupation of Armenian military forces following the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.
According to the applicant, despite her numerous demands, M. refused to vacate the apartment noting that he was an IDP and he had no other place to reside in.
On an unspecified date in 1999, the applicant lodged a lawsuit with the Yasamal District Court asking the court to order the eviction of M. and his family from the apartment.
On 9 June 1999 the Yasamal District Court granted the applicant's request. The court held that the applicant was the sole lawful tenant of the apartment on the basis of the occupancy voucher of 22 January 1998 and, therefore, the apartment was unlawfully occupied by M. and his family. No appeals were filed against this judgment and, pursuant to the domestic law in force at the material time, it became enforceable within ten days after its delivery.
According to the applicant, M. and his family refused to comply with the judgment and the competent authorities did not take any measures to enforce it.
It appears from the case file that in 2008 the applicant lodged compensation proceedings against the State Committee for Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons claiming EUR 72,000 for unlawful use of her flat by an IDP family. On 7 May 2008 the Yasamal District Court dismissed the applicant's claim as unsubstantiated. On 7 July 2008 the Court of Appeal and on 10 November 2008 the Supreme Court upheld the Yasamal District Court's judgment of 7 July 2008.
At the time of the latest communication with the applicant, the judgment of 9 June 1999 in the applicant's favour remained unenforced.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in Gulmammadova v. Azerbaijan (no. 38798/07, §§ 18-24, 22 April 2010).
