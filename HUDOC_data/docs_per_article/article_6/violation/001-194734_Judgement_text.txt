The case originated in an application (no. 51227/16) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by thirty two nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the applicants”), on 17 August 2016. Additional personal details are set out in the appendix to this judgment.
The applicants were represented by Ms D. Madžo, a lawyer practising in Jajce. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms B. Skalonjić.
On 13 April 2018 notice of the application was given to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The applicants worked for Borac-R d.o.o. Jajce (hereinafter “Borac-R”), a limited liability company producing textiles. The company was privatised in 2005 and is in the sole ownership of N.R.
Under eleven judgments delivered by the Jajce Municipal Court (hereinafter “the Municipal Court”) on 24 February 2009, 23 March 2009 and 29 September 2009, Borac-R was ordered to pay the applicants various sums in respect of unpaid work-related benefits, together with default interest at the statutory rate; it was also ordered to pay their pension contributions and legal costs.
Under eleven judgments delivered by the Cantonal Court in Novi Travnik (hereinafter “the Cantonal Court”), on 28 October 2009, 24 November 2009, 2 December 2009 and 24 February 2010, appeals lodged by the applicants were partially upheld in so far as they related to the payment of their health-insurance and legal costs.
On 4 and 8 February and 23 March 2010 the applicants lodged requests for the issuance of the writs of execution (rješenje o izvršenju) in their cases.
On 12 May 2010 the Municipal Court issued writs of execution for all the applicants.
On 17 May 2010 Borac-R lodged an objection (prigovor) against the writs of execution.
On 31 May 2010 the applicants lodged a request with the Municipal Court for the undertaking of an urgent inventory and assessment of Borac-R’s movable property, warning the court that burglaries were being committed at Borac-R’s premises.
On 2 June 2010 the Municipal Court adopted a decision ordering an inventory to be taken of Borac-R’s movable property.
By a judgement of 1 July 2010 the Municipal Court rejected an objection against that decision lodged by Borac-R. On 16 July 2010 Borac-R appealed against that judgment.
On 3 August 2010 the applicants lodged a request for the acceleration of the enforcement proceedings.
On 6 September 2010 the Municipal Court issued an order imposing a charge on Borac-R’s movable property (pljenidbeni popis), which was carried out on 24 September 2010. The most valuable movable property consisted of various machines used for producing textiles. On the same date the court bailiff changed the locks on Borac-R’s premises, as N.R., the owner of Borac-R (see paragraph 6 above), refused to open them.
On 8 December 2010 the Cantonal Court upheld an appeal lodged by Borac-R and quashed the decision of the Municipal Court of 1 July 2010, and remitted the case for reconsideration.
On 13 July 2011 the Municipal Court partially accepted the objection of Borac-R (see paragraph 11 above) in so far as it related to the statutory interest on the contributions for health-insurance of the applicants.
On 26 September 2011 the court bailiff lodged a criminal complaint with the Jajce Police Department against unknown individuals for damaging numerous machines and stealing various items that had been stored on Borac-R’s premises. He stated that the alleged offences had been committed over the previous four months and assessed the damage to the machines as amounting to 12,700 convertible marks (BAM), but could not assess the value of the damage to the electrical installations. He furthermore stated that over the previous “eight to ten months” Borac-R’s premises had not had any physical security “or any other form of protection”, since the enforcement debtor was subject to court proceedings.
On 5 October 2011 the court bailiff, accompanied by the police, again inspected Borac-R’s premises and noted that the entrance door had been ripped open, but did not note that anything had been stolen, apart from those missing items already noted on 26 September 2011 (see paragraph 19 above).
On 13 October 2011 the first public auction of Borac-R’s movable property was held, but it was unsuccessful.
On 17 October 2011 the applicants lodged a request for the holding of a second public auction.
On 9 November 2011 the court bailiff lodged a criminal complaint with the Jajce Police Department against unknown individuals for damaging one of the machines of Borac-R and for ripping electrical cables from one of the walls. He assessed the damage as amounting to a value of BAM 700. He reiterated that Borac-R’s premises did not have any form of protection.
On 10 November 2011 the court bailiff ordered the closure of all entries to Borac-R’s premises in order to prevent any further burglaries.
On 15 December 2011 a second public auction of Borac-R’s movable property was held; a portion of the movable property was sold for the total sum of BAM 19,425. The court bailiff, after consultation with the judge, then terminated the auction owing to disturbances caused by BoracR’s attorney.
On 16 December 2011 and 2 April, 21 September, and 1 and 18 October 2012 the applicants initially lodged requests with the Municipal Court for the continuation of the second public auction, but subsequently also requested that those requests be dealt with urgently in the light of the burglaries being committed in respect of Borac-R’s property. With the last request the applicants submitted a report by Jajce Police Department dated 21 September 2012 on all the burglaries committed against Borac-R until that point.
On 29 August 2012 the court bailiff lodged a criminal complaint with the Jajce Police Department against unknown individuals for damaging a large number of machines during the period from 15 July 2012 until that point. He stated that he could not assess the value of the damage before a new inventory was made.
On 14 September 2012 the Municipal Court delivered a decision ordering the continuation of the second public auction.
On 15 October 2012 the continuation of the second public auction was realised. The applicants bought all of the movable property that was on offer for BAM 20,000, but without depositing (pursuant to section 92 of the 2003 Enforcement Procedure Act) the sale price with the court.
On 19 October 2012 the Municipal Court delivered a decision on the award (rješenje o dosudi) regarding the items bought by the applicants, and that the handing over of those items would also be undertaken during a weekend, because the frequency of burglaries at the premises of Borac-R indicated a danger that those items could be damaged or stolen.
On 11 March, 7 May and 6 September 2013 the applicants lodged requests with the Municipal Court for the continuation of the enforcement proceedings through the making of a new inventory, the undertaking of an assessment, and the sale of that movable property not already sold; they also reminded the court of the burglaries that had already been committed.
On 29 May 2013 the Municipal Court delivered a decision ordering the partial settlement (djelimično namirenje) of the applicants’ claims from the items acquired at the 15 October 2012 auction (see paragraph 28 above) in the equal amount of BAM 625 for each applicant.
On 24 September 2013 the Municipal Court rejected a request lodged by the applicants for the continuation of the enforcement proceedings, concluding that the applicants’ claims had already been met through the 29 May 2013 decision on partial settlement. On 1 October 2013 the applicants lodged an objection against that decision.
On 7 October 2013 the Municipal Court delivered a decision ordering the partial settlement of the claims of S.L. (another of Borac-R’s judgment creditors) – in the amount of BAM 17,745 on the basis of the priority of his claim – from the proceeds of the auction of 15 December 2011 (see paragraph 25 above).
On 10 December 2013 and 19 March 2014 the applicants lodged requests with the Municipal Court for an urgent decision on their objection against its decision of 24 September 2013 (see paragraph 33 above).
On 21 March 2014 the Municipal Court rejected the applicants’ objection.
On 1 April 2014 the applicants appealed against that decision.
On 3 September 2014 the Cantonal Court upheld the applicants’ appeal, quashed the decision of the Municipal Court of 21 March 2014 (see paragraph 36 above), and remitted the case for reconsideration. The court found that the applicants’ claims were much higher than the amount awarded to them in the partial settlement (see paragraph 32 above).
On 4 December 2014 the Municipal Court quashed its initial decision of 24 September 2013 (see paragraph 33 above), and allowed the continuation of the enforcement proceedings through the making of a new inventory, undertaking an assessment, and the sale of the movable property of BoracR. The court noted that it was aware of the burglaries that had been committed against Borac-R, but indicated that it could not be held responsible for them. It indicated that the applicants were invited to take the possession of the movable property of Borac-R for safekeeping (pursuant to section 122 of the 2003 Enforcement Procedure Act), including the machines, but that they had refused, as they argued that they had nowhere to store them.
On 23 January 2015 the Municipal Court delivered a decision ordering the court bailiff to make an inventory, assessment and charge on Borac-R’s movable property within fifteen days.
On 30 January 2015 the court bailiff inspected the premises of Borac-R and determined that the items found there had been completely devastated and destroyed and that no valuable movable property was present that could be subject to enforcement.
On 15 December 2015 the Municipal Court terminated the enforcement proceedings in respect of Borac-R’s movable property, as the applicants had not proposed that enforcement be continued in that respect.
In the meantime, on 28 April 2015 the applicants proposed a new means of enforcement, lodging a request for the imposition of charge and transfer of Borac-R’s claim, in the amount of BAM 8,872 with statutory interest, against N.R. (as the owner of Borac-R). That sum represented 50% of the amount that Borac-R and N.R. jointly owed to S.L. (see paragraph 34 above), who had received the full amount of this claim only from Borac-R in the enforcement proceedings. The applicants considered that Borac-R, as their debtor, thus had a statutory right to compensation from N.R.
On 30 June 2015 the Municipal Court refused the applicants’ request. The court reasoned that Borac-R had a right of redress in respect of N.R., but that it could be realised only in separate civil proceedings, and only if Borac-R decided to initiate them; until such proceedings were finalised the applicants could not request the transfer of such a claim against N.R. himself.
On 14 July 2015 the applicants lodged an objection against that decision.
On 22 September 2015 the applicants brought an action against N.R., since Borac-R had failed itself to initiate civil proceedings against N.R. (they considered that failure to be prejudicial to their interests – see paragraph 44 above).
On 15 December 2015 the Municipal Court rejected the applicants’ objection of 14 July 2015 (see paragraph 45 above).
On 12 January 2016 the applicants appealed against that decision.
On 22 December 2016 the Cantonal Court upheld the applicants’ appeal, quashed the decision of the Municipal Court of 15 December 2015 (see paragraph 47 above), and remitted the case for reconsideration.
On 14 April 2017 the applicants submitted a request for the urgent adoption of an enforcement decision in their case.
On 26 December 2017 the Travnik Municipal Court dismissed the applicants’ action (see paragraph 46 above). It appears that the applicants did not appeal against this decision.
On 10 January 2018 the Municipal Court allowed the applicants’ request of 28 April 2015 (see paragraph 43 above).
On an unspecified date Borac-R and N.R. lodged separate appeals against that decision, arguing that the claim requested by the applicants did not exist.
On 15 March 2018 the Cantonal Court rejected the appeals. It explained that the decision in the enforcement proceedings had not transferred Borac-R’s claim to the applicants, but rather had granted them the right to request it. If N.R. were to fail to accede to such a request, the applicants would have to initiate separate civil proceedings against him.
On 2 July 2018 the Municipal Court informed the applicants that N.R. had not lodged with it a claim that was subject to enforcement.
According to the information provided by the applicants on 31 October 2018, the enforcement proceedings in the applicants’ case ended on 2 July 2018 (see paragraph 55 above).
On 28 May 2015 the applicants lodged an appeal with the Constitutional Court.
On 3 February 2016 the Constitutional Court rejected that appeal. The court found that the enforcement proceedings were relatively complex, that they were of great importance for the applicants, and that they had not in any way contributed to their length. However, it considered that the courts had not prolonged the proceedings, and that there were “objective circumstances” – namely the burglary of Borac-R’s property – that had contributed to the length of the proceedings.
On 7 July 2014 the Municipal Court found D.B. guilty of committing the criminal offence of aggravated burglary against Borac-R on 6 December 2013. It gave him a five-month suspended prison sentence, with a probation period of one year.
On 24 April 2015 the Municipal Court found M.T., M.B. and T.B. guilty of committing the criminal offence of burglary against Borac-R on 29 September 2013. It gave them three-month suspended prison sentences, with probation periods of one year.
On 28 September 2015 the Municipal Court found H.K. and M.T. guilty of committing a criminal offence of burglary against Borac-R on 17 and 24 February 2015. It gave them suspended three-month prison sentences, with probation periods of one year. On 16 May 2016 the Cantonal Court partially upheld an appeal lodged by the cantonal prosecutor’s office in relation to M.T., and sentenced him to five months imprisonment.
On 1 November 2016 the Municipal Court found M.B. and M.J. guilty of committing the criminal offence of burglary against Borac-R on 26 March 2015. It gave M.J. a suspended prison sentence of three months, with a probation period of one year; it sentenced M.B. to three months in prison.
On 26 June 2014 the Jajce Police Department submitted a report to the cantonal prosecutor’s office against M.M., after a criminal complaint was lodged against him for a burglary allegedly committed against Borac-R on 27 May 2014. It appears that no criminal proceedings were initiated in this regard.
On 2 September 2015 the Jajce Police Department submitted a report to the cantonal prosecutor’s office against A.O. and H.K., after a criminal complaint was lodged against them for an aggravated burglary allegedly committed against Borac-R on 8 July 2015. It appears that no criminal proceedings were initiated in this regard.
According to the information provided by the Government on 17 September 2018, on that date the individuals against whom criminal complaints were lodged by the court bailiff for burglaries committed against Borac-R in 2011 and 2012 (see paragraphs 19, 23 and 27 above) had not yet been identified.
The 2003 Enforcement Procedure Act specifically provides that all enforcement proceedings are “urgent” (section 5). Monetary claims (such as those lodged in the course of the present case) are enforced in chronological order (section 66). Similarly, if a creditor requests that his or her claim be enforced against the movable or immovable property of a debtor, he or she is issued with an order imposing a charge on the property in question; in such cases the creditor with the oldest charging order will be paid first (sections 98, 124 and 134). If the buyer of the property is the judgment creditor, and there are no other creditors who have chronologically prior claims, he is not obligated to deposit the sale price to the court up to the level of his claim (section 92).
Section 122 provides that the court bailiff must leave inventoried items with the judgment debtor for safekeeping, unless, upon an application lodged by the judgment creditor, the court has ordered that the objects be given for safekeeping to the judgment creditor or a third party. In the latter situation the judgment creditor will bear the risk of destruction or damage to the objects given to him or her or a third person for safekeeping, unless such destruction or damage was a consequence of force majeure. It furthermore provides that cash, securities and other valuable items are to be stored in the court safe, as well as other items of greater value if they are suitable for such safekeeping.
Section 44 provides that the court bailiff is authorised to remove an individual who impedes the enforcement procedure, and the police are required to provide the bailiff with all necessary assistance. If it proves necessary, the court bailiff may order the use of force against such an individual.
