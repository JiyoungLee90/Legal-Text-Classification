Insolvency proceedings are regulated by the Bankruptcy Act (Act No. 328/1991 Coll. was in force until 1 January 2006, when it was replaced by Act No. 7/2005 Coll.). According to the relevant provisions, the administrator in insolvency administers the insolvency assets, converts the insolvency assets into money and satisfies the creditors’ claims. Pursuant to § 66f of the 1991 Bankruptcy Act and § 196 of the 2005 Bankruptcy Act, the Code of Civil Procedure is the lex generalis in relation to the Bankruptcy Act in respect of bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings.
The general responsibilities of a bankruptcy court can be found in §§ 8 and 12 of the 1991 Bankruptcy Act and in §§ 40-42 of the 2005 Bankruptcy Act. In bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings the court appoints and removes the administrator. It can, inter alia, impose a fine on the administrator for a failure to fulfil his or her duties, ask the administrator to submit reports and explanations and consult the administrator’s accounts. The court can also order the administrator to act in a certain manner.
