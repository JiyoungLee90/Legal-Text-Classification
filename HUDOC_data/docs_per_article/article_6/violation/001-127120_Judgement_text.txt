The case originated in an application (no. 9429/10) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Krisztián Máté (“the applicant”), on 10 February 2010. The applicant was represented by Ms I. Patócs, a lawyer practising in Tapolca.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 5 April 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1981 and lives in Szombathely.
At the material time, he was serving his prison sentence for fraud and forgery of public documents.
On 20 December 2006 the applicant was interrogated as a suspect by the Budapest X District Police Department on charges of fraud. Subsequently, a bill of indictment was preferred.
On 2 June and 12 October 2010, 14 January, 22 April, 16 September 2011 and 24 February 2012 the Pest Central District Court held hearings. On 24 February 2012 the applicant was found guilty as charged and sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment.
The applicant lodged a petition for review against the judgment. On 11 October 2012 the Supreme Court declared the applicant’s petition inadmissible, without examining the merits, since it was incompatible ratione materiae with the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
