The case originated in an application (no. 28359/05) against Montenegro and  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Ivan Milić (“the applicant”), on 19 July 2005.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Ms G. Ćušić, a lawyer practising in . The Montenegrin Government were represented by their Agent, Mr Z. Pažin. The Serbian Government were represented by their Agent, Mr. S. Carić.
The applicant complained about non-enforcement of a final judgment ordering his reinstatement and a lack of an effective domestic remedy in that regard.
On 15 March 2010 the application was communicated to the Governments of Montenegro and . It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant, Mr Ivan Milić, was born in 1966 and lives in .
On 20 June 2002 the Court of First Instance (Osnovni sud) in Podgorica ordered that the applicant be reinstated by the Clinical Centre of Montenegro (Kliničko bolnički Centar Crne Gore), a State-run medical institution.
On 4 February 2003 this judgment became final, and on 16 December 2003 it was confirmed by the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud) in Podgorica at third instance.
On 23 April 2003 the Clinical Centre of Montenegro informed the applicant that it could not comply with the judgment in question, but would rather seek an alternative solution.
On 22 May 2003 the Court of First Instance issued an enforcement order, which decision was confirmed on 26 June 2003.
On 19 August 2003 the Clinical Centre of Montenegro concluded an agreement with the  in Risan, also a State-run medical institution, whereby the latter accepted the applicant as its employee.
On 30 September 2003 the applicant informed the State Prosecutor that he did not approve of this arrangement.
On 17 October 2003 the  in Risan issued a decision to the effect that the applicant would become its employee as of 30 October 2003.
On 20 October 2003 the applicant received this decision.
On 21 October 2009, as submitted by the Montenegrin Government, the applicant concluded an Agreement on Termination of Employment with the Clinical Centre of Montenegro whereby his employment had been terminated as from 3 February 2003 and both parties waived any further claims in this regard.
On 26 October 2009 the applicant withdrew his enforcement request.
On 5 November 2009 the Court of First Instance terminated the enforcement proceedings and all the enforcement activities which had been carried out in that regard. On 17 November 2009 this decision became final.
On 6 May 2004, upon the applicant’s separate claim, the Court of First Instance in Podgorica ordered the Clinical Centre of Montenegro to pay the applicant 4,456 euros (“EUR”) for salary arrears for the period between September 2001 and 3 February 2003. This judgment was upheld by the High Court on 5 October 2004. It would appear from the case file that this judgment was enforced on an unspecified date thereafter.
On 3 February 2003 the applicant started to work in the Clinical Centre of Serbia for a period of nine months. It would appear from the case file that on an unspecified date thereafter his temporary employment was transformed into a permanent one.
