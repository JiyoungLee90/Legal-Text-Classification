The case originated in an application (no. 33868/08) against the Republic of Slovenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Janko Kolar (“the applicant”), on 8 July 2008.
The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney.
On 13 May 2015 the complaints concerning the length of judicial proceedings and the lack of effective remedy in this connection were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Beloljin, Republic of Serbia.
In 1997 the Maribor unit of the Surveying and Mapping Authority (hereinafter the “Maribor unit”) issued several decisions concerning the delimitation of real estate belonging to the applicant and to company D., and ordering changes in respect of the use of land. The applicant appealed against some of those decisions.
On 28 September 2000 the Ministry for the Environment and Spatial Planning (hereinafter the “Ministry”) granted the applicant’s appeal in part and annulled a decision issued on 12 February 1997 while it dismissed the appeal concerning two decisions issued on 31 January 1997.
On 23 November 2000 the applicant challenged the aforementioned decision of the Ministry in the part dismissing his appeal by instituting proceedings before the Administrative Court.
On 6 November 2003 the Administrative Court granted the applicant’s appeal, annulled the challenged part of the decision of 28 September 2000 (see paragraph 6 above) and referred the case back to the Ministry who, in turn, referred it to the Maribor unit. The applicant appealed.
On 24 May 2006 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the Administrative Court’s judgment. This decision was served on the applicant on 4 July 2006. The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint.
On 19 December 2007 the Constitutional Court dismissed the constitutional complaint. The decision was served on the applicant on 10 January 2008.
On 10 July 2015, referring to section 25 of the 2006 Act, which regulates the domestic settlement proceedings in cases where an application to an international court had been lodged before the 2006 Act entered into force (see paragraph 14 below), the State Attorney’s Office sent the applicant a settlement offer. In the offer they emphasised that the proceedings before the Constitutional Court could not have given rise to a violation of the “reasonable time” requirement. In respect of redress they offered to provide the applicant with a written statement in which they would acknowledge that his right to a trial within a reasonable time had been violated in the proceedings before the Administrative Court and the Supreme Court. The offer was served on the applicant on 24 July 2015.
The applicant did not accept the offer.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in Robert Lesjak v. Slovenia (no. 33946/03, §§ 18-25, 21 July 2009) and Tomažič v. Slovenia (no. 38350/02, § 23, 13 December 2007).
In addition, section 25 of the 2006 Act, as amended on 9 June 2012, reads as follows (see also Novak v. Slovenia [Committee], no. 5420/07, § 14, 25 April 2013):
“(1) In cases where a violation of the right to a trial without undue delay has already ceased by 31 March 2007 and the party has made a claim for just satisfaction with the international court before the date of implementation of this Act, the State Attorney’s Office shall offer the party a settlement on the amount of just satisfaction within four months of the date of receipt of the case referred by the international court for the settlement procedure. The party shall submit a settlement proposal to the State Attorney’s Office within two months of the date of receipt of the proposal of the State Attorney’s Office. The State Attorney’s Office shall decide on the proposal as soon as possible and within a period of four months at the latest ...
(2) If the proposal for settlement referred to in paragraph 1 of this section is not acceded to or the State Attorney’s Office and the party fail to negotiate an agreement within four months of the date on which the party filed its proposal, the party may bring an action before the court with jurisdiction under this Act. The party may bring an action within six months of receipt of the State Attorney’s Office reply that the party’s proposal referred to in the previous paragraph was not acceded to, or after the expiry of the period fixed in the previous paragraph for the State Attorney’s Office to decide to proceed with settlement. Irrespective of the type or amount of the claim, the provisions of the Civil Procedure Act concerning small claims shall apply in proceedings before a court.”
