The case originated in an application (no. 32883/08) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Goran Šilović (“the applicant”), on 19 March 2008.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Ms V. Rodić who was recently substituted by their current agent Ms N. Plavšić.
On 18 December 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Beograd.
On 10 June 2002 the applicant filed a claim with the former Supreme Military Court in Belgrade for payment of certain benefits.
On 10 August 2007 the Supreme Court of Serbia which took over the jurisdiction of the Supreme Military Court in Belgrade rejected the applicant’s claim. The applicant received the said judgment on 2 October 2007.
