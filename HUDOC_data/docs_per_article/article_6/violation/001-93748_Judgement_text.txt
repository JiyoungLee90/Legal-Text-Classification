The case originated in three separate applications (nos. 16909/06, 38989/06 and 39235/06). The first application was lodged with the Court against the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro and the other two were brought against Serbia, under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”), by Ms Safa Grišević and 2 others (“the applicants”; see paragraph 5 below), on 14 April 2006 and 23 September 2006, respectively.
As of 3 June 2006, following the Montenegrin declaration of independence,  remained the sole respondent in the proceedings before the Court.
The first applicant was represented by Ms R. Paljevac-Emrović, while the other two were represented by Ms R. Garibović. Both representatives are lawyers practising in Novi Pazar. The Government of the State Union of Serbia and  and, subsequently, the Government of Serbia (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 17 October 2006 and 13 November 2006 the Court decided to communicate the applications to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it also decided to rule on their admissibility and merits at the same time.
The applicants, Ms Safa Grišević (“the first applicant”), Mr Dragoš Vranić (“the second applicant”) and Ms Mladomirka Vučićević (“the third applicant”) are all Serbian citizens who were born in 1962, 1954 and 1965, respectively, and currently live in the Municipality of Novi Pazar, .
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 1 February 1995 the first applicant employed with Raška Holding AD, on 1 January 1998 the second applicant employed with Raška Holding AD – Tkačnica DOO, and on 17 November 1995 the third applicant employed with DP Savremena Konfekcija Raška, were all placed by their respective socially-owned employers on compulsory paid leave until such time when normal production could be resumed and the said companies’ business performance had improved sufficiently.
Whilst on this leave, in accordance with the relevant domestic legislation, the applicants were entitled to a significantly reduced monthly income, as well as the payment of their pension, disability and other social security contributions.
Since the companies failed to fulfil these obligations, the applicants brought numerous separate civil claims before the Municipal Court (Opštinski sud) in Novi Pazar (hereinafter “the Municipal Court”).
On 30 March 2004 the Municipal Court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered her employer to pay her:
the “paid leave benefits” (“naknadu za vreme plaćenog odsustva”) due from 1 February 1995 to 19 January 2004, amounting to 80% of the salary which she would otherwise have earned, plus statutory interest;
7,800.00 Dinars [RSD] (approximately 99 euros [EUR]) for her legal costs; and
the pension and disability insurance contributions (“doprinose za penzijsko i invalidsko osiguranje”) due for that period.
By 20 April 2004 this judgment became final.
On 14 May 2004 the applicant requested the Municipal Court to enforce the said judgment and proposed that this be carried out either by means of a bank account transfer, for which purpose she produced her employer’s relevant bank details, or through the auctioning of the debtor’s movable and/or immovable assets.
On 10 June 2004 the Municipal Court accepted the applicant’s request and ordered the enforcement sought.
Thereafter, the Municipal Court transmitted this order to the Central Bank (Narodna banka Srbije).
On 1 December 2005 the applicant filed a written submission with the Municipal Court, stating, inter alia, that:
the debtor had, in the meantime, publicly leased out its real estate to third parties and must have thereby obtained sufficient funds for the purposes of enforcement; and
it was unclear whether these funds were being paid to the debtor in cash or through a bank account transfer, which is why the enforcement at issue should instead be attempted through the auctioning of the debtor’s movable and specified immovable property.
On 17 November 2006 the Central Bank informed the Municipal Court that certain information was missing.
On 24 November 2006 the Municipal Court requested the applicant to complete the information.
On 4 December 2006 the applicant provided the Municipal Court with the information sought and on 6 December 2006 the latter adopted a new enforcement order.
On 14 December 2006 the Municipal Court transmitted this order to the Central Bank.
It would appear that the enforcement proceedings are still pending.

On 8 February 2005 the Municipal Court accepted the applicant’s request and issued an enforcement order.
On 12 February 2005 the Municipal Court transmitted this order to the Central Bank, but on an unspecified date the latter informed the former that certain information needed for the enforcement was missing.
Following the applicant’s request of 30 June 2006, on 5 July 2006 the Municipal Court terminated the proceedings as regards the enforcement of the pension and disability insurance contributions only.
On 15 December 2006 the applicant was declared redundant.
On the same date she signed an agreement with the debtor concerning her salary arrears with interest, as well as her other labour-related benefits and/or contributions. The agreement provided, inter alia, that the applicant shall be paid a certain amount in accordance with the Government’s “social programme”, in return for which the applicant would renounce her right to seek judicial enforcement of any final judgments rendered in her favour before 15 December 2006.
It would appear that the applicant received payment.
Relying on the debtor’s request of 5 May 2005 and the above-mentioned agreement, on 6 May 2008 and 7 May 2008, respectively, the Municipal Court terminated the enforcement ordered on 29 October 2004 and 8 February 2005, respectively.
The District Court upheld these decisions on 4 July and 21 July 2008, respectively.
On 30 November 2004 and 21 February 2005, the applicants’ lawyer sent two separate letters to the Ministry of Finance, stating, inter alia, that the companies at issue:
have, for the past ten years, deliberately avoided doing business through their official bank accounts;
have instead, apparently, engaged in cash transactions or even the use of other “secret” bank accounts, unknown to the tax authorities; and
that, as a result of this, judicial enforcement by means of a bank transfer has been rendered impossible.
Finally, the applicants’ lawyer requested that urgent action be taken to secure the enforcement of the final judgments in question.
On 21 March 2005 the Ministry of Finance responded that the representative’s letters had been duly considered but, in view of the confidential nature of the information obtained, no details could be disclosed.
On 6 June 2005 the applicants’ lawyer sent another complaint to the Ministry of Finance, stating that the situation concerning the bank accounts in question had remained unchanged.
On 2 November 2004 the Privatisation Agency ordered the restructuring of the first and second applicants’ employers, as part of the privatisation process. On 13 December 2006 privatisation was stayed, but on 14 March 2007 it was resumed.
As of April 2009, the first and second applicants’ debtors were still predominantly socially-owned, whilst the third applicant’s debtor, having been privatised, was predominantly comprised of private capital.

Serbia (nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, 15 January 2008, §§ 57-82), Crnišanin and Others v.
