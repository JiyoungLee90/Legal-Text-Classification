The case originated in an application (no. 42946/98) against the Republic of Cyprus lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Cypriot national, Maro Louka (“the applicant”), on 27 July 1998.
The applicant was represented by Christos Theodoulou, a lawyer practising in Larnaca (Cyprus). The Government of Cyprus (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr A. Markides, Attorney General of the Republic of Cyprus.
The applicant alleged that the proceedings she had instituted in connection with a civil claim were not fair and that her case had not been heard within the “reasonable time” required by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber called upon to examine the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted according to the provision of Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 12 October 1999 the Chamber declared the application partly admissible as to the length issue.
On 12 September 1987 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against K.M. before the District Court of Larnaca, claiming CYP 4,720. The money had been paid to K.M. by the applicant’s father as a loan.
On 27 December 1991 the District Court granted the applicant’s claim.
On 21 January 1992 the defendant filed an appeal against this judgment. The parties were informed that the appeal would be heard on 21 March 1996. On that date the Supreme Court adjourned the hearing at the parties’ request.
On 11 April 1996 K.M. applied to amend his grounds of appeal. On 9 May 1996 the applicant opposed this request. The hearing was fixed on 25 June 1996. On that date the Supreme Court ordered an adjournment until 18 July 1996 at the defendant’s request. On 28 February 1997 the Supreme Court allowed the defendant to amend his grounds of appeal.
On 6 March 1997 the defendant filed new grounds of appeal.
The Supreme Court heard the case on 17 December 1997. On 19 February 1998 it ordered a retrial and sent the case back to the Larnaca District Court.
On 23 February 1998 the defendant died.
On 11 September 1998, in the context of a settlement reached between the applicant and the administrator of the estate of the deceased K.M., it was declared before the Larnaca District Court that the case had been fully settled.
On 11 May 1999 the action was brought before the Larnaca District Court to enable the parties to declare on the record that a settlement had been reached. The applicant’s counsel failed to appear before the Court, therefore the Court dismissed her action.
