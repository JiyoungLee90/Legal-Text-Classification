The case originated in an application (no. 29143/09) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Hungarian nationals, Mr Imre Karacs, Mrs Edit Karacsné Isaszegi, Ms Zsófia Karacs, Mr Gergely Karacs and Ms Luca Karacs (“the applicants”), on 26 May 2009 (as regards the first applicant) and 23 December 2014 (as regards the remaining applicants), respectively. The second, third, fourth and fifth applicants were represented by the first applicant.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Justice.
On 26 January 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1965, 1967, 1996, 1998 and 2000 respectively and live in Isaszeg. The first and second applicants are spouses and parents of the third, fourth and fifth applicants.
The applicants lived as specially protected tenants in a flat owned by the local government of Budapest 12th District. Due to the seriously deteriorated condition of the flat, in December 1995 they concluded an agreement with a view to moving to another property of the local government. Subsequently, a dispute arose between the parties concerning the applicants’ rights flowing from the tenancy.
In a first set of civil proceedings, the first applicant challenged the validity of the agreement concluded in December 1995. The Buda Central District Court dismissed the first applicant’s claim on 27 March 1996. The judgment became final at first instance.
In September 1997 the first applicant brought a new action against the local government in relation to the tenancy agreement. This action was also dismissed by the Buda Central District Court; and the first instance judgment was upheld by the Budapest High Court in 2000, on a date not specified in the application.
On 28 August 2001 the first applicant brought a third action before the Budapest High Court, claiming damages sustained in connection to the tenancy dispute.
On 6 August 2002 the second, third, fourth and fifth applicants joined the first applicant’s action.
Both the Budapest High Court and the Budapest Court of Appeal, the latter acting as a second instance court, turned down the applicants’ claims. The dates of the judgments were not specified in the application.
The applicants lodged a petition for review. On 1 October 2014 the Kúria confirmed the final judgment. The judgment was served on the applicants on 4 December 2014.
