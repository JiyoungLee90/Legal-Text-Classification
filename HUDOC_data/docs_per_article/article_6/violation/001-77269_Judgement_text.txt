On 22 February 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Mirnyy, in the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic.
On 28 November 2002 the Mirninskiy District Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic granted the applicant's civil action against the Ministry of Finance and awarded her 127,825 Russian roubles (“RUR”, approximately 4,055 euros).
On 25 December 2002 the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic upheld the judgment on appeal.
On 18 February 2003 the applicant's representative submitted a writ of execution to the Ministry of Finance.
At the time the application was lodged with the Court the judgment remained unenforced.
