The case originated in an application (no. 26042/06) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Dragan Vilotijević (“the applicant”), on 5 June 2006.
