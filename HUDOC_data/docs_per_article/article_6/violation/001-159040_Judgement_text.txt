The case originated in seven applications (nos. 36299/03, 14222/04, 15030/04, 36581/04, 1407/05, 2071/05 and 24618/05) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eight Russian nationals (“the applicants”). The applicants’ names and the dates of their applications to the Court appear in Appendix I.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev and Ms V. Milinchuk, former Representatives of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, and Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants complained inter alia of the quashing of binding and enforceable judgments by way of supervisory review in 2003-2007 and their nonenforcement or delayed enforcement.
.  On various dates these complaints were communicated to the respondent Government.
.  The applicants, whose names and years of birth are tabulated in Appendix I, took part in the cleaning-up operation at the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site. They were subsequently registered disabled, becoming entitled to various social benefits.
.  On various dates the applicants successfully sued the authorities for inflation adjustment of these benefits. The judgments became final.
.  On various dates the Presidia of Regional Courts allowed the defendant authorities’ applications for supervisory review and quashed the judgments, considering that the lower courts misapplied the material law.
.  Some of the judgments remained unenforced until the date of their quashing or were enforced with delay.
.  The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure from 2003 is summed up in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007).
