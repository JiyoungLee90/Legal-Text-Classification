The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) on 11 March 1996, within the threemonth period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 25574/94) against the Italian Republic lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by an Italian national, Mr Maurizio De Santa, on 24 May 1993.
The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby Italy recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 35 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court B, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings.
On 30 March 1996 the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, decided, under Rule 21 § 7 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to consider the instant case and the cases of Spurio, Gallo, Lapalorcia, Abenavoli, Zilaghe, Laghi, Viero, Orlandini, Ryllo, Soldani, Fusco, Di Luca and Saluzzi, Nicodemo, Pizzi, Scarfò, Argento and Trombetta v. Italy. The Chamber to be constituted for that purpose included ex officio Mr C. Russo, the elected judge of Italian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On the same day, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr N. Valticos, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr A.B. Baka, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha, Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici, Mr P. Kūris and Mr E. Levits (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Italian Government (“the Government”), the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 § 1 and 40). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 24 July 1996 and the Government’s memorial on 25 July. On 25 June 1996 the Secretary to the Commission had informed the Registrar that the Delegate did not intend to submit written observations.
On 21 October 1996 the Commission produced the file on the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the President’s instructions.
On 27 November 1996 the Chamber decided to dispense with a hearing in the case, having satisfied itself that the conditions for this derogation from its usual procedure had been met (Rules 27 and 40).
Mr Maurizio De Santa is the secretary of the municipal welfare agency (Ente Comunale Assistenza) of the city of Udine, where he lives.

8.  On 27 December 1977 he applied to the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Regional Administrative Court (“the RAC”) for judicial review of a decision of his employer’s board of governors, which, on 6 September 1997, in adopting the staff regulations, had assigned to him a level of remuneration lower than that to which he considered himself to be entitled on the basis of the collective agreements on contracts of employment negotiated at national level by the unions concerned (accordi nazionali di lavoro del personale degli enti locali). He also contested the discrimination between himself and other employees, who were paid on the basis of the salary scales laid down in the contracts in question.
On 10 March 1982 the RAC ordered the municipal welfare agency to file certain documents. In a judgment of 17 November 1982, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 16 May 1983, it dismissed the applicant’s application as being ill-founded.
On 28 June 1984 Mr De Santa appealed to the Consiglio di Stato. On 12 December 1984 Udine District Council, which had by then succeeded the municipal welfare agency, lodged a counter-appeal. It contended, as a preliminary point, that the applicant’s appeal was inadmissible for failure to comply with the time-limit; as regards the merits, it argued that the appeal should be dismissed as being ill-founded.
On 19 July 1984 the applicant filed an application for a date to be fixed for the hearing. On 22 October 1987 he requested that the case be set down for an urgent hearing. In a judgment of 10 June 1994, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 29 November 1994, the Consiglio di Stato dismissed the objection of inadmissibility and dismissed the applicant’s appeal.
Mr De Santa applied to the Commission on 24 May 1993. He complained of the length of the proceedings in the administrative courts and relied on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
On 6 July 1995 the Commission declared the application (no. 25574/94) admissible. In its report of 28 November 1995 (Article 31) it expressed the opinion by twenty-four votes to five that there had been a breach of Article 6. The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.
The Government asked the Court, as their primary submission, to rule that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was not applicable to the case and, in the alternative, to hold that there had been no breach of it.
