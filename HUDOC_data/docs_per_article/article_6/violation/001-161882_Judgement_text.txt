The case originated in an application (no. 63833/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Roman Vitalyevich Gruzda (“the applicant”), on 20 November 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mrs T. Borisenko, a lawyer practising in Krasnodar. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 21 June 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Krasnodar.
On 24 March 2009 the Military Court of Novorossiysk Garrison (Новороссийский гарнизонный военный суд) convicted the applicant of laundering of the proceeds of crime and sentenced him to a fine.
.  On 21 May 2009 the Military Court of the North-Caucasian Command (Северо-Кавказский окружной военный суд) acquitted the applicant on appeal.
.  On 21 July 2009 the Presidium of the Military Court of the NorthCaucasian Command, on a public prosecutor’s initiative, annulled the judgment of 21 May 2009 by way of supervisory review and remitted the case for fresh consideration to the appeal court. The annulment was reasoned by two main arguments: (1) unresolved contradictions between witnesses’ statements pertaining to the applicant’s criminal intent, and (2) absence in the appeal judgment of a summary of the arguments presented by the prosecution during the appeal proceedings.
.  On 6 August 2009 the Military Court of the North-Caucasian Command, acting on appeal, reversed the judgment of 24 March 2009 and remitted the case for fresh consideration to the trial court.
.  In 2010 the criminal proceedings against the applicant were terminated due to decriminalization of his actions under the domestic law.
The relevant domestic law governing supervisory review in criminal proceedings at the material time has been summarised in the case Berdzenishvili v. Russia (dec.), no. 31697/03, ECHR 2004II (extracts).
