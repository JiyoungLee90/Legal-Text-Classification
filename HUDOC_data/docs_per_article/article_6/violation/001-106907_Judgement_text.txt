The case originated in an application (no. 16286/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Jerzy Włodarczyk (“the applicant”), on 20 March 2007.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 29 June 2009 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.
In accordance with Protocol No. 14, the application was allocated to a Committee.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Ozorkow.
On 20 September 2005 the Łódź Regional Court convicted the applicant of several counts of robbery and membership of an organised criminal gang and sentenced him to five years and eight months’ imprisonment.
On 21 February 2006 the Łódź Court of Appeal quashed the firstinstance judgment and remitted the case. On 21 July 2006 the Łódź Regional Court again convicted the applicant and sentenced him to five years and eight months’ imprisonment.
On 9 January 2007 the Łódź Court of Appeal upheld the firstinstance judgment. On 24 January 2007 the appellate court sent its judgment, together with its written grounds, to the applicant. It was served on him on 10 February 2007.
Meanwhile, on 7 February 2007 the court assigned a legalaid lawyer to the case for the purposes of lodging a cassation appeal before the Supreme Court.
On 14 February 2007 the applicant requested the court to assign a new legal-aid lawyer to prepare a cassation appeal.
In a letter to the court dated 16 February 2007 the lawyer assigned to the case informed the court that he had found no grounds on which to draft a cassation appeal in the applicant’s case. The court forwarded the letter to the applicant. It was served on him on 26 February 2007. The court did not inform the applicant of his further procedural rights.
On 13 March 2007 the Łódź Court of Appeal refused the applicant’s request to assign a new legal-aid lawyer to the case.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the procedure for lodging cassation appeals with the Supreme Court against judgments of the appellate courts are stated in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Kulikowski v. Poland, no. 18353/03, §§ 19-27, ECHR 2009... (extracts) and Antonicelli v. Poland, no. 2815/05, §§ 14-22, 19 May 2009).
In particular, on 26 February 2002 the Supreme Court examined a situation where a legal-aid lawyer had refused to represent a convicted person for the purposes of cassation proceedings, finding that a cassation appeal would offer no prospects of success. It held that in such a situation the appellate court was obliged to instruct the defendant that the timelimit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date on which the defendant was served with the lawyer’s refusal and not on the earlier date when the judgment of the appellate court was served on the defendant himself. It stated that it was not open to doubt that a defendant faced with a legal-aid lawyer’s refusal had the right to take other measures to seek legal assistance necessary for effective lodging of a cassation appeal (III KZ 87/01). The Supreme Court reiterated its position in a decision of 6 May 2008 and in a number of similar decisions given in 2008. It observed that there had been certain discrepancies in the judicial practice as to the manner in which the time-limit in such situations was calculated, but the strand of the case-law launched by the decision given in February 2002 was both dominant and correct, and also accepted by doctrine as providing to defendants adequate procedural guarantees of access to the Supreme Court within a reasonable time frame (II KZ 16/08).
In its decision of 25 March 1998 the Supreme Court stated that the refusal of a legal-aid lawyer to lodge a cassation appeal did not constitute a valid ground for granting retrospective leave to lodge such an appeal by another lawyer out of time (V KZ 12/98). It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of 1 December 1999. The Supreme Court observed that the court could only assign a new legal-aid lawyer to the case if it were shown that the first lawyer had been negligent in his or her task of assessing whether a cassation appeal had any prospects of success. If this were not the case, a court was not obliged to assign a new legal-aid lawyer to represent the convicted person and its refusal was not subject to appeal (III KZ 139/99). The Supreme Court reiterated its position in a number of other decisions (e.g. II KZ 11/02, II KZ 36/02).
