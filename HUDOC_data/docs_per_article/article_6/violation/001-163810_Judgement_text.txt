The case originated in an application (no. 1468/08) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Romanian nationals, Mr Aurel Loghin, Ms Virginia Loghin and Mr Neculai Loghin (a son and his parents – “the applicants”), on 17 December 2007. The third applicant, Mr Neculai Loghin, died on 17 January 2011. No request to pursue the application on his behalf was made.
The applicants represented themselves before the Court. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their coAgent, Mrs C. Ciută, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicants alleged, in particular, that the composition of the bench which had delivered the judgment of the Iaşi County Court had not been in accordance with the law, and had therefore breached their rights as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
On 24 November 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1958, 1940 and 1933 respectively and live in Paşcani. The third applicant was born in 1933 and died in 2011.
On 2 March 2004 a claimant initiated civil proceedings against the applicants, seeking the annulment of a sale/purchase agreement. By a judgment of 3 March 2006 the Paşcani District Court, acting as a court of first instance, dismissed the claimant’s action.
.  The claimant appealed against the judgment of 3 March 2006. In their submissions in reply to the appeal lodged by the claimant, the applicants argued, inter alia, that the judgment was subject only to an appeal on points of law (recurs). By a judgment delivered on 26 January 2007 the Iaşi County Court, sitting as a bench of two judges, allowed the claimant’s appeal (apel). In the same judgment, the court dismissed the applicants’ arguments as to its jurisdiction, ruling that the judgment could be appealed at two levels by means of an ordinary appeal and an appeal on points of law. Thus, according to the Iaşi County Court, its judgment could be appealed via an appeal on points of law.
.  The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of the Iaşi County Court. By a final judgment of 21 June 2007 the Iaşi Court of Appeal dismissed their appeal as inadmissible, without giving an analysis on the merits, ruling that the case could only be considered by two levels of jurisdiction, and that the judgment of the Iaşi County Court was therefore final, even if it had been given by a bench of two judges rather than the three prescribed by law. The Iaşi Court of Appeal also dismissed an extraordinary appeal (contestaţie în anulare) by the applicants, without giving an analysis on the merits, by a judgment delivered on 6 December 2007.
.  The relevant provisions of the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure and of the Administration of Justice Act (Law no. 304/2004), as in force at the material time, are set out in Jenița Mocanu v. Romania (no. 11770/08, 17 December 2013).
