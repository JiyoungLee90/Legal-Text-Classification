The case originated in an application (no. 60336/08) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Brany D.O.O. and Jugokoka D.O.O. (“the applicants”), on 5 December 2008. Both applicants are limited liability companies, with their seats in Belgrade.
The applicants were represented by Mr A. Bosijoković, a lawyer practising in Belgrade. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 19 October 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarized as follows.
On 18 November 1994 the applicants initiated civil proceedings before the Belgrade Commercial Court against DD “Yuko Farma”, a socially-owned company from Žitište (hereinafter: “the debtor”) seeking damages arising from the debtor’s failure to fulfil conditions of contract on breed of chickens.
On 3 June 1998 the Belgrade Commercial Court accepted the applicants’ claim and ordered the debtor to pay the applicants 813,120 Serbian dinars (RSD) in respect of damage sustained, plus statutory interest and RSD 15,514.25 for legal costs.
On 5 October 1998 the Belgrade High Commercial Court quashed the judgment of 3 June 1998 and returned the case to the first-instance court for fresh consideration.
On 13 May 2005 the Belgrade Commercial Court dismissed the applicants’ civil suit.
On 20 October 2005 the Belgrade High Commercial Court quashed the decision of 13 May 2005 and returned the case to the first-instance court.

On 27 November 2007 the Belgrade Commercial Court declared that it lacked jurisdiction to deal with the case and transferred it to the Zrenjanin Commercial Court.
On 8 May 2008 the Zrenjanin Commercial Court adopted a judgment by virtue of which the debtor was ordered to pay the applicants RSD 813,120 (approximately 10,000 euros) for damages and RSD 586,912.40 (approximately 7,200 euros) for their legal costs.
