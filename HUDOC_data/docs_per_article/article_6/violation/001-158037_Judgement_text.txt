The case originated in two applications (nos. 7786/13 and 47972/13) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Serbian nationals, Ms Dobrica Milenković (“the first applicant”) and Mr Miroslav Veljković (“the second applicant”), on 18 December 2012 and 5 July 2013 respectively.
The applicants were represented by Mr N. Antić, a lawyer practising in Vladičin Han. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms V. Rodić.
On 11 July 2014 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered this objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants were born in 1957 and 1966, respectively, and live in Vladičin Han.
They were employed by DP “PK Delišes”, a socially-owned company based in Vladičin Han (hereinafter “the debtor”).
