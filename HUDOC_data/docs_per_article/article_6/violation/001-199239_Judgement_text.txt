The case originated in an application (no. 37397/15) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Yevgeniy Nikolayevich Zubenko (“the applicant”), on 10 July 2015.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Khlebnikov, a lawyer practising in the Stavropol region. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr M. Galperin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 15 November 2017 the Government were given notice of the application.
The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Levokumskoye, Stavropol Region.
On 2 September 2014 the justice of the peace of judicial circuit no. 1 of the Levokumskiy District of the Stavropol Region found the applicant guilty of refusing to take a breathalyser test, ordered him to pay a fine in the amount of 30,000 Russian roubles and suspended his driving licence for one and a half years. The applicant appealed.
On 7 October 2014 the Levokumskiy District Court of the Stavropol Region quashed the judgment of 2 September 2014 and discontinued the proceedings. On an unspecified date the judgment became final.
On 5 December 2012 the head of the traffic police asked the President of the Stavropol Regional Court to review the applicant’s case, claiming that the District Court had failed to establish correctly the circumstances of the case.
On 18 February 2015 the Deputy President of the Regional Court accepted the complaint lodged by the head of the traffic police for consideration.
On 10 March 2015 the Deputy President of the Regional Court quashed the judgment of 5 December 2012 and remitted the matter for fresh consideration to the District Court.
On 20 March 2015 (postmark) the Regional Court sent a letter to the applicant informing him of the decision of 18 February 2015 and advising him of his right to submit observations in response to the complaint by 27 February 2015. The applicant received the relevant letter on 24 March 2015.
On 27 May 2015 the District Court upheld the judgment of 2 September 2014 on appeal. The applicant and his lawyer were not present at the hearing.
