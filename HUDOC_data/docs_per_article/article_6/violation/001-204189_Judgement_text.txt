The case concerns legislative intervention in the course of ongoing proceedings. In particular, the applicant complained, under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, that the enactment of Law no. 296/2006 had amounted to a breach of his right to a fair trial.
The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Foiano della Chiana. He was represented by Mrs E. Fatuzzo, a lawyer practising in Bergamo.
The Government were represented by their former Agent, Mrs E. Spatafora, and their former co-Agent, Mrs M. L. Aversano.
The circumstances of the case are analogous to those described in Maggio and Others v. Italy (nos. 46286/09 and 4 others, 31 May 2011) and Stefanetti and Others v. Italy (merits) (nos. 21838/10 and 7 others, 15 April 2014).
On an unspecified date, the applicant, who had transferred to Italy the pension contributions he had paid in Switzerland, lodged an application with the Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (“INPS”) for his pension to be recalculated, in accordance with the 1962 Italo-Swiss Convention on Social Security (see “Relevant legal framework and practice” below and the authorities therein cited), on the basis of the contributions he had paid in Switzerland in respect of work he had performed there over several years. As a basis for the calculation of his pension (in respect of his average remuneration over the final five years of his working life), the INPS employed a theoretical remuneration (“retribuzione teorica”) instead of the actual remuneration (“retribuzione effettiva”). The former resulted in a readjustment on the basis of the existing ratio between the social security contributions paid in, respectively, Switzerland (8%) and in Italy (32.7%), which meant that the calculation had as its basis a notional salary which, according to the applicant, led him to receive a pension equal to one fourth of the pension he should have received.
Consequently, in 2006, the applicant lodged a claim with the Arezzo Tribunal (the body responsible for labour and social security disputes), contending that that was contrary to the spirit of the Italo-Swiss Convention.
During the time that the relevant proceedings before the Arezzo Tribunal were pending, Law no. 296 of 27 December 2006 (“Law no. 296/2006”) entered into force on 1 January 2007.
On 28 May 2009, in view of the entry into force of Law 296/2006, the Arezzo Tribunal dismissed the applicant’s claim.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the case are to be found in Maggio and Others (cited above, §§ 27-35) and in Stefanetti and Others (merits) (cited above, §§ 13-27).
