The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms Valeria Lutkovska, succeeded by Ms Zoryana Bortnovska.
The applicant complained of the failure of the State authorities to execute the judgment of 16 August 1999, as amended by the resolution of 15 March 2000, given in his favour. He alleged an infringement of Articles 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
The application was communicated to the respondent Government on 10 April 2003. On the same date the Court decided that Article 29 § 3 of the Convention should be applied, and the admissibility and merits of the application be considered together.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits (Rule 54A).
The applicant is a Ukrainian national who was born on 6 January 1941 and lives in Dolyns’ka, the Kirovograd Region.
In March 1999 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Dolyns’ka City Court against the State Treasury Department, the Dolyns’ka financial department of the Municipal Council and the Dolyns’ka Tax Police Department, seeking compensation for the damage caused by the unlawful seizure and confiscation of his car.
On 16 August 1999 the Dolyns’ka City Court awarded the applicant UAH 50,000 in compensation for moral and material damage.
On 15 March 2000 the Presidium of the  allowed the protest of the Deputy Prosecutor General of  lodged against this decision. It amended the decision of 16 August 1999 and reduced the amount of compensation to UAH 20,000.

The Supreme Court ruled that the UAH 20,000 compensation awarded to the applicant by the decision of 16 August 1999, as amended on 15 March 2000, had been reasonably established.
On 20 September 2000 the Dolyns’ska City Court initiated enforcement proceedings in the applicant’s case and delivered the relevant writs of execution to the applicant.
On 12 December 2000 the Kyiv City Department of Justice informed the applicant that the State Treasury of Ukraine and its regional departments were responsible for such payments and therefore the writs of execution had to be forwarded to them.
On 18 July 2001 the State Treasury of Ukraine informed the applicant that it was not possible to execute the judgment because there were no relevant provisions in Ukrainian law (i.e. no relevant resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine) authorising it.
On 15 May 2002 the National Bank of  transferred UAH 20,000 to the applicant’s account in execution of the judgment of 16 August 1999, as modified by the resolution of the Presidium of the  on 15 March 2000.
