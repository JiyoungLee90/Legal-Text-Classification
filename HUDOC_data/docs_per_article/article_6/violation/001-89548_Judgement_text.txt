The case originated in an application (no. 37758/03) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Vladimir Grigoryevich Kabanov (“the applicant”), on 10 November 2003.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, former Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 1 March 2006 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Vladikavkaz, a town in North Ossetia.
On 28 February 2002 the Leninskiy District Court of Vladikavkaz granted the applicant’s claim against the Regional Department of the Interior and awarded him RUB 690,393.80 in wage arrears. This judgment became binding on 11 March 2002 and was enforced on 27 October 2004.
Because the enforcement of the judgment had been delayed, on 27 December 2004 the District Court adjusted the award for the cost of living and awarded the applicant RUB 221,319.22. This judgment became binding on 11 January 2005 and was enforced on 28 October 2005.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months. Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.
