The relevant parts of the decision read as follows:
 “...the length of proceedings – almost eight years – appears to be still just acceptable (gerade noch hinnehmbar) from a constitutional point of view. While the case which had to be adjudicated by the  was not particularly complex from a legal point of view, it was conducted in a very contentious and lengthy manner. Furthermore, it does not appear from the case file that the  delayed the proceedings ... by any inactivity on its part or that it neglected to advance the proceedings. The  constantly advanced the proceedings by exchanging the written statements rapidly, deciding on the taking of evidence and issuing legal instructions.
It must further be taken into account that the applicants repeatedly contributed to the obstructions and delays in the proceedings by requesting that further evidence be taken and time-limits extended and by lodging objections of bias and criminal complaints necessitating the dispatch of the case file. While these actions form part of the parties’ rights in civil proceedings, the relevant court cannot be held responsible for the resulting prolongation of the proceedings.
Finally, it must be borne in mind that the applicants, as far as can be established, have not been affected economically by the length of the proceedings.
While no objection can be made to the conduct of the proceedings from a constitutional point of view, the  – in view of the length of the proceedings – is requested to speed up the proceedings and bring them to an early conclusion.”
