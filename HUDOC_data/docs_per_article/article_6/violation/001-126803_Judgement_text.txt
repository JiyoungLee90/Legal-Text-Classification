The case originated in an application (no. 27618/10) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Ms Ildikó Vargáné Fekete (“the applicant”), on 10 May 2010.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 7 March 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Budapest.
On 18 June 2000 the applicant’s ex-husband lodged an action for divorce and partition of matrimonial property against the applicant.
On 6 November 2007 the Buda Central District Court delivered a judgment.
Both the applicant and the plaintiff appealed. On 4 September 2008 the Budapest Regional Court, acting as a second-instance court, delivered a judgment partly modifying the first-instance judgment.
The applicant’s ex-husband lodged a petition for review with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed on 6 October 2009, after an examination on the merits.
