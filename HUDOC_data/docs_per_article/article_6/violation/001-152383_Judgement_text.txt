The case originated in an application (no. 47902/08) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Ms Ilona Kovács (“the applicant”), on 16 September 2008.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 17 October 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Budapest.
On 1 September 2006 the applicant brought an action against the Budapest XIV District Mayor’s Office challenging an administrative decision whereby the registration document of her car had been revoked.
On 10 September 2010 the Budapest Regional Court adopted a final judgment quashing the administrative decision in question.
It appears that the ensuing administrative proceedings to have the registration document reissued have been pending ever since.
