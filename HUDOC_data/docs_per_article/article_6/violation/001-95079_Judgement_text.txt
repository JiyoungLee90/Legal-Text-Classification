The case originated in an application (no. 28808/07) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mrs Vira Oleksandrivna Korniychuk (“the applicant”), on 26 May 2007.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Yuriy Zaytsev.
On 20 November 2008 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Ovruch.
On an unspecified date the applicant retired from the army.
On 10 September 2001 the Military Court of the Zhytomyr Garrison awarded the applicant 1,946.20 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) in compensation for her uniform to be paid by the Military Unit A-4602. The judgment became final but remains unenforced due to the debtor's lack of funds.
