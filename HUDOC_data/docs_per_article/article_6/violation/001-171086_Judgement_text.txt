The case originated in an application (no. 22185/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Vladimir Nikitovich Nikitin (“the applicant”), on 10 April 2007.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr. G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 23 February 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Ufa, the Republic of Bashkortostan.
In February 1996 the applicant was severely injured in a traffic accident.
On 24 April 1996 he lodged a civil action against the owner of the car, the State Unitary Subsidiary Passenger Transport Company of Ufa No. 3 (Государственное унитарное дочернее уфимское пассажирское автотранспортное предприятие 3 – hereinafter “the transport company”), seeking compensation for damage.
On 29 November 2005 the Sovetskiy District Court of Ufa (hereinafter “the District Court”) partly granted the applicant’s claims.
On 15 February 2006 the transport company was declared insolvent and it was put into liquidation.
On 28 March 2006 the judgment of 29 November 2005 became final, as modified on appeal by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Bashkortostan. The final court award in the applicant’s favour consisted of a sum in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage sustained (equivalent to 30,462 euros (EUR)), to be paid once the judgment became final, and of a monthly allowance (equivalent of EUR 207), to be paid until the end of the applicant’s life.
On 17 June 2006 the Commercial Court of the Republic of Bashkortostan (hereinafter “the Commercial Court”) granted the applicant’s application for aggregation as a lump sum («капитализация») of the amounts of the monthly allowance awarded by the judgment of 29 November 2005, in accordance with section 135 § 1 of the Insolvency Act (see paragraph 20 below). Therefore the transport company’s debt under this head amounted to EUR 69,029.
Since the award remained unenforced, on 11 January 2009 the District Court granted a prior application by the applicant to have the amount of the monthly allowance index-linked, and raised it to EUR 909. The judgment became final on 22 January 2009.
On 3 March 2009 the Commercial Court once again granted the applicant’s application for payment as a lump sum of the amounts of the monthly allowance. The applicant was awarded EUR 203,673. The judgment became final on 23 April 2009.
On 15 July 2009 the Commercial Court accepted the applicant’s claim for transfer of the transport company’s debt to the Russian Federation, as provided for in section  135 § 3 of the Insolvency Act (see paragraph 21 below). The court ordered that the judgment debts in the applicant’s favour were to be paid by the Federal Tax Service of Russia. On 3 December 2009 the Commercial Court of the Uralskiy Circuit upheld that judgment and it became final.
Between August and October 2010 the applicant received the equivalent of EUR 15,131, which corresponded to total of the monthly allowance that he had not received in 2005-2010. Furthermore, on 6 August 2010 the applicant started receiving a monthly allowance of EUR 948.
The transport company provided public transport services on a commercial basis. It was a subsidiary of another company, Bashavtotrans State Unitary Company (ГУП «Башавтотранс» – hereinafter “the parent company”). The legal provisions on subsidiary companies are summarised in paragraph 22 below.
The transport company had the right of “economic control” over the assets allocated to it by the parent company. The parent company was a unitary company with the right of “economic control” over the assets allocated to it by the State Committee on construction, architecture and transport of the Republic of Bashkortostan.
On 14 October 2004 the Government of the Republic of Bashkortostan issued Decree no. 918-P, by which all the transport company’s assets were transferred to the parent company; the debts remained with the transport company.
On 15 February 2006 the transport company was declared insolvent, and it was put into liquidation. The liquidation proceedings ended on 31 December 2013.
The relevant provisions and case-law governing unitary companies with the right of economic control are described in the judgments of Liseytseva and Maslov v. Russia (nos. 39483/05 and 40527/10, §§ 54-127, 9 October 2014), and of Samsonov v. Russia (dec.) (no. 2880/10, 16 September 2014).
Pursuant to section 135 § 1 of the Insolvency Act of 26 October 2002 No. 127-FZ, the total in claims of citizens to which the debtor is liable for harm to life or health shall be calculated by means of aggregating the relevant regular payments which were established on adoption by the commercial court of the decision declaring the debtor company insolvent and which are payable to those citizens until they reach the age of seventy, but with a minimum of ten years payment.
Pursuant to section 135 § 3 of the Insolvency Act, upon the citizen’s consent his or her right to claim the aggregated amount of the regular payments shall be transferred to the Russian Federation. In this case the debtor’s obligation to pay the aggregated amount to the citizen shall be transferred to the Russian Federation and shall be fulfilled by the State in compliance with federal law in the manner determined by the Government of the Russian Federation.
Pursuant to Article 105 of the Civil Code of Russia, as in force at the material time, a company shall be recognised as a subsidiary if the other (the parent) company, on account of its majority shareholding, or in conformity with an agreement signed between them, or in any other way, can exert a decisive impact on the decisions adopted by such a company.
