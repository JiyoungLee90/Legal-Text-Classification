The case originated in an application (no. 21837/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Lithuanian national, Mr Renatas Simonavičius (“the applicant”), on 8 October 2002.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Falkauskas, a lawyer practising in Joniškis. The Lithuanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Baltutytė.
On 7 September 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Naujoji Akmenė.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 28 February 1996 a criminal investigation was opened into an alleged financial conspiracy involving the applicant. It was closed in December 1998.
On 1 September 1999 a new criminal investigation was opened into alleged cheating (Article 274 § 1 of the Criminal Code, as applicable at the material time). The applicant was questioned as a suspect on 3 September 1999.
On 13 October 1999 the applicant was arrested. On 15 October 1999 a judge authorised his detention on remand until 25 October 1999 for fear of his absconding and committing fresh crimes. On 25 October 1999 the applicant’s remand in custody was extended until 25 November 1999, and then until 25 January 2000.
On 14 December 1999 the applicant was released and placed under house arrest.
The matter was subsequently joined to seven other cases of cheating (Article 274 of the Criminal Code, as then in force) and obstructing the course of justice by attempting to influence witnesses, victims and other parties to the proceedings (Article 297).
On 12 June 2000 the prosecution confirmed the bill of indictment. On the same date the case was transmitted to the Mažeikiai Area District Court for trial.
On 24 August 2000 a judge of that court sent the case back to the prosecution for an additional investigation.
The prosecution appealed and on 19 October 2000 the Šiauliai  quashed the decision of 24 August 2000, remitting the case to the first instance court for trial.
On 8 January 2001 the applicant was committed for trial.
During the period from 23 January 2001 to 1 October 2002, the court hearings were adjourned ten times in view of the failure of certain witnesses, victims or defence counsel to appear.
Between 26 November 2002 and 9 July 2003, the trial was adjourned five times as a result of the illness of certain participants.
On 9 July 2003 a judge of the Mažeikiai Area District Court ordered the applicant’s detention in view of his failure to appear that day. He was accordingly arrested and remanded in custody. On 25 July 2003 the Šiauliai  quashed the decision, as the applicant had been hospitalised at the material time. He was immediately released. On 28 August 2003 the applicant’s bail was ordered by way of the written obligation not to leave the country.
Between 24 September 2003 and 26 November 2003, there were two further adjournments in the absence of a witness and the applicant’s defence lawyer.
On 15 December 2003 a trial judge wrote a letter to the police, explaining that the decision on house arrest of 14 December 1999 had been valid, so that the police should have supervised the applicant’s compliance with the measure.
Between 7 January 2004 and 8 June 2004, a judge of the Mažeikiai Area District Court conducted seven hearings at which the parties and certain witnesses were questioned. Court orders were issued to ensure the attendance of certain participants.
Twelve trial hearings were conducted between 17 December 2004 and 16 June 2005.
In the course of the trial, four different judges took over the examination of the case from each other.
On 29 June 2005 the applicant was convicted.
Following the applicant’s appeal against the conviction, the case was transmitted to the Šiauliai , which held two hearings. The appeal is apparently still pending.
On 2 May 2003 another criminal case was instituted against the applicant for financial fraud.
On 27 August 2003 his property was seized in the context of these proceedings.
On 4 March 2005 the prosecution confirmed the bill of indictment.
On 9 March 2005 the case was referred to the Klaipėda Area District Court for trial. The trial is currently pending.
Article 18 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure (in force until 1 May 2003) and Articles 2, 44 and 176 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure (effective since 1 May 2003) provide that the investigation and trial shall be conducted within a reasonable time.
Article 6.272 § 1 of the new Civil Code (which entered into force on 1 July 2001) allows a civil claim for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, in view of the unlawful actions of the investigating authorities or courts, in the context of a criminal case. The provision envisages compensation for an unlawful conviction, an unlawful arrest or detention, the application of unlawful procedural measures of enforcement, or an unlawful administrative penalty. According to recent domestic case-law, this provision may also allow claims for damages arising from the excessive length of criminal proceedings (also see paragraph 32 below).
