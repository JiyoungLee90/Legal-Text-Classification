The case originated in an application (no. 42932/11) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Ildar Dinarovich Vakhitov (“the applicant”), on 16 June 2011.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
In the wake of the pilot judgment in the case of Gerasimov and Others v. Russia, on 24 November 2014 the non-enforcement complaint and the lack of effective remedies’ issue were communicated to the Government for settlement or resolution (see Gerasimov and Others v. Russia, nos. 29920/05 and 10 others, §§ 230-31 and point 13 of the operative part, 1 July 2014). The Court adjourned for two years, that is until 1 October 2016, the proceedings in all cases concerning non-enforcement or delayed enforcement of domestic judgments imposing obligations in kind on the State authorities (ibid., § 232 and point 14 of the operative part). The remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
On 29 September 2016 the Government advised the Court that they were unable to settle the present application within the above time-limit, as the domestic judgment in the applicant’s favour had remained unenforced.
Having regard to the expiry of the above-mentioned adjournment period, the Court has decided to resume the examination of the application. The Court informed the parties at the communication stage that the case, subject to settled case-law, would be allocated to the Committee.
The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Shchemilovo, the Noginskiy District of the Moscow Region. He is a former military serviceman.
On 22 December 2003 the Ministry of Defence provided the applicant and his family with a flat of 78.8 sq.m. in Shchemilovo. The flat was granted as “service housing” (служебное жилое помещение), in connection with, and for the period of the applicant’s military service in a closed military settlement (закрытый военный городок).
On 23 August 2004 he was put on a list of servicemen in need of better housing.
On 17 February 2010 the Moscow Garrison Military Court ordered the commander of the applicant’s military unit and the housing commission to provide the applicant’s family of four with housing in Moscow on a priority basis, in accordance with housing norms and in line with the domestic legislation, in accordance with a priority order depending on the date of placement on the list of those entitled to housing on priority basis within the same category of servicemen. The court further ordered to dismiss him from service on health grounds after provision of the housing.
On 10 March 2010 the judgment entered into force.
On 11 March 2011 the same court replaced the defendant by the Housing Provision Department of the Ministry of Defence.
At some point the applicant started performing his military service in Moscow but continued living in the service flat in Shchemilovo (see paragraph 7 above), for the lack of available housing in Moscow. The flat’s “service housing” status was confirmed by the military unit officers in various documents dated 2005-2012, including a local housing exploitation unit’s documents and utility bills.
During the same period the applicant on several occasions undertook to vacate the flat once provided with State housing in Moscow.
In 2012 E., the applicant’s mother-in-law, moved into the flat to live together with the applicant’s family.
In 2014 the administration of the Staraya Kupavna settlement of the Noginskiy District and the head of a newly-created flat owners’ association at a special meeting informed the settlement population including the applicant that on 13 February 2009 the Ministry of Defence had transferred a major part of the housing fund in Shchemilovo, including the applicant’s flat, to the municipality. The flat allocated to the applicant had become municipal property.With reference to numerous documents issued by the housing and exploitation unit until 2013 and designating the flat as service housing, the applicant submits that he had been unaware of the title transfer until 2014.
On 18 December 2014 the applicant concluded a social tenancy agreement in respect of the flat with the administration of Staraya Kupavna settlement of the Noginskiy District.
On 29 December 2015 E. privatised the flat and became its owner. In October 2016 E. offered the flat to P., her another daughter. The applicant’s family have been living in the flat to date.
On 11 April 2016 the Housing Provision Department of the Ministry of Defence refused to provide the applicant with a flat at a specific address in Moscow and decided that the applicant’s name be removed from the list of persons in need of housing. The authority reiterated that military servicemen were entitled to receive free State housing only once, with the condition that they vacate their existing housing (see paragraph 38 above). However, the applicant had not done so: in 2015 his mother-in-law had privatised the flat provided to the applicant in 2003, and he was still living in that flat with his family at the time of the events. A total size of housing per family member exceeded the local housing norm. Accordingly, the grounds for the applicant’s family’s entitlement to receive housing under Article 29 § 1 of the Housing Code had ceased to exist.
On 14 January 2017 the applicant was dismissed from military service without being provided with housing. On 16 January 2017 he received the dismissal order.
On 10 July 2017 he complained to a court about his unlawful removal from the housing list and his subsequent dismissal without housing provision.
On 27 July 2017 the Moscow Garrison Military Court rejected his claim as lodged in breach of the three-month time-limit set out in Article 219 of the Code of Administrative Proceedings in respect of both issues. The court noted that the applicant had been aware of the decision to exclude him from the housing list as early as in May 2016 and had studied the dismissal order on 16 January 2017, but only lodged his complaint in July 2017. The court informed the applicant that the full text of the judgment would be available on 2 August 2017.
The applicant received the judgment on 4 August 2017. On 7 September 2017 he appealed against it.
On 11 September 2017 the Moscow Garrison Military Court returned the applicant’s appeal against the above judgment without examination as he had missed a one-month time-limit for its introduction.
He appealed arguing that he had not missed the time-limit, as from 4 to 6 September 2017 he had been away on business trip.
On 21 December 2017 the Military Court of the Moscow Circuit upheld the decision of 11 September 2017. The court found that the timelimit for lodging the appeal had expired on 4 September 2017. The applicant had received a full text of the judgment on 4 August 2017 but only appealed on 7 September 2017.
On 20 June 2018 the applicant lodged a single cassation appeal against the decisions of 27 July and 21 December 2017 with the Presidium of the Military Court of the Moscow Circuit. On 22 June 2018 the court returned the appeal without examination owing to various procedural shortcomings, such as the applicant’s failure to formulate his claims as regards the decision of 11 September 2017 and to submit a copy of the decision. The court further noted that under the domestic law it was impossible to lodge a single cassation appeal against several judicial acts.
On 6 July 2018 the applicant corrected the defects and re-introduced his complaint.
On 11 July 2018 the Military Court of the Moscow Circuit returned his request to lodge a cassation appeal without examination, as introduced outside the six-month time-limit.
On 15 August 2018 the applicant lodged a further cassation appeal and a request to reinstate the six-month time-limit with the Supreme Court of Russia. On 28 August 2018 the Supreme Court refused to reinstate the time-limit.
At some point in 2017 the debtor authority requested to discontinue the enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 17 February 2010, as the applicant’s name had been removed from the list of persons in need of housing, and there had “no longer been a possibility to enforce the judgment”.
On 21 April 2017 the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow dismissed the debtor’s request to discontinue the enforcement proceedings. There was no evidence that the judgment in the applicant’s favour could no longer be enforced. It was not quashed or amended. A “loss of a possibility to enforce” should have been “of an objective nature”. The defendant’s arguments were rather indicative of its disagreement with the court’s findings in the judgment of 17 February 2010, but did not constitute a ground for termination of the enforcement proceedings.
On 29 November 2017 a bailiff rejected the debtor’s request to terminate the enforcement proceedings, as the judgment had not been enforced.
On 29 June 2018 the defendant again requested the court to terminate the enforcement proceedings, the application being lodged this time with a military court.
On 11 July 2018 the Moscow Garrison Military Court granted the request and ordered to discontinue the enforcement proceedings. With reference to the judgment of 27 July 2017 (see paragraph 21 above) it found established that as of 11 April 2016 the applicant had no longer been in need of housing, which meant that the possibility to enforce the judgment of 17 February 2010 had ceased to exist.
On 6 September 2018 the Appellate Chamber for Administrative Cases of the Military Court of the Moscow Circuit upheld the decision on appeal. The court observed that in 2003 the applicant had received a flat from the Ministry of Defence. In 2011 he and his family undertook to vacate it, if provided with housing in Moscow. However, in 2014 the applicant concluded a social tenancy agreement in respect of the flat, and in November 2015 it was privatised by his mother-in-law. His family had still been living in the flat. Accordingly, the applicant had no longer been entitled to State housing, and his name had been struck out of the respective lists. Thus, the possibility to enforce the initial judgment had been lost.
It is unclear whether the applicant lodged a cassation appeal against that decision.
At some point before 6 October 2018, date of the applicant’s latest submissions, the bailiffs service discontinued the enforcement of the judgment.
Federal Law no. 76-FZ of 27 May 1998 on the Status of Military Servicemen grants them the right to housing (section 15(1)(1)). That provision has been subject to numerous amendments over the years. According to the text in force as from 8 May 2006 (Law no. 66-FZ of 8 May 2006), the State was to ensure that servicemen be provided with housing or monetary funds to allow them to purchase housing in accordance with the procedure and under the conditions set by the federal laws and regulations. Construction and purchase of housing for servicemen was performed by the federal executive authorities at the expense of the federal budget. A right to be provided with State housing is granted to servicemen only once. On receipt of housing at a place of their choosing, servicemen and their family members must submit documents confirming that they have vacated living premises to the Ministry of Defence and discontinued residence registration at their previous places of residence (section 15(14) of the Law).
For a summary of other relevant provisions of the Russian Housing Code of 29 December 2004, the Federal Law on the Status of Military Servicemen, the Enforcement Act and Instruction of the Ministry of Defence of 30 September 2010 No. 1280 setting out rules governing provision of housing to military servicemen under social tenancy agreements, see Lebedenko v. Russia (dec.), no. 60432/13, §§ 26-39, 4 December 2018. Annex II to the aforementioned Instruction sets out rules for provision of service housing.
According to Article 359 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, enforcement proceedings are discontinued either by a court which had issued the writ of execution or a court of the bailiff’s location.
Relevant provisions of the Federal Law No. 450-FZ amending the Compensation Act of 2010, in force as of 1 January 2017 and extending the scope of the Compensation Act to cases of excessive delays in the enforcement of court judgments ordering the domestic authorities to fulfil various obligations in kind are summarised in Shtolts and Others v. Russia (dec.), nos. 77056/14 and 2 others, §§ 3141, 30 January 2018.
