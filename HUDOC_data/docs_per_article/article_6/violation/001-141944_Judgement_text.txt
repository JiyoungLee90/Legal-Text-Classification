The case originated in an application (no. 62552/10) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Ms Sára Anna Kovács (“the applicant”), on 25 October 2010.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 6 March 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Siófok.
On 11 January 2002 the applicant was dismissed from the civil service.
On 20 February 2002 she challenged her dismissal before the Budapest Labour Court.
On 15 May 2003 the court found for the applicant, establishing that her dismissal had been unlawful, and awarded her compensation.
On appeal, on 17 March 2004 the Budapest Regional Court upheld in essence the first instance decision, increased the award, but dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s compensation claims and, as to the applicant’s claim regarding the amount of certain additional allowances, it remitted the case to the first-instance court.
On 5 September 2005 the Supreme Court quashed the second-instance decision and remitted the case to the Labour Court.
In the resumed proceedings, on 7 June 2007 the Labour Court dismissed the applicant’s action.
On 29 October 2008 the Budapest Regional Court reversed the first-instance decision and awarded compensation to the applicant. This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court on 31 March 2010.
The applicant’s further pecuniary claims, also originating in the labour dispute, were finally adjudicated on 16 January 2013 by the Budapest High Court.
