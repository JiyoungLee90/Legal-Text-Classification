The case originated in four applications (nos. 58559/12, 9162/15, 14772/15 and 14883/15) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). The applicants are all Serbian nationals and their personal details are set out in the appendix to this judgment.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Ms V. Rodić, who was recently replaced by their current Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 1 September 2015 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the applications by a Committee. The Court rejects this objection after giving it due consideration.
The applicants complained about the excessive length of various criminal and civil proceedings (see the appendix to this judgment).
.  All the applicants obtained decisions by the Constitutional Court that found a violation of their right to a hearing within a reasonable time and awarded them various sums of money in respect of non-pecuniary damage (see appendix).
