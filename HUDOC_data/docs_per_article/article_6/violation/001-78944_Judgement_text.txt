The case originated in an application (no. 11931/02) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Vadim Mikhaylovich Mas (“the applicant”), on 15 November 2001.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mrs V. Lutkovska, succeeded by Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 8 April 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints under Articles 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the non-enforcement of the judgments in the applicant's favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Kostyantynivka, the  region.
On 30 October 1998 and 27 September 1999 the Mykytivsky District Court of Gorlivka (Микитівський районний суд м. Горлівка) ordered the State Company “Gorlivrozvidka” (“the Company,” ДП “Горліврозвідка”) to pay the applicant UAH 4,298.97 and UAH 3,939.61, respectively, in salary arrears and other payments. These judgments became final and the enforcement writs were transferred to the bailiffs' service for enforcement.
On 17 May 2002 the Mykytivsky District Bailiffs' Service (Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Микитівського районного управління юстиції в м. Горлівка) informed the applicant that the awarded sums could not be paid to him on account of the Company's lack of funds. It also stated that the attachment of the Company's property was impeded by the Law of 2001 “on the Introduction of a Moratorium on the Forced Sale of Property.”
The judgment of 30 October 1998 was enforced in several instalments, the last payment being made on 7 March 2003.
On 30 November 2004 the applicant received UAH 1,919.03 under the judgment of 27 September 1999. The remainder debt is still outstanding to the present day.
