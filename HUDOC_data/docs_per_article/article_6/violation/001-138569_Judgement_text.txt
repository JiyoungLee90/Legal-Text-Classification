The case originated in two applications (nos. 75271/10 and 67112/11) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Serbian nationals, Mr Milan Gligorić (“the first applicant”) and Ms Verica Gligorić (“the second applicant”), on 2 December 2010 and 2 February 2010 respectively.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 21 November 2011 the applications were communicated to the Government.
Introduction
The applicants were born in 1952 and 1954 respectively and live in Majur.
The applicants were employed by “7 Juli”, a company based in Šabac (hereinafter – “the debtor”).
On 13 November 2006 the applicant and the debtor concluded a settlement before the Šabac Municipal Court, according to which the debtor was ordered to pay the applicant certain sums in respect to salary arrears and costs of proceedings.
On 29 December 2009 the applicant lodged an application for the enforcement of the above court decision with the Šabac Municipal Court.
On 31 December 2009 the court allowed the application and issued an enforcement order.
On 11 December 2008 the applicant and the debtor concluded a settlement before the Šabac Municipal Court, according to which the debtor was ordered to pay the applicant certain sums in respect to salary arrears and pension and disability insurance contributions.
On 7 July 2009 the applicant lodged an application for the enforcement of the above court decision with the Šabac Municipal Court.
On 9 July 2009 the court allowed the application and issued an enforcement order.
On 21 July 2006 the applicant and the debtor concluded a settlement before the Šabac Municipal Court, according to which the debtor was ordered to pay the applicant certain sums in respect to salary arrears, pension and disability insurance contributions and costs of proceedings.
On 7 July 2009 the applicant lodged an application for the enforcement of the above court decision with the Šabac Municipal Court.
On 9 July 2009 the court allowed the application and issued an enforcement order.
On 14 March 2007 the debtor was privatised.
On 10 June 2008 the contract for the sale of the debtor was annulled because the buyer in question had failed to fulfil his contractual obligations.
Following the annulment of the debtor’s privatisation 70% of its shares were transferred to the State.
As it would appear from media reports, in November 2009 the State sold its shares to a private company.
On 14 April 2010 the Valjevo Commercial Court opened the preliminary insolvency proceedings against the debtor.
On 1 December 2010 the Commercial Court terminated the insolvency proceedings against the debtor because the creditors and the debtor failed to advance the costs of the insolvency proceedings.
In addition, the court ordered the transfer of the debtor’s property to the State.
The decision became final on 14 April 2011.
