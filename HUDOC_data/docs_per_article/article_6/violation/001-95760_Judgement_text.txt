The case originated in five applications (nos. 8107/06, 8473/06, 8475/06, 15941/06 and 32116/06) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Ukrainian nationals, Mr Vladimir Ivanovich Skaloukhov (“the first applicant”), Ms Tamara Petrovna Mikolyuk (“the second applicant”), Mr Aleksandr Nikolayevich Menshchikov (“the third applicant”), Ms Ekaterina Mitrofanovna Kondratyuk (“the fourth applicant) and Mr Feliks Vatslavovich Bernatskiy (“the fifth applicant”).
The first and third applicants lodged their applications with the Court on 10 February 2006, the second applicant on 11 February 2006, the fourth applicant on 3 April 2006, and the fifth applicant on 17 July 2006.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Y. Zaytsev.
On 30 April 2008 the Court decided to communicate the applications to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
The first applicant was born in 1938, the second in 1962, the third in 1959, the fourth in 1940, and the fifth in 1939. All applicants live in the town of Makeyevka, .
The applicants are former employees of the State company Shachta imeni K.I. Pochenkova (“the company”).
The applicants instituted proceedings against the company in the Chervonogvardeysky District Court of Makeyevka (“the first-instance court”) requesting it to recalculate the amount of the salary paid to them from January 1997 to October 2001 and compensate them for losses sustained as a result of alleged miscalculations made by the company. They also claimed compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The court allowed their claims (see Annex 1).
The Chervonogvardeysky District Bailiffs' Service of Makeyevka initiated enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgments given in the applicants' favour.
On an unspecified date the company was liquidated. The applicants requested the first-instance court to change the debtor in enforcement proceedings to another State company. The court allowed their requests and changed the debtor to the State company Ukrvuglerestrukturizatsiya. The Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal quashed the rulings of the first-instance court and rejected the applicants' requests. The Supreme Court upheld the rulings of the Court of Appeal (for details see Annex 2).
Later, the applicants lodged extraordinary appeals against the final decisions given in their cases by the Supreme Court. However, their appeals were unsuccessful.
On 3 June 2008 the State Bailiffs' Service returned the enforcement writs to the applicants and terminated the enforcement proceedings. The judgments in the applicants' favour remain unenforced.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-19, 27 July 2004).
