The case originated in an application (no. 12089/07) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Ms Ágnes Kovács (“the applicant”), on 24 February 2007.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 13 September 2010 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. In accordance with Protocol No. 14, the application was allocated to a Committee of three Judges.
The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Budapest.
On 18 December 1999 the applicant brought a labour action against her former employer for unlawful dismissal.
After holding several hearings and obtaining expert evidence, the Budapest Labour Court dismissed the action on 28 February 2005. The applicant appealed.
On 26 August 2005 the Budapest Regional Court, acting as a second-instance court, reversed the first-instance decision and ordered the defendant to pay the applicant 180,582 Hungarian forints (HUF) in unpaid employment benefits plus interests and HUF 200,000 in non-pecuniary damages. The applicant filed a petition for review.
On 25 October 2006 the Supreme Court decided that the petition had not disclosed a breach of the relevant law. Although this decision was given in a single-judge procedure as to the admissibility of the petition under section 273 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, in fact it dealt with the merits of the applicant’s case and contained detailed reasoning.
Meanwhile, on 11 November 2005 the applicant applied for the enforcement of the second-instance judgment. Apparently she miscalculated the claimed interests; therefore the debtor’s bank could not comply with the prompt collection order, which was issued by the Budapest Labour Court on an un-specified date. Thus, after clarifying the proper amount, the court issued a new enforcement order on 2 April 2007. The judgment having been complied with by the defendant, the court withdrew the enforcement order on 26 April 2007.
