The case originated in an application (no. 25248/05) against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Macedonian national, Mr Velko Naumoski (“the applicant”), on 14 June 2004.
In a judgment delivered on 27 November 2012, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the domestic courts’ failure to forward to the applicant the defendant’s observations in reply to the applicant’s appeals, as well as on account of the length of proceedings regarding his dismissal. The Court also decided to award the applicant 2,500 euros (EUR) for non-pecuniary damage and EUR 120 for costs and expenses and dismissed the remainder of the claims for just satisfaction.
On 14 February 2013 the Government requested revision of the judgment within the meaning of Rule 80 of the Rules of Court concerning an alleged incorrect issue of fact established by the Court.
On 2 April 2013 the Court considered the request for revision and decided to give the applicant until 16 May 2013 to submit any observations. Those observations were received on 7 May 2013.
