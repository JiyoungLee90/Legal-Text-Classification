The case originated in an application (no. 31391/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Macedonian national, Mr Ilija Kalanoski (“the applicant”), on 17 September 2003.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Popeski, a lawyer practising in Ohrid. The Macedonian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs R. Lazareska Gerovska.
On 17 November 2006 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in .
On 5 May 1991 the then Municipal Court of Struga (“the first-instance court”) ruled partly in the applicant's favour ordering the defendant, Mr J.T., to pay him compensation. On 29 December 1992 the then District Court of Bitola overturned the decision and increased the amount of the award.
On 1 February 1993 the applicant sought enforcement before the first-instance court by an inventory and public sale of the defendant's (“the debtor”) movable property.
According to the applicant, his request for enforcement was granted on 3 February 1993, but no formal decision has been ever served on him.
Between 17 April 1993 and 18 April 1994 respectively, the applicant complained to the President of the first-instance court and to the State Judicial Council about the court's inactivity. No answer was provided.
On 23 June 1994 an expert determined the amount of the applicant's claim with interest.
According to the Government, in May 1999 the enforcement proceedings were terminated as being resolved “in other way” (“на друг начин”) corresponding to the common practice of the courts and extract of the court's registry. No record was made about the termination of the proceedings. In or about March 2000, the case-file was destroyed.
According to the applicant, on 13 December 2006 the first-instance court intended to restore the case by requesting him to resubmit relevant documents. The Government did not dispute that assertion.
