The case originated in an application (no. 35002/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Irina Vasilyevna Rozhnyatovskaya (“the applicant”), on 4 July 2005.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 9 January 2009 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.
In accordance with the pilot judgment Burdov v.  (no. 2) (no. 33509/04, ECHR 2009...), this application was adjourned pending its resolution at the domestic level.
The Government later informed the Court that enforcement of the judgment in the applicant’s favour was impossible as the applicant had failed to submit the documents to the correct enforcement body and that the debtor had been dissolved. The Court therefore decided to resume examination of the present case.
The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Kuzmolovskiy, Leningrad Region.
The applicant served as a military officer.
On 25 July 2003 the Military Court of the Sertolovo Garrison issued a default judgment recovering 34,277.10 Russian roubles (RUB) in the applicant’s favour from military unit 93921 as an allowance for direct participation in combat action.
The judgment was not appealed and became final on 5 August 2003.
Following the applicant’s inquiry with the Ministry of Defence concerning the enforcement proceedings on 24 February 2004, she was apprised of the procedure.
On 8 February 2005 the bailiff service terminated the enforcement proceedings, returning the writ of execution to the applicant for submission to the Federal Treasury where the debtor’s account was opened.
However, the applicant has never submitted the documents to the Federal Treasury and the judgment remains unenforced to date.
According to the Government, on an unspecified date military unit 93921 was dissolved.
