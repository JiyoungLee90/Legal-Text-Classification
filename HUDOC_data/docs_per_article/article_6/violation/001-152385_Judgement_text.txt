The case originated in an application (no. 13344/11) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Radiša Lučić (“the applicant”), on 30 December 2010.
The applicant was represented by Ms R. Garibović, a lawyer practising in Novi Pazar. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms V. Rodić.
On 20 December 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Karan.
He was employed by Raketa-Putnički Saobraćaj AD, a company based in Užice (hereinafter “the debtor”).
Since the debtor had failed to fulfil its obligations toward its employees, the applicant brought three separate civil claims, seeking payment of salary arrears and various social security contributions.
On 31 August 2007 and 19 September 2007, respectively, the Municipal Court (Opštinski sud) in Užice rendered decisions ordering the debtor to pay the applicant certain sums. Both decisions became final on 9 October 2007.
Due to the debtor’s failure to fulfil its obligations from these decisions, the applicant submitted an enforcement request. On 15 May 2009 the Municipal Court (Opštinski sud) in Požega issued an enforcement order to that effect.
On 23 July 2009 the Municipal Court in Užice rendered a decision in the third set of civil proceedings brought by the applicant ordering the debtor to pay him an additional sum from the outstanding debt. On 2 September 2009 this decision became final.
Due to the debtor’s failure to fulfil its obligations from this decision, the applicant submitted an enforcement request. On 29 September 2009 the Municipal Court in Požega issued an enforcement order to that effect.
On 12 July 2010 the Commercial Court (Privredni sud) in Užice opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor. As a result, all of the ongoing enforcement proceedings against the debtor were terminated.
The applicant duly reported his claim based on the above-mentioned court decisions to the insolvency administration.
On 8 June 2011 the court accepted the applicant’s claim.
The insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor are still ongoing.
The debtor, which operated as a socially-owned company, was privatised on 27 December 2002.
On 17 July 2007 the privatisation was annulled because the buyer in question had failed to fulfil his contractual obligations.
Following the annulment of the debtor’s privatisation the State owned 58.18% of shares in the company.
On 11 December 2008 the State sold its shares to a private company.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially-owned companies, enforcement and insolvency proceedings is outlined in the cases of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06 et al., §§ 57-64 and §§ 71-76, 15 January 2008 and Jovičić and Others v. Serbia (dec.), no. 37270/11, §§ 88-93, 15 October 2013. Furthermore, the case-law of the Constitutional Court in respect of socially-owned companies, together with the relevant provisions concerning constitutional appeals and the privatisation of socially-owned companies, are outlined in the admissibility decision in Marinković v. Serbia (dec.), no. 5353/11, §§ 26-29 and §§ 31-44, 29 January 2013; and the judgment in Marinković v. Serbia, no. 5353/11, §§ 29-32, 22 October 2013.
