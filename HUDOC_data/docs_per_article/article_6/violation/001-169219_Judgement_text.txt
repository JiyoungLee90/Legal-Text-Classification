The case originated in an application (no. 57065/14) against the Republic of Albania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Albanian national, Mr Ylli Gjermeni (“the applicant”), on 8 August 2014.
The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms A. Hicka of the State Advocate’s Office.
On 15 December 2015 the complaint about the non-enforcement of a final court judgment was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Tirana.
On 18 June 2009 the applicant, who worked as General Deputy Director of State Social Service (Zëvendës Drejtor i Përgjithshëm i Shërbimit Social Shtetëror) at the Ministry of Work, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities (Ministria e Punës, Çështjeve Sociale dhe Shanseve të Barabarta) (“the Ministry”) was dismissed.
On 27 January 2010 the Tirana District Court accepted in part the applicant’s action against his dismissal. It ordered the applicant’s reinstatement and the payment of damages corresponding to five months’ salaries. By final judgment of 23 November 2010 the Tirana Court of Appeal upheld the Tirana District Court’s judgment.
On 6 May 2011 an enforcement writ was issued.
From 2011 to 2014 the bailiff office unsuccessfully attempted the enforcement of the final judgment.
On 9 December 2014 the authorities finally paid the damages to the applicant.
On 8 April 2016 the State Social Service requested the Ministry to examine the applicant’s reinstatement. On the same day the State Social Service addressed a letter to the Department of the Public Administration, stating that the position of the Deputy Director was available.
