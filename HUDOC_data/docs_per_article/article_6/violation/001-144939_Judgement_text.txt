The case originated in an application (no. 25326/11) against the Republic of Slovenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Ms Lilijana Kastelic (“the applicant”), on 12 April 2011.
The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms A. Vran, State Attorney.
On 30 August 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Ljubljana.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.
On 2 September 2009 the applicant stopped her car on the road in front of a school to let her children get out of the car. At that time, during a regular control, police officer S. found that the applicant had failed to use the seat-belt. The next day, the applicant allegedly approached S. and started insulting her. S. asked the applicant to follow her to the police station but the applicant refused to do so. Then S. requested the applicant to present her identity card which the applicant also refused to do. On the same day, S. issued a penalty notice against the applicant for not using the seat-belt, indecent behaviour, failure to comply with a public official’s lawful order and failure to submit identity papers. The fine amounted to 991.12 euros (EUR).
On 22 October 2009 the applicant filed a request for judicial review in which she submitted that on 3 September 2009 she was at home and she was not the person that S. dealt with.
On 15 September 2010 the Ljubljana Local Court heard S. According to the applicant, she was not informed of the hearing.
On 16 September 2010 the Local Court rejected the request for judicial review on the basis of S.’s statement. Moreover, it held that the applicant had failed to submit any evidence in support of her application.
On 11 October 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal challenging the Local Court’s findings of fact. Moreover, she complained that she had not been heard.
On 2 November 2010 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s constitutional appeal as inadmissible.
For the relevant provisions of the Minor Offences Act (hereinafter “the MOA”) and the Constitutional Court Act, see Suhadolc v. Slovenia ((dec.), no. 57655/08, 17 May 2011) and Flisar v. Slovenia (no. 3127/09, §§ 13-18, 29 September 2011).
Section 169 of the MOA provides:
“(1) A request for protection of legality may be filed against any decision issued at the second instance or against any final decision, if this Act or regulation governing minor offences has been violated.
(2) A request for protection of legality may be filed by a public prosecutor ex officio or at the initiative of a person who has the right to appeal against a minor offence judgment issued by a court of first instance.”
On 13 March 2011 Section 65 of the MOA was amended to the effect that the court shall inform the offender of its intention to repeat or supplement the evidence-taking procedure.
