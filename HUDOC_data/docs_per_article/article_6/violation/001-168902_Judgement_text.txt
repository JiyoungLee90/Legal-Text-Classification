The case originated in an application (no. 61691/13) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Homan d.o.o. (“the applicant company”), a commercial company incorporated under Croatian law, on 13 September 2013.
The applicant company was represented by Mr T. Vukičević, an advocate practising in Split. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.
On 7 March 2014 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant company is a limited liability company incorporated under Croatian law, which has its seat in Zagreb.
On 21 June 2000 the applicant company instituted civil proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) against the Croatian Health Insurance Fund seeking payment of 11,500 Croatian kunas (HRK) which had been unjustifiably seized from the company’s bank account for the alleged failure to pay health insurance contributions.
The Municipal Court scheduled sixteen hearings of which six were adjourned (in the period between 10 May 2005 and 3 November 2009) at the request of the applicant company.
The applicant company’s director failed to attend the hearing scheduled for 6 November 2006 without giving any reasons for his absence. Therefore, by a decision of the same day, the court decided to suspend the proceedings (mirovanje postupka) pursuant to the law. The proceedings continued upon the request of the applicant company of 21 February 2007.
The statutory conditions for the suspension of proceedings were again fulfilled on 2 March 2010 when the applicant company’s director attended the hearing but failed to engage in litigation. Accordingly, on the same date the Municipal Court issued a decision declaring that the applicant company’s action was to be considered withdrawn, pursuant to the law.
By a decision of 17 September 2010 the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant company against the first-instance decision. The County Court’s decision was served on the applicant company on 3 January 2011.
Meanwhile, on 1 April 2010 the applicant company lodged a request for protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time (zahtjev za zaštitu prava na suđenje u razumnom roku) with the Zagreb County Court, complaining about the excessive length of the above civil proceedings.
On 3 September 2010 the applicant company’s request was forwarded to the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske).
By a decision of 13 July 2011 the Supreme Court found a violation of the applicant company’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time and awarded it HRK 5,000 in compensation. It held that (a) even though there were no substantial periods of inactivity the mere fact that the Municipal Court had scheduled sixteen hearings suggested that the proceedings had not been conducted efficiently, and (b) the conduct of the applicant company significantly contributed to their length (see paragraphs 6-8 above).
The applicant company appealed.
By a decision of 6 September 2012 a three-judge panel of the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and served its decision on the applicant company on 13 November 2012.
By a decision of 31 January 2013 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) declared inadmissible the applicant company’s subsequent constitutional complaint, and served that decision on the company on 23 March 2013. The Constitutional Court held that the contested second-instance decision was not open to constitutional review.
The relevant domestic law and practice is set out in Vrtar v. Croatia, no. 39380/13, §§ 50, 52-56 and 61-63, 7 January 2016.
