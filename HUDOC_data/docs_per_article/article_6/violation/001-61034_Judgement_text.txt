The case originated in an application (no. 59539/00) against the Italian Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mrs Anna Maria Pulcini (“the applicant”) on 20 July 2000.
The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, and by their successive co-agents, respectively Mr V. Esposito and Mr F. Crisafulli.
The applicant complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that she had been unable to recover possession of her flat within a reasonable time. Invoking Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, she further complained about the length of the eviction proceedings.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.
On 7 March 2002 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in Monte Porzio Catone (Rome).
She is the owner of a flat in Monte Porzio Catone, which she had let to R.L.
In a registered letter of 7 July 1986, the applicant informed the tenant that she intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1987 and asked him to vacate the premises by that date.
The tenant told the applicant that he would not leave the premises.
In a writ served on the tenant on 9 December 1986, the applicant reiterated her intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Frascati Magistrate (Rome).
By a decision of 31 March 1987, which was made enforceable on 14 April 1987, the Frascati Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 December 1988.
On 10 January 1989, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises.
On 4 July 1989, she served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 27 July 1989.
Between 27 July 1989 and 26 May 2000 the bailiff made thirty-five attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as the applicant was never granted the assistance of the police in enforcing the order for possession.
In the meanwhile, on 12 July 1993, the applicant made a statutory declaration that she urgently required the premises as accommodation for her daughter.
On 8 June 2000, the applicant recovered possession of the flat.
The relevant domestic law is described in the Court’s judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V.
