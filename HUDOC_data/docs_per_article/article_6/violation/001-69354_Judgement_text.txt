On 5 August 2002, the Appeals Division of the  upheld the judgment, but speciﬁed that the debt was to be paid by the Ministry of Finance.
On 6 November 2002, the ministry asked the court to stay the enforcement of the judgment until January 2003, because there were no funds in the State budget of 2002.
On 19 November 2002, bailiffs opened enforcement proceedings.

In August 2003, the ministry asked the appeal court to clarify how the judgment was to be enforced.
On 3 September 2003, the appeal court clariﬁed that the judgment was to be enforced only once the applicant company had handed in the bond.

In addition, the applicant company argued that the judgment could be enforced on the basis of a writ of enforcement alone, and that the bond was to be returned to the ministry only after the enforcement. On 25 November 2003, the Federal Commercial Court of the Moscow Circuit dismissed this appeal.
On 18 February 2004, the applicant company handed in the bond to the ministry.
Subsequently, the applicant company unsuccessfully sought an injunction to oblige the ministry to enforce the judgment.
