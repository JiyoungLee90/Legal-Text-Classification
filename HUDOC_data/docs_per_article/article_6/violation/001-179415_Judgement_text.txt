The case originated in an application (no. 46227/11) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Ms Melahat Kılıç and Mr Yılmaz Kılıç (“the applicants”), on 19 May 2011.
The applicants were represented by Ms M. Yaman Yurdugül, a lawyer practising in İzmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 20 September 2016 the complaint concerning the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Military Administrative Court was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicants were born in 1961 and 1960 respectively and live in İzmir.
Following the death of their son during his military service, on 2 February 2006 the applicants initiated compensation proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court. On 20 October 2010 the Supreme Military Administrative Court, composed of five members, including three military judges and two military officers, dismissed the case. This judgment was notified on the applicants on 29 November 2010.
A description of the domestic law at the material time can be found in Yavuz v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 29870/96, 25 May 2000), and Tanışma v. Turkey (no. 32219/05, §§ 29-47, 17 November 2015).
