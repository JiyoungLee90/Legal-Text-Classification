The case of Foti and others was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission"). The case originated in four applications (nos. 7604/76, 7719/76, 7781/77 and 7913/77) against the  lodged with the Commission in 1976 and 1977 by four Italian nationals, Mr. Benito Foti, Mr. Felice Lentini, Mr. Demetrio Cenerini and Mr. Giovanni Gulli, under Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention. On 9 May 1977, the Commission ordered the first three applications to be joined and, on 11 May 1978, ordered the fourth application to be joined to the other three.
The Commission’s request was lodged with the registry of the Court on 20 May 1981, within the period of three months laid down by Articles 32 § 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47). The request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the  recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request is to obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the case disclose a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1).
The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. C. Russo, the elected judge of Italian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. G. Wiarda, the President of the Court (Rule 21-3-b of the Rules of Court). On 30 May 1981, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely, Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert, Mr. D. Evrigenis, Mr. J. Pinheiro Farinha, Mr. E. García de Enterría and Sir Vincent Evans (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21-4) (art. 43).
Mr. Wiarda, who had assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5) ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Italian Government ("the Government") and the Delegate of the Commission regarding the procedure to be followed. On 15 June 1981, he directed that the Agent should have until 31 October 1981 to lodge a memorial and that the Delegate should be entitled to reply in writing within two months from the date of the transmission of the Government’s memorial to him by the Registrar. On 3 November, the President extended the first time-limit to 16 November.
The official French text of the Government’s memorial and its appendices was received at the registry on 23 November 1981 and 7 January 1982, respectively.
On 21 January 1982, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would present his observations at the hearings; on 27 January, he forwarded to the Registrar the observations by applicants Foti, Lentini and Cenerini on the Government’s memorial, stating that they also represented Mr. Gulli’s views.
Having consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission, the President directed on 4 February that the oral proceedings should open on 21 April.
The hearings were held in public at the , , on 21 April. Shortly before their opening, the Chamber had held a preparatory meeting; it had authorised the use of Italian by the persons assisting the Delegate of the Commission (Rule 27 § 3).
There appeared before the Court:
- for the Government:
- for the Commission:
The Court heard their submissions and statements as well as their replies to the questions put by the Court and two of its members.
On various dates between 15 December 1981 and 17 August 1982, the registry received from the Commission and the Government, respectively, numerous documents and items of information either requested by or on behalf of the Chamber or provided by the Commission or the Government on their own initiative. This material included the four initial applications (14 March 1976, 2 September 1976, 28 November 1976 and 15 April 1977), several letters from the applicants to the Commission (13 April 1976, 26 June 1976, 25 August 1976, 11 October 1976, 28 October 1976, 20 December 1976, 26 December 1976, 4 February 1977, 16 February 1977, 24 February 1977, 1 April 1977, 18 August 1977 and 9 October 1977), the written observations submitted to the Commission by the Government (9 July 1977, 10 October 1977, 12 January 1978, 1 March 1978, 6 March 1979 and 25 October 1979) and the verbatim record of the hearing on 12 December 1979 before the Commission.
At the deliberations held on 23 November 1982, Mr. R. Bernhardt, first substitute judge, replaced Mr. E. García de Enterría, who was prevented from attending (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1).
The applicants, who are all Italian nationals, live in Reggio Calabria. They were prosecuted for acts committed in the course of demonstrations that took place in Reggio Calabria between 1970 and 1973. The popular unrest, which was particularly heightened between July 1970 and April 1971, was triggered off by the decision to transfer the capital of the  from Reggio (its traditional site) to , and became particularly widespread on account of the economic situation in this part of the region. It took the form of general strikes, dynamite bombings and clashes with the police. It led to hundreds of arrests, about 1,200 charges and, in 1970 and 1971 alone, to 459 prosecutions; 94 of these were transferred, for serious reasons of public policy (Article 55 of the Code of Criminal Procedure - see paragraph 31 below), to a court in another town, including 86 to the Potenza Regional Court.
As to the exact dates of the facts concerning each applicant, the evidence in the case-file contains numerous contradictions and uncertainties which the efforts of the Court, and in particular the questions it put to the persons appearing before it, have not entirely succeeded in removing. Subject to this reservation, the facts may be summarised as follows:
Mr. Benito Foti was born in 1932 and is a clerk. He complains of three different proceedings instituted against him.
On 9 October 1970, the applicant was charged, together with three other persons, with obstructing the public highway and seditious assembly. The preliminary investigation commenced before the  had to be suspended by reason of the election to the Chamber of Deputies on 7 May 1972 of one of the applicant’s co-accused, Mr. Fortunato Aloi. In 1975, the Chamber of Deputies authorised Mr. Aloi’s parliamentary immunity to be waived (Article 65 of the Constitution), following which, on 22 March 1976, the investigating judge committed the persons concerned, including Mr. Foti, for trial.
On 17 May 1976, the public prosecutor ( procuratore della Repubblica ) of Reggio requested the public prosecutor ( procuratore generale ) attached to the Catanzaro Court of Appeal to apply for the case to be remitted to a court other than the Reggio Regional Court, for serious reasons of public policy. By order of 20 December 1976, registered on 12 January 1977, the Court of Cassation granted the application made by the latter public prosecutor on 22 May and transferred the case to the , which received the case-file on 17 January 1977.
On 21 December 1977, the  summoned the applicant to appear. On 15 February 1978, it delivered a judgment acquitting the applicant, which was entered in the court registry on 27 February.
In September 1971, Mr. Foti was arrested and charged, together with another person, with obstructing the public highway, seditious assembly, illegal possession of weapons (tear-gas grenades) and "serious resistance" to the police.
In November 1971, the Reggio investigating judge committed the applicant for trial. The committal decision included a discharge on one of the counts. In January 1976, the investigation chamber of the  declared inadmissible the appeal that the public prosecutor’s office (pubblico ministero) had brought on that point.
In February 1976, the Reggio public prosecutor requested the public prosecutor attached to the Catanzaro Court of Appeal to apply for the case to be remitted to a court other than the , for serious reasons of public policy. By order of 11 June 1976, registered at the beginning of September, the Court of Cassation granted the application made in March 1976 by the latter public prosecutor and transferred the case to the .
The  public prosecutor’s office received the case-file on 1 October and transmitted it to the  on 26 November. The applicant, after being summoned on 9 December 1976 to appear on 1 February 1977, received a four months’ suspended sentence and a fine for illegal possession of weapons but was acquitted on the remaining charges.
On 2 June 1977, the Potenza Court of Appeal upheld this decision against which Mr. Foti had appealed. The applicant’s subsequent appeal on a point of law to the Court of Cassation was dismissed on 25 June 1979.
On 21 March 1973, the applicant was arrested and charged, together with two other persons, with obstructing the public highway.
On 27 February 1976, the Reggio public prosecutor requested the public prosecutor attached to the Catanzaro Court of Appeal to apply for the case to be remitted to a court other than the , for serious reasons of public policy. By order of 14 June 1976, which was registered the following day, the Court of Cassation granted the application made by the latter public prosecutor on 5 March 1976 and transferred the case to the .
The applicant was committed for trial on 14 January 1977. The  summoned Mr. Foti to appear on 29 March 1977, but had to adjourn the hearings until 7 June. On that date, it delivered a decision, which became final, acquitting the applicant.
Mr. Felice Lentini was born in 1939 and is a carpenter. In September 1970, together with eight others, he was arrested and charged with resisting the police.
The Reggio Calabria public prosecutor conducted the investigation according to the "summary" procedure (Article 389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) and committed the applicant for trial on 18 September 1972.
On 24 May 1974, however, he requested the public prosecutor attached to the Catanzaro Court of Appeal to apply for the case to be remitted to a court other than the , for serious reasons of public policy. By order of 16 June 1975, the Court of Cassation granted the application made by the latter public prosecutor on 14 June 1974 and transferred the case to the .
The  Regional Court, at its first hearing on 26 May 1976, concluded that the ordinary procedure should be followed and consequently referred the case-file to an investigating judge for examination. After once more being committed for trial approximately two months later, Mr. Lentini was acquitted by the  on 18 January 1977 for lack of evidence by a decision which became final.
Mr. Demetrio Cenerini was born in 1942 and is a messenger. He was arrested on 15 July 1970 and charged on 18 July, together with seventeen other persons, with insulting the police. He was released from custody on 31 July 1970. The Reggio Calabria investigating judge committed him for trial on 18 October 1972.
On 27 May 1974, the Reggio public prosecutor requested the public prosecutor attached to the Catanzaro Court of Appeal to apply to the Court of Cassation for the case to be remitted to a court other than the , for serious reasons of public policy. The latter public prosecutor did so on 3 June 1974, but did not forward the case-file until each of the eighteen persons charged had been served with judicial notification (see paragraphs 33-36 below). By order of 17 January 1975, which was registered approximately three months later, the Court of Cassation granted the application and transferred the case to the .
The  Regional Court, before which proceedings had been commenced by the public prosecutor’s office in April 1976, summoned the applicant on 22 September to appear before it on 30 November. At that hearing, the defence objected, under Article 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that the committal order was void because it had not been notified of the lodging of the preliminary investigation documents at the court registry before closure of the investigation proceedings. On 30 November 1976, the Court allowed the objection. Consequently, it sent the case-file back to the investigating judge, who on 12 May 1977 made a new committal order.
A first hearing fixed for 16 January 1978 had to be postponed because some important witnesses did not attend. At the following hearing on 15 March 1978, the case had to be adjourned again because the composition of the chamber had changed. Finally, on 7 June 1978, the Court discharged Mr. Cenerini, finding that the period of limitation had expired on 15 January 1978 (Articles 157 and 160 of the Penal Code).
Mr. Giovanni Gulli was born in 1952 and is a labourer. He was arrested on 16 July 1970 and charged on 18 July, together with fifty-three others, with resisting and insulting the police, obstructing the public highway and seditious assembly. The Reggio Calabria investigating judge committed him for trial on 3 March 1973.
On 16 November 1974, the Reggio public prosecutor requested the public prosecutor attached to the Catanzaro Court of Appeal to apply to the Court of Cassation for the case to be remitted to a court other than the , for serious reasons of public policy. The latter public prosecutor did so on 3 December 1974, but did not forward the case-file until 15 December 1975, after service of judicial notification on each of the fifty-four accused (see paragraphs 33-36 below). By order of 26 January 1976, which was lodged in the registry on 12 March 1976, the Court of Cassation granted the application and transferred the case to the .
The  Regional Court, before which proceedings had been commenced by the public prosecutor’s office in June 1977, summoned the applicant on 2 February 1978 to appear before it on 29 March. At the hearing on that date, the consideration of the case had to be adjourned until 2 October because it had proved impossible to serve judicial notification on some of the accused.
On 2 October 1978, the  discharged Mr. Gulli, finding that the period of limitation had expired on 15 January 1978 (Articles 157 and 160 of the Penal Code).
Article 55, first paragraph, of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides (translation from Italian):
"At any time during or at any stage of the proceedings on the merits, on application by the public prosecutor attached to the Court of Appeal or the Court of Cassation, the Court of Cassation may transfer the preliminary investigation or trial proceedings to a different court, on serious grounds of public policy or on grounds of legitimate suspicion."
Article 56, second paragraph, specifies that the application is to be communicated to the accused (imputato) by the registry of the public prosecutor’s office. The transfer proceedings suspend neither the preliminary investigation nor the trial, unless the Court of Cassation, which gives its ruling on the application by means of an order (Article 58), directs otherwise (Article 57).
Under Article 45 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (translation from Italian):
"There is a close connection between proceedings in the following cases:
Where the prosecutions concern offences (reati) committed on the same occasion by several persons gathered together ...;
 ...
If the evidence of an offence or of one of its circumstances is material for the evidence of another offence or one of its circumstances."
Where a close connection exists, Article 413 of that Code provides that proceedings may be joined provided this serves to expedite the procedure.
Notifications in criminal cases are governed by the rules laid down by Articles 166 to 179 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
As regards the initial notification of an accused person who is not in custody and where it is impossible to effect service on the person concerned, a copy shall be left at his domicile or normal place of work, with a third party living with him, even temporarily, or, failing that, with a caretaker or equivalent. If both places are unknown, a copy of the document shall be served on one of these persons wherever the accused resides or has an address. Where there are no such persons, or where they are unable or unwilling to accept service of a copy of the document, the latter shall be lodged in the town hall of the municipality in which the accused lives or, failing that, in which he has his normal place of work; notice that the document has been lodged shall be posted on the door of the accused’s home or normal place of work (Article 169).
If notification is nevertheless impossible, the official responsible for serving it shall so inform the competent judicial or prosecuting authority. That authority, after having ordered further searches, in particular at the accused’s place of birth or his last place of residence, shall draw up a declaration to the effect that the accused is untraceable (decreto di irreperibilità), assigning him a defence lawyer if he does not already have one and requiring that the notification which could not be served and any future notifications be lodged with the registry of the judicial authority ( ufficio giudiziario ) conducting the proceedings (Article 170).
Under Article 171, the accused is asked, in the first formal document in the proceedings to elect a domicile for notification purposes; he is required to report any change of domicile. According to the legislation applicable at the time (amended by Act no. 534 of 8 August 1977), where the information provided on this matter by the person concerned proved incomplete, further searches had to be conducted pursuant to Articles 169 and 170.
By virtue of Article 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a court is obliged, at any stage of the proceedings, to take notice of its own motion of the extinction of an offence; statutory limitation takes effect by operation of law.
The statutory limitation period varies from eighteen months to twenty years, according to the seriousness of the potential penalty (Article 157 of the Penal Code); in calculating the period, account has to be taken of any suspension or interruption that may have occurred (Articles 159 and 160 of the Penal Code). Thus, in the case of Mr. Cenerini and Mr. Gulli, the period was seven and a half years (see paragraphs 27 and 30 above).
Mr. Foti, Mr. Lentini, Mr. Cenerini and Mr. Gulli applied to the Commission on 14 March 1976, 2 September 1976, 22 November 1976 and 15 April 1977, respectively.
Each of the first three applicants complained of the transfer of his trial to the Potenza Regional Court, claiming that such a measure was incompatible with Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. Mr. Cenerini also complained, under Articles 2, 3, 4 and 5 (art. 2, art. 3, art. 4, art. 5), of ill-treatment he allegedly suffered at the hands of the police and of his detention in the police station.
Gulli’s grievance was that the Governor of Reggio Calabria had on 2 December 1976 refused, because of the prosecution brought against him, to authorise his appointment as a personal guard (guardia particolare); he regarded this decision as a violation of Article 4 § 1 (art. 4-1). In a subsequent letter dated 7 May 1977, he made an additional submission on this point on the basis of Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2); in addition, he alleged violation of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) both on the ground that the proceedings had exceeded a "reasonable time" and because of the transfer of his trial to the Potenza Regional Court.
In their preliminary written observations, drafted by Mr. Corigliano on their behalf, the applicants used extremely strong language which the Court regards as unacceptable. For this reason too, the Commission decided on 14 October 1977 that it would no longer accept this lawyer as the adviser of Mr. Foti, Mr. Lentini and Mr. Cenerini, who thereupon appointed another lawyer (appendices I and II to the report).
On 9 May 1977, the Commission ordered the joinder of the first three applications under Rule 29 of its Rules of Procedure and decided to examine of its own motion the issue of trial "within a reasonable time", within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1), and the issue of Article 13 (art. 13). In a memorial dated 18 August 1977, Mr. Foti, Mr. Lentini and Mr. Cenerini stated that they "adopted as their own" (" facciamo nostri") the reasons that led the Commission to take this initiative, adding that the breach of both provisions was "already implicitly alleged in the narrative part of their applications" (" violazione, peraltro, implicitamente già dedotta nella narrativa dei nostri ricorsi "). They thereby answered one of the Government’s preliminary objections.
On 11 May 1978, the Commission declared the four applications admissible only in so far as they related to the length of the criminal proceedings in question; it rejected the remainder of the complaints ratione temporis, ratione materiae, for being manifestly ill-founded or for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, depending upon the circumstances. It joined Mr. Gulli’s application to the other three.
In its report of 15 October 1980 (Article 31 of the Convention) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that the applicants’ cases had not been heard "within a reasonable time" and that there had thus been a breach of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1); it considered it unnecessary to rule on the application of Article 13 (art. 13) in the instant case.
