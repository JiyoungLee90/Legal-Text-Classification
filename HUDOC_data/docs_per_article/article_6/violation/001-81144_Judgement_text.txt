The case originated in an application (no. 19981/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Andrei Botnari (“the applicant”), on 1 April 2002.
The applicant was represented by Ms Luciana Iabangi, from the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in , a non-governmental organisation based in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V. Pârlog.
The applicant complained that the failure to enforce the judgment of 25 May 2000 violated his right to have his civil claims determined by a court within a reasonable time, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, and his right to an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 7 October 2003 a Chamber of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Chişinău.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The applicant is a public prosecutor. According to Law no. 902-XII of 29 January 1992 the local authorities are obliged to provide public prosecutors with an apartment within one year of their commencing employment. In 1999 the applicant filed an official request with the local council for an apartment. The local council replied that due to the lack of funds allocated from the central budget, no new apartments had been built and the provisions of the law could not be enforced.
In March 2000 the applicant brought a civil action against the local council. On 25 May 2000 the Chişinău District Court ordered the local council to provide him with an apartment. No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final and enforceable 15 days later.
The applicant obtained an enforcement warrant which the bailiff failed to enforce. Because the local council did not comply with the judgment of 25 May 2000 and with other judgments, it was fined 1,800 Moldovan lei (MDL) by a decision of 9 February 2001 of the Chişinău District Court. According to the Government, the same court fined the local council MDL 2,700 on 17 February 2001 on account of its continued failure to enforce the judgment. The applicant disputes that the second fine was ever imposed.
On an unspecified date the applicant wrote to the Ministry of Justice, complaining about the non-enforcement of the judgment. In a letter addressed to the applicant on 26 December 2000, the Ministry of Justice assured the applicant that everything possible was being done to enforce the judgment.
On 23 December 2001 the applicant wrote another letter to the Ministry of Justice. That letter was forwarded to the Chişinău District Court. The applicant also wrote letters on numerous occasions to the Prime Minister and the President of Moldova.
The judgment of 25 May 2000 has still not been enforced.
The relevant domestic law has been set out in Prodan v. Moldova (no. 49806/99, ECHR 2004III (extracts)).
