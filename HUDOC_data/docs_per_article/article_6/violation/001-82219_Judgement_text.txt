All the applicants are Ukrainian nationals and reside in the Bashtansky District of the Mykolayiv region.

By decisions of 21 September and 1 October 2001 the  awarded each applicant UAH 590 against the Bailiffs for non-pecuniary damage caused by the failure to execute the judgments given in their favour against the JSC.
On 8 January 2002 the Bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgments of 21 September and 1 October 2001.
On 16 September 2004 the writs of execution were returned to the applicants unenforced due to the debtor's lack of funds.
