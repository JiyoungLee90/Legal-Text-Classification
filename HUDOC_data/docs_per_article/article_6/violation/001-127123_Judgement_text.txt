The case originated in an application (no. 63153/10) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Hungarian nationals, Mr Dávid Faragó (“the first applicant”), Ms Dóra Miklódy (“the second applicant”) and Mr Tamás Faragó (“the third applicant”), on 20 October 2010. The applicants were represented by Mr I. Tóth, a lawyer practising in Budapest.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 7 March 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1995, 1969 and 1962, respectively.
On 6 July 1995 the second applicant gave birth to a boy, the first applicant. In 1996 the latter was diagnosed with cerebral atrophy.
On 1 October 1997 the applicants lodged a medical liability action against the hospital where the first applicant was born.
On 30 October 2009 the Pest Central District Court partly found for the applicants and ordered the respondent to pay them respectively 47,647,959 Hungarian forints (HUF) (approximately 163,000 euros (EUR)), HUF 8,000,000 (approximately EUR 27,000) and HUF 3,000,000 (approximately EUR 10,000) and accrued interests. The respondent appealed.
On 26 March 2010 the Budapest Regional Court, acting as a second-instance court, gave judgment, upholding the first-instance decision.
On 21 May 2010 a written copy of the decision was served on the applicants’ lawyer.
