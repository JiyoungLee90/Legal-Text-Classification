The case originated in an application (no. 30616/05) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Nikolay Nikolayevich Akashev (“the applicant”), on 16 July 2005.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mrs V. Milinchuk, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 18 June 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3). The Government objected to the joint examination of the admissibility and merits, but the Court rejected this objection.
The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Aykhal, a town in Yakutia.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
In 1991 the applicant subscribed to a State savings scheme for buying a car. The State failed to provide the car, and the applicant had to apply to a court.
On 19 August 2003 the Mirninskiy District Court of Yakutia awarded the applicant 138,967 Russian roubles (“RUB”) against the Ministry of Finance. On 6 October 2003 the judgment became binding, but was not enforced immediately.
On 23 October 2003 the district court mailed the writ of enforcement to the bailiff’s service. The bailiff’s service considered that the judgment should be enforced by the Ministry of Finance, and on 27 November 2003 returned the writ to the court. On 5 April 2004 the applicant collected the writ from the court and mailed it to the Ministry of Finance.
On 12 August 2004 the Ministry of Finance applied for a supervisory review of the judgment.
On 28 October 2004 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of Yakutia allowed the Ministry’s application and quashed the judgment. According tothe applicant, he received a copy of this decision on 19 March 2005.
On 7 September 2005 the Ministry paid to the applicant RUB 50,247.98 under the State program of redemption of in-kind debentures.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment in two months. Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment in three months.
