The case originated in an application (no. 29699/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Sergey Fedorovich Sergeyev (“the applicant”), on 9 April 2009.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 19 May 2014 the complaints concerning the conditions of detention and the absence of applicant’s counsel from an appeal hearing were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Moscow.
On 13 August 2008 the Taganskiy District Court of Moscow found the applicant guilty of corruption and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment.
The applicant appealed. On 13 October 2008 the Moscow City Court modified the judgment on appeal. It characterised the offence as an abuse of power and reduced the sentence to one and a half years’ imprisonment. A prosecutor was present during the hearing and made oral submissions. The applicant also attended the hearing, but was not represented. As it happened, on the same day his lawyer had asked the City Court to examine the case in his absence.
Between 21 November 2007 and 3 November 2008 the applicant was held in remand prison IZ-77/2 in Moscow. The prison was overcrowded.
