The case originated in an application (no. 38576/97) against the Italian Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Carlo Barattelli (“the applicant”), on 19 December 1996.
The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, assisted by their Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant, in particular, complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of a set of criminal proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 15 March 2001 the Chamber declared the application partly admissible.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.
On 4 May 1988 the Genoa Public Prosecutor's Office informed the applicant that criminal proceedings concerning his public duties (the applicant was a civil servant in the Ministry of Public Works) had been instituted against him. These proceedings were subsequently transferred to the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office, and on 7 September 1988 the Milan investigating judge informed the applicant that a charge of corruption was pending against him.
On 26 May 1989 the applicant was heard by the Milan investigating judge.
On 31 May 1991 the applicant and forty-four other persons were committed for trial before the Milan District Court. The first hearing, initially scheduled for 27 January 1993, took place on 12 January 1994.
In a judgement of 31 March 1994, the District Court, following the plea bargain procedure (“applicazione della pena su richiesta delle parti”) sentenced the applicant to one year and four months' imprisonment. This decision was filed with the registry only on 19 March 1997. It became final on 6 July 1997.
In the meantime, by an order of 31 July 1995, the Ministry of Public Works dismissed the applicant from his post as a consequence of his criminal conviction.
