The case originated in an application (no. 11072/03) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Croatian nationals, Mrs Marija Popara and Mrs Željka Popara (“the applicants”), on 15 March 2003
The applicants were represented by Mr M. Mihočević, a lawyer practising in . The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Štefica Stažnik.
On 8 December 2004 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the applicants' right of access to a court to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
The applicants were born in 1976 and 1979 respectively and live in Karlovac.
In 1991 business premises owned by D.P., the applicants' late father, were blown up by unknown perpetrators. Some time later, his car was also damaged beyond repair by an explosive device.
D.P. instituted civil proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) in 1994, seeking compensation from the State. He relied on section 180 of the Civil Obligations Act (Zakon o obveznim odnosima).
On 17 January 1996 Parliament introduced an amendment to the Civil Obligations Act, which provided that all proceedings concerning actions for damages resulting from terrorist acts were to be stayed pending the enactment of new legislation. The new legislation was to be enacted within six months.
Pursuant to the above legislation, the Zagreb Municipal Court stayed D.P.'s proceedings on 5 February 1998. On his appeal, on 31 August 1999 the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) quashed that decision and remitted the case.
D.P. died on 25 February 2000.
The Municipal Court again issued a decision staying the proceedings on 16 July 2001.
The applicants and their late mother, acting as D.P.'s heirs, filed a constitutional complaint with the  (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) on 7 May 2002, complaining about the length of the proceedings and the lack of access to a court. They relied on section 63 of the  Act and Article 29 § 1 of the Constitution.
On 28 April 2004 the  accepted the applicants' complaint, ordered the Zagreb Municipal Court to bring the proceedings to an end within six months and awarded each of the complainants the amount of 4,400 Croatian kunas (HRK) wich is approximately euros (EUR) 600.
The proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Court were resumed on 18 May 2004 when it declared the applicants' action inadmissible finding that it no longer had jurisdiction in the matter. The decision was quashed by the Zagreb County Court on 30 December 2004.
The proceedings are currently pending before the Zagreb Municipal Court.
