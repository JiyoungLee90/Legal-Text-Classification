The case originated in two applications (nos. 58821/08 and 18360/13) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals, Ms Lipa Nozhayevna Indayeva (“the first applicant”) and Mr Shamkhan Sultanovich Sultanov (“the second applicant”), on 6 August 2008 and 18 February 2013 respectively.
The first applicant was initially represented by Mr U. S.-M. Khasiyev and since 2016 also by Ms E.M. Khalimova, lawyers practising in Grozny. The second applicant was represented by Ms E.M. Khalimova. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
In the wake of the pilot judgment in the case of Gerasimov and Others v. Russia, on 24 November 2014 the complaints concerning the nonenforcement of the judgments in the applicants’ favour and the lack of the effective remedy in respect of the non-enforcement complaint were communicated to the Government for settlement or resolution (see Gerasimov and Others v. Russia, nos.  and 10 others, §§ 230-31 and point 13 of the operative part, 1 July 2014), and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court. On 29 September 2016 the Government advised the Court that they were unable to settle the applications, as the domestic judgments in the applicants’ favour had remained unenforced.
The applicants were born in 1958 and 1960 respectively and live in Groznyy and Verkhniy Naur, Chechnya.
At the relevant time the applicants were residents of Chechnya. Their property was damaged in the course of a counterterrorist operation in 19992000. They sought to obtain no-fault compensation provided for by Government Decree no. 404 of 4 July 2003. That decree established the right of all permanent residents of the Chechen Republic who had lost their housing and any possessions therein after 12 December 1994 to receive compensation up to a maximum amount of 300,000 Russian roubles (RUB) for housing and RUB 50,000 for other possessions. The decree was subsequently changed on several occasions. In 2012 its application was extended beyond the initially determined period of 2003-2004.
The applicants’ individual situations can be summarised as follows.
The first applicant owned a half of the house no. 13 at Magistralnaya Street, Grozny. The house was completely destroyed during the hostilities in 1999-2000, as confirmed by the evaluation report dated 30 September 2003.
On 4 November 2003 she submitted an application for administrative compensation to the Commission for compensation for lost property (Комиссия по рассмотрению заявлений граждан о компенсационных выплатах за утраченное жилье и имущество, hereafter “the Commission”) and provided requisite documents. She received an acknowledgment of receipt of documents (nos. 03/6748, 03/14465). Despite her repeated requests in April-September 2004, she received no reply. She complained to a district court about the Commission’s failure to act.
On 28 February 2005 the Staropromyslovskiy District Court of Grozny declared the Commission’s inaction unlawful and ordered the Commission “to take a decision on the issue of payment of the compensation for destroyed housing to [the applicant]”. The judgment entered into force on 11 March 2005.
In May 2006 the Commission informed the applicant that her application in respect of the destroyed house “would be included in the list of destroyed housing” once the technical units of the Federal authority on construction and municipal services (технические группы Федерального агентства по строительству и ЖКХ по формированию перечня разрушенного жилья на территории Чеченской республики, hereafter “the technical units”) complete examination of all destroyed housing in Chechnya.
In 2008 the Commission informed the applicant that the decision as to whether her house was to be included in the list of destroyed housing could not be taken in the absence of replies from the Federal Migration Service, Ministry of Interior and a technical inventory company.
The applicant sued the Government of the Chechen Republic and the Ministry of Finance of Chechnya for compensation of pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage resulting from the Commission’s failure to act. On 14 April 2008 the Staropromyslovskiy District Court rejected her claim, pointing out that the Commission was unable to proceed in the absence of a corresponding entry in the register of destroyed buildings (“the register”), which was to be updated by a technical unit. On 24 June 2008 the Supreme Court of Chechnya upheld the judgment on appeal.
The second applicant owned a two-room flat at Proletarskaya, 72, apt. 4 in Grozny (as confirmed by the decision of 11 February 2005 of the Leninskiy District Court of Grozny). The house was completely destroyed during the hostilities in 1999-2000, as subsequently confirmed by an evaluation report of 10 February 2009.
On 27 April 2005 the applicant submitted an application for administrative compensation to the Commission and provided requisite documents. It follows from the letter of the Commission to the Ombudsman of the Chechen republic dated 15 June 2007 that at some point a technical unit had examined the applicant’s living premises and issued a “positive conclusion”. The Commission undertook to include the applicant’s application no. 22/10034 into the list of destroyed housing.
The applicant on several occasions requested to accelerate the provision of the housing, as his flat was destroyed and he had six minor children, two of them suffering from disabilities. In March 2009 he was registered as a person eligible for social housing because his flat had been destroyed, and put on the waiting list for housing provision. In 2011 his number in that list was 4398.
In July 2011 the applicant learned that his application had not been examined by the Commission since in August 2005 the work of the technical unit had been put on hold and the list of destroyed housing has not been updated since that time.
On 26 July 2011 the Leninskiy District Court of Grozny granted the applicant’s claim against the Secretariat of the Commission “to be included in the list of recipients of the compensation, with subsequent payment of the compensation for housing and property destroyed during the hostilities on the territory of the Chechen Republic”. The court declared unlawful the Commission’s failure to include the applicant’s name in the lists of persons receiving the compensation and ordered the Secretariat of the Commission “to include the applicant’s name in the list of persons in receipt of the compensation (в список получателей компенсации)”.
The judgment entered into force on 9 August 2011. In October 2011 the district court issued a writ of execution and forwarded it to the bailiffs service. On 4 May 2012 the bailiffs discontinued the enforcement proceedings owning to the impossibility to execute the writ.
On 16 May 2012 the Commission informed the applicant that his flat had not been entered in the register of destroyed buildings.
In April 2012 applicant sought to obtain damages from the Commission and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. On 31 July 2012 the Leninskiy District Court of Grozny dismissed his action, as the applicant had failed to prove the authorities’ fault. On 8 November 2012 the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic upheld the refusal. The applicant’s cassation appeal was disallowed by a judge of the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic on 1 February 2013.
In 2012 the applicant lodged a claim for compensation for the nonenforcement of the judgment of 26 July 2011. On 13 November 2012 the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic returned the application to him unexamined.
The Commission did not process the applicants’ claims until September 2013.
The Commission held a final meeting on 16 September 2013 and, according to the minutes of the meeting, rejected all claims lodged by the owners of property which had not been entered in the register of destroyed buildings. Both applicants were in that category. In January 2014 the Commission ceased to exist.
The judgments in the applicants’ favour have not been enforced.
