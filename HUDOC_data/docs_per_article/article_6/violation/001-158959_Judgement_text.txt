.  The case originated in an application (no. 5250/07) against the Republic of Albania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Albanian national, Mr Xhaferr Bici (“the applicant”), on 4 December 2006.
.  The applicant was represented by Mr S. Puto, a lawyer practising in Tirana. The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their then Agent, Ms E. Hajro of the State Advocate’s Office.
.  On 5 February 2009 the application was communicated to the Government.
.  The applicant was born in 1926 and lives in Durrës.
.  The applicant’s father was the owner of two plots of agricultural land, which, at some point, were expropriated by the communist regime.
On 19 September 1996 the Durrës District Court acknowledged the existence of the applicant’s inherited property rights to a plot of agricultural land measuring 72,000 sq. m in accordance with Article 388 of the Civil Code (vërtetim fakti juridik). The operative provision reads as follows:
“the court accepts the plaintiff’s civil action and acknowledges the existence of the legal fact that his father possessed an agricultural plot of land measuring 72,000 sq. m (...). This recognition is made for compensation purposes (“pranimin e kërkesë padisë së paditësit Xhaferr Bici duke vërtetuar faktin juridik të pronësisë së babait të tij mbi një sipërfaqe toke bujqësore 72,000 sq. m (...). Kjo njohje bëhet për efekt kompensimi).”
On 26 September 1996 the applicant, relying on the District Court’s decision, lodged an application with the Durrës Property Restitution and Compensation Commission (Komisioni i Kthimit dhe Kompensimit të Pronave – “the Commission”) seeking the recognition, restitution and/or compensation of the property.
From 2001 to 2008, the applicant requested several authorities to recognise his property right and restore the property to him.
On 11 March and 19 November 2002 the Durrës Prefecture (Prefektura e Qarkut Durrës) and the Commission stated that the application had been pending since 1996. The Commission also stated that the application was to be examined on the basis of the 1993 Property Act, as amended.
On 28 August 2007 the Commission confirmed that no decision had been taken in relation to the application of 26 September 1996. The letter included a list of documents that were part of the applicant’s file.
.  On 14 July 2008 the Commission returned the applicant his application of 26 September 1996. It stated that no decision could be taken on the strength of the District Court’s decision of 19 September 1996 on the basis of section 17 of the 2004 Property Act, as amended (see paragraph 16 below). It further noted that the 1993 Property Act and the subsequent statutory legal acts, which provided for the recognition of the property rights on the basis of a decision acknowledging the existence of a legal fact about alleged property rights (vërtetim fakti juridik), had been repealed.
.  There is no acknowledgment of receipt of the Commission’s letter of 14 July 2008 by the applicant.
.  The Property Acts are described in detail in the judgments of Gjonbocari v. Albania (no. 10508/02, 23 October 2007); Driza v. Albania (no. 33771/02, 13 November 2007); Ramadhi v. Albania (no. 38222/02, 13 November 2007); Hamzaraj v. Albania (no. 2) (no. 45265/04, 22 September 2009); Luli and Others v. Albania (nos. 64480/09, 64482/09, 12874/10, 56935/10, 3129/12 and 31355/09, 1 April 2014); and, Manushaqe Puto and Others v. Albania, nos. 604/07, 43628/07, 46684/07 and 34770/09, 31 July 2012.
.  The relevant provisions, in so far as this case is concerned, are as follows:
.  Section 22 of the 1993 Property Act provided that, the recognition of a property right was based on official documents to be submitted by a former owner. In the absence of such official documents, the existence of alleged property rights could be acknowledged by a court decision in the presence of the defendant party. Consequently, a former owner was entitled to lodge an application with the Commission for the recognition of his alleged inherited property rights based on such a court decision. The 2004 Property Act repealed the 1993 Property Act.
.  Under section 17 of the 2004 Property Act, as amended, the timelimit for submitting new applications was extended. It was also provided that the Agency for Compensation and Restitution of Properties in Tirana (Agjencia e Kthimit dhe Kompensimit të Pronave ish  pronarëve  “the Central Agency”) would not take any decisions in relation to applications whose claims were solely based on a court decision which acknowledged the existence of a legal fact in accordance with Article 388 of the Code of Civil Procedure. All applications based on such a decision would be returned to the claimant within thirty days of submission and no further action would be taken.
.  Section 19 § 1 of the 2004 Property Act provided for the possibility of submitting new applications for the recognition, restitution and compensation of a property. In accordance with section 22, a former owner could make a new application for the recognition, restitution or compensation of the remainder of the property which had not been previously decided upon by the Commission.
.  Under Article 324 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) a claimant may seek the annulment of an administrative decision. A claimant may also challenge the authorities’ refusal to take an administrative decision within the prescribed time-limit.
Article 388 of the CCP provides that any interested party has the right to request that the first-instance court acknowledges a fact whose documentary evidence has disappeared, been lost and cannot be created again or cannot be obtained in any other way, provided that such a fact is material to the emergence, change or cessation of personal or property rights.
.  Article 77 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (“CAP”) provides for the tacit refusal by a State authority in case no decision has been taken within ninety days in respect of an application. Under Article  137 of the CAP, an interested party may appeal, inter alia, against the refusal to take an administrative decision to a court, after having exhausted the respective administrative remedy.
.  Under the State’s extra-contractual liability Act (law no. 8510 of 15 July 1999), a State entity is obliged to compensate the damage caused to a third party during the exercise of its public functions, provided that such damage and compensation was recognised by that entity.
In 2007 and 2008 the Supreme Court finally clarified the practice of the domestic courts in respect of the application of Article 388 of the Code of Civil Procedure. More specifically, in its decisions no. 746/2007 of 31 May 2007 and 98/2008 of 14 February 2008 in relation to a property dispute, the Supreme Court stated that “a court decision taken pursuant to Article 388 of the Code of Civil Procedure should not be construed as binding upon the administrative authorities, but as a guiding document to enable them to take a decision in compliance with the law and the documents they possess.” In decision no. 749/2007 of 31 May 2007 the Supreme Court added that “such a court decision shall be examined in combination with additional supporting documents by the Agency, which shall finally decide to accept or dismiss the applicant’s request [about the recognition of his property rights]”.
