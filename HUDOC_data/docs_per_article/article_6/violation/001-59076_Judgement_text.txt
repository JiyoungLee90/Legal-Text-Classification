The case originated in an application (no. 22671/93) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr G.L. (“the applicant”), on 3 May 1993.
The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Umberto Leanza, and by their Co-Agent, Mr Vitaliano Esposito.
The applicant alleged that the prolonged impossibility to recover possession of his flat, owing to the implementation of emergency legislative provisions on residential property leases, infringed his right under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Invoking Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, he further complained about the duration of the eviction proceedings.
The application was declared admissible by the Commission on 17 January 1997 and transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1999 in accordance with Article 5 § 3, second sentence, of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, the Commission not having completed its examination of the case by that date.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was the owner of an apartment in Milan, which he had let at a low rent pursuant to a 1969 law on rent control (equo canone). His tenant owns a shop and is shopkeeper together with his family.
On 18 November 1985, the applicant served a notice to quit on the tenant upon expiry of the lease on 28 December 1988, but the tenant refused to vacate the premises.
In a writ served on the tenant on 22 January 1988, the applicant reiterated the notice to quit and summoned the tenant to appear before the Milan magistrate. By a decision of 1 February 1988, which was made enforceable on 22 February 1988, the Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 1 September 1989.
On 25 August 1989, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises. On 6 November 1989, he served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 13 November 1989.
On 13 November 1989, the bailiff adjourned the eviction to 19 January 1990, pursuant to the instructions given by the Milan Prefect on 8 May 1989. Further attempts to evict the tenant on 20 February, 7 April and 15 November 1990, were unsuccessful.
On 15 September 1992, the applicant served on the tenant a second order to vacate the apartment. On 28 October 1992, he served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 20 November 1992. The attempts made by the bailiff on 20 November 1992 and 25 February 1993 were unsuccessful as, under the statutory provisions providing for the staggering of evictions, the applicant was not entitled to police assistance in enforcing the order for possession.
On 20 September 1993, the applicant made a statutory declaration that he urgently required the premises as accommodation for his son.
Between 14 October 1993 and 28 November 1996, the bailiff made 14 attempts to recover possession, on 14 October 1993, 18 January 1994, 12 April 1994, 28 June 1994, 18 October 1994, 31 January 1995, 13 April 1995, 18 July 1995, 26 September 1995, 19 December 1995, 14 March 1996, 28 May 1996, 26 September 1996 and 28 November 1996.
Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as the applicant was never granted the assistance of the police in enforcing the order for possession.
On 16 February 1997, the tenant spontaneously vacated the premises.
