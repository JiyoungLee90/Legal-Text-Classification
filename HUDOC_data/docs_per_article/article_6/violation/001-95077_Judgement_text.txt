The case originated in an application (no. 27865/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Mariya Sergeyevna Plemyanova (“the applicant”), on 16 May 2006.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 19 June 2008 the President of the First Section decided to grant priority treatment to the application and to give notice of it to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1928 and lives in .
In October 1996 the applicant's husband sued his neighbours, Mr P and Mr Pr alleging that they prevented him from using his land. In April 1997 he amended his claim raising a complaint against the  town administration claiming removal of structures built on his land and annulment of the administration's decision allowing such construction. In reply to the court's request, in his report dated 31 March 1997, the expert concluded that the border between P's and the applicant's land was not in line with the reference document issued in 1957. By a default judgment of 23 January 1998, the Pervomayskiy District Court of Krasnodar granted the applicant's husband's claims. Mr P sought annulment of the default judgment. On 10 April 1998 this judgment was annulled and the proceedings resumed.
On 5 May 1998 the Convention entered into force in respect of .
On 26 June 1998 the District Court granted the applicant's husband's claims and ordered the town administration “not to place any obstacles in the way of his building a garage”. The applicant's husband and the district prosecutor lodged appeals against this judgment. On 27 August 1998 the  quashed the judgment on appeal; the case was remitted to the District Court.
In the resumed proceedings, three hearings were adjourned because third parties, experts or witnesses defaulted. Two hearings were adjourned because the applicant's husband's lawyer studied the case file for ten days and because the applicant's husband drafted an amended statement of claim.
In April 1999 the case was re-assigned to another judge. In May 1999 the applicant's husband lodged a claim against a Ms N, his other neighbour. In June 1999 Mr P and Ms N lodged counter-claims against the applicant's husband. In July 1999 the court ordered an expert report. In the absence of the necessary documents and payment, the expert refused to submit a report.
In 3 February 2000 the case was re-assigned. At least five hearings were adjourned for various reasons (the judge was ill or busy; the other parties, their lawyers or other participants failed to attend). In September 2000 the applicant's husband and Mr P signed a friendly settlement agreement in respect of certain claims. On 30 November 2000 the Presidium of the  annulled it.
In January 2001 the applicant's husband withdrew some of his claims; Mr Pr waived his right to be present at hearings; Ms N withdrew her claims against the applicant. By a judgment of 1 February 2001, the District Court rejected the applicant's husband's claims. On 20 March 2001 the  upheld the judgment. On 2 August 2001 the Presidium of the  quashed the above judgments by supervisory review and ordered a re-examination of the case.
The applicant's husband died on 8 October 2001. On 17 October 2001 the court suspended the proceedings pending the succession proceedings (see paragraph 20 below). In early 2002 the applicant informed the court that she had applied for a succession certificate.
In March 2002 Mr Pr waived his right to be present at hearings and asked the court to render a judgment with reference to his depositions made over the previous years. On 9 April 2002 the court resumed the proceedings. A hearing was scheduled for 3 June 2002. On the latter date, the court suspended the proceedings because the applicant decided to bring a separate court action in order to have certain succession-related documents amended. The outcome of this court action remains unclear. On 23 December 2002 the notary public issued a succession certificate to the applicant in respect of the house. Thereby the applicant acquired rent title to the land under and around the house, which was at the heart of the civil dispute initiated by her late husband.
In March 2003 the main proceedings were resumed. In April 2003 the case was re-assigned. In 2003 there were several adjournments for various reasons: at least five hearings were scheduled but adjourned because one or two defendants (or their lawyers) were absent or ill or because the judge was busy in other proceedings.
On 26 January 2004 the court issued an order allowing the applicant to step into the proceedings as the plaintiff's heir. In 2004 and 2005 hearings were regularly scheduled but were adjourned for various reasons, mainly on account of the illness or unavailability of one or more parties.
In 2006 three hearings were scheduled and adjourned because the defendants failed to appear or because the judge was busy in other proceedings or ill.
Hearings were held on 12 and 21 February 2007. On the latter date, the court refused to start the deliberations because of the announcement of Mr Pr's death. Thus, the proceedings resumed. In March 2007 the applicant asked the District Court to discontinue the proceedings in respect of Mr Pr. On 18 April 2007 the court granted her request. Despite the applicant's objection, the court also considered that the rights of Mr Pr's heirs might be affected by the applicant's civil case, and thus suspended the proceedings pending determination of the succession issue. On 24 October 2007 the  refused to re-examine the above decision by way of supervisory review.
The main proceedings resumed in April 2008. The case was reassigned. According to the Government, the parties failed to attend a hearing on 2 June 2008. Mr Pr's heirs indicated that they would obtain a succession certificate only in early August 2008.
By a judgment of 12 August 2008, the District Court granted the applicant's claims in part. With reference to the 1997 expert report, the court concluded that the border between P's and the applicant's land was not in line with the reference document issued in 1957. The court also heard the parties' neighbours who made contradictory statements. On 7 October 2008 the  upheld the judgment, except for one claim against Mr P. Having noted that the case had already been pending for more than ten years, the appeal court itself re-examined that claim and rejected it.
Pursuant to the RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure in force before 1 February 2003, the court was required to suspend the proceedings if one party had died and the claims could be succeeded to (Article 214). The suspension had to be valid until a successor was identified (Article 216). Similar provisions are contained in Articles 215-217 of the 2002 Code of Civil Procedure.
