The case originated in an application (no. 34203/96) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Aldo Ferrarin (“the applicant”), on 26 November 1996.
The applicant was represented by Mr G. A. Conte, a lawyer practising in Milan. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, assisted by their Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained, in particular, under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of a set of criminal proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 6 April 2000 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant was born in 1944 and is currently residing in Montecchio Precalcino (Vicenza). In 1978, he was the sole manager of a limited company, Nuova R.A.C.E. srl.
On 26 June 1986 the Milan Public Prosecutor requested the investigating judge to summon the applicant to appear in order to answer the charge of criminal bankruptcy (bancarotta fraudolenta). However, following the entry into force of the new code of criminal procedure on 24 October 1989, the investigating judge sent the case back to the Milan Public Prosecutor.
On 5 March 1990 the Milan Public Prosecutor requested that the applicant be committed for trial. On 6 March 1990 the applicant’s name was entered into the register of pending proceedings, which is kept in the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
By an order of 30 May 1990, served on the applicant on 18 June 1990, the investigating judge committed the applicant for trial commencing on 19 September 1990 before the Milan District Court.
By a judgment of 22 November 1990, filed with the registry on 4 December 1990, the Milan District Court sentenced the applicant to three years’ imprisonment.
On 24 December 1990 the applicant lodged an appeal. He complained that he had been informed of the existence of criminal investigations against him only after 24 October 1989.
The hearing before the Milan District Court of Appeal was scheduled for 12 December 1995.
By a judgment of the same day, filed with the registry on 19 December 1995, the Milan Court of Appeal confirmed the first instance’s judgment. The court pointed out that there was no legal obligation to inform the applicant about the existence of criminal investigations against him before the request for committal for trial.
On 26 January 1996 the applicant appealed on points of law. By a judgment of 7 May 1996, filed with the registry on 9 May 1996, the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal.
