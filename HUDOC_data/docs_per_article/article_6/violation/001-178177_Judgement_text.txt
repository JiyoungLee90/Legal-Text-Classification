The case originated in an application (no. 17248/11) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, Mr B. Damjanović (“the first applicant”) and by a company registered in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Euromag d.o.o. (“the second applicant”) on 30 December 2010.
The applicants were represented by Mr Lj. Živadinović, a lawyer practising in Belgrade. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Ms. M. Mijić.
On 31 January 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Serbian Government were also notified of the application but did not exercise their right under Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 of the Rules of Court to intervene in the proceedings.
The first applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Belgrade, Serbia. The second applicant is a privately owned company, founded by the first applicant in 1990, with its registered seat in Ilijaš - Podlugovi, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On 19 December 2001 the second applicant requested a licence to build a petrol station on the main highway in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On 21 October 2002 the Federal Road Directorate of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Directorate”) rejected the request. The second applicant appealed on 31 October 2002.
On 28 February 2003 the Federal Ministry upheld that decision.
On 28 March 2003 the second applicant initiated proceedings for judicial review before the Supreme Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Supreme Court”).
On 25 August 2005 and 24 August 2006 the second applicant urged the Supreme Court to expedite the proceedings.
On 22 November 2006 the Supreme Court quashed the decisions of 21 October 2002 and 28 February 2003 (see paragraphs 7-8 above) on procedural grounds, and remitted the case to the Directorate.
On 9 May 2007 the second applicant informed the Supreme Court that the decision of 22 November 2006 had not been enforced yet.
On 16 August 2007 the Directorate rejected the second applicant’s request. On 30 August 2007 the second applicant appealed.
On 8 November 2007 the second applicant complained to the Administrative Inspectorate of the Federal Ministry of Justice about the inaction of the administration.
On 12 November 2007 the Federal Ministry upheld the decision of 16 August 2007 (see paragraph 13 above). The decision was served on the second applicant on 18 April 2008.
On 30 May 2008 the second applicant initiated proceedings for judicial review with the Supreme Court seeking it to quash the decisions of 16 August 2007 and 12 November 2007 (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above). On 31 August 2009 the Supreme Court referred the claim to the Mostar Cantonal Court, as the competent court.
On 27 November 2009 the Mostar Cantonal Court rejected the application for judicial review.
On 6 January 2010 the applicant submitted a request for an extraordinary review of the decision of 27 November 2009 with the Supreme Court, which request was rejected as unfounded on 12 May 2010. That decision was served on the second applicant on 9 July 2010.
On 6 September 2010 the second applicant lodged a constitutional appeal before the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Constitutional Court”) complaining, notably, about the length of the above administrative proceedings.
On 23 December 2013 the Constitutional Court rejected the appeal as unfounded. It noted that the relevant proceedings had lasted eight years and five months in total, that seven different decisions had been rendered by the competent authorities and that, therefore, the length of the proceedings had not been excessive.
