The case originated in four applications (nos. 26437/08, 14954/09, 53137/09 and 60300/10) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eight Turkish nationals, Mr Müslim Uğurlu, Ms Mercan Çalışkan, Mr Necdet Siyamoğlu, Mr Tuncay Siyamoğlu, Ms Aynur Baskak, Mr Cevdet Düzgünsıvacı, Mr Semih Düzgünsıvacı and Ms Gülser Özalp (“the applicants”), on 23 May 2008 (application no. 26437/08), 23 February 2009 (application no. 14954/09), 29 September 2009 (application no. 53137/09) and 27 September 2010 (application no. 60300/10) respectively.
Mr Uğurlu was represented before the Court by Mr E. Pekcan, a lawyer practising in Kocaeli. Ms Çalışkan was represented by Mr İ. Bazan, a lawyer practicing in Istanbul. Mr N. Siyamoğlu, Mr T. Siyamoğlu, Ms Baskak, Mr C. Düzgünsıvacı and Mr S. Düzgünsıvacı were represented by Ms N. Şentuna, a lawyer practicing in İzmir. Ms Özalp was represented by Ms J. Kapıdere, a lawyer practicing in İzmir.
The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 8 February 2016 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants are Turkish nationals, whose dates of birth and places of residence are shown in the appendix. They all own plots of land located in different cities of Turkey.
Following local land development plans, the applicants’ plots of land were designated for public use. Subsequently, complaining about the decrease in the market value of the land and the long-term uncertainty about the fate of their plots of land, the applicants initiated compensation proceedings before the civil courts.
During the proceedings relating to their land, the applicants submitted the decision given by the Plenary Chamber of the Court of Cassation (civil divisions, numbered E.2004/5-555 K.2005/17) to the domestic courts and asserted that according to this decision their compensation claims had to be accepted.
On various dates between 2007 and 2010, the applicants’ respective claims for compensation were dismissed by the domestic courts on the ground that their plots of land were not actually seized by the authorities. In their decisions, neither the courts of first instance nor Fifth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation, which examined the applicants’ claims on cassation, expressed any reason as to why they had reached a different conclusion from the plenary Court of Cassation.
The details of the proceedings may be found in the appended table.
A description of the domestic law and practice with respect to the Compensation Commission established by Law no. 6384 of 19 January 2013 (see paragraph 29 below) may be found in Paksoy and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no. 19474/10, 7 June 2016.
According to section 15 (1) of the Court of Cassation Act (Law no. 2797), the plenary Court of Cassation (civil divisions) has the authority to review civil courts’ rulings confirming their previous judgments, following rulings by the civil divisions of the Court of Cassation quashing those previous judgments.
Section 15 (2-b) of the same Act provides that if there are contradictory judgments delivered by the different civil divisions of the Court of Cassation, the plenary Court of Cassation (civil divisions) shall give a final ruling on the matter, thus unifying the case law.
Section 16 (5) of Law no. 2797 stipulates that if judgments given by one (or more than one) of the civil divisions of the Court of Cassation and the Plenary Chamber of the Court of Cassation (civil division) contradict each other, then the Grand Plenary Chamber of the Court of Cassation shall give a final ruling harmonising the conflicting judgments.
In its decision of 11 May 2004, numbered E.2004/5-555 K.2005/17, the Plenary Chamber of the Court of Cassation (civil divisions) examined the issue of zoning restrictions imposed on land that belonged to individuals. The case was about a plot of land which had been allocated for the construction of a school in the zoning plan. After its owner had brought a compensation case, firstly, Ankara 24th Civil Court of First Instance accepted the compensation claim of the owner as there was a seizure without expropriation. However, Fifth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation quashed Ankara 24th Civil Court of First Instance’s decision on the ground that the land at issue had not been controlled or used effectively by the public administrations. Subsequently, Ankara 24th Civil Court of First Instance insisted on its previous decisions and the case was brought before the Plenary Court of Cassation (civil divisions) in accordance with section 15 (1) of the Court of Cassation Act (Law no. 2797). The Plenary Chamber of the Court of Cassation (civil divisions) noted in its decision, dated 11 May 2004 and numbered E.2004/5-555 K.2005/17, that as it terminated alternative possibilities of using the land, the designation of land as a public use area in zoning plans amounted to seizure without expropriation and thus the decision of Ankara 24th Civil Court of First Instance was in conformity with the law in this respect.
