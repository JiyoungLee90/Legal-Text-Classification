The relevant provisions of the Courts Act (Zakon o sudovima, Official Gazette nos. 150/05, 16/07 and 113/08), governing the request for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, as the remedy for the length of judicial proceedings in Croatia, are set out in Praunsperger v. , no. 16553/08, § 21, 22 April 2010.
Section 64 of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 99/99, 29/02 and 49/02 – “the Constitutional Court Act”) provides that a constitutional complaint may be lodged within the time-limit of thirty days which begins on the day that the contested decision is received.
According to the Constitutional Court’s practice, that court is not competent to supervise the implementation of higher courts’ decisions ordering lower courts to decide a case within a certain time-limit (see, for example, Pavić v. , no. 21846/08, § 11, 28 January 2010).
