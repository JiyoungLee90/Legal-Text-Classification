The case originated in an application (no. 18912/15) against Montenegro lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Montenegrin national, Mr Milorad Vujović (“the first applicant”), and a limited liability construction company registered in Montenegro, Lipa D.O.O. (“the second applicant”) on 14 April 2015.
The applicants were represented by Mr B. Radović, a lawyer practising in Cetinje. The Montenegrin Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Valentina Pavličić.
The applicants complained, in particular, about lack of access to court in that the Court of Appeal refused to examine on the merits the second applicant’s appeal.
On 12 January 2017 the application was communicated to the Government.
The first applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Cetinje. The second applicant was founded in Cetinje in 1990. The first applicant is the founder, the sole owner, and the executive director of the second applicant. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 1 July 2013 an insolvency creditor X (stečajni povjerilac) requested the Commercial Court (Privredni sud) in Podgorica to open insolvency proceedings (stečajni postupak) in respect of the second applicant. In the proceedings before the Commercial Court the second applicant was represented by the first applicant and a lawyer duly authorised by the latter. On 27 December 2013 the Commercial Court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the second applicant and, inter alia, appointed an insolvency administrator (stečajni upravnik).
On 23 January 2014 the second applicant, through the lawyer, lodged an appeal against the Commercial Court decision.
On 18 March 2014 the Court of Appeals (Apelacioni sud) in Podgorica rejected the appeal (žalba se odbacuje) as having been submitted by an unauthorised person, given that the lawyer had not been appointed by the insolvency administrator. The court relied on sections 75 and 76 of the Insolvency Act (see paragraphs 17-18 below). This decision was served on the applicants on 17 April 2014.
On 12 May 2014 the applicants lodged a constitutional appeal.
On 13 May 2014 the applicants’ representative filed an initiative with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud) seeking the assessment of the constitutionality of section 76 of the Insolvency Act in force at the time. There is nothing in the case-file as to the outcome of that initiative.
On 23 July 2014 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicants’ constitutional appeal for “not having been lodged by a party to the domestic proceedings or by a person authorised to appeal on behalf of the person whose rights and freedoms were violated”. This decision was served on the applicants on 15 October 2014.
Article 20 provides that everyone is entitled to a legal remedy against a decision on their rights or a legally based interest.
Section 7 provides that the Civil Procedure Act will be applied by analogy to all the issues not regulated by this Act.
Section 32 provides, inter alia, that an insolvency administrator represents an insolvency debtor.
Section 33(5) and (6) provides, inter alia, that the insolvency administrator is bound (dužan) to initiate proceedings before court, file a claim, hire a lawyer, reach a settlement, withdraw a claim or waive a right to a claim in the proceedings before the court or an administrative body in Montenegro or abroad.
Section 40 provides, inter alia, that an insolvency administrator is entitled to remuneration and compensation of costs, which are determined by the insolvency judge at the conclusion of the insolvency proceedings (u vrijeme zaključenja stečajnog postupka).
Section 75 provides that the legal consequences of the opening of insolvency proceedings take effect as of the day when the notice of the opening of these proceedings was displayed on the notice board of the court.
Section 76 provided at the relevant time that by opening insolvency proceedings all the rights in respect of company representation and management (zastupnička i upravljačka prava) of the executive director, legal representative and counsel (zastupnika i punomoćnika) ceased and were transferred to the insolvency administrator. By amendments in August 2016 this section was amended so as to provide that by opening insolvency proceedings all the rights in respect of company representation and management of the executive director, legal representative and counsel cease and are transferred to the insolvency administrator except for the right to lodge an appeal against the decision on the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Section 3 provides that for a claim or any other procedural action (za tužbu i svaku drugu parničnu radnju) a party to the proceedings should have legal interest.
Section 371 provides that the court shall reject an appeal submitted by a person who was not authorised to lodge an appeal.
Between 19 June 2012 and 25 September 2014 the Court of Appeal ruled on the merits of a number of appeals lodged by insolvency debtors against decisions on opening insolvency proceedings (Pž.br. 505/2012, Pž.br. 663/2012, Pž.br. 682/12, Pž.br. 733/12, Pž.br. 310/2013, Pž.br. 344/13, Pž.br. 465/2013, Pž.br. 659/14).
On 7 May and 17 July 2015 the Court of Appeal rejected two appeals submitted by insolvency debtors (Pž.br. 371/15 and Pž.br. 545/15) on the grounds that the lawyers were not authorised by the insolvency administrators.
