The case originated in an application (no. 38695/13) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Ivan Kožul, Mr Dinko Kožul, Mr Dražen Kožul, Mr Petar Kožul and Ms Ruža Kožul, nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the applicants”), on 20 April 2013.
The applicants represented themselves. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their then Deputy Agent, Ms S. Malešić.
On 10 July 2017 the Government were given notice of the complaints concerning Articles 6, 8 and 13 of the Convention and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicants were born in 1960, 1967, 1962, 1938 and 1939, respectively, and live in the vicinity of Široki Brijeg.
On 4 February 2002 the local authorities ordered a private company, Paškić d.o.o. Široki Brijeg (hereinafter “Paškić”), to demolish its industrial buildings which had been erected illegally next to the applicants’ homes. That decision became enforceable on 18 April 2002.
On 13 October 2005 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicants’ right to a fair trial and ordered the local authorities concerned to enforce the decision of 4 February 2002 without further delay. It held that it was not necessary to examine the applicants’ complaints under Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
On 27 May 2006 the Constitutional Court found that its decision of 13 October 2005 had not been enforced.
The local authorities have so far issued over thirty calls for tenders in order to find a company able and willing to demolish the buildings in issue, but to no avail. Moreover, they have imposed more than thirty fines on Paškić, in amounts ranging between 50 and 300 convertible marks (BAM), because of its failure to comply with the demolition order.
On two occasions the competent public prosecutor carried out an investigation into the case (the non-enforcement of a decision of the Constitutional Court may constitute a criminal offence), but decided not to prosecute, first on 15 May 2007 and then again on 30 January 2017, because of lack evidence that the officials concerned had acted with criminal intent.
At the date of the latest information available to the Court (18 March 2019), the Constitutional Court’s decision remained unenforced.
