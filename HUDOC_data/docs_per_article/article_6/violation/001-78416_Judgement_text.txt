The case originated in an application (no. 43108/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Anna Arkhipovna Serikova (“the applicant”), on 2 March 2004.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Bychkovskiy from Miusinsk. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Y. Zaytsev, their Agent, and Mrs I. Shevchuk, Head of the Office of the Government Agent before the European Court of Human Rights.
On 8 November 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the non-enforcement of the judgments in the applicant's favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Vakhrushevo, the Lugansk region.
On 5 June 2000 and 5 June 2001 the Krasnyy Luch Court (Краснолуцький міський суд Луганської області) awarded the applicant UAH 1,278.79 and UAH 375.06 respectively in salary arrears and other payments against her employer, the Gob Piles Fire-fighting Department of the State Holding Company “Donbasantratsyt” (“the Department,” Управління з тушіння, профілактики териконів та рекультивації земель ДХК „Донбасантрацит”). These judgments became final and the enforcement writs were transferred to the Krasnyy Luch Bailiffs' Service (“the Bailiffs,” Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Краснолуцького міського управління юстиції) for enforcement.
In the meantime, according to the Government, the Department's assets were held in a tax lien since 12 August 1998, which blocked the possibility of their sale. Additionally, in accordance with the explanations of the Bailiffs of 11 February 2005, the enforcement was impeded by the reorganization of the State Holding Company “Donbasantratsyt” into the State Enterprise “Donbasantratsyt” (ГП “Донбасантрацит”) and the need to appoint the Department's successor for the purposes of the enforcement proceedings.
The applicant received the debt due to her by the judgment of 5 June 2000 on 14 October 2004 and on 14 October 2005 – the one due to her by the judgment of 5 June 2001.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-18, 27 July 2004).
