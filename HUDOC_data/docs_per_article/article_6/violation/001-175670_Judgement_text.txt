.  The case originated in two applications (nos. 69997/10 and 74793/11) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Panorama Ltd, a limited liability company with its registered seat in Brčko District (“the applicant company”, or “the first applicant”), and Mr Đuro Miličić, a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, (“the second applicant”), on 23 November 2010 and 18 November 2011, respectively.
.  The applicant company was initially represented by Mr N. Konjić, a lawyer practising in Tuzla. Since 1 March 2016 it has been represented by Mr E. Suljić, a lawyer practising in Sarajevo. The second applicant was represented by Ms S. Redžepović, a lawyer practising in Orašje. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Deputy Agent at the time, Ms Z. Ibrahimović.
.  The applicants complained, in particular, about the non-enforcement of final domestic judgments in their favour, relying on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
On 16 March 2015 the complaints concerning non-enforcement were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the applications were declared inadmissible, pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
On 22 December 1998 the first applicant lodged a compensation claim with the Sarajevo Municipal Court, seeking damages against the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Federation”) for goods seized during the 1992-95 war.
On 10 May 2007 the Sarajevo Municipal Court ordered the Federation to pay the first applicant 521,556.20 convertible marks (BAM – approximately 266,370 euros (EUR)) in respect of pecuniary damage, together with default interest at the statutory rate from April 1992, and legal costs, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Civil Obligations Act of 1978.
On 23 January 2009 the Sarajevo Cantonal Court allowed the Federation’s appeal in part and amended the judgment of 10 May 2007 in respect of the part concerning default interest. It ordered that the interest should be calculated from February 1996. The rest of the first-instance judgment was upheld and it became final on the same day.
On an unspecified date the Federation lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Supreme Court”) against the judgment of 23 January 2009. On 10 June 2010 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. It held, in particular, that the Sarajevo Cantonal Court had correctly applied the Civil Obligations Act of 1978 as regards default interest.
On 4 March 2009 the Sarajevo Municipal Court issued an enforcement order. The enforcement was to be carried out at the debtor’s expense.
On 28 May 2009 the Sarajevo Municipal Court dismissed the debtor’s objection and upheld the enforcement order of 4 March 2009.
On 16 March 2010 the debtor’s bank informed the enforcement court that the applicant had received BAM 24,244.78 in respect of legal costs.
On 9 December 2011 the applicant received BAM 521,556.20 in respect of the principal debt.
On 28 January 2013 the Sarajevo Municipal Court requested information from the bank about the status of the enforcement.
.  On 14 February 2013 the bank informed the Sarajevo Municipal Court that it did not consider that the enforcement order of 4 March 2009 had been fully implemented (because the interest due had not been paid).
.  On 17 August 2010 the first applicant lodged an appeal with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Constitutional Court”), complaining about the non-enforcement of the final judgment of 10 May 2007.
On 7 November and 13 December 2012 the first applicant informed the Constitutional Court that the principal debt had been paid on 9 December 2011 but that the default interest remained unsettled.
.  Invited to submit their comments on the first applicant’s appeal, the Federal Ministry of Finance argued that the War Damage Act of 2001 had declared that war damage constituted a part of public debt to which default interest did not apply. Thus, there was no legal basis for the payment of default interest to the first applicant.
On 12 June 2013 the Constitutional Court held that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention on account of the excessive length of the enforcement proceedings. It ordered the Municipal Court to conclude the enforcement proceedings without delay. However, the Constitutional Court did not examine the issue of the amount of default interest.
In so far as relevant to the case before the Court, its reasoning was as follows:
“39.  ... from the material in the case file it is evident that the impugned enforcement proceedings were not (i) completed or (ii) terminated by means of a final procedural decision rejecting the appellant’s request for the enforcement. Moreover, they were not suspended for any of the reasons prescribed by the Enforcement Procedure Act of 2003 ... Under the Enforcement Procedure Act of 2003, the enforcement court’s duty does not end once an enforcement order has been issued and delivered to the competent authority for enforcement.
Therefore, the failure of the Municipal Court to ... terminate the enforcement proceedings in one of the ways prescribed by [the Enforcement Procedure Act of 2003] ... without any justification based on the relevant law has led to an unlawful interference with the appellant’s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions under Article II/3.k) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention.”
.  Neither the judgment of 10 May 2007 (the amount due in respect of default interest) nor the Constitutional Court’s decision of 12 June 2013 has been fully enforced until the present day according to the last available information.
The second applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Orašje.
On 5 June 2001 the second applicant lodged a compensation claim with the Orašje Municipal Court, seeking damages against the Federation in respect for property owned by him that had been destroyed during the 1992-95 war.
.  On 28 May 2007 the Orašje Municipal Court ordered the Federation to pay the second applicant BAM 70,000 (approximately EUR 35,260) in respect of pecuniary damage, together with default interest at the statutory rate from April 2003 and legal costs, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Civil Obligations Act of 1978.
.  That judgment became final on 7 November 2007.
On 14 November 2007 the second applicant lodged a request for the enforcement of the judgment of 28 May 2007 with the Orašje Municipal Court.
.  On 14 December 2007 the Orašje Municipal Court issued an enforcement order. The enforcement was to be carried out at the debtor’s expense.
On 13 February 2008 the court dismissed the debtor’s objection and upheld the enforcement order of 14 December 2007.
On 26 October 2009 the second applicant was issued government bonds in lieu of cash in respect of the principal debt, in accordance with the Domestic Debt Act of 2004 (see paragraph 42 below).
In March 2010 the second applicant received BAM 2,477.25 in respect of legal costs.
On 10 December 2010 the bank informed the Orašje Municipal Court that it could not make any payments from the debtor’s account without the approval of the Federal Ministry of Finance.
.  On 4 November 2011 the Federal Ministry of Finance informed the second applicant that, in accordance with the amendments to the Domestic Debt Act of 2004 (see paragraph 42 below), he would receive payment in cash for the nominal value of those of his government bonds with which he had not traded on the stock exchange market, reduced by the amount paid in respect of the interest earned on bonds.
.  On 5 December 2011 the second applicant received BAM 66,499.98 in respect of the principal debt. The second applicant acknowledged that that payment had fully settled the principal debt.
.  On 17 May 2012 the Orašje Municipal Court partially suspended the enforcement proceedings in view of the payments made in 2010 and 2011.
On 12 June 2012 the Ministry of Finance informed the Orašje Municipal Court that the judgment of 28 May 2007 had been fully enforced as regards the principal debt and legal costs, and that there was no legal basis for the payment of default interest.
On 5 April 2013 the Orašje Municipal Court instructed the second applicant to bring a civil action for damages against the bank under the ordinary rules of tort law for failure to comply with the execution order of 14 December 2007 and to fully enforce the judgment of 28 May 2007.
.  On 2 April 2014 the Orašje Municipal Court amended the execution order of 14 December 2007 in respect of the means of enforcement in that it ordered that the enforcement be executed with funds in accounts held by the debtor in two different banks.
On 3 January 2009 the second applicant lodged an appeal with the Constitutional Court, complaining about the non-enforcement of the final judgment of 28 May 2007.
On 8 June 2011 the Constitutional Court held that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in the case of the second applicant and in three other cases on account of the excessive delay in the enforcement in respect of each case. It also held that the enforcement schedule under the Domestic Debt Act of 2004, which at the time stipulated that final judgments should be enforced by the payment of war damages in governments bonds in lieu of cash, had placed a disproportionate burden on the appellants. In its reasoning the Constitutional Court referred to its earlier decisions concerning the same matter. It ordered the Federation to enforce the final judgments in question without further delay.
.  On 16 January 2013 the Constitutional Court concluded that its decision of 8 June 2011 had been enforced.
.  The judgment of 28 May 2007 (the amount due in respect of default interest), however, has not been hitherto fully enforced.
In 2001 the Federation created a general compensation scheme for war damage under the War Damage Act of 2001 (Zakon o utvrđivanju i ostvarivanju potraživanja nastalih za vrijeme ratnog stanja i neposredne ratne opasnosti, Official Gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“OG FBH”) no. 43/01, and the Decree on Public Debt (Uredba o načinu utvrđivanja i realiziranja javnog duga Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine nastalog za vrijeme ratnog stanja i neposredne ratne opasnosti, OG FBH no. 17/02; compare Čolić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 1218/07 et al., 10 November 2009, and Đurić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 79867/12 et al., 20 January 2015, concerning war damage in Republika Srpska). The claims in respect of war damage were declared a part of the public debt of the Federation to which default interest did not apply (section 6 of the War Damage Act of 2001).
The enforcement of final judgments awarding war damages has been suspended since 16 October 1998, pursuant to the Postponement of Enforcement Act of 1998 (Zakon o privremenoj obustavi od izvršenja potraživanja nastalih za vrijeme ratnog stanja i neposredne ratne opasnosti, OG FBH no. 39/98) and the Temporary Postponement of Enforcement Act of 2004 (Zakon o privremenom odlaganju od izvršenja potraživanja na osnovu izvršnih odluka na teret budžeta Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine, OG FBH no. 9/04).
The Domestic Debt Act of 2004 (Zakon o utvrđivanju i načinu izmirenja unutrašnjih obaveza Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine, OG FBH nos. 66/04, 49/05, 35/06, 31/08, 32/09, 65/09, 42/11 and 35/14) introduced a settlement plan for the enforcement of final judgments ordering the payment of war damages (see also the Decision on the emission of bonds of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina for claims of physical and legal persons concerning  war damage, Odluka o emisiji obveznica Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine po osnovu ratnih potraživanja fizičkih i pravih lica, OG FBH no. 47/09). The Domestic Debt Act stipulated that a principal debt should be paid in government bonds and that legal costs should be settled in cash. The maturity of the bonds would be fourteen years. They were to be amortised in ten annual instalments, would earn interest at an annual rate of 2.5% and would be tradable on the stock exchange market. Default interest awarded by final judgments was written off (section 17(4) of the Domestic Debt Act of 2004).
Subsequently, following numerous decisions of the Constitutional Court finding that such a legislative solution was contrary to Article 6 § 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention – including the decision in the second applicant’s case (see paragraph 37 above) and decisions nos. AP 703/04 of 23 March 2005, AP 1084/06 of 11 March 2008 and AP 1307/08 of 9 July 2010 – the Domestic Debt Act of 2004 underwent several amendments. The most important one, which was introduced in November 2011, provided that final judgments should be enforced in cash. The provision concerning default interest remained unchanged.
Section 277 (1) of the Civil Obligations Act of 1978 (Zakon o obligacionim odnosima, Official Gazette of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia nos. 29/78, 39/85 and 57/8, and Official Gazette of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina nos. 2/92, 13/93 and 13/94) provides that in the event of a delay in the enforcement a debtor must pay default interest at the statutory rate, in addition to the principal debt.
In a decision of 14 September 2004, in another war damage case similar to the present one, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal on points of law submitted by the Federation. In so far as relevant to the case before the Court, its reasoning was as follows:
“...  The lower courts correctly applied the relevant law and provided detailed reasons for their decisions, which this court accepts.
Objections contained in the appeal that the War Damage Act of 2001 should have been applied are groundless ...
That Act prescribes the procedure for the implementation of war damage claims; that procedure therefore falls under procedural, rather than substantive law. Accordingly, provisions under which war damage was declared a part of the public debt of the Federation to which default interest did not apply do not affect the [civil] procedure in which war damage claims are being determined, but are applicable in the enforcement stage.
...  In view of the above, the debtor’s objection – that the second-instance court should have applied the War Damage Act of 2001 – is unsubstantiated.
As it is not a substantive law, it could not have been applied at this stage of the proceedings, irrespective of the fact that it came into legal force before the second-instance judgment was made ... ”
In a decision of 20 December 2005 concerning compensation for war damage in Republika Srpska (no. AP 774/04), the Constitutional Court considered that default interest awarded by final judgments constituted “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
In a later case, similar to the present ones, the Constitutional Court upheld the enforcement court’s conclusion that the debtor’s objections based on provisions concerning default interest were manifestly ill-founded (decision no. AP 3940/13 of 7 October 2014). In so far as relevant to the case before the Court, its reasoning was as follows:
 “28. The Constitutional Court notes that the debtor’s objection in the enforcement proceedings concerning the application of the War Damage Act of 2001 and the Domestic Debt Act of 2004 [on default interest], which the appellant sees as an obstacle to the full enforcement of the final judgment [in his favour], were already examined and dismissed as ill-founded by the Municipal Court. The banks were ordered to continue with the enforcement ...”
