The case originated in an application (no. 20568/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Bulgarian nationals, Mrs Rayna Vasileva Marinova and Mrs Maria Stefanova Radeva (“the applicants”), on 23 May 2002.
The applicants were represented by Mr N. Runevski, a lawyer practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mrs M. Dimova and Mrs S. Atanasova of the Ministry of Justice.
On 25 September 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the length of the civil proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
Mrs Kalaydjieva, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government subsequently appointed Mrs Pavlina Panova to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).
The applicants were born in 1925 and 1946 respectively and live in .
In 1959 Mr M., the husband of the first applicant and father of the second applicant, purchased from the Sofia municipality a four-room flat which had been nationalised in 1948.
On 22 February 1993 the heirs of the pre-nationalisation owner of the flat brought proceedings under section 7 of the 1992 Law on the Restitution of Ownership of Nationalised Real Property (the Restitution Law) seeking the annulment of the applicants’ title. Initially, however, their action was directed against the first applicant and Mr M. Finding that this did not represent a valid claim against the second applicant, and in view of the fact that no such claim had been brought within the time-limit indicated in the Restitution Law, in a final decision of 22 September 1997 the courts terminated the proceedings against the second applicant.
The Sofia District Court held its first hearing on 23 February 1994. The first applicant had been duly summoned on 29 November 1993 but did not attend.
The Sofia District Court held seventeen more hearings, eight of which, held between 15 February 1995 and 7 October 1996, were adjourned because the first applicant had not been found at her address to be summoned. For the first time a representative of the first applicant attended a hearing on 12 March 1997.
In a judgment of 11 November 1997 the Sofia District Court dismissed the plaintiffs’ action. On 19 January 1999 the Sofia City Court upheld the lower court’s judgment.
The plaintiffs appealed. In a judgment of 19 October 1999 the Supreme Court of Cassation reversed that decision and referred the case back to the Sofia City Court, holding that the latter had applied the law wrongly.
On 30 June 2000 the Sofia City Court gave a judgment finding against the first applicant and ordering her to surrender possession of the flat to the plaintiffs.
The first applicant appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation. In a final judgment of 27 November 2001 the latter court upheld the Sofia City Court’s judgment.
Until July 1999 Bulgarian law did not provide any remedies capable of accelerating civil proceedings.
A “complaint about delays” was created in July 1999, by virtue of the new Article 217a of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952, in force until 2007. In such a complaint a litigant aggrieved by the slow examination of the case could request the president of the higher court to issue mandatory instructions for faster processing of the case.
