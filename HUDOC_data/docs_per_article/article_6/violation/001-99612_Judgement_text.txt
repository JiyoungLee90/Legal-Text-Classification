The case originated in an application (no. 36942/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by European University Press GmbH (“the applicant”), on 29 September 2005.
The applicant was represented by Mr E. Morent, a lawyer practising in . The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Tichy, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
The applicant company complained that the non-communication of a request for a correction of a cost order violated the principle of equality of arms.
On 28 September 2007 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant is a limited liability company with its seat in .
In 2002 the applicant company published a book about K., Federal President of  at that time, and his family. The book included a passage suggesting that K. had forced his wife to undergo an abortion in the . It was distributed to bookshops on 9 April 2002.
On 22 April 2002 the  (Handelsgericht) issued a preliminary injunction (einstweilige Verfügung) against the applicant company prohibiting it from disseminating statements concerning the alleged abortion. The preliminary injunction became enforceable on 24 April 2002.
Since the applicant company allegedly did not comply, K. and his wife requested the enforcement of the injunction (Unterlassungsexekution). This request was granted by the Innere Stadt Vienna District Court (Bezirksgericht) on 2 May 2002.
On 3 May 2002 the District Court, upon request of the opposing party, imposed for the first time a fine of EUR 10,000 on the applicant company for failure to comply with the injunction.
On the basis of the enforcement order of 2 May 2002 the District Court subsequently, upon request of the opposing party, imposed fines between EUR 10,000 and EUR 75,000 on the applicant company 36 times, since the applicant company was found still not to have complied with injunction of 22 April 2002. All 37 decisions included costs orders, which amounted to EUR 741.76 in each case.
The applicant company appealed against the enforcement order of 2 May 2002 to the  (Landesgericht). It also opposed the 37 fines which had subsequently been imposed on it. On 12 June 2002 the  quashed the decision of 2 May 2002, by which enforcement of the injunction had been granted, because, on the basis of the preliminary injunction, the applicant company could not be ordered to dispose of the books which had already been disseminated before the entry into force of that injunction. Subsequently, on 26 July 2002, the  also quashed all 37 decisions imposing fines and cost orders on the applicant company.
On an unspecified date K. and his wife lodged extraordinary appeals against the decisions of the .
On 18 December 2002 the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) gave a lengthy judgment on the appeals against the 's decisions of 12 June 2002 and 26 July 2002. Whereas the Supreme Court agreed with the Regional Court that the injunction ordering the applicant company not to distribute the book in question could not relate to copies of the book which had already been distributed to book shops, it found it established that the applicant company had also offered the book for mail order on its internet site. In this respect the applicant company had not complied with the injunction and enforcement through imposition of fines was in those instances justified.
In the operative part of its judgment the Supreme Court accordingly granted the appeal in so far as it related to the imposition of fines in 11 cases, namely as regards decisions no. 4, 6, 8-11, 13, 14 and 18-20.
As regards decision no. 4 the Supreme Court reformulated it to cover only a breach of the injunction for offering the book on the internet site, reduced the fine to EUR 1,000 but upheld the cost order of EUR 741.76.
As regards the remaining 10 decisions the Supreme Court likewise held the applicant company responsible for a breach of the injunction, limited to offering the book on the internet site and reduced the fines to amounts between EUR 1,000 and EUR 2,000. The Supreme Court, however, was silent on the question of costs in respect of these 10 decisions.
On 26 January 2005 the estate of K. and K.'s former wife requested the correction of the Supreme Court's judgment of 18 December 2002 maintaining that the court had by mistake omitted to restore the remaining 10 cost orders. The request was not communicated to the applicant company.
On 16 February 2005 the Supreme Court corrected its judgment of 18 December 2002, by inserting in the operative part the following phrase:
“The cost orders, namely para 3 of the first instance decisions, are restored”
As a result, the applicant company had to pay an additional EUR 7.467,51 to the opposing parties.
The applicant company was informed of the opposing parties' request on 27 June 2005, when the decision of the Supreme Court concerning the correction of its judgment was served on it.
Article 419 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:
“(1)  The court giving judgment may at any time correct writing and calculation errors or other apparent errors in the judgment or in its written version or deviations of the written version from the issued decision and may add statements omitted contrary to the requirements of Article 417 § 3.
(2)  The court may decide on the correction without conducting a previous oral hearing. There is no separate remedy against the decision rejecting the request for a correction. A correction shall be added to the original version of the judgement and, if possible, shall be made visible in the required pertinent copies.
(3)  The correction may also be ordered at a higher instance.”
Article 521a § 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as applicable at the time of the events, read as follows:
“Where an appeal is lodged in time against a cost order, the notice of appeal or a copy of the record drawn up in its place shall be served on the opposing party by the first-instance court. The opposing party may lodge a counter-appeal with the firstinstance court within a fixed time-limit of four weeks from the date of notification of the appeal as regards points 1-3 and within a fixed timelimit of fourteen days from notification as regards point 4. Article 464 § 3 and the final sentence of Article 520 § 1 shall apply mutatis mutandis.”
