The Đilas were represented by Ms Radmila Plavšić and Mr Ranko Vulić, lawyers practising in . The Government of Bosnia and  (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Mijić.
This case is, like Čolić and Others v. , nos. 1218/07 et al., 10 November 2009, and Runić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 28735/06 et al., 15 November 2011, about the non-enforcement of final and enforceable domestic judgments awarding war damages to the applicants.
On 30 August 2010 (applications nos. 31864/06, 16570/07 and 47332/10) and on 4 July 2011 (applications nos. 17780/10, 17824/10, 31717/10 and 17291/11) the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicants live in .
By seven judgments of different courts of first instance of 18 May 2000, 29 February 2000, 17 December 1999, 24 March 2000, 5 April 2001, 25 April 2000 and 14 November 2001, which became final on 15 June 2000, 13 October 2000, 16 July 2002, 26 July 2001, 25 May 2001, 13 July 2001 and 9 September 2004, respectively, the Republika Srpska (an Entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina) was ordered to pay, within 15 days, the following amounts in convertible marks (BAM) in respect of war damage together with default interest at the statutory rate:
The Banja Luka Court of First Instance issued writs of execution (rješenje o izvršenju) on 20 December 2001, 8 November 2000, 23 April 2003, 16 November 2001, 24 August 2001, 2 November 2001 and 21 December 2006, respectively.
The applicants complained of non-enforcement to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the ”). On 20 December 2005 the Constitutional Court found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the cases of the Ćosić, Ms Sanja Alaša, Ms Borka Vođević, Mr Slavoljub Đorđević, the Paripovićs, the Voćkićs, the Simićs, Ms Slađana Migerl, the Lazićs and Ms Branka Lazić-Marković. The applicants did not claim compensation, but even if they had done so, their claim would have most likely been refused (see, for example, the Constitutional Court’s decisions AP 774/04 of 20 December 2005, § 438; AP 557/05 of 12 April 2006, § 195; AP 1211/06 of 13 December 2007, § 79; and AP 244/08 of 8 December 2010, § 37). On 15 April 2009 the Constitutional Court dismissed the case of the Đilas due to the change of circumstances following amendments to the Domestic Debt Act 2004.
After the extensive information campaign explaining the available options for the settlement of the Republika Srpska’s public debt (including its debt arising from domestic judgments), between 26 April 2007 and 13 May 2011 some of the applicants informed the authorities that they agreed to be paid only the legal costs in cash and the principal debt and default interest in bonds. Government bonds were then issued on the following dates to the following applicants:
Mr Slavoljub Đorđević and Ms Mara Đilas have already sold all of their bonds on the Stock Exchange.
Mr Dado Ćosić, Ms Sanja Alaša, Ms Borka Vođević, Ms Branka Lazić-Marković, Mr Zoran Đilas and Mr Željko Đilas were not issued government bonds.
The relevant domestic law and practice were outlined in Čolić and Others (cited above, §§ 10-12) and Runić and Others (cited above, § 11).
On 13 January 2012 the Domestic Debt Act 2012 entered into force, thereby repealing the Domestic Debt Act 2004. As regards the payment of war damage, it envisages the same solution as the old Act, with the change in the maturity of government bonds which is now 13 years instead of 14 years. The new Act is, however, irrelevant for the present case: as regards those applicants who were issued government bonds, the applicable provisions are those from the Domestic Debt Act 2004, which was in force at the time the bonds were issued; and the other applicants did not accept issuance of bonds in lieu of cash as means of enforcement, therefore, the new Act is also irrelevant.
