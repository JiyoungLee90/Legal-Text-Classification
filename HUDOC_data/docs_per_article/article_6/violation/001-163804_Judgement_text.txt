The case originated in three applications (nos. 46796/06, 13260/10 and 52082/10) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Russian nationals. The application numbers, dates the applications were lodged and communicated, applicants’ names, personal details and names of legal representatives, and information concerning the relevant domestic judgments are set out in the Appendix.
The applicants all alleged that they had been convicted of drug offences following entrapment by the police, in violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. They also complained under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention that they had not been able to examine witnesses who had given evidence against them.
On the dates indicated in the Appendix the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants were all targeted in undercover operations carried out by the police in the form of test purchases of drugs under sections 7 and 8 of the Operational-Search Activities Act of 12 August 1995 (no. 144-FZ). Those operations led to their criminal convictions for drug dealing.
The applicants disagreed with their convictions and argued that the police had incited them to commit drug-related offences. They also complained that they had not been able to examine the witnesses who had testified against them.
The relevant domestic law governing the use of undercover techniques at the material time is summed up in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Lagutin and Others v. Russia, nos. 6228/09, 19123/09, 19678/07, 52340/08 and 7451/09, 24 April 2014; Veselov and Others v. Russia, nos. 23200/10, 24009/07 and 556/10, 2 October 2012; Bannikova v.
