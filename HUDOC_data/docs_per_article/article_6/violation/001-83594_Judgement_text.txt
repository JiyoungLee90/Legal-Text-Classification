The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Y. Zaytsev, their Agent, and Mrs I. Shevchuk, Head of the Office of the Government Agent before the European Court of Human Rights.
The Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the delay in enforcement of the final judgments given in the applicants' favour against the State-owned mining companies to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
On various dates each of the applicants received one or more final judgments awarding payments from a State-owned mining company (see appendix for details) and instituted enforcement proceedings to collect the payment.
The judgments given in favour of the second and the third applicant were enforced on 24 December 2004 and 7 August 2006, respectively.
The judgments given in favour of the other applicants remain fully or partly unenforced on account of the debtor-companies' lack of funds.
Some of the applicants attempted to claim compensation against various State entities for the delay in the enforcement of the judgments given in their favour, however, these attempts have been to no avail.
After the institution of the Convention proceedings, the second and the seventh applicants died. Their widows, Mrs Lidiya Mikhaylovna Volokhova and Mrs Galina Aleksandrovna Vashchenko, informed the Court that they wished to pursue the applications of their late husbands.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Sokur v. Ukraine (no. 29439/02, § 17-22, 26 April 2005).
