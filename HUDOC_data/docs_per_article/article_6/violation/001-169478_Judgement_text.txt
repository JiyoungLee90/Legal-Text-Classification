The case originated in an application (no. 24446/09) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Boris Iurii (“the applicant”), on 23 April 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Chiriac, a lawyer practising in Chișinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Apostol.
On 23 June 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Chișinău.
On 2 October 2008 the Chișinău Court of Appeal delivered a judgment acknowledging the applicant’s entitlement to a disability pension. Owing to the lack of an appeal, the judgment became final on 22 October 2008.
On 1 December 2008 the Ministry of Defence lodged an appeal on points of law.
On 4 February 2009 the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the appeal on points of law, quashed the judgment of 2 October 2008 and remitted the case for a fresh examination on the merits. After several rounds of proceedings, on 2 March 2011 the Supreme Court of Justice finally acknowledged the applicant’s entitlement to a disability pension.
Meanwhile, after communication, the Prosecutor General, following a request from the Government Agent, lodged an application for revision with the Supreme Court of Justice, seeking the reopening of the proceedings and redress for the violation of the applicant’s rights. In those proceedings, the applicant claimed 29,069.17 Moldovan lei (MDL) in respect of pecuniary damage, MDL 25,000 in respect of nonpecuniary damage, MDL 29,784.60 for legal costs and MDL 4,000 for miscellaneous expenses. On 23 June 2011 the Supreme Court of Justice found a violation of the applicant’s rights as a result of the quashing of the final judgment in his favour. It set aside the judgment of 4 February 2009 and the subsequent judgments adopted in the reopened proceedings and decided to restore the final judgment of 2 October 2008 in the applicant’s favour. The court then awarded the applicant MDL 15,000 (equivalent to 890 euros (EUR)) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, MDL 15,000 for legal costs and MDL 1,000 for miscellaneous expenses. The court dismissed the applicant’s claims in respect of pecuniary damage, arguing that they could not be examined by direct application of Article 41 of the Convention.
