The case originated in five applications (nos. 11472/07, 68568/10, 70670/10, 71506/10 and 2804/12) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Romanian nationals. Their names and other details, as well as the date of lodging and the date of communication to the Government of each application are specified in the appended table.
The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Catrinel Brumar, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In accordance with Protocol No. 14, after informing the respondent Government, the applications were assigned to a Committee of three Judges.
On the dates set out in the appended table domestic courts delivered decisions according to which the applicants were entitled to various pecuniary amounts and/or to have certain actions taken by State authorities in their favour. However, the applicants were unable to obtain the enforcement of the decisions in due time.
