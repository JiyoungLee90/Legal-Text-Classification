The case originated in an application (no. 23240/04) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court on 18 June 2004 under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Bulgarian nationals, Mr Stefan Dimitrov Rangelov and Mr Rangel Vulchev Stefanov, who were born in 1974 and 1972 respectively and live in Plovdiv.
The applicants were represented before the Court by Ms S. Stefanova and Mr A. Atanasov, lawyers practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms S. Atanasova, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 27 May 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
On 8 and 10 November 1993 three criminal proceedings were opened against unknown perpetrators for three thefts from motor vehicles.
On 10 November 1993 the first applicant, Mr S. Rangelov, was questioned and confessed to having participated in the perpetration of the offences. On the next day, the 11th, the second applicant, Mr R. Stefanov, was also questioned and confessed. Two other individuals were also questioned.
On 15 November 1993 the investigating authorities proposed to transfer the three investigation files to the prosecution authorities as it had been established that the applicants, given their confessions, and their two accomplices had been the perpetrators.
There was no apparent development until 24 April 1996 when the investigating authorities proposed to the prosecution authorities to stay the first criminal proceedings. There was another period of inactivity until 23 April 1999 when the investigating authorities transformed the third criminal proceedings into a police investigation (дознание).
Subsequently between 7 May 2001 and 14 May 2002 the second criminal proceedings were stayed, then resumed and joined to the third criminal proceedings; the first proceedings were also resumed and joined to the third proceedings; and two expert reports were commissioned.
Between 22 October and 12 December 2002 the two applicants and their accomplices were charged with the three thefts. On 13 and 14 March 2003 the charges were amended.
On 10 May 2003 an indictment was filed against the applicants and their co-accused in respect of the three thefts.
At a hearing held on 19 December 2003 the Plovdiv District Court approved a plea bargain agreement and discontinued the proceedings. The applicants were each sentenced to one year's imprisonment, suspended.
