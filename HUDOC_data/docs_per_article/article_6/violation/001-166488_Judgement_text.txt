The case originated in an application (no. 72152/13) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Croatian nationals, Mr Alojz Cindrić and Ms Katarina Bešlić (“the applicants”), on 5 November 2013.
The applicants were represented by Ms L. Kušan, a lawyer practising in Ivanić Grad and Ms Nataša Owens, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.
The applicants alleged, in particular, that the procedural obligations under Articles 2 and 14 of the Convention had not been complied with; that, contrary to Article 13 of the Convention, they had no effective remedy in that respect; that they had been deprived of their right of access to a court contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention; and that their right to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions protected under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention had also been violated.
On 16 December 2013 the Government were given notice of the application.
The President of the Chamber acceded to a request by the Government to grant confidentiality to the case (Rule 33 § 1 of the Rules of Court).
The applicants were born in 1973 and 1975 respectively and live in P.
The applicants lived with their parents in A, Croatia. In August 1991 the first applicant joined the Croatian Army and left his home, and in November 1991 the second applicant went to live in Germany.
In the second half of November 1991 the Yugoslav People’s Army, together with Serbian paramilitary forces, gained control of A, which thus became a part of the “Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina” (hereinafter “the Krajina”).
On 6 January 1992 two unknown men took the applicants’ parents, S.C. and P.C., from their home in A. On 7 January 1992 the bodies of the applicants’ parents were driven by municipal employees in a truck to the front of their house. The applicants’ uncle was called and he gave the municipal employees clothes for the burial of the applicants’ parents.
On 7 January 1992 the A police carried out a search of a flat occupied by X in A and found an automatic gun, a hand gun and some bullets.
On 7 January 1992 the A police interviewed police officers R.B., M.S., D.J., V.K., M.T., D.K. and M.M. The police officers, apart from R.B., had been on duty at a checkpoint in R. Street in A between 7 p.m. on 6 January 1992 and 7 a.m. on 7 January 1992.
R.B. said that on 6 January 1992 at about 7 p.m. police officer X had asked him, R.B., as his hierarchical superior, for permission to take a short leave of absence. He, R.B., had granted the request. R.B. did not know when X had returned to duty at the police station, but thought that he had seen him between 11 p.m. and midnight that same evening.
M.S. said that at about 8 p.m. on 6 January 1992 a vehicle had approached the checkpoint and D.J. had stopped it. At that time he, M.S., had been in the barracks. D.J. and D.K. had entered and asked him if he knew a police officer with a birthmark on his face or a Volkswagen vehicle with the number 44 as the last digits on its registration plates, which he did not. At about 10 p.m. the same day, however, he stopped a Volkswagen vehicle which had 44 as the last two digits on its registration plates. The vehicle was driven by police officer X, who was known personally to M.S., D.J. and D.K. confirmed that it was the same vehicle which had passed from the opposite direction at about 8 p.m.
D.J. said that at about 8.10 p.m. on 6 January 1992 a vehicle of Volkswagen make had approached the checkpoint and that he had stopped it. The driver had been dressed in the uniform of the civil police. D.J.’s attention had been diverted by a vehicle which had come from the opposite direction and he had stopped it. At that moment the Volkswagen had suddenly started up and left in the direction of K. D.K. told him that he had not had the time to fully examine the vehicle but that he had seen that the driver and the person in the front passenger seat were dressed in the uniforms of the civil police. He had also seen two civilians in the back seat, a man and a woman. D.K. noted down the registration number of that vehicle. At about 11 p.m. the same day police officer M.S. stopped a vehicle which had arrived from the direction of K and asked the other police officers on duty whether it was the same vehicle they had stopped at about 8 p.m., which D.J. confirmed. The only occupants were the driver and the person in the front passenger seat. D.J. asked them who the other passengers had been and where they had taken them. The driver said that the passengers had been S.C. and P.C. and that they had left them in a village.
M.T. and D.K. confirmed the above events.
On 8 January 1992 the A police interviewed X and Y, two police officers. They both admitted that on 6 January 1992 they had taken S.C. and P.C. in X’s vehicle. On the outskirts of A the police had stopped them. However, the attention of the police had been diverted by another vehicle and X and Y had quickly driven away. They had taken S.C. and P.C. to the village of J. X said that there they had taken S.C. and P.C. out of the vehicle and started walking. He had been carrying an automatic gun and at one point S.C. had attempted to take it from him, resulting in a commotion in which the weapon had fired and killed S.C. After that Y had shot and killed P.C. Y said that X had killed S.C. when they had arrived in J and then forced him, Y, to kill P.C.
On 9 January 1992 the A police lodged a criminal complaint with the B public prosecutor against X and Y, alleging that on 6 January 1992 at 10.30 p.m. in J, a village near the town of A, they had killed S.C. and P.C. They had first driven the victims in X’s vehicle to J and taken them out of the vehicle. X had then killed S.C. with an automatic gun and Y had killed P.C. with a hand gun.
On 28 January 1992 the B County Court opened an investigation in respect of X and Y on suspicion of killing S.C. and P.C.
On 13 April 1992 an investigating judge of the B County Court commissioned a ballistics report.
In August 1995 the Croatian authorities regained control of the town of A. In 1996 the United Nations Security Council established the United Nations Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (“UNTAES”). On 15 January 1998 the UNTAES mandate came to an end and the transfer of power to the Croatian authorities began.
On 16 April 1996 the A police interviewed M.C., the brother of the late S.C., who told them that his brother and his brother’s wife had been killed on 6 January 1992. Their bodies had been given to him by the police of the “Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina” and he had been allowed to bury them.
On 19 September 2000 the C police interviewed M.M., who said that on 6 January 1992 he had been on duty, together with M.B., at the entrance to village J. At about 9 p.m. he and M.M. had been walking towards a ramp by the barracks where all patrols had their meeting point and had heard a vehicle being driven, followed by several gun shots and then a vehicle starting up again. When they arrived at the meeting point they found Lj.Č., D.J. and M.P. there, who told them that “two fools [had] just brought two people in a car and killed them by the road.” None of the officers on patrol dared go to the crime scene. Soon they all went home. In the morning of 7 January 1992 the police from A came to M.M.’s house and took him to A police station, where they interviewed him and told him that X and his friend had killed S.C. and his wife. He had heard that X had moved to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On 21 September 2000 the C police interviewed the applicants, who had learned from B.Ž., who lived with their parents during the relevant period, that X and Y had been charged with the killing of the applicants’ parents.
On 4 January 2001 an investigating judge of the C County Court (Županijski sud u C) ordered an investigation concerning X and Y, who were not available to the Croatian authorities, on suspicion of killing S.C. and P.C. An international arrest warrant was also issued against the suspects, who had absconded.
On 8 February 2002 the Ministry of the Interior asked the Ministry of Justice whether extradition proceedings would be instituted against the suspects.
On 14 January 2005 Interpol in Washington informed the Croatian authorities that the Department of Homeland Security in Cleveland, Ohio, had a valid location for Y. On 19 January 2005 the Ministry of the Interior informed the Ministry of Justice, asking the latter to institute proceedings for Y’s extradition. On 20 January 2004 the Ministry of Justice asked the C County Court for the relevant documents with a view to seeking Y’s extradition from the United States authorities. All the evidence from the case file was translated into English and on 11 January 2006 the Ministry of Justice sent a “request for [Y’s] temporary arrest” to the US Department of Justice through diplomatic channels.
On 10 January 2007 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Ministry of Justice that the US Department of Justice had requested some additional documents. On 10 May 2007 the C County Court sent the requested information and documents to the Ministry of Justice.
It appears that on 12 and 13 February 2008 the Croatian and US authorities held consultations in Zagreb in connection with the extradition of Y.
On 8 April 2008 the C County State Attorney’s Office again asked the Ministry of Justice to seek Y’s extradition. On 17 June 2008 the Ministry of Justice sent additional documents to the US Department of Justice in connection with Y’s extradition.
In April 2009 the US Department of Homeland Security asked the Croatian Ministry of Justice for legal assistance in connection with the criminal investigation pending against Y in the United States on charges of attempted procurement of United States citizenship by fraud, and fraud and misuse of visas, permits and other official documents. They asked for all documents related to any criminal offences Y might have committed. This request was forwarded to the State Attorney’s Office on 7 January 2013.
On 26 March 2014 the State Attorney’s Office forwarded the requested documents, translated into English, to the US Department of Homeland Security.
In 2002 the Ministry of Justice agreed that an international arrest warrant should be issued in respect of X.
On 2 January 2008 an investigating judge of the C County Court asked the competent court in Serbia to hear evidence from X in connection with the killing of S.C. and P.C. On 28 July 2008 the Serbian authorities asked for a certified translation of that request and all relevant documents into the Serbian language.
On 13 August 2008 the Croatian Ministry of Justice sent a note to the Serbian Ministry of Justice to the effect that, according to an agreement between the two States, each State party had the right to communicate in its own language and to submit documents in that language without the need for translations.
On 18 February 2009 the Serbian authorities heard evidence from X. He said that the criminal proceedings against him and Y for the murder of S.C. and P.C. had been instituted in 1992 in the B Municipal Court and that they had been acquitted. He also denied any involvement in the killing of S.C. and P.C. On 3 March 2009 his statement was forwarded to the Croatian authorities.
On 16 March 2006 the applicants brought a civil action against the State in the C Municipal Court (Općinski sud u C), seeking non-pecuniary damages in the amount of 500,000 Croatian kuna (HRK) each (about 65,500 euros (EUR)), in connection with the killing of their parents. They relied on sections 1 and 2 of the 2003 Liability Act.
On 9 March 2007 the C Municipal Court granted the applicants’ claim and awarded them each HRK 300,000 (about EUR 40,000), finding that the killing of the applicants’ parents had been an act of terror. This judgment was reversed by the C County Court on 3 December 2009. The applicants were also ordered to pay the State HRK 52,500 (about EUR 6,800) in costs, comprising the fees chargeable for the State’s representation by the State Attorney’s Office. The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows:
“The plaintiffs in the first-instance proceedings based their claim for damages on the provisions of the 2003 Liability Act .... It is necessary to point to the content of section 3 of that Act, which provides that the obligation to compensate for damage exists irrespective of whether the person responsible has been identified, criminally prosecuted or found guilty. However, having regard to the correct establishment of the facts by the first-instance court, which found that the events at issue had occurred on 7 January 1992 in the village of J, in the then occupied territory of the Republic of Croatia which at that time was under the control of illegal formations of the “Serbian Republic of Krajina” and outside the control of the Republic of Croatia and its lawful bodies, the appellant’s submission that [the killing of the plaintiffs’ parents] ... amounted to war-related damage is well-founded.
Section 2 of the Act on the Assessment of War-related Damage ... provides that war-related damage is damage caused by enemy or illegal groups, or legal bodies of the Republic of Croatia, as well as accomplices of these groups and bodies, where that damage occurred directly or indirectly at the time specified in section 1 of that Act (from 15 August 1990 until the end of hostilities and war operations conducted against the Republic of Croatia). Therefore, given the nature, place and time of the events at issue (the killing of innocent civilians in the occupied territory of the Republic of Croatia during the Homeland war), it is to be concluded that the events at issue are to be legally classified as war-related damage and that the appellant is not responsible for them or for the damage thus caused.
...”
This judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court on 19 June 2012. The court endorsed the County Court’s finding that the killing of the applicants’ parents amounted to war-related damage and added, in so far as relevant, the following:
On 1 February 2013 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint. They argued, inter alia, that in a number of its previous judgments the Supreme Court had recognised the plaintiffs’ right to compensation for damage caused by death during the Homeland War in Croatia, and cited seven judgments of that court adopted between 2006 and 2010 (see paragraph 52 below). The constitutional complaint was dismissed on 9 May 2013.
Article 21 of the Constitution (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 56/1990, 135/1997, 8/1998, 113/2000, 124/2000 and 28/2001) reads as follows:
“Every human being has the right to life.
...”
The report on the work of the State Attorney’s Office for the year 2012, submitted to Parliament in September 2013, stated that in the period between 1991 and 31 December 2012 there had been 13,749 reported victims of the war in Croatia, of whom 5,979 had been killed. By the time of the report the Croatian authorities had opened investigations in respect of 3,436 alleged perpetrators. There had been 557 convictions for war-related crimes.
.  On 13 October 2006 the War Crimes Prosecutor of the Republic of Serbia and the State Attorney of the Republic of Croatia concluded the above agreement (Sporazum o suradnji u progonu počinitelja kaznenih djela ratnih zločina, zločina protiv čovječnosti i genocida). It covers cooperation as regards evidence, information and documents.
The relevant part of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, Official Gazette of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia nos. 4/1977, 36/1977 (corrigendum), 36/1980, 69/1982, 58/1984, 74/1987, 57/1989, 20/1990, 27/1990 and 35/1991, and Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia nos. 53/91, 91/92, 58/93, 112/99, 88/01, 117/03, 88/05, 02/07, 84/08, 123/08, 57/11 and 148/11) reads as follows:
“(1)  The costs of proceedings shall comprise disbursements made during, or in relation to, the proceedings.
(2)  The costs of proceedings shall also include a fee for the services of an advocate and other persons entitled to a fee by law.”
“(1) A party which loses a case completely shall reimburse the costs of the opposing party and his or her representative.
(2) If a party succeeds in the proceedings in part, the court may, having regard to the degree to which it was successful, order that each party shall bear its own costs or that one party shall reimburse the corresponding portion of the costs of the other party and his or her representative.
(3) The court may decide that one party shall reimburse in full the costs incurred by the opposing party and his or her representative, where the opposing party was unsuccessful in respect of only a relatively insignificant portion of his or her claim, and where no special costs were generated on account of that portion.
...”
“(1) In deciding which costs shall be reimbursed to a party, the court shall take into account only those costs which were necessary for the conduct of the proceedings. When deciding which costs were necessary and the amount thereof, the court shall carefully consider all the circumstances.
(2) If there is a prescribed scale of advocates’ fees or other costs, the costs shall be awarded in accordance with that scale.”
“Regardless of the outcome of the case, a party shall reimburse the costs of the opposing party which he or she caused to be incurred through his or her own fault or as the result of an event that befell him or her [that is, by accident].”
“Where the State Attorney participates in the proceedings as a party, he or she shall be entitled to the reimbursement of costs under the provisions of this Act, but not to payment of a fee.”
“The provisions on costs [of proceedings] shall also be applicable to parties which are represented by the State Attorney’s Office. In that case the costs of the proceedings shall also include the amount that would be awarded to the party as advocates’ fees.”
.  According to the Scales of Advocates’ Fees and Reimbursement of their Costs (Tarifa o nagradama i naknadi troškova za rad odvjetnika, Official Gazette nos. 91/2004, 37/2005 and 59/2007), an advocate’s fees in a civil case are, as a matter of principle, calculated in proportion to the value of the subject matter of the dispute (the amount in issue) for each procedural action. The value of the subject matter of the dispute normally corresponds to the sum the plaintiff is seeking to obtain through his or her civil action.
.  The Rules on Legal Aid Fees (Pravilik o visini nagrade odvjetniku određenom za branitelja po službenoj dužnosti, Official Gazette no. 101/2012) were adopted by the Ministry of Justice and concern advocates’ fees reimbursed by the State. Rule 1 provides that advocates defending accused in criminal proceedings under the legal aid scheme are entitled only to 30% of their usual fee.
.  The relevant provision of the Obligations Act (Zakon o obveznim odnosima, Official Gazette of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia nos. 29/1978, 39/1985 and 57/1989, and Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia nos. 53/1991, 73/1991, 3/1994 – “the Obligations Act”), as in force before the 1996 Amendment, read as follows:
“Liability for loss caused by death or bodily injury or by damage or destruction of another’s property, resulting from acts of violence or terrorist acts ..., shall lie with the ... authority whose officers were under a duty, according to the laws in force, to prevent such loss.”
.  The relevant part of the 1996 Amendment to the Obligations Act (Zakon o izmjeni Zakona o obveznim odnosima, Official Gazette no. 7/1996 of 26 January 1996 – “the 1996 Amendment”), which entered into force on 3 February 1996, provided as follows:
“Section 180 of the Obligations Act (Official Gazette nos. 53/91, 73/91 and 3/94) is hereby repealed.”
“(1)  Any proceedings for damages instituted under section 180 of the Obligations Act shall be stayed.
(2)  The proceedings referred to in paragraph 1 of this section shall be resumed after the enactment of special legislation which will regulate liability for damage resulting from terrorist acts.”
The relevant parts of the Act on Liability for Damage Resulting from Terrorist Acts and Public Demonstrations (Zakon o odgovornosti za štetu nastalu uslijed terorističkih akata i javnih demonstracija, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia no. 117/2003 of 23 July 2003 – “the 2003 Liability Act”), which entered into force on 31 July 2003, provide as follows:
“(1)  This Act regulates liability for damage caused by acts of terrorism or other acts of violence committed with the aim of seriously disturbing public order by provoking fear or stirring up feelings of insecurity in citizens ...
(2)  A terrorist act within the meaning of this Act is in particular an act of violence committed for political reasons with a view to stirring up fear, terror or feelings of personal insecurity in citizens.”
“The Republic of Croatia shall be liable for the damage referred to in section 1 of this Act on [the basis of] the principles of social solidarity, equal distribution of public burdens and fair and prompt compensation.”
“The obligation to compensate damage under this Act exists irrespective of whether the perpetrator has been identified, criminally prosecuted or found guilty.”
“The victim shall have the right to compensation [in the form of damages] for damage resulting from death, bodily injury or impairment of health.”
“Judicial proceedings for damages stayed pursuant to the 1996 Amendment shall be resumed in accordance with the provisions of this Act.”
.  In its judgments nos. Rev-348/05-2 of 31 January 2006, Rev-356/07-2 of 18 April 2007, Rev-1133/04-2 of 3 July 2007, Rev-130/08-2 of 10 December 2008, and Rev-104/08-2 of 7 January 2009 the Supreme Court found the State liable for damage caused by terrorist acts committed during the war in Croatia. The relevant parts of these judgments read as follows.
Judgment no. Rev-348/05-2 of 31 January 2006:
“It has been established that on ... in G.G. the claimants’ parents were killed ... That day between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. unknown persons fired weapons and threw explosive devices at a large number of houses, with the result that serious material damage was caused and the claimants’ parents were killed in the ruins of their house.
...
In the view of this court the events described above (the firing of weapons at houses and the throwing of explosive devices into a number of houses in the village by unknown persons) amount to a terrorist act within the meaning of the statutory provisions. The Republic of Croatia is liable for damage caused by terrorist acts on the basis of the principles of social solidarity, equal distribution of public burdens and fair and prompt compensation (section 2 of the [Liability] Act), and that liability exists irrespective of whether the perpetrator has been identified, criminally prosecuted or found guilty (section 3 of the [Liability] Act).”
Judgment no. Rev-356/07-2 of 18 April 2007:
“It is undisputed that ... J.B. and M.F. were found guilty of ... throwing an anti-tank mine into the house of the claimant’s parents. The mine exploded and caused serious bodily injuries to the claimant’s mother, from which she died, and serious bodily injuries to the claimant’s father, who survived.
...
In the case at issue the liability of the State is objective – irrespective of [anyone’s] guilt. However, the State is not liable for failure to prevent the damage but on the basis of the principles of solidarity, fairness and equal distribution of public burdens (section 2 of the [Liability] Act).”
Judgment no. Rev-130/08-2 of 10 December 2008:
“Given that war-related damage and damage caused by a terrorist act both result from violence, it being one of the essential elements (so that there is a basic similarity in the nature of the act which is reduced to violence), [the question] whether a specific instance of damage is war-related damage or damage caused by a terrorist act [is to be answered] by assessing the act of violence in the broader context of the circumstances and the events during which such an act was committed; [the answer] will depend in particular on the means used, the motives, the damage caused, and the time and place of the events.
...
The courts have established the following facts:
- that the late D.J. ... was living alone in the family’s summer house in V. ... that ... a bomb thrown through a window of the house by an unknown person killed D.J., and that at that time there had been no war-related activity in the area of V. ...
Given the above facts and the manner in which the deceased was killed, the lower courts correctly established that [the killing of D.J.] amounted to a terrorist act aimed at provoking fear and feelings of insecurity in citizens ...”
Judgment no. Rev-104/08-2 of 7 January 2009:
“The lower courts established that the late M.V. was injured while working in her garden by an explosive device that had been planted ...
Given the circumstances of the damage, the conclusion of the lower courts that the damage was caused by a terrorist act is correct.”
.  The War Crimes Act 2003 (Zakon o nadležnosti državnih organa u posutpku za ratne zločine, published in Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia no. 67/2003, amendments published in Official Gazette nos. 135/04, 61/2005, 101/2007 and 104/2009) entered into force on 9 July 2003. The War Crimes Prosecutor, the War Crimes Police Unit and the War Crimes Sections within the Belgrade Higher Court and the Belgrade Court of Appeal were set up pursuant to this Act. They have jurisdiction over serious violations of international humanitarian law committed anywhere in the former Yugoslavia, regardless of the nationality of the victims or perpetrators.
.  The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 2009 (published in Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia no. 20/2009) entered into force on 27 March 2009. Under section 16 of this Act, Serbian citizens cannot be extradited. The Act repealed the corresponding provision of the 2001 Code of Criminal Procedure (published in Official Gazette of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia no. 70/2001, amendments published in Official Gazette of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia no. 68/2002 and Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia nos. 58/2004, 85/2005, 115/2005, 49/2007, 20/2009 and 72/2009), which was in force between 28 March 2002 and 27 March 2009.
The applicants further complained that their right of access to a court had been violated. They relied on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the relevant part of which reads as follows:
“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...”.
The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.
The applicants reiterated their arguments summarised in paragraphs 82-88 above.
The Government maintained that the applicants had had access to a court in connection with their civil claim for damages, which had been examined at three levels of jurisdiction. The fact that the applicants’ claim had been dismissed could not be seen as depriving them of the right of access to a court. It had been the established practice of the Supreme Court to dismiss claims for damages against the State in connection with the killing of civilians in the occupied territories, since this was regarded as war-related damage for which the State was not liable. In that connection the Supreme Court had adopted several judgments concerning the killings in the area around the town of A. These judgments had been adopted between 2007 and 2010.
Article 6 § 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way, that provision embodies the “right to a court”, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, is one aspect (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 January 1975, §§ 34 in fine and 35-36, Series A no. 18; and Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, §§ 9193, ECHR 2001-V).
.  The right of access to the courts is not absolute but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access “by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, regulation which may vary in time and in place according to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals”. In laying down such regulation, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. Whilst the final decision as to observance of the Convention’s requirements rests with the Court, it is no part of the Court’s function to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities any other assessment of what might be the best policy in this field. Nonetheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, § 230, ECHR 2012).
.  The Court has already held that the imposition of a considerable financial burden after the conclusion of proceedings, such as an order to pay fees for the representation of the State according to the “loser pays” rule could well act as a restriction on the right to a court (see Klauz, cited above, § 77; and, mutatis mutandis, Stankov , cited above, § 54).
The Court considers that it is not its task to rule on the “loser pays” rule as such, but to determine whether, in the circumstances of this case, the applicants’ right of access to a court within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was respected (see, mutatis mutandis, Malige v. France, 23 September 1998, § 30, Reports 1998VII).  The Court accepts that imposition on the applicants to pay the costs of the State representation may be viewed as a restriction hindering the right of access to court (see Klauz, cited above, § 81).
As the Court has underlined on a number of occasions, a restriction affecting the right to court will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 unless it pursues a legitimate aim and there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the legitimate aim sought to be achieved (see paragraph117 above and in particular with respect to the “loser pays” rule, Klauz, cited above, § 83). The Court must therefore examine whether this was achieved in the present case.
The Court accepts that the “loser pays” rule pursues a legitimate aim of ensuring the proper administration of justice and protecting the rights of others by discouraging ill-founded litigation and excessive costs (see Klauz, cited above, § 84; see also paragraph 93 above).
As to the question whether the limitation was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, the Court refers to its finding under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraphs 97-107 above). On the same grounds on which it found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraph 108 above) the Court emphasizes once again that ordering the applicants to bear the full costs of the State’s representation in the proceedings at issue amounts to a disproportionate restriction of the applicants’ right of access to court.
There has therefore been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention as regards the applicants’ right of access to a court.
Article 41 of the Convention provides:
“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”
The applicants each claimed: 30,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage as regards the procedural aspect of Article 2 of the Convention; EUR 10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage as regards the procedural aspect of Article 14 of the Convention; EUR 10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage as regards Article 13 of the Convention; EUR 10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage as regards Article 6 § 1 of the Convention; EUR 10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage as regards Article 1 of Protocol No. 1; and HRK 26,250 (about 3,500 euros) in respect of pecuniary damage as regards Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
The Government deemed the sums claimed excessive and unfounded.
The Court, having regard to its case-law (see Stankov, cited above, § 71; and Perdigão, cited above, §§ 85-86), considers it reasonable to award the applicants jointly EUR 5,000 on account of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 3,400 on account of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.
The applicants also claimed EUR 5,090 for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court. They submitted a copy of a legal fees agreement between them and their lawyer.
The Government objected to the amount claimed.
According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these were actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 3,000 for the proceedings before the Court.
The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.
