In a judgment delivered on 17 July 2008, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the length of the civil proceedings. The Court also decided to award the applicant 14,400 euros (EUR) for non-pecuniary damage and dismissed the remainder of the claims for just satisfaction.
On 17 October 2008 the Government informed the Court that they had never received for comments any pleadings filed by the applicant concerning his claims for just satisfaction. They accordingly requested revision of the judgment pursuant to Rule 80 of the Rules of Court.
The Government further requested rectification of paragraph 72 of the judgment under Rule 81 of the Rules of Court. In this connection the Government observed that in their observations on the admissibility and merits they in fact had referred to the alleged violation of Article 13 of the Convention by submitting that no violation of this provision had occurred in the applicant's case.
On 24 April 2009 the Court considered the request for revision and decided to give the Government three weeks to submit their comments on the applicant's claims for just satisfaction. Those comments were received on 16 July 2009.

On 9 February 2005 the  confirmed that the proceedings in question had indeed been lengthy. The court considered that an award of 3,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) would be adequate (approx. 738 euros (EUR), according to the exchange rate at the relevant time). The court stated, inter alia, that the measures taken by the District Court on 26 September 2003 and 31 May, 16 September and 20 December 2004 not only infringed the relevant provisions of the civil procedure code but also appeared to be futile, as some of them had had to be taken for a second time. The court further stated that the fact the District Court had failed to establish the scope of the claim for fifteen years could only be explained by the fact that the court had contributed to the excessive length of the proceedings.

As the proceedings continued to be lengthy, on 5 April 2007 the applicant filed another complaint under the 2004 Act. On 22 May 2007 the  dismissed the applicant's complaint on the ground that there had been no undue delay in the proceedings between 4 April 2006 (the date of the previous decision ascertaining that there had been an undue delay) and the time of the lodging of the complaint by the applicant.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court's decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005-V; Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII; and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, §§ 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.
