On 23 November 2004 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in the city of , .
On 27 May 2002 the Bryanka City Court ordered the State Company “Shakhtoupravlinnya No. 17” to pay the applicant UAH 9,970.16 in salary arrears and other payments.
On 8 July 2002 the Shakhtarsk City Bailiffs’ Service instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of that judgment.
On 25 October 2002 the Bailiffs’ Service informed the applicant that the judgment of 18 June 2002 could not be enforced due to the large number of enforcement proceedings against the debtor and the fact that the procedure for the forced sale of assets belonging to the debtor had been suspended because of the moratorium on the forced sale of property belonging to State enterprises introduced by the Law of 29 November 2001.
On 25 December 2003, 7 September and 29 December 2004, respectively, the full amount of the judgment debt was paid to the applicant in three instalments of UAH 1,195.74, 1,727.84 and 7,053.58.
In November 2003 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Bryanka City Court against the same company seeking the amendment of his retirement date and compensation for the failure to pay him the judgment debt of 27 May 2002.
On 4 November 2004 the court found against the applicant. On 12 January 2005 the Lugansk Regional Court of Appeal upheld the decision of 4 November 2004. The applicant’s appeal in cassation is still pending before the Supreme Court of Ukraine.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-18, 27 July 2004).
