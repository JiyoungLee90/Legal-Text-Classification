The case originated in an application (no. 6667/09) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by six Greek nationals whose names appear in the annex, on 13 January 2009.
The applicants were represented by Mr A. Papakonstantinou, a lawyer practising in Athens. The Greek Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent’s delegates, Mrs K. Paraskevopoulou, Senior Adviser at the State Legal Council, and Mr I. Bakopoulos, Legal Representative at the State Legal Council.
On 2 September 2010 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. In accordance with Protocol no. 14, the application was allocated to a Committee of three Judges.
The six applicants were born on the dates listed in the Annex.
The applicants are co-owners of a plot of land in the  district. On 26 August 1986 a compulsory expropriation was declared on their property according to presidential decree no. 719/1986. Subsequently, on 1st August 2002, the applicants filed an application with the Ministry of Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works asking for the revocation of the blocking of their property as the expropriation procedure had not been completed and no compensation had been awarded to them.
On 18 November 2002 the applicants lodged a recourse against the Greek authorities with the Volos First Instance Administrative Court challenging the implicit refusal of the authorities to revoke the expropriation of their property.
On 7 July 2005 a preliminary decision was published asking the authorities to submit additional evidence within twenty days (decision no. 241/2005). On 13 July 2006 the applicants filed an application before the  First  asking for a hearing date to be set as soon as possible.
The hearing took place on 5 March 2009.
By judgment dated 25 June 2009 the Volos First Instance Administrative Court accepted the applicants’ recourse (judgment no. 144/2009).
On 22 January 2010 the Government lodged an appeal on points of law with the  challenging the abovementioned decision (appeal no. 1099/10). It transpires from the case file that these proceedings are still pending.
The following provisions of the Introductory Law (Εισαγωγικός Νόμος) to the Civil Code (Law no. 2783/41) are relevant:
Section 104
“The State shall be liable in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code concerning legal persons, for acts or omissions of its organs regarding private-law relations or State assets.”
Section 105
“The State shall be under a duty to make good any damage caused by the unlawful acts or omissions of its organs in the exercise of public authority, except where the unlawful act or omission is in breach of an existing provision but is intended to serve the public interest. The person responsible shall be jointly and severally liable, without prejudice to the special provisions on ministerial responsibility.”
These sections establish the concept of a special prejudicial act in public law, creating State liability in tort. This liability results from unlawful acts or omissions. The acts concerned may be not only legal acts but also physical acts by the administrative authorities, including acts which are not in principle enforceable through the courts (Kyriakopoulos, Interpretation of the Civil Code, section 105 of the Introductory Law to the Civil Code, no. 23; Filios, Contract, Special Part, volume 6, Tort, 1977, para. 48 B 112; E. Spiliotopoulos, Administrative Law, 3rd edition, para. 217; Court of Cassation judgment no. 535/1971, Nomiko Vima, 19th year, p. 1414; Court of Cassation judgment no. 492/1967, Nomiko Vima, 16th year, p. 75). The admissibility of an action for damages is subject to one condition, namely the unlawfulness of the act or omission.
