The case originated in an application (no. 23253/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Ms Radojka Jovičić (“the applicant”), on 30 April 2007.

On 14 December 2009 the President of the First Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of proceedings to the Government.
The applicant, who is of Serbian origin, was born in 1950 and lives in .
On 29 July 1987 the Sisak Regional Office of the Croatian Pension Fund (Hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje, Područna služba u Sisku – “the Regional Office”), after finding that due to her illness the applicant’s ability to work had been reduced (smanjena sposobnost za rad), issued a decision awarding her the right to reduced working hours (pravo na rad s polovicom radnog vremena). On 15 October 1987 she was also awarded compensation for the loss of salary resulting from the reduced working hours (pravo na naknadu osobnog dohotka zbog rada sa skraćenim radnim vremenom).
The applicant had been receiving this compensation until September 1991 when she was forced to quit her job and leave Petrinja as the town was taken by the occupying forces. She settled in  as an internally displaced person.
The applicant submitted that she had instituted administrative proceedings before the Regional Office with a view that the payment of compensation for her reduced ability to work be resumed, by making a request to that end on 17 October 1991. The Government submitted that the applicant had done so only on 12 June 1995.
On 20 September 1995 the Regional Office decided to discontinue the administrative proceedings instituted by the applicant’s request.
Following an appeal by the applicant, on 29 January 1996 the Central Office of the Croatian Pension Fund (Hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje, Središnja služba – “the Central Office”) quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case to the Regional Office.
In the fresh first-instance proceedings, on 28 June 1999 the Regional Office issued a decision abolishing the applicant’s right to compensation for reduced ability to work as of 21 September 1991. The applicant appealed.
On 29 October 1999 the Central Office dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision.
On 7 December 1999 the applicant brought an action in  (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske) contesting the second-instance decision.
On 14 November 2002 the  quashed the Central Office’s decision of 29 October 1999 for incomplete facts.
In the fresh appellate proceedings, on 6 February 2003 the Central Office quashed the first-instance decision of 28 June 1999 and remitted the case to the Regional Office.
In the fresh first-instance proceedings, on 23 July 2003 the Regional Office restored the applicant’s right to compensation for reduced ability to work and decided that its payment should be resumed as of 1 July 1995. On 18 August 2003 the applicant appealed, arguing that she should also be paid the outstanding instalments of compensation for reduced ability to work in the period before 1 July 1995.
On 6 May 2004 the Central Office dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision of 23 July 2003.
On 29 June 2004 the applicant brought her second action in the  challenging the second-instance decision of 6 May 2004.
On 25 January 2007 the  again quashed the contested decision for incomplete facts.
In the fresh appellate proceedings, on 17 May 2007 the Central Office quashed the first-instance decision of 23 July 2003 and remitted the case to the Regional Office.
In the fresh first-instance proceedings, on 4 September 2007 the Regional Office adopted a new decision and dismissed the applicant’s request for payment of compensation for reduced ability to work in the period prior to 1 July 1995. The applicant appealed on 10 October 2007.
On 29 November 2007 the Central Office quashed the first-instance decision of 4 September 2007 and remitted the case to the Regional Office.
As in the fresh first-instance proceedings the Regional Office did not issue a new decision within the statutory time-limit of sixty days, on 4 March 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal for failure to respond (žalba zbog šutnje administracije) with the Central Office.
On 13 May 2008 the Central Office allowed the applicant’s appeal for failure to respond of 4 March 2008 and ordered the Regional Office to issue a decision in her case within thirty days.
On 16 July 2008 the Regional Office issued a decision dismissing again the applicant’s request for payment of compensation for the period prior to 1 July 1995. The applicant appealed on 12 August 2008.
On 1 October 2008 the Central Office dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision of 16 July 2008.
On 1 December 2008 the applicant brought another action in the . She contested the decision of the Central Office of 1 October 2008.
On 10 June 2009 the  dismissed the applicant’s action.
On 19 August 2009 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the  (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) against the ’s judgment.
On 16 March 2011 the  declared inadmissible the applicant’s constitutional complaint. It found that the applicant had not substantiated her complaint by any constitutional law arguments but had merely repeated the arguments raised in the proceedings before the Croatian Pension Fund and the . Therefore, the  had been unable to examine the merits of her constitutional complaint.
The relevant part of the 1999 Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette no. 99/1999 of 29 September 1999 – “the Constitutional Court Act”), as amended by the 2002 Amendments (Ustavni zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Ustavnog zakona o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia no. 29/2002 of 22 March 2002), which entered into force on 15 March 2002, reads as follows:
Section 63
“(1) The Constitutional Court shall examine a constitutional complaint whether or not all legal remedies have been exhausted if the competent court fails to decide a claim concerning an individual’s rights and obligations or a criminal charge against him or her within a reasonable time ...
(2) If a constitutional complaint ... under paragraph 1 of this section is upheld, the  shall set a time-limit within which the competent court must decide the case on the merits...
(3) In a decision issued under paragraph 2 of this section, the  shall assess appropriate compensation for an applicant for a violation of his or her constitutional rights ... The compensation shall be paid out of the State budget within three months of the date a request for payment is lodged.”
In the period before 20 June 2007 the Constitutional Court when deciding constitutional complaints lodged under section 63 of the Constitutional Court Act concerning the length of proceedings pending before the Administrative Court, was not taking into consideration their overall duration as it was excluding the period during which the case had been pending before the administrative authorities. The case-law of the  in that period was summarised in Božić v. Croatia, no. 22457/02, § 23, 29 June 2006; Počuča v. Croatia, no. 38550/02, § 27, 29 June 2006; Smoje v. Croatia, no. 28074/03, § 34, 11 January 2007; and Štokalo and others v. , no. 15233/05, §§ 37-38, 16 October 2008).
Following the Court’s judgments in the Božić and Počuča cases, on 20 June 2007 the  adopted a decision no. U-IIIA/4885/2005, which was published in the Official Gazette no. 67/2007 of 27 June 2007, whereby it changed its previous jurisprudence concerning the length of the proceedings before the . The Constitutional Court indicated that from then on it would also take into consideration the period during which the case had been pending before the administrative authorities if: (a) the complainants demonstrated that in that period they had resorted to remedies (an appeal and an action) for failure to respond, or (b) the main cause of the delay in that period had been repeated remittals mandated by incomplete findings of fact.
The Courts Act (Zakon o sudovima, Official Gazette nos. 150/2005, 16/2007, 113/2008, 153/2009, 116/2010, 122/2010 (consolidated text) and 27/2011) entered into force on 29 December 2005. In its sections 27 and 28 it provided for a new remedy for the excessive length of proceedings, a request for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time. The new remedy replaced a constitutional complaint under section 63 of the Constitutional Court Act as the remedy for the length of proceedings. Sections 27 and 28 of the Courts Act, as in force at the material time, read as follows:
PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT TO A HEARING WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME
Section 27
 “(1) A party to court proceedings who considers that the competent court failed to decide within a reasonable time on his or her rights or obligations or a criminal charge against him or her may lodge a request for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time with the immediately higher court.
(2) If the request concerns proceedings pending before the High Commercial Court of the Republic of Croatia, the High Court for Administrative Offences of the Republic of Croatia or the Administrative Court of the Republic of Croatia, the request shall be decided by the Supreme Court of the .
(3) The proceedings for deciding the request referred to in paragraph 1 of this section shall be urgent.
Section 28
(1) If the court referred to in section 27 of this Act finds the request well founded, it shall set a time-limit within which the court before which the proceedings are pending must decide on a right or obligation of, or a criminal charge against, the person who lodged the request, and shall award him or her appropriate compensation for the violation of his or her right to a hearing within a reasonable time.
(2) The compensation shall be paid out of the State budget within three months from the date the party’s request for payment is lodged.
(3) An appeal, to be lodged within fifteen days with the Supreme Court, lies against a decision on the request for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time. No appeal lies against the Supreme Court’s decision but one may lodge a constitutional complaint.”
Until the 2009 Amendments to the Courts Act (Zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Zakona o sudovima, Official Gazette no. 153/2009), that entered into force on 29 December 2009, a constitutional complaint under section 63 of the Constitutional Court Act could still be lodged against the Supreme Court’s decisions rendered under sections 27(2) on 28(3) of the Courts Act.
In the period between 29 December 2005 and 25 November 2007 the Supreme Court when deciding requests for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time lodged concerning the length of proceedings pending before the Administrative Court, followed the above described jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 31 above) and was thus not taking into consideration their overall duration as it was excluding the period during which the case had been pending before the administrative authorities.
On 26 November 2007 the Supreme Court adopted a decision no. Uzp 309/07-6 bringing its own case-law in line with the change in the ’s jurisprudence (see paragraph 32 above).
