The case originated in an application (no. 52529/12) against Montenegro lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by six Montenegrin nationals, Ms Pava Brajović, Ms Zoranka Ajković, Ms Jelena Brajović, Mr Kastro Brajović, Ms Lindita Vučić, and Ms Nada Zlatičanin (“the applicants”), on 7 August 2012.
The applicants were represented by Mr B. Simović, a lawyer practising in Podgorica. The Montenegrin Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs V. Pavličić.
The applicants complained about the denial of access to court given that the Court of Appeal had not ruled on their appeal on costs in criminal proceedings.
On 7 December 2016 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1931, 1972, 1948, 1965, 1970, and 1964 respectively, and live in Golubovci.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The applicants intervened, as injured party, in criminal proceedings against X, in the course of which they sought 2.705,70 euros (EUR) as compensation for legal costs.
On 14 October 2008 the High Court (Viši sud) in Podgorica found X guilty and, inter alia, ordered him to pay the applicants 505.70 euros (EUR) for the costs of legal representation, without specifying what exactly was covered by this amount.
On an unspecified date X and the High State Prosecutor appealed.
On 30 March 2009 the applicants appealed in respect of costs and expenses. On 6 May 2009 the High Court transmitted the applicants’ appeal to the Court of Appeal (Apelacioni sud) in Podgorica.
On 22 September 2009 the Court of Appeal ruled on the appeals lodged by the High State Prosecutor and X. The applicants learned of this judgment on 27 May 2010 when checking the case-file at the High Court. It was served on them on 3 October 2013.
On 28 May 2010 the applicants complained to the President of the Supreme Court that the Court of Appeal had failed to rule on their appeal.
On 7 June 2010 the President of the Supreme Court notified them that she had been informed by the High Court President that the case file had been “at the Court of Appeal in order for it to rule on [their] appeal in respect of costs of criminal proceedings given that it had not been ruled upon by [its] judgment of 22 September 2009”.
On 24 October 2011 the applicants requested the President of the High Court to transmit the case file to the Court of Appeal given that they had learnt that the file had been archived in the High Court, contrary to what that court had said to the President of the Supreme Court.
On 11 January 2012 the applicants again complained to the President of the Supreme Court.
It would appear that the Court of Appeal has not ruled on the applicants’ appeal.
On 14 March 2011, in the absence of any ruling by the Court of Appeal, the applicants filed a compensation claim against the State.
On 17 June 2011 the Court of First Instance (Osnovni sud) in Podgorica rejected the claim (odbacuje se) finding that the High Court had awarded them the costs, which judgment had become final in the meantime, and that the issue was thus res iudicata.
On 7 July 2011 the High Court upheld this judgment.
On 12 July 2012 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud) dismissed the applicants’ constitutional appeal, considering that there was no violation of Article 6 as res iudicata was indeed a procedural obstacle which prevented further proceedings. It further held that the applicants’ dissatisfaction with the costs awarded in the criminal proceedings did not mean that they could claim them by a regular civil claim (putem redovne građanske tužbe). In any event, the civil proceedings could not serve to correct the final decisions issued in criminal proceedings.
On 8 December 2011 the High Court issued a decision ordering its finance department (računovodstvo) to pay the applicants’ representative the amount awarded by the High Court on 14 October 2008. This decision became final on 5 January 2012, given that no appeal was lodged against it.
On 10 January 2017 the High Court informed the Agent’s office that the Court of Appeal had not ruled on the applicants’ appeal in respect of costs of criminal proceedings, but that the High Court, after its judgment of 14 October 2008 had become final, had issued a decision on 8 December 2011 ordering that the applicants’ representative be paid the sum awarded thereby.
Article 32 provides that everyone shall have the right to a fair trial before a tribunal.
Article 193 provided that a judgment would become final when it was no longer possible to challenge it by an appeal or when appeal was not allowed against it.
Article 199 § 2(8) provided that the costs of proceedings included necessary expenses of an injured party, as well as the fee and necessary expenses of their representative. Article 202 § 1 provided that, when finding a defendant guilty, the court would also award the costs of criminal proceedings, including the costs incurred by the injured party and their representative as well as their representative’s fee. Articles 371-402 set out details as regards appeals. Article 372 § 4, in particular, provided that an injured party was entitled to lodge an appeal against the first-instance judgment in respect of the costs of proceedings.
Article 203 § 1 provided that if the proceedings were discontinued, if the defendant was acquitted, or if the charges were dismissed (odbijajuća presuda), the decision or the judgment would specify that the costs of criminal proceedings as specified in Article 199 § 2(1)-(6), as well as the defendant’s expenses, and expenses and the fee of the defendant’s representative, would be paid from the budget, save in exceptional cases not relevant to the present case, specified in Article 203. Article 203 § 6 further provided that if the request for the costs and the fee under paragraph 1 of this Article was not accepted or the court did not rule thereon within two months as of the day when it had been lodged, the defendant and his representative were entitled to claim them in civil proceedings (imaju pravo da potraživanja ostvaruju u parničnom postupku) against the State.
Section 1 provides, inter alia, that this Act shall be applied to all property-related/pecuniary matters and other civil claims of physical and legal entities (iz imovinskih i drugih građanskopravnih odnosa), except those where the law specifically provides for a competence of some other State body.
Section 276(1)(5) provides that the court shall reject a claim if it finds that the matter has already been ruled upon.
The Obligations Act, which entered into force in 2008, was partially amended in April 2017. The relevant provisions, as in force at the time, provided as follows.
Sections 148 to 216 set out details as regards compensation claims.
Sections 148 and 149 set out the different grounds for claiming compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. In particular, section 148(1) provided that whoever caused damage to somebody else was liable to compensation, unless he or she could prove that the damage was not his or her fault.
Section 166(1) provided that any legal entity, including the State, was liable for any damage caused by one of “its bodies”.
