The case originated in three applications (nos. 78162/13, 79517/13 and 3245/14) against the Republic of Azerbaijan lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Azerbaijani nationals, Mr Turkel Ahmad oglu Alisoy (“the first applicant”), Mr Ali Natig oglu Safarli (“the second applicant”) and Sarvar Nizami oglu Abdullali (“the third applicant”), on 26 November 2013, 4 December 2013 and 25 December 2013 respectively.
The applicants were represented by Mr R. Mustafazade and Mr A. Mustafayev, lawyers practising in Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Ç. Asgarov.
On 16 April 2015 the complaints concerning Articles 5, 6, 10 and 11 of the Convention were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicants’ dates of birth and places of residence are given in the Appendix.
The applicants were opposition-oriented activists. At the material time the first applicant was a member of one of the opposition parties, the Popular Front Party of Azerbaijan. He participated in a number of peaceful demonstrations organised by the opposition and on several occasions was arrested and convicted for that.
On 12 October 2013 an opposition group İctimai Palata held a demonstration, authorised by the relevant authority, the Baku City Executive Authority (“the BCEA”).
The demonstration was held in the Mahsul stadium, a place proposed by the BCEA. It was intended to be peaceful and was conducted in a peaceful manner. The participants were protesting against alleged irregularities and fraud during the presidential elections of 9 October 2013.
All three applicants participated in that demonstration.
After the end of the demonstration of 12 October 2013 the applicants were arrested at the entrance to a nearby metro station, Inshaatchilar.
The circumstances of the applicants’ arrests, their custody and subsequent administrative proceedings against them are similar to those in Huseynli and Others v. Azerbaijan (nos. 67360/11 and 2 others, 11 February 2016) and Huseynov and Others v. Azerbaijan ([Committee] nos. 34262/14 and 5 others, 24 November 2016) (see also Appendix).
After the amendments introduced by Law no. 135-IVQD of 31 May 2011, which entered into force on 1 July 2011, Article 410 of the Code of Administrative Offences 2000 (“the CAO”) provided as follows:
“... 410.3.  A copy of the administrative offence report shall be given to an individual who is subject to the administrative offence proceedings or to a representative of a legal entity.
4. ... An aggrieved person in administrative offence proceedings has the right to a copy of the administrative offence report.”
