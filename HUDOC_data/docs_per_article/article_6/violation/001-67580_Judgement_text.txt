By a letter of 17 June 1999, the Ministry of Energy informed Mr Grygoriy Ganushevych that the delay in the payment of salary arrears was due to the debtor company’s difficult economic situation, caused by the failure of third parties to pay their debts to the company. According to the Ministry, the company’s situation required a solution at State level.
By a letter of 5 May 2001, the same Ministry informed Mr Grygoriy Ganushevych that, despite its efforts, the debtor company’s economic situation had not improved. The Ministry mentioned that the Ministry for Emergencies and the Protection of the Population from the Consequences of the Chernobyl Catastrophe (“the Ministry for Emergencies”) was Atomspetsbud’s largest debtor. The Ministry informed the applicant that the company’s management had asked it to decide on the expediency of the company’s continued existence.
At the end of 2001 the sixth, seventh and ninth applicants instituted separate proceedings in the Pechersky District Court of Kiev against the Ukrainian President, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Justice, seeking compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the non-enforcement of the judicial decisions in their favour. In three separate decisions of 29 January 2002, that court found against the applicants, stating that, in the event of non-enforcement, the applicants had the option of lodging the appropriate claims for damages against the State Bailiffs’ Service, rather than the above defendants, whose responsibility for the non-enforcement had not been proved by the claimants. The applicants did not appeal against those decisions under the ordinary appeal procedure or on points of law.
In their joint letter of 31 October 2002 to the Ukrainian Prime Minister, all the applicants gave notice that they had lodged applications with the European Court of Human Rights and proposed a friendly settlement of the matter. They requested full enforcement of the decisions and compensation for damage ranging from UAH 20,000 to 50,000 each.
In reply, the Agent of the Government informed the applicants that friendly-settlement proceedings could only be started following the Court’s admissibility decision. She further informed the applicants of the large number of writs of execution pending against the debtor company, amounting to UAH 3,849,312. However, enforcement of the judgments through the seizure of property required special authorisation from the Ministry for Emergencies, since the debtor company’s property was located within the  area, which was contaminated by radiation. No such authorisation was granted.
By an order of the Ministry of Energy dated 27 June 2002, the debtor company was liquidated and a liquidation commission established.
As a result, between 7 October 2002 and 9 July 2003 the State Bailiffs’ Service terminated the enforcement proceedings in the applicants’ cases and all the writs of execution were forwarded to the liquidation commission as creditors’ claims. The liquidation proceedings are still pending.
