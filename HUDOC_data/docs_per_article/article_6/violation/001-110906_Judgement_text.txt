The case originated in an application (no. 38975/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Borut Madžarević (“the applicant”), on 10 October 2005.

On 12 February 2009 the application was communicated to the Government. In accordance with Protocol No. 14 to the Convention, the application was assigned to a committee of three Judges.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in .
On 25 November 1998 the Ljubljana Labour and  found that the applicant’s employment had been unlawfully terminated by company K. and ordered the latter to reinstate the applicant in his previous position and pay his salary for the period of his wrongful dismissal. On 28 June 2000 this judgment became final.
On 22 September 2000 the applicant lodged a request for enforcement of the judgment.
On 3 October 2000 the  allowed the enforcement claim. Company K., however, objected, claiming that it had already fulfilled the obligations arising from the above-mentioned judgment. On 8 November 2000 the  stayed the enforcement and advised company K. to institute contentious proceedings.
After the termination of the contentious proceedings (see paragraphs 11-18 below), and further to a request by the applicant on 13 March 2007, the enforcement proceedings continued. On 13 June 2007 the court ordered enforcement of the part of the judgment awarding the sum of EUR 46,950 which represented the unpaid salary with default interest (see paragraph 16 below). The applicant lodged an appeal, which was rejected on 10 October 2007.
On 29 November 2007 the Vrhnika Local Court discontinued the enforcement on the basis of information received from company K. to the effect that the payment had been made. However, this decision was quashed on appeal and subsequently, further to the notification that the applicant had received the full amount of the outstanding claim, the  discontinued the enforcement on 24 September 2008. The applicant’s appeal against that decision was rejected by the  on 25 February 2009. The latter’s decision was served on the applicant on an unspecified date in March 2009.
In the course of those proceedings, the applicant lodged supervisory appeals under the Protection of the Right to Trial without Undue Delay Act (hereinafter referred to as “the 2006 Act”) on 18 July 2007 and 17 March 2008 respectively. On 4 April 2008 he lodged a motion for a deadline, which was rejected as unfounded by the vice-president of the  on 25 April 2008.
On 24 November 2000 company K. lodged a claim with the Ljubljana Labour and , contesting the validity of the above-mentioned enforcement order of 3 October 2000 (see paragraph 7 above).
A hearing was held on 28 August 2001. On that date the court delivered a judgment, which was served on the applicant on 7 January 2002. On 14 January 2002 the applicant appealed.
On 29 August 2003 the Higher Labour and  allowed the appeal and remitted the case for re-examination.
On 1 December 2003 the Ljubljana Labour and  decided that it did not have jurisdiction in the case and referred it to the  for adjudication. Following an objection by the applicant, the  also declared that it lacked jurisdiction to decide on the matter and referred the case to the Ljubljana District Court on 16 July 2004. On 21 January 2005 the latter instituted a dispute on jurisdiction. Following a decision of the Ljubljana Higher Court of 2 February 2005 the case was again transferred to the  on 7 March 2005.
On 10 March 2005 the  ordered company K. to specify the monetary value of the claim and, on 7 April 2005, declared lack of jurisdiction to adjudicate the case and referred it to the Ljubljana District Court. On 23 June and 6 December 2005 the latter held hearings.
On 6 December 2005 the court delivered a judgment in which it upheld company K.’s claim in so far as it concerned the re-employment of the applicant and payment of contributions and taxes. On the other hand, it rejected the company’s claim with respect to unreimbursed salary with default interest and found that the claim for enforcement of this part of the judgment was admissible.
On 15 March 2006 the applicant appealed and so did K. On 24 January 2007 the  rejected both appeals. The judgment was served on the applicant on 12 February 2007.
In the course of the proceedings, the applicant lodged two supervisory appeals, one on 9 March 2005 and one on 3 January 2007.
On 19 May 2008 the applicant, relying on section 20 of the 2006 Act, lodged a claim with the  seeking compensation in the amount of EUR 5,000 for non-pecuniary damage incurred as a result of the length of the contentious proceedings. In the course of the proceedings, the applicant reduced his claim to EUR 4,000.
In reply to the claim, the State Attorney agreed to pay EUR 1,440 with respect to non-pecuniary damage.
Further to the termination of the enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 9 above), the applicant, on 8 June 2009, sent a settlement proposal to the State Attorney requesting to be paid compensation for non-pecuniary damage relating also to the length of the enforcement.
On 7 June 2010, the applicant, having received no reply from the State Attorney, requested that his compensation claim be extended to cover the damage resulting from the alleged excessive length of the enforcement proceedings. On 5 July 2010 the State Attorney declined to settle the case as far as the enforcement proceedings were concerned.
On 9 July 2010 the applicant lodged a supervisory appeal.
On 14 July 2010 the court issued a judgment. The court found that the contentious proceedings had lasted six years and two months at two levels of jurisdiction, had not concerned an issue of any complexity, and that the delay could not be attributed to the applicant. It also found that the applicant had lodged two well-founded supervisory appeals in the course of the proceedings. The court concluded that the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time had been violated and that the State was to pay EUR 1,440 to him. In addition, it ordered the State to pay the applicant default interest on the amount of EUR 1,440 backdated to 19 May 2008. The court rejected the remainder of the claim. Lastly, the court rejected the applicant’s request of 7 June 2010 for the modification of the claim, finding that in accordance with the applicable procedural rules no modification could be made at that late stage of the proceedings.
On 6 September 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal. On 6 May 2011 the  rejected the appeal and the ’s judgment consequently became final.
On 22 July 2008 the applicant, relying on section 21 of the 2006 Act, lodged a claim with the Ljubljana District Court for compensation for pecuniary damage in the amount of EUR 24,851, which he had allegedly sustained on account of the length of the contentious proceedings.
On 22 October 2009 the applicant modified his claim so as to include the damage incurred on account of the length of the enforcement proceedings (no. In 2000/20047).
On 1 June 2010 the Ljubljana District Court referred the case to the , which had jurisdiction to decide on the matter.
On 6 July 2010 the applicant lodged a supervisory appeal.
The 2006 Act entered into force on 17 May 2006. On 1 January 2007 it became operational and has been implemented since that date. The Act provides that a claimant may use a supervisory appeal and an application for a deadline in order to expedite the proceedings. In addition to these acceleratory remedies, the 2006 Act also provides for the opportunity to obtain redress by means of a compensatory remedy, namely, by bringing a claim for compensation. With regard to the compensatory remedy, the 2006 Act provides that two cumulative conditions must be satisfied in order for a party to be able to lodge a claim for compensation. Firstly, during the proceedings the applicant must have successfully availed himself of a supervisory appeal or have lodged an application for a deadline, regardless of the outcome. Secondly, the proceedings must have been terminated. Before a compensation claim can be lodged with a court, the claimant is required to attempt to settle the case with the State Attorney’s Office.
