The case of Albert and Le Compte was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission"). It originated in two applications against  (nos. 7299/75 and 7496/76) lodged with the Commission in 1975 and 1976 by two Belgian nationals, Dr. Alfred Albert and Dr. Herman Le Compte, under Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ("the Convention"). The Commission ordered the joinder of the applications on 10 July 1979.
The Commission’s request was lodged with the registry of the Court on 12 March 1982, within the period of three months laid down by Articles 32 para. 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47). The request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration made by the  recognising the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the Commission’s request was to obtain a decision from the Court as to whether the disciplinary proceedings instituted against the applicants before the competent bodies of the Belgian Ordre des médecins (Medical Association) breached the rights guaranteed by the Convention, particularly by Articles 3 and 6 thereof (art. 3, art. 6).
The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. W. Ganshof van der Meersch, the elected judge of Belgian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. G. Wiarda, the President of the Court (Rule 21 3 (b) of the Rules of Court). On 26 March 1982, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members of the Chamber, namely Mr. M. Zekia, Mr. J. Cremona, Mr. D. Evrigenis, Mr. R. Macdonald, and Mr. J. Gersing (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).
After assuming the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr. Wiarda ascertained through the Registrar the views of the Agent of the Belgian Government ("the Government") and the Delegates of the Commission as regards the procedure to be followed. On 3 May 1982, having particular regard to their concurring statements, he concluded that there was no need for memorials to be filed; he also directed that the oral proceedings should open on 27 September.
On 28 May 1982, the Chamber decided under Rule 48 to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court.
On 27 August, the President instructed the Registrar to request the Commission to produce several documents to the Court and the Government to furnish certain information. The representatives complied with these requests on 8 and 27 September.
The oral proceedings were held in public at the , , on 27 September 1982. The Court held a preparatory meeting immediately beforehand.
There appeared before the Court:
- for the Government
- for the Commission
Dr. Alfred Albert is a medical practitioner. He was born in 1908, lives at Molenbeek and is a Belgian national.
By letter of 9 April 1974, the Brabant Provincial Council of the Ordre des médecins (Medical Association) notified him of the opening of an enquiry regarding him; it summoned him to appear before its Bureau on 8 May to answer questions in connection with a series of certificates of unfitness for work issued by him, asking him to bring with him the medical files of the patients concerned.
The applicant appeared on the prescribed date. The Bureau of the Provincial Council informed him that he was accused of having issued spurious certificates.
On 16 May, the President of the Provincial Council sent Dr. Albert a registered letter which read:
"Dear Colleague,
The Brabant Council of the Ordre des médecins requests the honour of your appearance before it on Tuesday, 4 June 1974 at 8.30 p.m., 32 Place de Jamblinne de Meux, in order to present your defence in connection with the following complaint, namely that of
- having issued various certificates of unfitness for work, in particular:
on 26.12.1973 to B..., on 7.1.1974 to T..., on 9.1.1974 to A...,
without having satisfied yourself in a strict manner, by means of a sufficiently thorough examination, of the justification of the unfitness for work and while not possessing any medical record in relation to these patients,
these facts having compromised the reputation, probity and dignity of the medical profession.
The case-file concerning you may be consulted at the Council’s office on any working day from 9.00 a.m. until 11.30 a.m., and from 2.00 p.m. 5.00 p.m., except on Saturday afternoon, from 18 to 31 May inclusive.
You may be assisted by one or more lawyers.
Yours faithfully ..."
On 4 June, the Provincial Council heard Dr. Albert and suspended his right to practise medicine for a period of two years. It found that Dr. Albert had "carried out no medical examinations such as to warrant finding a state of unfitness for work", that he had been unable to produce "any medical document whatsoever capable of establishing" such a state, and that neither had "his memory permitted him ... to come forward with any justification". It considered that "it ought to impose a very severe sanction" in view of "the very serious disciplinary record" of the applicant (two suspensions from practice following criminal convictions).
Albert was notified of the decision on 11 June.
Dr. Albert appealed to the French-language Appeals Council of the Ordre on 18 June. The Provincial Council’s legal assessor did likewise on 26 June in order to have the penalty increased.
On 19 November, the Appeals Council upheld the decision given at first instance.
By judgment of 12 June 1975, the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant’s appeal on a point of law alleging violation of the rights of defence and, in so far as relevant, of Article 97 of the Constitution.
Dr. Herman Le Compte, a Belgian national born in 1929 and living at Knokke-Heist, is a medical practitioner.
On 22 February 1974, the West Flanders Provincial Council of the Ordre des médecins informed him that an enquiry had been ordered concerning him for "improper publicity" (ongeoorloofde publiciteit) and "contempt (beledigingen) of the Ordre": he had given three interviews to magazines and sent a letter to the President of the Provincial Council.
On 26 March, the applicant wrote to the said President to advise him of his intention to exercise his right, under sections 40 an 41 of the Royal Decree of 6 February 1970, to challenge the Provincial Council’s members as a whole.
On 27 March, the Provincial Council, by decision rendered in absentia, rejected the applicant’s challenge and suspended his right to practise medicine for a period of two years.
The applicant entered an appeal on 5 April 1974. He alleged, amongst other things, violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention:
"This provision of the Convention guarantees to a litigant that his case will be dealt with at a public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. In the particular circumstances of the case, neither of these two guarantees was assured.
The legal assessor of the Provincial Council did not avail himself of his own right to appeal.
On 28 October, the Dutch-language Appeals Council rejected the grounds challenging its members and changed the applicants’ suspension into striking his name from the register of the Ordre.
On 4 November, Dr. Le Compte lodged an objection (opposition) against this decision, which had been given in absentia.
As he had been summoned to appear at a hearing on 16 December, he lodged a further challenge on 6 December against the Appeals Council’s members as a whole.
On 6 January 1975, the Appeals Council rejected both the objection and the challenge.
The applicant thereupon appealed on a point of law to the court of Cassation, but his appeal was dismissed by judgment of 7 November 1975, which was notified to him on 25 November.
The striking of Dr. Le Compte’s name from the register of the Ordre took effect on 26 December.
Under sections 7 para. 1 and 31 of Royal Decree No. 79 of 10 November 1967 and section 38 para. 1 of Royal Decree No. 78 of the same date, being struck off the register has the consequence of debarring him from practising medicine.
Belgian legislation on the Ordre des médecins, particularly on the organs of the Ordre and the procedure followed in disciplinary matters, is described in the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere judgment of 23 June 1981 (Series A no. 43, pp. 11-17, paras. 20-34). The Court refers back to this judgment in this connection.
Dr. Albert applied to the Commission on 10 December 1975, Dr. Le Compte on 6 May 1976.
Both applicants alleged a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. They maintained in particular that they had not been given a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by and independent and impartial tribunal established by law.
Albert further asserted that he had not received the benefit of the guarantees of Article 6 paras. 2 and 3 (a), (b) and (d) (art. 6-2, art. 6-3-a, art. 6-3-b, art. 6-3-d).
Le Compte, for his part, contended that the striking of his name from the register of the Ordre was an inhuman or degrading punishment in breach of Article 3 (art. 3) and that the obligation to join the Ordre and submit to its disciplinary organs violated Article 11 (art. 11) taken on its own or in conjunction with Article 17 (art. 17+11).
The Commission declared both applications admissible on 4 December 1979 after ordering their joinder on 10 July 1979 under Rule 29 of its Rules of Procedure.
In its report of 14 December 1981 (Article 31 of the Convention) (art. 31), its expressed the opinion:
- that there had been no violation of Article 3 (art. 3) (unanimously);
- that neither Dr. Albert (8 votes to 4, with 1 abstention) nor  Dr. Le Compte (12 votes, with 1 abstention) had been subject to a  "criminal charge";
- that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) applied to the "contestations"  (disputes) over "civil rights and obligations" which had led to the  disciplinary measures taken against the applicants (12 votes to 1);
- that, in the circumstances, the organs of the Ordre were  "established by law" and were "independent" (10 votes, with  3 abstentions);
- that Dr. Albert (7 votes to 4, with 2 abstentions) and Dr. Le Compte  (8 votes to 1, with 4 abstentions) had been given a hearing by an  "impartial tribunal";
- that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) had been violated in that neither  applicant had been given a "public hearing" (11 votes to 1, with  1 abstention).
Noting that Dr. Le Compte’s allegations regarding Article 11 (art. 11) were similar to those he had made in the case of Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere, the Commission referred back to its report of 14 December 1979 (paras. 61-65) and to the Court’s judgment of 23 June 1981 (Series A no. 43, p. 17, para. 36, and pp. 26-27, paras. 62-66).
The report contains four separate opinions.
At the hearing held on 27 September 1982, the Government requested the Court
"to hold that there has been, in the present cases, no violation of Article 3 (art. 3) or of any of the provisions of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention".
