The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission") on 15 September 1995, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in two applications (nos. 16566/90 and 16898/90) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 18 January and 14 May 1990 respectively, by an Austrian national, Mr Wolfgang Mauer.
The Commission’s requests referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby  recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the requests was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1).
In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 35 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court B, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated Mr H. Blum, a lawyer practising in , to represent him (Rule 31).
On 29 September 1995 the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, decided, under Rule 21 para. 7 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to hear both cases.
The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr F. Matscher, the elected judge of Austrian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 29 September 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, Mr Ryssdal drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr I. Foighel, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr L. Wildhaber, Mr D. Gotchev, Mr B. Repik and Mr P. Jambrek (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43). Subsequently Mr L.-E. Pettiti and Mrs E. Palm, substitute judges, replaced Mr Pekkanen and Mr Gotchev, who were unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1).
On 23 November 1995 the Chamber ordered the joinder of the two cases (Rule 39 para. 3 in fine).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Austrian Government ("the Government"), the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 para. 1 and 40). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 28 May 1996 and the applicant’s memorial (in which the applicant’s claims under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50) were also set out) on 30 May. The Delegate filed written observations in reply on 3 July.
On 13 June 1996 the Commission produced various documents from the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the President’s instructions.
On 28 August 1996 the Chamber decided to dispense with a hearing in the case, having satisfied itself that the conditions for this derogation from its usual procedure had been met (Rules 27 and 40).
Pursuant to the order made by the President on 29 August 1996, further documents were received from the Commission on 19 September 1996 and from the Government on 20 September.
The applicant is an Austrian national born in 1953 and resident in . He has a taxi business.
On 4 March 1988 a car identified as belonging to the applicant was seen to drive through a red traffic-light.
On 15 May 1988 the Federal Police Authority (Bundespolizeidirektion) in  sent the applicant a letter ordering him to disclose the identity of the driver.
On 20 May 1988 the Vienna Federal Police Authority imposed a fine of 800 Austrian schillings (ATS) with forty-eight hours’ imprisonment (Arrest) in default on the applicant by way of a provisional penal order (Strafverfügung) for having failed to comply with his obligation as registered owner (Zulassungsbesitzer) of a car to disclose the identity of the driver at a particular time, contrary to section 103 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act (Kraftfahrgesetz) 1967 (see paragraph 22 below).
The applicant states that he tried to submit a written appeal at a police station, or in the alternative to declare his objections orally, but the officers at the police station refused to cooperate.
When the Federal Police Authority proceeded to the enforcement of the provisional order, the applicant referred to this refusal. The authority thereupon instituted ordinary penal administrative proceedings which - after a hearing of the applicant - led to a penal order (Straferkenntnis) on 21 April 1989 imposing a fine of ATS 800 (again with forty-eight hours’ imprisonment in default) and ordering the applicant to pay costs to an amount of ATS 80.
The applicant appealed to the  regional government (Amt der Landesregierung), which on 12 June 1989 quashed this penal order as being null and void on the ground that the applicant had not effectively raised objections against the initial provisional penal order. The latter order accordingly remained valid.
The applicant lodged a complaint regarding this decision with the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof), which on 18 October 1989 dismissed the appeal without a hearing (section 35 (1) of the Administrative Court Act) and confirmed the decision of the regional government. It found that the refusal of the police to accept his written appeal had not deprived the applicant of the possibility to lodge it; he could still have dropped it into the letter-box or sent it by post.
On 6 August 1987 officers of the  police found that a tyre on one of the applicant’s taxis had too low a tread. They drew up a report and confiscated the car’s number plates and logbook.
On 20 September 1988 the Vienna Federal Police Authority, having heard the applicant, fined him ATS 500 for failure to comply with his duties as the registered owner of a motor vehicle (see paragraph 21 below), with thirty hours’ imprisonment in default.
The applicant appealed to the  regional government, which confirmed the decision of the Federal Police Authority on 21 April 1989.
The applicant filed a further appeal to the  on 9 June 1989, complaining, inter alia, that the regional government had refused to hear the evidence of witnesses whom he had sought to bring forward.
The  dismissed this appeal on 13 December 1989 without a hearing and ordered the applicant to pay ATS 2,760 costs. Its reasoning reflected the finding that the further evidence which the applicant had wished to put forward was in any event irrelevant.
Under section 103 (1), first sub-paragraph, of the Motor Vehicles Act 1967, the registered owner of a motor vehicle is responsible for maintaining the vehicle in such a way as to comply with the Act or delegated legislation.
Section 7 (1) of the Act requires motor vehicles to be equipped with appropriate tyres for the type of vehicle. Regulation 4 (4) of the Motor Vehicle (Implementation) Regulations (Kraftfahrzeuggesetz-Durchführungsverordnung) requires the tyres of the type of vehicle at issue in the present case to have a tread at least 1.6mm high over their entire surface.
Section 103 (2) of the Act entitles the competent authority, inter alia, to require the registered owner to communicate the name and address of the person who has used the vehicle at a specific time.
Under section 134 (1), first sub-paragraph, it is an administrative offence (Verwaltungsübertretung) not to comply with the above-mentioned provisions, punishable by a fine of up to ATS 30,000 or up to six weeks’ imprisonment in default.
For a description of the relevant domestic procedure, reference is made to the Umlauft v.  judgment of 23 October 1995 (Series A no. 328-B, pp. 34-36, paras. 14-23).
Mr Mauer applied to the Commission on 18 January 1990 (application no. 16566/90) and 14 May 1990 (application no. 16898/90).
In the first application the applicant relied on Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-c). He complained that he had not had a fair and public hearing before a tribunal and that he had not been allowed to defend himself in person.
In the second application the applicant relied on Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d). He complained that he had not had a fair hearing and that witnesses whom he had sought to bring forward had not been heard.
The Commission declared both applications admissible on 18 October 1994. In its reports of 27 June 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the following unanimous opinions:
(a) in the first case (application no. 16566/90), that there had been a violation of the applicant’s right to a tribunal as guaranteed by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), but that the absence of a hearing before the  raised no separate issue under that provision (art. 6-1);
(b) in the second case (application no. 16898/90), that there had been a violation of the applicant’s right to a tribunal as guaranteed by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), but that neither the absence of a hearing before the Administrative Court nor the way in which the evidence was considered raised any separate issue under that provision (art. 6-1).
