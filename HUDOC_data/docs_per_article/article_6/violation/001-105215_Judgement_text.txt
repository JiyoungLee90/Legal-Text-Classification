The case originated in an application (no. 53261/08) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Bulfracht Ltd, a company incorporated under Bulgarian law (“the applicant company”), on 7 October 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Maćešić, an advocate practising in . The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Š. Stažnik.
On 9 February 2010 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The Government of Bulgaria, having been informed of their right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 2 (a) of the Rules of Court), did not avail themselves of this right.
The applicant company, Bulfracht Ltd., is a limited liability company incorporated under Bulgarian law with its head office in Sofia ().
On 13 April 1990 company J.A. from Rijeka, a shipping agent, brokered a contract of carriage of goods by sea between the applicant company as the ship’s operator (carrier) and the Cypriot company TWS as the charterer. The applicant company undertook to transport a certain quantity of steel tubes from Odessa to Kaohsiung, while TWS assumed the obligation to pay the freight to the applicant company, amounting to 515,099.20  dollars (USD). It would appear that the freight was not paid and that on 15 May 1990 company J.A. sent a fax message to the applicant company, which the latter interpreted as the former undertaking to pay the freight as a guarantor.
Since the freight had not been paid, on 15 April 1991 the applicant company brought a civil action in  (Trgovački sud u Rijeci) against company J.A., seeking payment of USD 515,099.20.
On 26 September 2000 the  dismissed the applicant company’s action, finding that the text of the fax message of 15 May 1990 could not be interpreted as giving rise to any obligation on the part of the defendant.
On 6 July 2004 the  (Visoki trgovački sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the applicant company’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment.
On 20 October 2004 the applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija) against the second-instance judgment.
On 27 April 2006 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) declared inadmissible ratione valoris the applicant company’s appeal on points of law, as it found that the value of the subject matter of the dispute was below the statutory threshold of HRK 500,000. In doing so it reasoned as follows:
“The exchange rate between the US dollar and the domestic currency on 15 April 1991, that is, on the day the action was brought, was 14.2694 [former Yugoslav] dinars [YUD] to USD 1, which for USD 515,099.20 amounted to [YUD] 7,350,156.53... After conversion of the amount sought by the plaintiff, pursuant to the [relevant] legislation, the value of the subject matter of the dispute in the present case is HRK 7,350.16.”
On 12 March 2008 the  (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant company and served its decision on the company’s representative on 7 April 2008. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:
“In the constitutional complaint the complainant alleged violation of the constitutional right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Article 29 paragraph 1 of the Constitution.
...
In the present case the  finds that the contested decision of the Supreme Court was rendered in the proceedings conducted in accordance with the law, on the basis of valid application of the substantive law.
The  therefore holds that that the proceedings which preceded those before the  were conducted in a manner which enabled the complainant to have a fair hearing and did not result in a violation of the constitutional right guaranteed by Article 29 paragraph 1 of the Constitution.”
The relevant part of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, Official Gazette of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia nos. 4/1977, 36/1977 (corrigendum), 36/1980, 69/1982, 58/1984, 74/1987, 57/1989, 20/1990, 27/1990 and 35/1991, and Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia nos. 53/1991, 91/1992, 58/1993, 112/1999, 88/2001, 117/2003, 88/2005, 2/2007, 84/2008 and 123/2008), as in force at the material time, provided as follows:

“(1) When the value of the subject matter of the dispute is relevant for determining subject matter jurisdiction, the composition of the court, the right to lodge an appeal on points of law and in other cases provided for in this Act, only the value of the principal claim shall be taken into account as the value of the subject matter of the dispute.
(2) Interest, costs of proceedings, liquidated damages and other secondary claims shall not be taken into account unless they constitute the principal claim.”

Section 186 (2)
“When the jurisdiction of the court or its composition, or the right to lodge an appeal on points of law, depends on the value of the subject matter of the dispute, and the object of an action is not the sum of money, the plaintiff shall in the statement of claim (u tužbi) indicate the value of the subject matter of the dispute.”

	EXTRAORDINARY REMEDIES
Appeal on points of law
Section 382(1) provides that the parties may lodge an appeal on points of law (revizija protiv presude) against the second-instance judgment if the value of the subject matter of the dispute of the contested part of the judgment exceeds a certain amount of money (statutory threshold). The statutory threshold in commercial cases was changed as follows:
a.  Reopening of proceedings following a final judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in  finding a violation of a fundamental human right or freedom
Section 428a
“(1) When the European Court of Human Rights has found a violation of a human right or fundamental freedom guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms or additional protocols thereto ratified by the Republic of Croatia, a party may, within thirty days of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights becoming final, file a petition with the court in the Republic of Croatia which adjudicated in the first instance in the proceedings in which the decision violating the human right or fundamental freedom was rendered, to set aside the decision by which the human right or fundamental freedom was violated.
(2) The proceedings referred to in paragraph 1 of this section shall be conducted by applying, mutatis mutandis, the provisions on the reopening of proceedings.
(3) In the reopened proceedings the courts are required to respect the legal opinions expressed in the final judgment of the European Court of Human Rights finding a violation of a fundamental human right or freedom.”
In its case no. Rev 885-05-2 of 9 November 2005 the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff was not authorised to subsequently change the value of the subject matter of the dispute indicated in his statement of claim unless he also amended the action (by increasing, supplementing or replacing the initial claim).
Relevant provisions
In decision no. U-III-2646/2007 of 18 June 2008 the Constitutional Court found violations of the complainant’s constitutional rights to equality before the courts and to a fair hearing and quashed the Supreme Court’s decision declaring the appeal on points of law inadmissible ratione valoris, in a case where the plaintiff, who had brought his action in 1978, had sought payment of 48,600 German marks. The  held, inter alia:
“When the civil proceedings for payment of a relatively high amount of foreign currency have lasted thirty years, and the value of the subject matter of the dispute in [those proceedings] (which at the time the action was brought greatly exceeded the amount prescribed for admissibility of an appeal on points of law) is being determined according to the nominal amount of the domestic currency (which had become worthless due to revaluation) and not according to the real value of the amount sought, then such a long lapse of time always benefits one party. The outcome in its favour is due solely to the protracted nature of the proceedings, which upsets the other party’s equal status before the law.”
In decision no. U-III-4361/2008 of 10 June 2009 in a similar case, the  confirmed the above case-law.
The Dinar Revaluation Act (Zakon o promjeni vrijednosti dinara, Official Gazette of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia no. 83/89), which entered into force on 1 January 1990, established the new value of the Yugoslav dinar (YUD) so that one new dinar corresponded to 10,000 old dinars.
By the Decision on the Introduction of the Croatian Dinar as the Currency on the Territory of the Republic of Croatia (Odluka o uvođenju hrvatskog dinara kao sredstva plaćanja na teritoriju Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia no. 71/1991), which entered into force on 23 December 1991, the Republic of Croatia introduced its own currency, the Croatian dinar (HRD). The Yugoslav dinar (YUD) was replaced by the Croatian dinar at an exchange rate of YUD 1 to HRD 1.
On 13 May 1994 the Decision on the Termination of the Validity of the Decision on the Introduction of the Croatian Dinar as the Currency on the Territory of the Republic of Croatia and on the Manner and Time of Calculation of Sums Expressed in Croatian Dinars into Kunas and Lipas (Odluka o prestanku važenja Odluke o uvođenju hrvatskog dinara kao sredstva plaćanja na teritoriju Republike Hrvatske, te o načinu i vremenu preračunavanja iznosa izraženih u hrvatskim dinarima u kune i lipe, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia no. 37/1994) entered into force, introducing the Croatian kuna (HRK) as the currency of the Republic of Croatia. It provided that the Croatian dinar should be replaced by the Croatian kuna at an exchange rate of 1,000 dinars to one kuna.
