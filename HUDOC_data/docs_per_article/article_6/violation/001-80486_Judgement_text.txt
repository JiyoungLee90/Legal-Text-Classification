The case originated in an application (no. 56026/00) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Polish nationals Stefania Wende and Franciszek Kukówka (“the applicants”), on 4 February 2000.

On 30 March 1993 the Governor refused. The second applicant appealed against this decision.
On 20 December 1993 the Minister of Construction (Minister Gospodarki Przestrzennej i Budownictwa) dismissed the appeal. The second applicant appealed.
On 15 June 1994 the  (Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny) quashed both decisions taken in 1993.
On 31 January 1995 the Minister of Construction, having re-examined the second applicant's request, declared the 1953 expropriation decision null and void. The applicants' ownership right to the property was entered in the relevant land and mortgage register.
On 7 April 1995 the second applicant requested the Minister of Construction for compensation for the unlawful use of the property by a State-owned enterprise.
On 15 January 1996 the Minister of Construction refused the request. The applicant filed a civil action with the  (sąd wojewódzki).

The  held hearings on 5 September 1996, 17 October 1996, 6 May 1997 and 21 August 1997.
On 8 May 1998 the first applicant joined the proceedings as an intervenor (interwenient uboczny).
On 25 May 1998 the lawyer representing the State Treasury contested an expert's opinion filed in the case.
On 22 October 1998 a hearing was held.
On 26 October 1998 the defendant (the State Treasury) requested the court to order an opinion from another expert.

The hearing scheduled for 27 January 2000 was adjourned because the defendant's lawyer had failed to attend. The expert witness had informed the court that he would not be able to attend hearings scheduled before 7 February 2000 because he would abroad.
The expert witness was heard on 19 March 2000.
On 27 March 2000 the  delivered a judgment. It awarded the second applicant 103,818 zlotys (PLN) in compensation for damage actually suffered (damnum emergens), together with statutory interest payable from 11 May 1998. The court dismissed the claim for the alleged loss of profits (lucrum cessans).
On 31 March 2000 the first applicant filed a motion to supplement the judgment. On 22 September 2000 the defendant submitted its comments. On 10 October 2000 the court dismissed the first applicant's motion. She appealed. Her appeal was dismissed on 14 May 2001.
On 24 July 2000 the first applicant filed a complaint with the President of the  about the alleged excessive length of the proceedings.

On 10 July 2001 the applicants summoned the defendant to pay the compensation awarded by the . In reply, they were informed that the judgment of 27 March 2000 was not enforceable since the appellate proceedings were pending.
The applicants requested the  to provide them with an interpretation of its judgment. On 25 July 2001 the court refused that request.
Subsequently, they requested that court to add an enforcement clause to the judgment. On 21 September 2001 the court refused since the proceedings were pending before the Court of Appeal.
On 29 August 2002 the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the first-instance court, but held that interest was payable from 27 March 2000.
On 17 February 2003 the Court of Appeal attached an enforcement clause to the judgment.
The compensation was eventually paid by the State on 5 March 2003.
On 18 March 2003 the applicants lodged a request for the re-opening of the proceedings. The request was eventually refused on 26 April 2006.
On 26 October 2004 the first applicant lodged a complaint under the 2004 Act (see paragraph 37 below) with the Court of Appeal about the excessive length of the proceedings. She invoked section 18 of the 2004 Act and requested the court to “deliver a decision concerning the unreasonable length of proceedings which had lasted eight years” (since the proceedings for re-opening were still pending). She further presented the substance of the impugned proceedings and submitted that she had lodged a complaint about the length of the proceedings with the European Court of Human Rights and that the Court had communicated her complaint to the respondent Government.
On 5 November 2004 the Court of Appeal asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs whether the first applicant had lodged an application with the Court and whether an admissibility decision had been issued.
In reply to its question of 5 November 2004, on 16 November 2004 the Registry informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the first applicant's application was pending before the Court and had not been declared admissible.
On 1 December 2004 the Court of Appeal rejected the complaint without examining its merits. The court first noted that it had been informed by the Government that the first applicant's case in  had been declared inadmissible. Further, the court noted that the first applicant's complaint had not contained a request to find that there had been an unreasonable delay in the impugned proceedings. Lastly, the court considered that the applicant had failed to indicate circumstances that would justify her request, as required by section 6 of the 2004 Act. The court found that the mere fact, relied on by the applicant, that the proceedings had lasted over eight years, could not suffice to find that the proceedings had lasted longer that was necessary. Therefore, according to section 9 of the Act, the complaint had to be rejected without requiring the plaintiff to complete it.
The second applicant also lodged a length complaint with regard to the same proceedings. His complaint was examined by the same panel of judges and on the same day as the first applicant's complaint. The second applicant's complaint was partly rejected and partly dismissed. The Court of Appeal considered that the second applicant's complaint concerned two separate sets of proceedings, the original proceedings and those in which the applicant had sought to have the original proceedings re-opened. In so far as the proceedings which had ended on 29 August 2002 were concerned, the Court of Appeal found that the complaint had not been lodged while the impugned proceedings were still pending. Therefore, the second applicant had not complied with the provisions of section 5 of the 2004 Act and his complaint had therefore to be rejected. The court did not refer to the applicant's reliance on section 18 of the 2004 Act in his complaint.
On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. A party to pending proceedings may ask for the acceleration of those proceedings and/or just satisfaction for their unreasonable length under section 2 read in conjunction with section 5(1) of the 2004 Act.
Section 6 § 2 provides that a complaint must include:
1) a request to find that there was an unreasonable delay in the impugned proceedings;
2) circumstances that would justify the request.
According to section 9 of the Act, when a complaint does not meet the requirements of section 6 of the Act, it must be rejected without prior summons to the plaintiff to complete the shortcomings in the complaint.
Under section 18 of the Act, within six months after the entry into force of the Act, that is, from 17 September 2004, anyone who had lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights complaining of a violation of the 'reasonable-time' requirement contained in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was entitled to lodge a length of proceedings complaint provided for by the Act, if the application to the Court had been lodged when the proceedings were still pending and if it had not yet been declared admissible by the European Court.
Under Article 130 of the Code of Civil Procedure if a statement of case or a pleading fails to comply with formal requirements, the party shall be summoned to complete or remedy the formal shortcomings within a one-week time-limit.
