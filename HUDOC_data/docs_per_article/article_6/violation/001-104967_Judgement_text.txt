The case originated in two applications (nos. 1789/07 and 28058/07) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Serbian nationals, Ms Zorica Rašković (“the first applicant”) and Ms Dana Milunović, formerly Popović, (“the second applicant”), on 14 December 2006 and 25 June 2007 respectively.
The first applicant was represented by Ms R. Garibović, while the second applicant was represented by Ms M. Popović and Ms R. Garibović, lawyers practising in Novi Pazar. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
The applicants alleged that the State had infringed with their right from Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, due to the failure to enforce final domestic judgments rendered in their favour.
On 1 September 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The applicants, Ms Zorica Rašković and Ms Dana Milunović, were born in 1961 and 1953 respectively and live in Novi Pazar.
Both applicants were employed by Pamučna predionica DOO from Novi Pazar (hereinafter “the debtor”). On 14 January 2001 and 15 May 1996 they were respectively placed on compulsory paid leave until such time when normal production could be resumed and the debtor’s business performance had improved sufficiently.
Whilst on this leave, in accordance with the relevant domestic legislation, the applicants were entitled to a significantly reduced monthly income, as well as the payment of their pension, disability and other social security contributions.
Since the debtor failed to fulfil these obligations, the applicants brought numerous separate civil claims before the Municipal Court (Opštinski sud) in Novi Pazar (hereinafter “the Municipal Court”).
On an unspecified date the debtor’s mother company (see paragraph 62 below) proposed the Redundant Employees Programme (Program rešavanja viška zaposlenih– hereinafter “the redundancy programme”). The redundancy programme set out the criteria for determining redundant employees and, once declared redundant, provided them with two options for benefits: to receive a single redundancy payment from the employer (otpremnina); or to claim monthly unemployment benefits from the social security of the State (novčana naknada). These benefits were provided for all employees, regardless of whether they had any other outstanding claim towards the company.
On 7 October 2004 the Municipal Court ruled in favour of the applicant. On 23 December 2004 the Municipal Court supplemented this judgment, and ultimately ordered the debtor to pay to the applicant:
the monthly paid leave benefits (minimalna zarada) due from 1 August 2001 to 31 July 2004 (RSD 155,002 in all; EUR 2,400 at the relevant time2), indexed in accordance with the relevant regulations, together with statutory interest;
RSD 7,800 (EUR 100) for her legal costs; and
the pension and disability insurance contributions (“doprinosi za penzijsko i invalidsko osiguranje”) due from 1 January 1997 to 19 July 2004.
On 18 July 2005 this judgment became final.
On 24 December 2004 the applicant filed a request for its enforcement, in relation to the payment of paid leave benefits and costs, proposing that it be carried out either by means of a bank transfer or through auctioning the debtor’s specified movable and/or immovable assets.
On 24 January 2005 the Municipal Court accepted the applicant’s request and issued an enforcement order, at the same time awarding the applicant the additional amount of RSD 2,400 in respect of enforcement costs (EUR 30).

The relevant domestic law is set out in the Court’s judgments of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia (nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, 15 January 2008, §§ 57-82); Vlahović v. Serbia (no. 42619/04, §§37-47, 16 December 2008); Crnišanin and Others v. Serbia (nos. 35835/05, 43548/05, 43569/05 and 36986/06, 13 January 2009, §§100-104); and EVT Company v. Serbia (no. 3102/05, §§ 26 and 27, 21 June 2007).
In its decisions of 29 November 2009 and 4 December 2009, the Constitutional Court of Serbia (cases no. Už-95/2008 and Už-143/2007) examined the complaints of persons who had previously been employed with one of the companies within the “Raška” holding company, and whose employment had been terminated in accordance with the redundancy programme. The appellants had requested the Municipal Court to order the company to pay them monthly paid leave benefits. The Municipal Court and District Court in Novi Pazar had rejected their respective claims because, inter alia, they had already claimed their entitlement under the redundancy programme. The  found that the employees were entitled to enjoy the rights arising from both the redundancy programme and the outstanding claims from their employment, prior to its termination. Thus, the bare fact that the appellants in those cases had agreed to enjoy benefits from the redundancy programme could not be interpreted to mean that they had waived the right to the monthly paid leave benefits previously due, and the courts had to examine whether those benefits had indeed been paid or not.
