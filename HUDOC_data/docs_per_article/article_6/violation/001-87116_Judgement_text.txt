The case originated in an application (no. 20745/04) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Aleksandr Kudabertovich Isakov (“the applicant”), on 25 May 2004.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P.A. Laptev, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 12 September 2005 the Court gave notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3). The Government objected to the joint examination of the admissibility and merits, but the Court dismissed this objection.
The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Kosta Khetagurova, a village in Karachay-Cherkessia.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
In 1990 the applicant subscribed to a State savings scheme for buying a car. The State failed to provide the car, and the applicant had to apply to a court.
On 19 December 2002 the Mirninskiy District Court of Yakutia awarded the applicant 138,967 Russian roubles against the Ministry of Finance. On 5 February 2003 the judgment became binding, but was not enforced.
On 15 July 2004 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of Yakutia allowed the Ministry’s supervisory-review complaint, and quashed the judgment on the ground that the district court had misinterpreted material law.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a judgment must be enforced in two months.
