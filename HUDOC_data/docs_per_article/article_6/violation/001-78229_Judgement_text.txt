The case originated in an application (no. 31276/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Zoya Stepanovna Kolyada (“the applicant”), on 5 July 2002.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Kolomin, a lawyer practising in . The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Laptev, Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 10 January 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in the , the Minsk Region of Belarus.
The applicant is a former employee of the municipal enterprise Teplovodokanal in the town of  (Муниципальное предприятие «Управление «Тепловодоканал» г. Нерюнгри). Before her retirement she filed a claim for salary arrears with the Labour Disputes Board (Комиссия по трудовым спорам) of Teplovodokanal.
On 19 January, 3 February and 18 May 1998 the Labour Disputes Board found in the applicant's favour and awarded her salary arrears totalling 96,684.67 Russian roubles (RUR). The decisions became final immediately as no appeal lay against them. On the basis of the decisions in the applicant's favour, specific enforcement documents – certificates from the Labour Disputes Board (удостоверения Комиссии по трудовым спорам) – were issued. On 20 May 1998 the applicant forwarded the certificates to the bailiffs' service with a view to execution.
The decisions of the Labour Disputes Board of 19 January, 3 February and 18 May 1998 were enforced in full by 5 January 2001.  As their execution had been delayed, the applicant filed court claims against her former employer requesting index-linking of the awards.
On 16 March 2001 the Neryungri Town Court of the  (Yakutiya) granted her claims in part and awarded her RUR 30,084. On the same date a writ of execution was issued. Later the applicant appealed against the judgment as she was not satisfied with the amount of the award.
On 4 May 2001 the bailiffs' service instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of the writ of execution of 16 March 2001. Three days later the bailiffs' service levied execution on the debtor's account.
The judgment of 16 March 2001 was upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court of the  (Yakutiya) on 11 July 2001.
On an unspecified date the bailiffs' service closed the enforcement proceedings on the ground that the salary arrears had been paid to the applicant on the basis of the Labour Disputes Board certificates.
On 27 April 2002 the Neryungri Prosecutor's Office informed the applicant that it had submitted a request for supervisory review of the bailiffs' service's decision to close the enforcement proceedings, since they concerned not the payment of the salary arrears, but their index-linking pursuant to the judgment of 16 March 2001.
The enforcement proceedings were reopened on 1 March 2006.
On 9 March 2006 the bailiffs' service transferred the sum of RUR 30,084 to the applicant by postal order.
The enforcement proceedings were closed on 4 May 2006.
On 17 May 2006 the post office transferred the sum of RUR 30,084 back to the sender because the applicant had refused to take receipt of it.
On 7 July 2006 the bailiffs' service again transferred the sum of RUR 30,084 to the applicant by postal order. It appears that the applicant again refused to accept it.
