The case originated in an application (no. 37075/97) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Austrian national, Mr Heinz Luksch (“the applicant”), on 28 May 1997.
The applicant was represented before the Court by Mrs S. Schubert, a lawyer practising in Vienna. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Winkler, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged in particular, that disciplinary proceedings against him lasted unreasonably long.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 21 November 2000 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
As of 1 November 2001 the application was allocated to the First Section of the Court. Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was an accountant by profession. He retired in 1998. On 2 April 1986 the Chamber of Accountants instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant. Subsequently, the proceedings were adjourned having regard to criminal proceedings pending against the applicant.
On 14 April 1986 the applicant was convicted of aggravated fraud by the Vienna Regional Criminal Court (Landesgericht für Strafsachen), which conviction was confirmed by the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) on 3 October 1988. By the end of 1990 the file relating to the criminal proceedings reached the Disciplinary Court and on 8 November 1991 the hearing date was set down for 8 May 1992.
On 8 May 1992 the Disciplinary Court of the Chamber of Accountants, having regard to the applicant’s conviction, found that he had infringed the profession’s reputation and ordered the suspension of the applicant’s right to practise for one year.
On 19 October 1992 the applicant appealed this decision. On 7 May 1993 the Appeals Board dismissed the appeal stating that the suspension should last for one year. This decision was served on 30 January 1995.
On 15 March 1995 the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) refused to deal with the applicant’s complaint and transferred the case to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof).
On 30 March 1995 the Chamber of Accountants declared the suspension to be effective from 31 January 1995 to 30 January 1996.
On 17 May 1995 the Administrative Court granted the applicant’s complaint suspensive effect. On 28 February 1997 it dismissed the complaint. The decision was served on 22 March 1997.
