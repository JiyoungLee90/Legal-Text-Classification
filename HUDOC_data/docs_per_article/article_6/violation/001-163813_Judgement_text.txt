The case originated in two applications (nos. 7873/09 and 8174/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Israeli nationals, Mrs Khayka Grigoryevna Sheyman (“the first applicant”) and Mr Yuriy Petrovich Sheyman (“the second applicant”), on 29 December 2008.
Both applicants were represented by Mr R.A. Zarbeyev, a lawyer practising in St Petersburg. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation tо the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants complained, inter alia, of the quashing of a binding and enforceable judgment in their favour by way of supervisory review procedure.
The applications were communicated to the Government on 12 May 2009 and 17 November 2009 respectively.
The applicants, who are husband and wife, were born in 1932 and 1926, respectively, and live in Bat-Yam, Israel.
In 1990s the applicants emigrated from the USSR to Israel and obtained Israeli nationality. Before emigrating, they were receiving old-age pensions from the Soviet authorities. Once the applicants left the USSR, the payments were discontinued in accordance with the USSR pension law in force at the material time.
On 4 August 2006 the applicants brought civil proceedings against the competent regional department of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation (Пенсионный Фонд Российской Федерации) (hereinafter “the Pension Fund”) seeking reinstatement of their right to the pension payments.
On 4 December 2006 the Kirovskiy District Court of Astrakhan found in the applicants’ favour and ordered the Pension Fund to set up monthly pension payments backdated to 15 June 1998.
On 12 January 2007 the Astrakhan Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal and it became binding and enforceable.
On 10 July 2007 the Pension Fund lodged an application for supervisory review, seeking to have the judgments quashed. The application was addressed to the President of the Supreme Court.
On 27 July 2007 a judge of the Supreme Court requested the case file from the District Court and subsequently suspended enforcement of the judgment of 4 December 2006.
On 4 December 2007 another judge of the Supreme Court sent the case for supervisory review to the Astrakhan Regional Court.
On 22 January 2008 the Astrakhan Regional Court dismissed the supervisory review application and endorsed the judgment of 4 December 2006, as upheld on 12 January 2007.
On 8 April 2008 the Pension Fund lodged another application for supervisory review, again addressed to the President of the Supreme Court.
On 24 June 2008 a judge of the Supreme Court sent the case for supervisory review by the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court.
On 1 August 2008 the Civil Chamber of Supreme Court quashed the judgment of 4 December 2006, as upheld on 12 January 2007, and rejected the applicants’ claims.
The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure between 1 February 2003 and 7 January 2008 is summed up in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007). At that time, a supervisory review application could be lodged within one year of the date when the challenged judgments became binding and enforceable.
As regards the supervisory review procedure in force since 7 January 2008, the relevant domestic provisions are summed up in the Court’s decision in the case of Martynets v. Russia ((dec.), no. 29612/09, 5 November 2009). In particular, the new provisions reduced the time-limit for challenging binding and enforceable judgments by way of supervisory review from one year to six months.
On 16 December 2008, in its decision no. 1054-O-П, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation clarified the fact that the new provisions of the Russian Code of Civil Procedure introducing the sixmonth time-limit for lodging a supervisory application did not prevent the supervisory-review courts from examining on the merits supervisory review applications lodged outside of this time-limit concerning judgments which had become binding prior to 8 January 2008 and had been introduced before the expiry of the one-year time-limit in force at that time (but in any event not later than 8 July 2008).
On 21 July 2011 the Presidium of the Rostov Regional Court examined Mrs Shinkova’s application. The application had been lodged following the judgment delivered in the case of Eydelman and other “Emigrant pensioners” v. Russia, (nos. 7319/05, 9992/07, 10359/07, 13476/07, 3565/08, 10628/08, 33904/08, 33918/08, 40058/08, 42112/08, 42115/08, and 60792/08, 4 November 2010) in which the Court had found violations of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention on account of the quashing of domestic judgments regarding the applicants’ entitlement to a pension despite their living abroad. The Presidium found that the quashing of a domestic judgment in the applicant’s favour had not been justified. It reversed the judgment and accordingly reinstated her entitlement to a pension.
On 27 July and 3 August 2011 the Presidium of the Moscow Regional Court delivered a similar judgment in respect of other applicants in the case of Eydelman and other “Emigrant pensioners”, cited above.
