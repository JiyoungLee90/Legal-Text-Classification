The case originated in an application (no. 19441/03) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Ukrainian nationals, Mr Vladimir and Mrs Valentina Rudenko (“the applicants”), on 14 March 2003.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Y. Zaytsev, their Agent, and Mrs I. Shevchuk, Head of the Office of the Government Agent before the European Court of Human Rights.
On 30 May 2006 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning non-enforcement of judgments to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants, husband and wife, live in Dniprodzerzhynsk.
In August 2000 the applicants instituted civil proceedings in the Zavodsky District Court of Dniprodzerzhynsk (Заводський районний суд м. Дніпродзержинська) against their employer, the municipally owned Public Transportation Company (“the PTC”; Комунальне експлуатаційне підприємство “Дніпродзержинськміськелектротранс”) for salary arrears and compensation for a delay in the payment of salary.
On 31 August 2000 the court awarded 4,004.55 hryvnyas (UAH) to the first and UAH 3,323 to the second applicant in salary arrears and compensation.
Subsequently the applicants lodged similar claims and on 4 April 2001 the court additionally awarded UAH 2,511.83 to the first and UAH 1,539.94 to the second applicant in salary arrears and compensation.
The judgments became final and the enforcement writs were transferred to the Zavodsky District Bailiffs' Service (“the Bailiffs”; Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Заводського районного управління юстиції в м. Дніпродзержинську) for enforcement.
On 29 October 2001 the Bailiffs informed the applicants that the PTC lacked funds and that no buyers were interested in acquiring its assets.
In January 2002 the Bailiffs proposed that the PTC's property (trams, technical equipment and an administrative building) be transferred to the creditors.
Having received no positive response from the applicants, on 26 June 2002 the Bailiffs returned the enforcement writs to them unenforced.
On 17 June 2003 the  (Господарський суд Дніпропетровської області) declared the PTC bankrupt and ordered its liquidation.
The PTC paid the salary arrears due to the applicants in several instalments. However, the compensations for a delay in the payment of salary awarded by all four judgments in the amounts of UAH 639.38 in favour of the first and UAH 673.94 in favour of the second applicant remain outstanding.
The relevant domestic law is set out in the judgment of 27 July 2004 in the case of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-19).
