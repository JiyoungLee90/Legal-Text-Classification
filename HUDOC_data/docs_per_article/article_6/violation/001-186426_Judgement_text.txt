The case originated in an application (no. 14099/15) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia, Mr Mirso Kaltak (“the applicant”), on 3 March 2015.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Dujaković, a lawyer practising in Banja Luka. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms B. Skalonjić.
On 12 December 2016 the application was communicated to the Government. Further to the notification under Article 36 § 1 of the Convention, the Slovenian Government did not wish to exercise their right to intervene in the present case.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Sanski Most.
By a judgment of the Banja Luka Court of First Instance of 23 May 2005, which became final on 11 September 2007, the Republika Srpska (an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina) was ordered to pay the applicant 42,767 convertible marks (BAM) on account of pecuniary damage together with default interest calculated from 23 May 2005 until final payment.
On 1 February 2010 the applicant submitted a request for the issuance of the writ of execution in his case, which request he amended on 30 August 2010.
On 18 October 2010 the applicant submitted a request for the acceleration of the proceedings before the Banja Luka Court of First Instance.
On 15 November 2010 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance issued the writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju).
On 18 March 2011 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance rejected the objections against its decision of 15 November 2010, as well as the applicant’s request for the payment of the costs of the enforcement proceedings.
On 31 May 2011 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance made certain corrections to its decision of 18 March 2011.
On 15 December 2011 the Banja Luka Court of Second Instance quashed the decision of the Banja Luka Court of First Instance of 18 March 2011 and remitted the case for reconsideration.
On 26 March 2012 the applicant submitted a request for the acceleration of the proceedings before the Banja Luka Court of First Instance.
On 12 April 2012 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance partially granted the objection of the Republika Srpska against the writ of execution.
On 23 April 2012 the applicant appealed the decision of the Banja Luka Court of First Instance of 12 April 2012. On 11 June, 13 July, and 21 November 2012, and on 15 January 2013 the applicant submitted further requests for the acceleration of the proceedings before the Banja Luka Court of Second Instance.
On 21 January 2013 the Banja Luka Court of Second Instance rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of 12 April 2012.
On 7 October 2014 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ruled in favour of the applicant that the enforcement proceedings before the Banja Luka Court of First Instance had not been finalised within a reasonable time. It further ordered the Banja Luka Court of First Instance to urgently expedite the enforcement proceedings in the applicant’s case. The Constitutional Court considered this to be sufficient just satisfaction and rejected the applicant’s claim for non-pecuniary damage.
On 8 November 2016 the final decision in question was enforced in cash, regarding the principal amount and the statutory default interests. On 5 July 2017 the costs of the enforcement proceedings and related statutory default interests were also fully paid to the applicant.
