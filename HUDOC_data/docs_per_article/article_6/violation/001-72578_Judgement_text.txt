The case originated in an application (no. 35132/02) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Ivan Ivanovych Berestovyy (“the applicant”), on 27 June 2001.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs V. Lutkovska.
On 9 September 2004 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in the town of Chervonograd, Lviv region, Ukraine.
On 8 February 2001 the Chervonogradskyy Town Court of the Lviv Region awarded the applicant UAH 23,351, UAH 4,553.56 and UAH 50 in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, and for legal aid respectively, against the State Mining Enterprise No. 7 “Velykomostivska”.
