The case is still pending before the first-instance court.

The applicant had lodged four requests for withdrawal of the judges. Between May 2004 and February 2006 four hearings were scheduled, none of which was held. Between 25 December 2006 and 14 November 2007 three hearings were scheduled and two hearings were held at intervals of approximately five months.
