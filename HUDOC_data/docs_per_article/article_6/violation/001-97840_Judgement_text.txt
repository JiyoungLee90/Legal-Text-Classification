In any event, the applicant could lodge an application under Article 34 of the Convention with the European Court of Human Rights, whereby he could obtain compensation.

Section 109 of the Social Courts Act, in the version in force at the relevant time, reads as follows:
“(1) On request by ... the person entitled to benefits ..., a particular physician has to be heard as an expert. The hearing of this expert may be made dependant on the person who is making the request advancing the costs and, unless the court decides otherwise, the person making the request bearing the costs in the end.
(2) The court may reject a request if its admission would delay the settlement of the legal dispute and if the court is convinced that the request was submitted in an attempt to delay the proceedings or was not submitted earlier due to gross negligence.”
In view of the requirements of § 2 of this provision, domestic courts in practice rarely reject a request to hear another expert.
The relevant part of section 1 § 1 of the Victims Compensation Act, in its version in force at the relevant time, reads as follows:
“(1) A person who ... has sustained damage to his health attributable to an intentional and unlawful attack upon himself ... shall, on application, be granted benefits in accordance with the provisions of the Federal War Victims Relief Act in respect of resulting health impairments and financial loss.“
