The case originated in an application (no. 42260/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Dániel Kustár (“the applicant”), on 16 November 2005.

On 19 March 1999 the applicant brought an action against a cooperative of which he was an external shareholder. He claimed that a resolution of the cooperative establishing the value of his share was wrong.
On 11 December 2001 the Kunszentmiklós District Court dismissed his action. On 31 January 2002 it completed this decision with a ruling concerning the costs.
On appeal, on 3 October 2002 the  reversed these decisions, found for the applicant in an interim decision and quashed the resolution in question. In the ensuing proceedings, on 17 March 2004 the District Court awarded the applicant 258,000 Hungarian forints plus accrued interest. On 2 September 2004 the  upheld this ruling in a partial decision.
