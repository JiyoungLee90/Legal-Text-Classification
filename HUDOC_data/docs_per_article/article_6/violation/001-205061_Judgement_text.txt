The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Diyarbakır. The applicant was represented by Ms İpek Ulaş, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır.
The Government were represented by their Agent.
The Government did not object to the examination of the application by a Committee.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The applicant was taken into custody on 22 June 2004 and the following day he had given incriminatory statements concerning his involvement in the activities of the terrorist organisation in the absence of a lawyer as, according to his statement form, he did not ask for a lawyer. His subsequent statements had been taken in the presence of a lawyer and had not been incriminatory. At a hearing held on 22 February 2005 the applicant’s lawyer submitted that despite his requests he had not been allowed to take part in the applicant’s police interview.
Relying on, inter alia, the applicant’s police statements and without subjecting them to scrutiny and examining their inadmissibility or the circumstances surrounding his waiver, the trial court convicted him under Article 125 of the former Criminal Code of breaking up the unity of the State and seeking to remove part of the national territory from the State’s control, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. On 15 April 2010 the Court of Cassation upheld that judgment.
The relevant domestic law in force at the material time, as well as case-law of the Constitutional Court on the issue of waiver of the right to a lawyer, may be found in Ruşen Bayar v. Turkey, (no. 25253/08, §§ 416, 19 February 2019).
