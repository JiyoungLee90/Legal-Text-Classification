The case originated in an application (no. 15495/10) against Montenegro lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by sixteen applicants, on 15 March 2010. Their further personal details are set out in the appendix to this judgment.
All the applicants were initially represented by Ms L. Božović, who was later substituted by Mr Ž. Braletić, a lawyer practicing in Podgorica. The Montenegrin Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms V. Pavličić.
On 3 December 2014 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
At the relevant time all applicants were employed in a company called Kombinat aluminijuma Podgorica.
On 4 November 2003, 5 November 2003, and 28 January 2004 the applicants brought separate civil claims against their employer in the First Instance Court in Podgorica, seeking payments of the difference between the salaries which they had received and those which they had allegedly been entitled to on the basis of the Collective Labour Agreement (Kolektivni ugovor o radu).
On 7 March 2009 the first instance court in Podgorica joined and dismissed the applicants’ cases.
On 26 March 2009 the applicants lodged an appeal with the High Court in Podgorica. On 25 September 2009 the High Court upheld the decision of the first instance court.
