The case originated in three applications (nos. 14019/07, 46287/07 and 19387/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Turkish nationals, Mr Ramazan Keloğlan, Mr Gökhan Yıldırım and Mr Tarık Kuruldak (“the applicants”), on 19 March 2007, 10 October 2007 and 10 April 2008, respectively.
The applicants were represented by Mr İ. Çetin, Mr K. Bilgiç and Mr R. Hallaçoğlu and Mr N. K. Tüylüce, lawyers practising in Ankara, Kocaeli and , respectively. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 26 May 2009 the Court declared the applications partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the infringement of the right to adversarial proceedings and the principle of equality of arms on account of the lack of access to classified documents submitted by the Ministry of Defence to the Supreme Military Administrative Court.
The applicants, who are former military students, were born in 1988, 1987 and 1991 respectively and live in Ankara, Kocaeli and .
On different dates the applicants were expelled from military schools following disciplinary decisions, which held that the applicants did not possess the requisite attributes of a military student as defined in the relevant legislations. The applicants were not provided with any further information regarding the reasons for their expulsions.
The applicants subsequently brought separate actions before the  against the Ministry of Defence, requesting this court to quash the disciplinary decisions ordering their expulsions.
The Ministry of Defence submitted certain documents and information to the  during the course of the proceedings, which were classified as “secret documents” under Article 52 (4) of Law no. 1602 on the . These documents were not disclosed to the applicants.
On 27 September 2006, 22 November 2006 and 3 October 2007, respectively, the  rejected the applicants’ request. The judgment of 3 October 2007 was served on the third applicant on 25 October 2007. Citing the relevant legislation, the Supreme Military Administrative Court held that a student could be lawfully expelled from a military school by a disciplinary board decision if he was found to have lost the attributes of a military student during the course of his studies or if it became apparent at such time that he did not possess the necessary qualifications from the start. The applicants, who were found to lack the requisite attributes of a military student following a secret security investigation conducted on them and their families, were thus lawfully expelled from their schools.
On 15 November 2006 and 12 September 2007, respectively, the  rejected the first and second applicants’ rectification request. The third applicant did not seek rectification.
A description of the relevant domestic law can be found in the decision of Karayiğit v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 45874/05, 23 September 2008).
