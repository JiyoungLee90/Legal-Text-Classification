The case originated in an application (no. 18726/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Ion Nadulişneac (“the applicant”), on 8 April 2004.
The applicant was represented by Mr Victor Marcu, a lawyer practising in Edineţ. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr Vitalie Pârlog.
The applicant complained that the failure to enforce a final judgment in his favour had violated his right to have his civil rights determined by a court as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention and his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 14 February 2006 the President of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on admissibility, merits and just satisfaction.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Edineţ.
Following the applicant's unlawful detention for three days and then his acquittal, on an unspecified date in 2002 he brought an action against the Edineţ Department of Finances, seeking compensation for wrongful prosecution.
On 3 December 2002 the Edineţ District Court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant to pay him 11,739 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 850.04 euros (EUR) at the time). On the same date the District Court issued an enforcement warrant. The judgment was not appealed against and after fifteen days it became final and enforceable.
On 11 June 2003 a Bailiff of the Edineţ District sent the enforcement warrant to a Bailiff of the Râşcani District.
In May 2006, after the case had been communicated to the Government, the judgment was enforced.
The relevant domestic law was set out in Prodan v. Moldova (no. 49806/99, ECHR 2004III (extracts)) and Popov v. Moldova (no. 1) (no. 74153/01, §§ 29-41, 18 January 2005).
The Civil Code of 12 June 2003 reads as follows:
