The case originated in an application (no. 36813/97) against the Italian Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Italian nationals, Mr Giovanni, Ms Elena, Ms Maria and Ms Giuliana Scordino (“the applicants), on 21 July 1993.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
Having been designated by the initials G.S. and Others, the applicants subsequently agreed to the disclosure of their names. They were represented by Mr N. Paoletti, a lawyer practising in . The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr I.M. Braguglia, and co-Agent, Mr F. Crisafulli.
On 1 November 2001 the Court modified the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1 of the Rules of Court). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section. Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules. Mr V. Zagregelsky, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mrs M. del Tufo to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).
The case concerns the proceedings brought following the expropriation of the applicants' land. Relying on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 6 of the Convention, the applicants complained in particular of a violation of their rights to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions and a fair trial.
A hearing which dealt both with issues of admissibility and the merits took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 March 2003 (Rule 54 § 3).
There appeared before the Court:
By a decision of 27 March 2003 the Chamber declared the application admissible.
The applicants, but not the Government, submitted written observations on the merits of the case, (Rule 59 § 1). On 4 February 2004 the Government submitted a request for the application to be declared inadmissible in the light of a judgment delivered by the Italian Court of Cassation on 26 January 2004.

THE FACTS
The applicants inherited from Mr A. Scordino several plots of land in , entered in the land register as folio 111, parcels 105, 107, 109 and 662. On 25 March 1970 Reggio di Calabria District Council adopted a general development plan, which was approved by the Calabria Regional Council on 17 March 1975
The land in issue in the instant case, an area of 1,786 sq. m designated as parcel 109, was made subject to an expropriation permit under the general development plan with a view to the construction of housing on the land. The land was subsequently included in the zonal development plan approved by the  region on 20 June 1979.
In 1980 Reggio di Calabria District Council decided that a cooperative society, Edilizia Aquila, would carry out building work on the land in question. In a decision of 13 March 1981 the administrative authorities granted the cooperative permission to occupy the land.
On 30 March 1982, pursuant to Law no. 385/1980, Reggio di Calabria District Council offered an advance on the compensation payable for the expropriation that had been determined in accordance with Law no. 865/1971. The sum offered, 606,560 Italian lire (ITL), was calculated according to the rules in force for agricultural land, using a value of ITL 340 per square metre as a basis, with the proviso that the final amount of compensation would be determined once a law had been enacted laying down new compensation criteria for building land.
The offer was refused by Mr A. Scordino.
On 21 March 1983 the Regional Council issued an expropriation order in respect of the land.
On 13 June 1983 the District Council made a second offer of an advance, this time amounting to ITL 785,000. The offer was not accepted.
In judgment no. 223, delivered on 15 July 1983, the  declared Law no. 385/1980 unconstitutional on the ground that it made the award of compensation subject to the enactment of a future law.
As a result of that judgment, Law no. 2359/1865, which provided that compensation for expropriation should correspond to the market value of the land in question, came back into force.
On 10 August 1984 Mr A. Scordino served formal notice on the District Council to determine the final amount of compensation in accordance with Law no. 2359/1865. On 16 November 1989 he learned that Reggio di Calabria District Council had assessed the final amount at ITL 88,414,940 (ITL 50,000 per square metre) in an order of 6 October 1989.
Proceedings for the award of compensation for the expropriation
On 25 May 1990, contesting the amount of compensation he had been awarded, Mr A. Scordino brought proceedings against the District Council and the cooperative in the  Court of Appeal.
He argued that the amount determined by the District Council was ridiculously low in relation to the market value of the land and requested, among other things, to have the compensation calculated in accordance with Law no. 2359/1865. He also sought compensation for the period during which the land had been occupied before the expropriation order had been issued, and for the area of land (1,500 sq. m) that had become unusable as a result of the building work.
Preparation of the case for hearing began on 7 January 1991.
The cooperative gave notice of its intention to defend and raised an objection, arguing that it could not be considered as a party to the proceedings.
On 4 February 1991, as the District Council had still not given notice of its intention to defend, the  Court of Appeal declared it to be in default and ordered an expert assessment of the land. In an order of 13 February 1991 an expert was appointed and was given three months in which to submit his report.
On 6 May 1991 the District Council gave notice of its intention to defend and raised an objection, arguing that it could not be considered a party to the proceedings. The expert agreed to his terms of reference and was sworn in.
On 4 December 1991 an expert report was filed.
On 8 August 1992 Law no. 359/1992 came into force. Section 5 bis of the Law laid down new criteria for calculating compensation for the expropriation of building land. The Law was expressly applicable to pending proceedings.
Following Mr A. Scordino's death on 30 November 1992, the applicants joined the proceedings on 18 September 1993.
On 4 October 1993 the  Court of Appeal appointed another expert and instructed him to assess the compensation for the expropriation according to the new criteria laid down in section 5 bis of Law no. 359/1992.
The expert's report was filed on 24 March 1994, concluding that the land's market value on the date of the expropriation had been ITL 165,755 per square metre. In accordance with the new criteria laid down in section 5 bis of Law no. 359/1992, the compensation due was ITL 82,890 per square metre.
At the hearing on 11 April 1994 the parties asked for time to submit comments on the expert's report. Counsel for the applicants produced a separate expert opinion and observed that the expert appointed by the court had omitted to calculate the compensation for the 1,500 sq. m of land that were not covered by the expropriation order but had become unusable as a result of the building work.
A hearing was held on 6 June 1994 at which observations were submitted in reply. The next hearing, scheduled for 4 July 1994, was adjourned by the court of its own motion until 3 October 1994 and then until 10 November 1994.
In an order of 29 December 1994 the court ordered a further expert assessment and adjourned the proceedings until 6 March 1995. However, the hearing was subsequently adjourned on several occasions as the investigating judge was unavailable. At the applicants' request, the investigating judge was replaced on 29 February 1996 and the parties made their submissions at a hearing on 20 March 1996.
In a judgment of 17 July 1996 the Reggio di Calabria Court of Appeal held that the applicants were entitled to compensation calculated according to section 5 bis of Law no. 359/1992, both for the land that had been formally expropriated and for the land that had become unusable as a result of the building work. It also held that the compensation thus determined should not be subject to the further 40% statutory deduction applicable where the owner of the expropriated land had not signed an agreement for its transfer (cessione volontaria), seeing that in the applicants' case the land had already been expropriated when the law had come into force.
In conclusion, the Court of Appeal ordered the District Council and the cooperative to pay the applicants:
(a)  ITL 148,041,540 (ITL 82,890 per square metre for 1,786 sq. m of land) in compensation for the expropriation;
(b)  ITL 91,774,043 (ITL 75,012.50 per square metre for 1,223.45 sq. m) in compensation for the part of the land that had become unusable and was to be regarded as having been de facto expropriated; and
(c)  compensation for the period during which the land had been occupied prior to its expropriation.
Those amounts were to be index-linked and interest was payable on them until the date of settlement.
On 20 December 1996 the cooperative appealed on points of law, arguing that it could not be considered as a party to the proceedings. On 20 and 31 January 1997 respectively the applicants and the District Council likewise appealed.
On 30 June 1997 the cooperative applied for a stay of execution of the Court of Appeal's judgment. That application was dismissed on 8 August 1997.
In a judgment of 3 August 1998, deposited with the registry on 7 December 1998, the Court of Cassation allowed the cooperative's appeal, acknowledging that it could not take part in the proceedings as it had not formally been a party to the expropriation, although it had benefited from it. It upheld the remainder of the  Court of Appeal's judgment.
In the meantime, on 18 June 1997, the amount awarded by the Court of Appeal had been deposited at the national bank. On 30 September 1997 tax was deducted from the compensation at a rate of 20% in accordance with Law no. 413/1991.
The date on which the applicants actually received the compensation is not known.
The Pinto Act
On 18 April 2002 the applicants applied to the  Court of Appeal, claiming compensation under the Pinto Act for the length of the proceedings.
They sought redress for non-pecuniary and pecuniary damage.
In a decision of 1 July 2002 the  Court of Appeal awarded the applicants an aggregate sum of 2,450 euros (EUR) for non-pecuniary damage only and ordered the parties to pay their own costs.
The applicants did not appeal on points of law. The Court of Appeal's judgment became final on 26 October 2003.
As regards the complaint concerning the length of proceedings
The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the admissibility decision (Scordino v. Italy, no. 36813/97, ECHR 2003-IV).
Subsequently, on an appeal against a decision delivered by a court of appeal in “Pinto” proceedings, the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, affirmed in its judgment no. 1340 of 26 January 2004 the principle that “the determination of non-pecuniary damage by courts of appeal in accordance with section 2 of Law no. 89/2001, although inherently done on an equitable basis, must move within the confines of a legally defined context since regard must be made to the amounts awarded in similar cases by the Strasbourg Court.”
As regards the expropriation
Section 39 of Law no. 2359/1865 provided that where land was expropriated, the compensation to be paid should correspond to its market value at the time of the expropriation.
Article 42 of the Constitution, as interpreted by the  (see, among other authorities, judgment no. 138 of 6 December 1977), guarantees the payment of compensation for expropriation, in an amount lower than the market value of the land.
Law no. 865/1971 laid down new criteria: compensation for any land, whether it was agricultural or building land, should be paid as though it were agricultural land.
In judgment no. 5/1980 the  declared Law no. 865/1971 unconstitutional on the ground that it afforded the same treatment to two very different situations by providing for the same form of compensation for building and agricultural land.
In order to remedy the situation, Parliament enacted Law no. 385 of 29 July 1980, which reaffirmed, but this time on a provisional basis, the criteria that had been declared unconstitutional. The Law provided that compensation should be paid in the form of an advance, to be supplemented by a payment calculated on the basis of a subsequent law that would lay down specific compensation criteria for building land.
In judgment no. 223 of 15 July 1983 the  declared Law no. 385/1980 unconstitutional on the ground that it made the award of compensation for the expropriation of building land subject to the enactment of a future law.
As a result of that judgment, Law no. 2359/1865 came back into force. Consequently, the compensation payable for building land was to correspond to the land's market value (see, for example, Court of Cassation, Section I, judgment no. 13479 of 13 December 1991, and Section I, judgment no. 2180 of 22 February 1992).
Legislative Decree no. 333 of 11 July 1992, which became Law no. 359 of 8 August 1992, introduced (in section 5 bis) a “temporary, exceptional and urgent” measure aimed at stabilising public finances, to remain valid until structural measures were adopted. That provision applied to any pending proceedings.
Section 5 bis provides that the compensation payable for the expropriation of building land is to be calculated using the following formula: market value of the land plus the total of annual ground rent multiplied by the last ten years, divided by two, minus a 40% deduction.
In such cases the compensation corresponds to 30% of the market value. That amount is subject to tax, deducted at source at a rate of 20% (in accordance with section 11 of Law no. 413/1991).
The 40% deduction can be avoided if the basis for the expropriation is not an expropriation order but a “voluntary agreement” for the transfer of the land or, as in the instant case, if the expropriation took place before section 5 bis came into force (see the Constitutional Court's judgment no. 283 of 16 June 1993). In such cases, the resulting compensation corresponds to 50% of the market value. Again, that amount is subject to tax at a rate of 20% (see paragraph 54 above).
The Constitutional Court has held section 5 bis of Law no. 359/1992 and its retrospective application to be compatible with the Constitution (judgment no. 283 of 16 June 1993, and judgment no. 442 of 16 December 1993) on account of the urgent and temporary nature of the Law.
The Code of Expropriation Provisions (Presidential Decree no. 327 of 2001, subsequently modified by Legislative Decree no. 302 of 2002), which came into force on 30 June 2003, codified the existing provisions relating to expropriation and the principles established by the relevant case-law.
Article 37 of the Code reiterates the main criteria for calculating compensation for expropriation provided for in section 5 bis of Law no. 359/1992.
