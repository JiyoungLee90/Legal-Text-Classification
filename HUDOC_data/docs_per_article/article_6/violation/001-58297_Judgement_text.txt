The case was referred to the Court, as established under former Article 19 of the Convention,3 by the Italian Government (“the Government”) on 23 July 1998, within the three-month period laid down by former Articles 32 § 1 and 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 35265/97) against the Italian Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former
Article 25 by an Italian national, Mr A.P., on 30 June 1993. The applicant asked the Court not to reveal his identity.
The Government’s application referred to former Articles 44 and 48 as amended by Protocol No. 9, which Italy had ratified, and to the declaration whereby Italy recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (former Article 46). The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
As President of the Chamber which had originally been constituted (former Article 43 of the Convention and Rule 21 of former Rules of Court B) in order to deal, in particular, with procedural matters that might arise before the entry into force of Protocol No. 11, Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, Vice-President of the Court at the time, acting through the Registrar, consulted Mr U. Leanza, the Agent of the Government, the applicant and Mr. B. Conforti, the Delegate of the Commission, on the organisation of the written procedure. Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 17 November 1998 and the Government’s memorial on 18 November 1998.
After the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with Article 5 § 5 thereof and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present case and the cases of Bottazzi, Di Mauro, A.L.M. and Ferrari v. Italy were referred to the same Grand Chamber of the Court. The Grand Chamber included ex officio Mr Conforti, the judge elected in respect of Italy (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 24 § 4 of the Rules of Court), Mr L. Wildhaber, the President of the Court, Mrs E. Palm, Vice-President of the Court, and Mr J.P. Costa and Mr M. Fischbach, Vice-Presidents of Sections (Article 27 § 3 of the Convention and Rule 24 §§ 3 and 5 (a)). The other members appointed to complete the Grand Chamber were Mr A. Pastor Ridruejo, Mr G. Bonello, Mr J. Makarczyk, Mr P. Kūris, Mr R. Türmen, Mrs V. Strážnická, Mr P. Lorenzen, Mr V. Butkevych, Mrs H. S. Greve, Mr A. Baka, Mr R. Maruste and Mrs S. Botoucharova (Rule 24 § 3 and Rule 100 § 4). Subsequently Mr Conforti, who had taken part in the Commission’s examination of the case, withdrew from sitting in the Grand Chamber (Rule 28). Later the Government appointed Mr L. Ferrari Bravo, the judge elected in respect of San Marino, to sit in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).
The President decided that it was not necessary to invite the Commission to nominate a delegate in the case (Rule 99).
After consulting the Agent of the Government and the applicant, the Grand Chamber decided that it was not necessary to hold a hearing.
On 4 January 1999 the Registrar received additional observations from the applicant.
Subsequently Mrs Palm replaced Mr Wildhaber, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case, as President of the Grand Chamber, and Mr W. Fuhrmann, substitute judge, replaced him as a member of the Chamber (Rules 10 and 24 § 5 (b)). Mrs F. Tulkens and Mr J. Casadevall, substitute judges, replaced Mr Kūris and Mr Makarczyk, who were likewise unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 24 § 5 (b)).
The applicant, who was born in Codroipo (Udine) in 1952, lives in Biauzzo di Codroipo (Udine).
In an order of 19 January 1990 the President of the Udine District Court ordered M.L.D. to pay the applicant a sum of money in consideration of the latter’s performance of a business contract. On 19 February 1990 M.L.D. appealed to the same court against that order.
The preparation of the case for trial began on 30 April 1990, on which date the applicant requested a declaration that the order of 19 January 1990 could be enforced in the meantime. The judge in charge of preparing the case for trial rejected that application on 8 May 1990. Four investigative hearings – held between 1 October 1990 and 17 July 1991 – were devoted exclusively to examining requests for evidence to be admitted and, inter alia, witnesses to be examined. The examination of witnesses listed for 17 March 1992 was adjourned by the court to 5 May 1992, on which date six people gave evidence. The next hearing was set down for 14 December 1992, but the applicant succeeded in having it brought forward to 26 October 1992. After one further hearing, the parties lodged their final pleadings on 21 December 1992 and the judge in charge of preparing the case for trial set it down for final oral submissions before the relevant division of the court on 19 May 1994. However, the hearing was adjourned, first to 9 February 1995 because the parties had failed to appear, and then to 19 October 1995 at the request of both parties because they were trying to reach a friendly settlement.
In a judgment of that date, the text of which was deposited with the court registry on 28 November 1995, the court granted the applicant’s claims in part.
Mr A.P. applied to the Commission on 30 June 1993. He complained that his case had not been heard within a reasonable time as required by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The Commission (First Chamber) declared the application (no. 35265/97) admissible on 9 December 1997. In its report of 10 March 1998 (former Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1.
The Government asked the Court to hold that there had not been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The applicant asked the Court to hold that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 and to award him just satisfaction.
