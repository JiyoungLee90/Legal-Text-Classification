The case originated in an application (no. 24291/08) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Serbian nationals, Mr Branko Klikovac, Mr Milovan Bačanac and Mr Radovan Vasić (“the applicants”), on 3 May 2008.
All the applicants were initially represented by Mr S. Krstić, a lawyer practising in Kraljevo. On 27 September 2011 he informed the Court that he was no longer representing Mr Branko Klikovac and Mr Milovan Bačanac. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 29 June 2010 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants were born in 1942, 1953 and 1949 respectively and live in Kraljevo.
On 10 November 2004 the Kraljevo District Court (“the District Court”) ordered “MAGNOHROM d.o.o.” (“the debtor”), a company from Kraljevo, to pay the applicants in solidum 1,504,924 Serbian dinars (“RSD”) together with statutory interest and legal costs. This judgment became final on 6 July 2006.
On 2 February 2007 the applicants filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment proposing that it be carried out through the auctioning of the debtor’s specified immovable assets.
On 6 February 2007 the Kraljevo Municipal Court (“the Municipal Court”) issued a writ of execution (rešenje o izvršenju). The debtor appealed against that decision arguing that it was going through the process of restructuring as well as that the value of the impugned immovable assets exceeded the value of the applicants’ claims. On 9 March 2007 the District Court dismissed the appeal.
On an unspecified date 60 other enforcement claims submitted against the same debtor were joined to the applicants’ case.
After several hearings and few unsuccessful public auctions, on 30 April 2010 the impugned assets were sold to a company from Bačka Palanka for RSD 151,663.077.
The final decision on division of the proceeds and the order of settlement of creditors was issued by the Municipal Court on 5 July 2011. The court ordered the partial settlement of all creditors in proportion to their claims and the amount obtained through the sale.
Shortly thereafter the applicants’ claims were partially settled.
The debtor was privatised on 21 July 2006.
The sales contract was annulled on 28 December 2007 due to a buyer’s failure to fulfil the contractual obligations.
As of January 2008, the debtor still consisted of predominantly socially/State-owned capital.
On 28 May 2010 the Privatisation Agency ordered the restructuring of the debtor, which is still ongoing. Nevertheless, the enforcement proceedings under consideration in the present case have never been suspended or terminated on these grounds.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of the socially-owned companies and the relevant provisions concerning the enforcement proceedings were outlined in the case of R. Kačapor and Others v. , nos. 2269/06 et al., 15 January 2008, §§ 57-64 and §§ 71-76. Furthermore, the relevant provisions concerning the privatisation of socially-owned companies were outlined in the case of Crnišanin and Others v. Serbia, nos. 35835/05 et al., §§ 100-104, 13 January 2009.
