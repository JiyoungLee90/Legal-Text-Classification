The case originated in an application (no. 43316/98) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, B. R. (“the applicant”), on 15 July 1997.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The President of the Chamber acceded to the applicant’s request not to have his name disclosed (Rule 47 § 3 of the Rules of Court).
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the criminal proceedings in his case had exceeded a reasonable time.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 27 August 2002 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Warsaw.
On 8 June 1994 the applicant was charged with having forced a witness in his divorce proceedings to withdraw her testimony. On 12 July 1994 the Warsaw District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) submitted to the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a bill of indictment concerning that charge.
On 20 June 1994 the prosecutor submitted to District Court another bill of indictment against the applicant. The applicant was charged with domestic violence against his wife.
On 13 July and 13 September 1994 he requested the appointment of a legal-aid lawyer.
On 15 September 1994 the Warsaw District Court joined those two cases.
On 23 September 1994 the court appointed a lawyer for the applicant.
On 27 September, as well as on 4 and 7 October 1994, the applicant submitted several pieces of evidence to the court.
The court held hearings on 10 and 11 October 1994. On the latter date it ordered the psychiatric examination of the applicant. On 2 December 1994 the psychiatric opinion was submitted to the court.
On 2 December 1994 another hearing was held. The court summoned certain witnesses. On 1 February 1995 it adjourned a hearing, as witness M., the examination of whom had been requested by the applicant, failed to appear. The court established that the witness resided abroad, in France or Germany. It ordered the police to find out when that witness would return to Poland.
On 8 February, as well as on 9, 20 and 29 March 1995, the applicant submitted further petitions concerning evidence.
On 24 April 1995 the police informed the court that witness M was still abroad.
On 14 September 1995 the applicant requested that a further hearing be scheduled in the case. On 19 September 1995 he informed the court that M had already returned to Poland. However, on 8 October 1995, upon the court’s order, the police again established that M was abroad.
On 8 November 1995 the court informed the applicant that the only reason why the hearings were not scheduled was witness M’s absence.
On 15 November 1995 the applicant informed the court about M’s alleged return to Poland and specified his place of residence. The police again found out that M was still abroad.
On 27 November 1995 the Warsaw District Prosecutor submitted to the court another bill of indictment in which he charged the applicant with the evasion of the payment of maintenance for his daughter.
On 11 and 12 December 1995 the applicant submitted to the court further petitions concerning evidence.
The hearing scheduled for 18 March 1996 was adjourned because of the presiding judge’s illness. After that date the court did not schedule any hearings until 8 June 2000.
On 18 April 1996 it joined the bill of indictment of 27 November 1995 to the proceedings.
On 22 April 1996 the court informed the applicant that due to the change of the presiding judge further hearings would be scheduled only in the second half of 1996.
On 29 April 1996 the applicant requested that all his cases which had been joined be examined separately. Subsequently, he was informed that no appeal lay against the decision of 18 April 1996 and that the case had to be re-opened due to the change of the presiding judge.
On 10 and 23 May 1996 the applicant again requested that witness M be summoned to appear before the court. Subsequently, he requested also that a hearing be scheduled.
On 8 June 2000 the court ordered the applicant’s psychiatric examination, at his counsel’s request.
On 27 June 2000 the applicant requested the appointment of another lawyer for him and expressed his doubts as to the impartiality of the court.
In reply to the court’s request, on 14 July 2000 the applicant specified that it was not his intention to challenge the participation of the judges in the proceedings.
On 25 August 2000 the applicant asked permission to record the course of the hearing on his tape-recorder. After the presiding judge’s refusal the applicant decided to leave the courtroom and challenged the participation in the proceedings of the presiding judge.
On 30 August 2000 the Warsaw District Court declined the applicant’s request.
On 11 September 2000 the applicant petitioned the court to quash the decisions of 25 and 30 August 2000.
On 11 October 2000 the court ordered another psychiatric examination of the applicant, considering that the two psychiatric opinions issued in the course of those proceedings were incomplete and superficial.
The applicant did not attend the examination scheduled for 2 November 2000.
On 7 March 2001 the court ordered an inquiry as to whether the applicant had undergone the examination scheduled for December 2000 and when the psychiatric opinion would be submitted. The court’s registry established that the examination was arranged for 30 May 2001. The presiding judge ordered that the applicant be brought to the psychiatric hospital by the police.
In June 2001 the psychiatric and psychological opinions were submitted to the court. The experts stated that the overall examination of the applicant’s mental health would require his observation in a psychiatric hospital.
On 13 November 2001 the court ordered the applicant’s observation. On 8 January 2002 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed his appeal against that decision. The applicant was taken under observation in May 2002.
The District Court held hearings on 5 August and 16 October 2002, as well as 15 January, 24 March, 15 April, 8 May and 12 June 2003. The applicant filed motions concerning the correction of minutes and a challenge to the participation of certain judges in the proceedings.
On 24 March 2003 he was fined for contempt of court. On 6 May 2003 the Regional Court upheld that decision.
The proceedings are still continuing.
