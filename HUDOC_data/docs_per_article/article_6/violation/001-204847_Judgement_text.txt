On 27 October 2014 the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow extended the detention of Nadezhda Savchenko, a Ukrainian female pilot.
On 26 January 2015 the President of the PACE stated that Russia should free Nadezhda Savchenko. In response to this statement, several public gatherings took place in support of the pilot in Washington, New York, Kyiv, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, St Petersburg and Moscow.
On the evening of 26 January 2015 eleven people gathered on Lubyanskiy Proyezd in Moscow for a stationary demonstration; the gathering had not been notified to the city authorities. At first the participants stood silently holding handwritten posters “No to war”, “Freedom for Nadezhda Savchenko!” A while later they started to chant “Freedom for Nadezhda Savchenko!” At different times the applicants were arrested and taken to police stations.
