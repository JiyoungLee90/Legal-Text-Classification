In 2001 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Bagliyskyi District Court against the PKZ seeking recovery of salary arrears. On 9 August 2001 the court awarded the applicant UAH 2,201.58 (around 324 euros – “EUR”) in salary arrears and other payments.
On 5 July 2004 the applicant was informed by a letter from the Bailiffs' Service that the judgment in her favour was not enforced due to a large number of enforcement proceedings against the debtor and the bankruptcy proceedings initiated against it. The Bailiffs also informed her that the procedure for the forced sale of assets belonging to the debtor was blocked by the Law on the Introduction of a Moratorium on the Forced Sale of Property of 29 November 2001.
The judgment in the applicant's favour remains to a large extent unenforced (UAH 2,192.58 (EUR 325)), as only UAH 9.00 (around EUR 1.32) were paid to her.
