The Banja Luka Court of First Instance issued writs of execution (rješenje o izvršenju) on 4 July 2005, 12 December 2005, 17 October 2005, 3 October 2005 and 27 April 2006.
The applicants complained of non-enforcement to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the ”). On 12 April 2006, 14 March 2006, 9 May 2006 and 13 December 2007 the  found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in the cases of Mr Milan Momić, Mr Živan Anđić, Ms Ismihana Kalem and Mr Hašim Delić. The applicants did not claim compensation, but even if they had done so, their claim would have most likely been refused (see, for example, the Constitutional Court’s decisions AP 774/04 of 20 December 2005, § 438; AP 557/05 of 12 April 2006, § 195; AP 1211/06 of 13 December 2007, § 79; and AP 244/08 of 8 December 2010, § 37). On 24 June 2009 the Constitutional Court dismissed the case of Mr Marinko Tomčić due to the change of circumstances following amendments to the Domestic Debt Act 2004.
On 22 December 2008 Mr MarinkoTomčić was issued government bonds in lieu of cash in respect of the principal debt and associated default interest accrued until 23 July 2004 in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Domestic Debt Act 2004 (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below).
On 22 December 2011 the final judgment in respect of Mr Hašim Delić was fully enforced in cash and in March 2012 the final judgments in favour of Mr Milan Momić and Mr Živan Anđić were also fully enforced in cash.
The final judgment in favour of Ms Ismihana Kalem remains unenforced to this day.
The judgments under consideration in the present case fall under a special legal regime of the Republika Srpska’s general obligations. Their enforcement was suspended since 29 December 2003 pursuant to the Temporary Postponement of Enforcement Act 2003 and Domestic Debt Act 2004 until 7 April 2009 (paragraph 13 below). In accordance with the Domestic Debt Act 2004 the general obligations cover, inter alia, a debt arising from the final and enforceable domestic judgments given in respect of civil actions against the Republika Srpska brought in the period between 20 June 1996 and 31 December 2002, in the total amount of BAM 25,000,000, excluding the final judgments concerning war damage and old foreign-currency savings. Under an initial settlement plant envisaged by that Act, the principal debt and associated default interest, accrued until 23 July 2004 when it entered into force, were to be paid in government bonds. They were to be amortised in ten annual instalments and to earn interest at an annual rate of 1.5%.
While the Constitutional Court initially considered this solution to be incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see decision AP 774/04 of 20 December 2005), it decided that the matter had been resolved following a decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republika Srpska of 15 January 2009 which declared certain provisions of the Domestic Debt Act 2004 unconstitutional (see decision AP 37/08 of 24 June 2009).
On 7 April 2009 the Domestic Act 2004 was changed in that the Republika Srpskaʼs debt arising from the final and enforceable judgments representing general obligations would be paid in cash together with the associated default interest accrued until the full enforcement.
In accordance with the current settlement plan, the judgments will be enforced within five years starting in 2010, in order in which they were received at the Ministry of Finance of the Republika Srpska and after the submission of the necessary documents by the creditors. In respect of the creditors who were issued government bonds, the difference in accrued default interest is to be compensated. It is possible to conclude an agreement with the Ministry of Finance and thus obtain a prior execution of the judgement if one accepts payment in annual instalments or is willing to forfeit the amount due in respect of default interest. It is also possible to obtain the enforcement by concluding a contract about the settlement of mutual claims between the Ministry of Finance and a creditor.
