The case originated in an application (no. 41094/98) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Rocco Sandro Giannangeli (“the applicant”), on 30 December 1997.
The applicant was represented by Mr L. Rossi and Mr M. Antonio Rossi, two lawyers practising in L’Aquila. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, assisted by their Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of a set of criminal proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 21 October 1999 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant was born in 1959 and is currently residing in Sulmona (L’Aquila).
On 16 February 1991 the applicant endorsed a cheque payable to X, who on 20 February 1991 presented it to a bank in order to cash it. As the relevant chequebook had previously been stolen from Y, the bank informed the police which seized the cheque and reported the incident to the Public Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Sulmona Magistrates’ Court.
By an order of 10 November 1992 the Public Prosecutor committed the applicant for trial, commencing on 9 December 1993 before the Sulmona Magistrate, on charges of money laundering, forgery and fraud. On 12 November 1992, this order was served on the applicant, who was thus informed of the charges brought against him.
On 9 December 1993 the Magistrate severed the proceedings concerning the first accusation from those concerning the two others. In a decision of the same day, he discontinued the latter proceedings for lack of a formal criminal complaint against the applicant. A witness was examined in connection with the first charge and proceedings were adjourned until 16 June 1994.
The hearing of 16 June 1994 was postponed to 1 March 1995, because the lawyers were on strike from 13 until 18 June 1994. The case was then re-listed for 2 March 1995. However, this hearing was postponed to 15 February 1996, due to a legitimate impediment of the applicant’s counsel. The case was then re-listed for 23 January 1997. At this hearing, however, the proceedings were postponed until 10 July 1997, due to excessive workload, then adjourned until 20 November 1997 in order to examine a witness who failed to appear.
In a judgment of 20 November 1997, filed with the registry on 27 November 1997, the Magistrate acquitted the applicant. This decision became final on 4 January 1998.
