On 10 July 1998 the Suceava Court of Appeal by a final decision rejected the action, as the third parties had the land titles for the relevant piece of land, which had been obtained in 1995.
The applicant lodged a criminal complaint alleging that the expert in the civil action had given false evidence. On 1 September 1999 the public prosecutor found no grounds for initiating criminal proceedings against the expert.
On 10 March 1999 the Rădăuţi Court of First Instance by a final decision dismissed the applicant’s claim to have the land title of the third parties annulled.
On 5 January 2000 the Rădăuţi Court of First Instance allowed the civil action brought by the applicant together with C.V. and B.V. and ordered the Mayor of Frătăuţii Vechi village, in his capacity as the chairman of the local administrative authorities, to allow them to take possession of 0,26 ha of land situated in Frătăuţii Vechi village, in a place called “Ioneşti”.
