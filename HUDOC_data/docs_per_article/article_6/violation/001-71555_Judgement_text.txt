The case originated in an application (no. 68008/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Ms Stefania Frateschi, an Italian national (“the applicant”), on 28 February 2001.
The applicant was represented before the Court by Mr G. Fanfani, a lawyer practising in . The respondent Government were represented by their successive Agents, respectively Mr U. Leanza and Mr I.M. Braguglia, and by their successive co-Agents, respectively Mr V. Esposito and Mr F. Crisafulli.
On 18 March 2004 the Court declared the application admissible.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section.
The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Florence.
A.C., C.G. and G.G. were the owners of a flat in , which they had let to R.F.
In a registered letter of 29 June 1987, the owners informed the tenant that they intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1987 and asked him to vacate the premises by that date.
In a writ served on the tenant on 9 September 1988, the owners reiterated their intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Florence Magistrate.
By a decision of 18 October 1988, which was made enforceable on 23 November 1988, the Florence Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 13 October 1989.
In the meanwhile, on 4 April 1989, the applicant became the owner of the flat and pursued the enforcement proceedings.
On 14 November 1989, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises.
On 5 December 1989, she informed the tenant that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 26 January 1990.
Between 26 January 1990 and 22 January 1999, the bailiff made twenty attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as the applicant was never granted the assistance of the police in enforcing the order for possession.
On 17 May 1990, the applicant made a statutory declaration that she urgently required the premises as accommodation for herself.
On 11 October 2000, the applicant recovered possession of the flat.
