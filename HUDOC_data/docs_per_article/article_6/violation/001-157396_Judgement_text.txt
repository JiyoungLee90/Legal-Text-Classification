The case originated in an application (no. 60650/11) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Ms Mónika Nemesné Fonyódi (“the applicant”), on 25 September 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr B. Szabó, a lawyer practising in Győr. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Justice.
On 25 March 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Győr.
The applicant’s ex-husband initiated civil lawsuit before Győr District Court against the applicant for dissolution of marital property and for return of present on 21 February 2003.
The court separated the claim to two proceedings and dismissed the claimant’s claim in respect of the return of present.
Subsequently, after several hearings, the first-instance court delivered the judgment in respect of dissolution of the marital property on 13 January 2010.
On appeal, the Budapest Court of Appeal delivered the final and binding judgment on 7 July 2011 amending the first-instance judgment in several aspects.
Both the applicant and the claimant challenged the judgment before the Supreme Court which upheld the judgment on 2 October 2012.
