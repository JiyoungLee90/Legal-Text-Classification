The case originated in an application (no. 42329/09) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Ms Csabáné Varga (“the applicant”), on 4 August 2009.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Justice.
On 25 June 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Szeged.
The applicant had a car accident in 1993, sustained serious injuries and, as a consequence, her loss of capacity to work was assessed to be 67 per cent.
An insurance company was obliged to pay a monthly allowance to the applicant. In order to redeem the monthly allowance, the insurance company offered 4,400,000 Hungarian forints (17,600 euros) to the applicant as compensation for all damages she has suffered. The applicant and the insurance company concluded an agreement on the lump sum on 25 February 1999.
Subsequently, the applicant realised that the lump sum paid by the insurance company did not cover all her damages, believing that the calculation method applied by the insurance company was mistaken. Consequently, on 7 August 2003 the applicant initiated a civil lawsuit against the insurance company requesting the court to declare the agreement invalid and to oblige the insurance company to pay compensation for damages.
The Budapest Regional Court delivered a partial judgment on 18 April 2006 in which dismissed the applicant’s claim on the alleged invalidity of the parties’ agreement. On appeal, the Budapest Court of Appeal upheld the partial judgment on 21 February 2007. The applicant challenged the partial judgment before the Supreme Court which upheld it on 17 October 2007.
As to the remainder, the Budapest Regional Court in its judgment delivered on 11 June 2007 partly found for the applicant in respect of the damage claim. On appeal, the Budapest Court of Appeal reversed the judgment and dismissed the applicant’s claim on 23 April 2008. The applicant challenged the judgment before the Supreme Court but to no avail. The Supreme Court upheld the final and binding judgment on 11 February 2009.
