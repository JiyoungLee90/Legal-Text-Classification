The case originated in an application (no. 47921/08) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Tayisa Denisovna Azyukovska (“the applicant”), on 17 September 2008.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr A.S. Kychenok, a lawyer practising in Kyiv. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, most recently Mr I. Lishchyna.
The applicant alleged that the criminal proceedings against her were excessively lengthy.
On 14 February 2019 the Government were given notice of the above complaint and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Novomoskovsk.
On 25 May 2005 Mr K. a manager of a company which had dealings with the applicant’s then-employer, the State-owned telecom company, apparently informed the prosecutor’s office that the applicant was demanding money for signing a document in her official capacity. He provided an audio recording of his conversations with the applicant.
On 26 May 2005 criminal proceedings were instituted in that connection, K. met the applicant and secretly recorded his conversation with her on a device provided by the authorities. The applicant was arrested. Cash marked by the police with special luminescent substance was seized.
On 1 June 2005 the applicant was released and an undertaking not to abscond was imposed.
On 7 June 2005 the proceedings against the applicant were discontinued for lack of evidence of her guilt. According to her, she was not informed of that decision. The Government stated that the domestic case file contained no document indicating that she was informed (see paragraphs 27 and 28 below).
On 19 October 2006 the criminal investigation was resumed by a superior prosecutor. On the same date the applicant was questioned in the capacity of the accused.
On 14 November 2006 the investigation was completed and the case was sent for trial to Novomoskovsk Court.
The court held hearings on 28 November 2006, 16 January, 5 February, 20 March, 13 April, 3 and 31 May, 20 June, 16 July, 28 August, 24 September, 6 November, 14 and 28 December 2007, 19 February and 26 March 2008. On the latter date the trial court remitted the case for further investigation as the prosecutor failed to find originals of the documents that the applicant was to issue and sign in return of the alleged bribe, nor had the time and place where the applicant had demanded money been established.
On 29 December 2008 the proceedings were discontinued for lack of evidence of the applicant’s guilt.
On 8 January 2009 the superior prosecutor quashed that decision and the proceedings were resumed.
On 18 February 2009 the proceedings were discontinued again for the same reason.
On 3 April 2009 that decision was quashed and the investigation resumed.
On 27 May 2009 the police concluded its internal investigation into the circumstances under which the recordings of the applicant’s conversations with K. had been lost. The investigation concluded that no police officer was implicated in the loss.
On 6 July 2009 the criminal proceedings were discontinued on the same grounds as before (see paragraph 13 above).
On 24 July 2009 that decision was quashed by a superior prosecutor and the investigation resumed.
On 14 September 2009 the criminal proceedings were again discontinued as a key element of evidence, the recordings of the applicant’s conversations with K., had been lost.
On 29 December 2010 the criminal proceedings were reopened on the applicant’s insistence. The applicant considered that the reasoning of the decision of 14 September 2009 was not sufficiently exonerating.
On 4 March 2011 the proceedings were discontinued on the same grounds (see paragraphs 13 and 18 above).
On 29 March 2011 that decision was quashed by a superior prosecutor and the proceedings were resumed.
The proceedings were finally discontinued on 16 May 2011, for the same reasons (see paragraphs 13, 18 and 22 above).
Article 214 of the 1960 Code of Criminal Procedure, in force at the relevant time, required that a decision to discontinue proceedings be sent to the prosecuted person.
