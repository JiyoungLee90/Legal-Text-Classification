The case originated in two applications (nos. 1446/07 and 5667/07) against the Republic of Slovenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Slovenian nationals, Mrs Anamarija Stibilj (“the first applicant”) and Mrs Ivanka Stibilj (“the second applicant”), on 29 December 2006.
The applicants were represented by Mrs M. Končan Verstovšek, a lawyer practising in Trzin. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Lucijan Bembič, State Attorney.
The applicants alleged, in particular, under Article 6 of the Convention, that the length of the proceedings to which they had been party had been excessive. They also complained of the lack of an effective domestic remedy in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings (Article 13 of the Convention).
On 23 June 2014 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants, daughter and mother, were born in 1949 and 1921, respectively, and live in Ajdovščina.
On 2 February 1989 the Ajdovščina Municipality Land Consolidation Commission (hereinafter “the Commission”) adopted a land consolidation programme concerning, inter alia, land owned by the first applicant’s legal predecessor and a separate piece of land owned by the second applicant.
On 4 March 1989 the first applicant’s legal predecessor and the second applicant appealed against the Commission’s decision before the Slovenian Surveying and Mapping Authority (“the Authority”), arguing that they had not been duly compensated for the plots which they had owned and which had been transferred to the land consolidation programme.
On 6 November 1990 the Commission amended the land consolidation programme by assigning the second applicant a different plot of land. The second applicant appealed against the decision.
On 21 December 1990 the first applicant’s predecessor lodged an appeal for the failure of the Authority to adopt a decision within the prescribed time-limit.
On 1 February 1991 the Authority granted the first applicant’s legal predecessor’s appeal, remitting the case to the Commission for further consideration. The Authority found that the operative part of the decision lacked clarity and that the Commission had misapplied the law.
On 28 June 1994 the Convention became operational in respect of Slovenia.
On 16 November 1994 the Authority granted the second applicant’s appeal against the decision of 6 November 1990, finding that the operative part of the decision was inconsistent with its reasoning. The case was remitted to the Commission for further consideration.
On 15 December 1994, 15 March 1996, 24 April 1996 and 20 February 1997 the first applicant’s predecessor and the second applicant lodged informal motions before the Commission, asking that the proceedings be expedited.
On 10 April 1997 – the Commission having failed to undertake further examination of their cases – the first applicant’s legal predecessor and the second applicant each lodged a separate appeal with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food (“the Ministry”) alleging that the Commission had failed to adopt a decision within the prescribed time-limit. Moreover, on 30 June 1997 they both appealed to the Ministry to expedite the resolution of their respective land consolidation decisions.
On 25 September 1997 – the Ministry not having responded to their appeal – the first applicant’s legal predecessor and the second applicant brought an action before the Administrative Court for the failure of the Ministry to adopt a decision within the prescribed time-limit.
On 24 September 1999 the Administrative Court allowed those actions and ordered the Ministry to decide on the matter at issue within thirty days from the date on which its judgment became final.
Meanwhile, on 16 August 1999 the Ajdovščina Administrative Unit (previously the Commission, hereinafter “the Administrative Unit”), which had acquired competence to decide on matters of land consolidation, adopted new decisions on the land at issue.
On 23 September 1999 the first applicant’s legal predecessor and the second applicant appealed before the Ministry against those decisions.
On 25 August 2000 their appeals were allowed by the Ministry, which again assigned them different plots of land to compensate them for the loss of their original plots.
On 10 November 2000 the first applicant’s legal predecessor and the second applicant brought actions for judicial review (administrative action) before the Administrative Court against the Ministry’s decisions of 25 August 2000 on the grounds that the Ministry had failed to properly consider the criteria applicable to the land consolidation programme and had thereby violated their right to equality before the law.
On 23 January 2001 the first applicant’s legal predecessor died and the first applicant inherited a part of his land including plots subject to land consolidation proceedings. She then intervened in the proceedings as the heir.
On 11 April 2003 and 9 May 2003, respectively, the Administrative Court allowed the applicants’ actions for judicial review and annulled the Ministry’s decisions of 25 August 2000 on the grounds that the applicants had not been acquainted with the expert opinion on which the Ministry had based its decisions and that no reasons had been provided for the dismissal of the objections to the distribution of land. The Administrative Court remitted the cases to the Ministry for further consideration.
On 15 May 2007 the Ministry adopted new decisions concerning the distribution of land in respect of the first and second applicant.
On 17 June 2007 the applicants each brought another action for judicial review (administrative action) against those new decisions before the Administrative Court.
On 11 February 2008 and 3 March 2009 the applicants each lodged an informal motion before the Administrative Court to expedite the resolution of their action.
On 19 June 2009 and 23 October 2009, respectively, the Administrative Court allowed the first and second applicants’ actions for judicial review, annulling the Ministry’s decisions of 15 May 2007, and again remitted the cases to the Ministry for further consideration.
On 23 November 2009 and 10 May 2010 the first and second applicants lodged informal motions before the Ministry, asking that the proceedings be expedited. Moreover, three other similar motions were lodged before the Ministry by the first applicant on 27 August 2012, 4 December 2012 and 27 January 2013.
On 5 April 2013 the Ministry issued a decision annulling the Administrative Unit’s decision of 16 August 1999 (see paragraph 17 above) and remitted the cases to it.
On 20 May 2014 and 2 June 2014 the Administrative Unit scheduled oral hearings for 12 June 2014 and 19 June 2014, respectively. Prior to the hearings, the first applicant informed the Administrative Unit that she was unable to participate in the hearing due to medical treatment and that the second applicant could not participate as she was seriously ill and bedridden.
On 28 August 2014 the Administrative Unit held an oral hearing regarding the applicants’ cases. Land survey and agriculture experts were appointed to consider the first applicant’s requests regarding the land and an agriculture expert was appointed in connection with the second applicant’s requests.
The land consolidation proceedings were still pending on the date of the Government’s last communication with the Court.
Section 222 § 1 of the 1999 General Administrative Procedure Act (in force from 1 April 2000, hereinafter “the GAP Act”) provides that in simple matters, where there is no need to undertake separate examination proceedings, an administrative authority is obliged to give a decision within one month from the submission of an application. In all other cases the administrative authority is obliged to give a decision within two months.
Section 222 § 4 of the GAP Act entitles a party whose application has not been decided upon within the time limits set out in paragraph one to lodge an appeal for failure to adopt a decision within the prescribed time-limit, as if the application had been dismissed. In such a case, pursuant to Section 255 of the GAP Act, the appellate authority requires the firstinstance authority to report on the reasons for which the decision has not yet been taken. In so far as those reasons are considered justified, the time-limit for issuing the decision may be extended up to a month. Otherwise, the first-instance authority is required to transmit the case file to the appellate authority for examination. If the case at issue can be resolved on the basis of the case file, the appellate authority proceeds to decide on the matter itself; however, if it considers that the first-instance authority may conduct the proceedings in a speedier and more economical manner, the case file is returned to the latter authority and a time-limit is set in which a decision must be adopted.
Section 26 of the 1997 Administrative Disputes Act (in force from 2 September 1997 to 31 December 2006) entitled a party that had lodged an application with an administrative authority to institute an action for a failure to adopt a decision within the prescribed time-limit before the Administrative Court (administrative action) in the following cases:
“2. If the appellate authority does not rule on the appeal against the first-instance decision within two months, or within a shorter period, if such is provided by law, and if, following a repeated request, it does not issue such a decision within seven days, the applicant may then bring an administrative action as if his request had been dismissed.
The applicant may also bring the kind of action mentioned in the preceding paragraph when the first-instance administrative authority fails to make a decision against which no appeal lies.
If, in matters where a right to an appeal exists, the first-instance authority fails to make a decision on an individual’s application within two months, or within a shorter period, if such is provided by law, the individual may then submit an application to the appellate administrative authority. The individual may bring an administrative action against the decision of the appellate authority. The individual may also bring an administrative action under the conditions set out in paragraph 2.”
A similar provision may be found in Section 28 of the new Administrative Dispute Act (in force from 1 January 2007):
“2. If the appellate authority does not rule on an appeal against the first-instance decision within two months, or within a shorter period, if such is provided by law, and if, following a repeated request, it does not issue such a decision within seven days, the applicant may then bring an administrative action as if his request had been dismissed.
The applicant may also bring the kind of action noted in the preceding paragraph when the first-instance administrative authority fails to make a decision against which no appeal lies, and in the case that the authority has not issued a final administrative act within three years of the beginning of the procedure, irrespective of whether or not ordinary and extraordinary remedies have already been applied in the procedure, except if the procedure has been suspended.
If, in matters where a right to an appeal exists, the first-instance authority fails to make a decision upon an individual’s application within two months, or within a shorter period, if such is provided by law, the individual may then submit his application to the appellate administrative authority, which is required to decide on the matter. The individual may bring an administrative action against the decision of the appellate authority. The individual may also bring an administrative action under the conditions set out in paragraph 2.”
The Government submitted to the Court copies of nine domestic decisions – dated 26 October 2010 (Dec. no. I U 56/2010), 8 March 2011 (Dec. no. I U 1933/2010), 22 September 2010 (Dec. no. I U 454/2010), 13 December 2011 (Dec. no. I U 1131/2011), 4 December 2013 (Dec. no. I U 171/2013), 4 March 2014 (Dec. no. I U 1781/2013), 10 January 2012 (Dec. no. I U 392/2011), 8 January 2013 (Dec. no. I U 352/2012) and 16 October 2013 (Dec. no. I U 299/2013) – concerning actions lodged by parties to different administrative proceedings for a failure to adopt a decision within the prescribed time-limit. The Administrative Court had allowed all nine actions and ordered the administrative authorities to decide on the plaintiffs’ claims within a certain time. Three of those proceedings before the Administrative Court lasted for about three months and the rest for about six to ten months.
