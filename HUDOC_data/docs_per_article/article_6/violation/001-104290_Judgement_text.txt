The case originated in an application (no. 38597/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Pyotr Vladimirovich Kirilenko (“the applicant”), on 5 October 2004.
The applicant was represented by Ms N. Yurchak. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev and subsequently Mrs V. Milinchuk, both the Representatives of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicant complained of non-enforcement of a binding and enforceable judgment delivered in his late father’s favour in 2002 and its subsequent quashing by way of supervisory review.
On 16 January 2006 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 1). On 19 June 2007 the Court put additional questions to the parties.
In accordance with Protocol No. 14, the application is assigned to a Committee of three Judges.
The applicant, Mr Pyotr Vladimirovich Kirilenko, is a Russian national who was born in 1985 and lives in the  in the Ryazan Region.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 7 May 2001 Neryungri Town Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic (“the town court”) ordered the Russian Government and the Savings Bank to jointly pay 106,989.50 Russian roubles (RUB) to the applicant’s father.
On 18 June 2001 the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic (“the Supreme Court”) upheld the judgment on appeal.
On 30 August 2001 half of the amount, i.e. RUB 53,494.75, was credited to the account of Ms Yu., the representative of the applicant’s father.
On 16 May 2002 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic (“the Presidium”) quashed those judgments and remitted the case to the town court.
By a judgment of 26 June 2002, the town court ordered the Treasury to pay RUB 53,494.54 to the applicant’s father, which corresponded to the difference between the amount awarded on 7 May 2001 and the amount paid out on 30 August 2001.
On 21 August 2002 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment on appeal.
On 7 October 2002 the applicant’s father submitted a writ of enforcement to the Ministry of Finance.
On 9 October 2002 the applicant’s father died.
Having learnt about his father’s death and being his sole heir, the applicant, represented by Ms Yu., sought an extension of the time-limit for claiming his right to receive the debt under the judgment of 26 June 2002. On 30 March 2005 the town court granted the extension. On 1 June 2005 a public notary issued a succession certificate, confirming that the applicant had acquired the right to receive the judgment debt.
Since 2002 the Treasury and the Ministry of Finance have sought supervisory review of the judgment of 26 June 2002, as upheld on 21 August 2002.
On 13 May 2003 the Supreme Court refused the application for supervisory review submitted by the Treasury.
On 22 May 2003 the Ministry of Finance informed Ms Yu. that it had applied for supervisory review of the judgment of 26 June 2002 and therefore would not execute it pending a decision on the application. On 3 September 2003 the Ministry of Finance submitted another application for supervisory review. It appears that these applications were unsuccessful.
In 2006 the Ministry of Finance filed a new application for supervisory review, asking the town court to extend the expired time-limit for introduction of their application.
On 8 August 2006 the town court extended the time-limit for unspecified reasons and accepted the Ministry’s application for consideration.
On 30 November 2006 the Presidium quashed the judgment of 26 June 2002, as upheld on 21 August 2002, and remitted the case for a fresh examination to the town court. The applicant was not notified of the date of the hearing and was not provided with a copy of the respondent’s review application.
On 25 December 2006 Ms Yu. submitted a request to review the above decision on the ground that no copy of the respondent’s review application had been served on her. It appears that the request remained without response.
The town court re-examined the case on 25 May 2007 and rejected the claims. Ms Yu. attended the hearing and produced the applicant’s succession certificate and the town court’s decision of 30 March 2005. It does not appear that the parties appealed against the judgment.
Under Article 376 of the Code of the Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation of 14 November 2002 (in force from 1 February 2003), judicial decisions that have become legally binding, with the exception of judicial decisions by the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, may be appealed against to a court exercising supervisory review, by parties to the case and by other persons whose rights or legal interests have been adversely affected by the judicial decisions concerned (§ 1). Judicial decisions may be appealed against to a court exercising supervisory review within one year after they became legally binding (§ 2). By its ruling of 5 February 2007, the  interpreted Article 376 § 1 as allowing the above-mentioned persons to apply for supervisory review only after having exhausted all available ordinary appeals.
For the summary of other applicable provisions of the domestic law, see Murtazin v. Russia, no. 26338/06, §§ 14-18, 27 March 2008.
Under the Code of Civil Procedure of 14 November 2002, if a party dies during the proceedings, the court may allow its successor to pursue the proceedings. Succession is possible at any stage of the proceedings (Article 44 § 1).
Under Part 3 of the Civil Code, the succession includes the deceased’s property or pecuniary rights or claims but does not include rights or obligations intrinsically linked to the deceased’s person, such as alimony or a right to compensation for health damage (Article 1112). An heir should claim and accept succession, as well as obtain a succession certificate from a public notary (Articles 1152, 1162).
Under the Enforcement Act (Federal Law no. 229-FZ of 2 October 2007), if the judgment debtor has died the bailiff should obtain the appointment of the late debtor’s successor as the judgment debtor (section 52). All measures taken within the enforcement proceedings before such appointment should be binding for the successor to the extent that they were binding for the original debtor (ibid).
