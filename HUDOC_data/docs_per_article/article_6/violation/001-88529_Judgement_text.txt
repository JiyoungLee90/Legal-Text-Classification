The case originated in an application (no. 2914/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Boris Prepeliţă (“the applicant”), on 26 November 2001.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Chitic, from Lawyers for Human Rights, a non-governmental organisation based in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr V. Pârlog.
The applicant complained that the failure to enforce a final judgment in his favour had violated his right to have his civil rights determined by a court as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention and his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions, guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in Orhei.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The applicant was a victim of deportation by the Soviet authorities in the 1940s. In 1941 his family’s house was confiscated by the State. In 1992 the Moldovan Parliament enacted Law No. 1225-XII which allowed the victims of Soviet repression to claim back their confiscated property.
In 1998 the applicant brought an action against the local council, claiming the return of his family’s house. On 27 November 1998 the Orhei District Court found for the applicant. It confirmed his property right over the house and ordered the local council to evict the current tenants and provide them with alternative accommodation. The judgment became final. One of the two families concerned by the eviction included a person with a first-degree disability.
The applicant obtained an enforcement warrant which the bailiff failed to enforce. On 14 March 2002, the applicant wrote a letter to the bailiff of the Orhei District Court asking him to enforce the decision of 27 November 1998. The bailiff replied by a letter dated 3 April 2002, stating that the local council did not have the means to execute the judgment.
In view of the long period during which the judgment had not been enforced, the applicant on 10 January 2003 proposed to the council that it pay him the monetary value of the house, which he estimated at 80,000 Moldovan lei (MDL), (approximately 5,465 euros (EUR)) at the relevant time. By a letter of 28 January 2003 the council rejected his offer on the ground that the house was worth MDL 15,514 according to the real estate register.
On 20 February 2004 the local council informed the applicant that it had modified its budget for 2004 and had provided for MDL 80,000 to be paid to him in lieu of the house. No offer of compensation for pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage was made. The applicant rejected the offer. Subsequently the Republican Institute for Judiciary and Criminal Expertise (“the RIJCE”) determined the market value of the house at MDL 81,570 (EUR 5,400). The applicant again rejected the offer.
At the Government’s request, a second valuation of the applicant’s house was carried out by experts from the National Centre for Expert Analysis (“the NCEA”, attached to the Ministry of Justice) on 16 July 2007. The experts concluded that the market value of the house was MDL 162,000 (EUR 9,674).
According to the applicant, an expert hired by him did not have access to the house or the documents relating to it. He could not, accordingly, determine its market value. At the applicant’s request, an estate agency certified on 16 January 2008 that houses in the centre of Orhei were worth between EUR 25,000 and EUR 150,000, while apartments cost EUR 450-500 per square metre. The cost of renting a house varied between EUR 50 and EUR 100 a month.
The judgment of 27 November 1998 has not been enforced to date.
The relevant domestic law is set out in Prodan v. Moldova (no. 49806/99, § 31, ECHR 2004III (extracts)).
