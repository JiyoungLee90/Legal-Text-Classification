The case originated in an application (no. 68811/13) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr J. Dorić (“the applicant”), on 14 October 2013.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Nakić and Mr A. Jusić, lawyers practising in Sarajevo. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Ms M. Mijić.
On 31 January 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Sarajevo.
In 1999 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against his employer, the local police, seeking his reinstatement and damages. His claim was eventually rejected.
The first-instance judgment was rendered by the Sarajevo Municipal Court on 17 April 2006.
The second-instance judgment was rendered by the Sarajevo Cantonal Court on 27 March 2008.
The third-instance judgment was rendered by the Supreme Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 26 January 2010.
On 19 April 2010 the applicant filed a constitutional appeal with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina complaining under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 about the outcome and length of his labour dispute.
On 10 April 2013 the Constitutional Court found a breach of the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time and rejected the remainder of the case. It did not award any damages.
