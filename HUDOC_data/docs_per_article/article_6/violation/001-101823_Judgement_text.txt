On 11 May 2006 the District Court extended the applicant's detention on remand until 23 August 2006, referring to the gravity of the charges against him.
On 27 June 2006 the District Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to four years and six months' imprisonment. The applicant did not appeal against this judgment.
Between 5 April 1999 and 27 June 2006 the criminal proceedings against the applicant were adjourned on twenty-four occasions due to his and his counsel's absence from the hearings, which resulted in an overall delay in the proceedings of one year and three months.
