The case originated in an application (no. 12305/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Özgür Keskin, (“the applicant”), on 7 February 2009.
The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 6 December 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in İzmir.
On 18 June 1998 the applicant started working for a company owned by İzmir City Council (“the City Council”). On 19 March 2007 he resigned from his job to perform his military service.
On 12 April 2007 the applicant was paid 16,985 Turkish liras (TRY  approximately 9,200 euros (EUR)) in respect of severance pay and he signed a release (ibraname) discharging the City Council from all liability.
Following his discharge from the military on health grounds shortly after he was enlisted, on 20 April and 31 May 2007 the applicant requested his reinstatement in his previous job. However, his requests were rejected by the City Council.
On 28 June 2007 the applicant initiated proceedings before the İzmir Labour Court, seeking reinstatement. He relied on clause 19 of the collective bargaining agreement in force at the company (“the collective agreement”), which provided for the reinstatement of employees who had quit their jobs to perform their military service, provided that they applied within three months of their discharge from the armed forces.
On 12 September 2007, in a decision rendered orally in the presence of the parties, the İzmir Labour Court found in favour of the applicant. The Labour Court held that the applicant’s discharge from the military shortly after he had been enlisted fell under the provision of the collective agreement, which called for the suspension of the employment contract when an employee was conscripted (silah altına alınma) for reasons other than compulsory military service, such as being recalled to the armed forces in times of war. Therefore it held that the applicant was entitled to be reinstated in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement. The court informed the parties that they could appeal against this decision within the time-limits set out in the applicable procedure.
On 18 September 2007 the City Council appealed against the decision and reserved its right to submit additional observations once the reasoned judgment of the first-instance court had been served on it. That appeal was not communicated to the applicant.
On 15 October 2007, the registry of the first-instance court forwarded the file to the Court of Cassation for appeal on points of law.
On 23 October 2007 the City Council submitted its additional observations. It argued, inter alia, that the first-instance court’s interpretation of the collective agreement had been erroneous. These observations were also not communicated to the applicant.
On 21 July 2008, following an examination based on the case file and without holding a hearing, the Court of Cassation quashed the firstinstance court’s judgment and found in favour of the City Council. The Court of Cassation found it established that the applicant had resigned from his job to perform his military service and that he had been paid severance pay. It held that a rejection of the applicant’s request for reinstatement could not be regarded as the termination of the applicant’s employment contract; therefore, the applicant could not technically ask to be reinstated. The Court of Cassation further held that clause 19 of the collective agreement was not directly applicable in the case before it. No appeal was possible against this decision.
This decision was served on the applicant on 22 September 2008.
The relevant provision of the Labour Courts Act (Law no. 5521), as in force at the material time, provided as follows:
“Oral procedure shall be applicable to disputes before the labour courts.”
“...
The time-limit for appealing against a decision of a labour court is eight days, starting from the oral delivery of the judgment in public, or where the judgment is pronounced in a party’s absence, from the date it is served on the parties.
A regional assize court or the Court of Cassation shall render a final decision on the appeal within two months. ”
“In cases where a provision of this Law is not found to be clear, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure shall be applicable.”
The relevant provision on the time-limits for finalising the appeal for reinstatement cases is found in the Labour Act (Law no. 4857):
“... An employee whose contract of employment has been terminated unjustly may seek reinstatement before the labour court within one month of the notice of termination.
...
The claim shall be finalised within two months on the basis of the accelerated judgment procedure. In a case of appeal, the Court of Cassation shall render its decision within one month. That decision shall be final.”
Article 433 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Law no. 1086), which was in force at the time of the events, provided as follows:
“The appeal of the appellant shall be communicated to the respondent by the court which has rendered the decision.
The respondent may reply to the appeal within ten days of the date of notification. The respondent may nevertheless cross-appeal in his or her reply submissions even if he or she had not lodged an appeal within the required time-limits ...”
The Labour Courts Act provided at the material time for an oral and accelerated procedure to be applied in labour disputes. By virtue of section 15 of the Labour Courts Act, the courts have transposed the relevant provisions found in the Code of Civil Procedure to the oral and accelerated procedure in labour disputes. However, the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure are found only in sections 178 to 426 of the same Code and they do not refer specifically to section 433, which is the provision that provides for the communication of the appeal of the appellant to the respondent and the right of the respondent party to cross-appeal. In the particular context of appeal proceedings against the decisions of labour courts, it is clear from the established case-law of the Court of Cassation that an appeal by one party would not be communicated to the other party and that the respondent party could not cross-appeal in his or her reply submissions (katılma yolu ile temyiz) once the appeal time-limits had passed. Therefore, it was for the respondent to keep him or herself informed by consulting the case file at the court’s registry (see, inter alia, the Court of Cassation’s decisions: E. 1984/1150, K. 1984/2552, 9 March 1984; E. 1985/2323, K. 1985/2464, 18 April 1985; E. 1991/9534, K. 1991/10062, 1 July 1991; E.1995/13744, K. 1995/34388, 20 November 1995; E. 1998/12223, K. 1998/14537, 19 October 1998; E. 2001/18951, K. 2002/4605, 20 March 2002).
Owing to recent case-law developments in this area of the law, the practice of non-communication of the appellant’s observations to the defendant has become defunct. In a judgment delivered on 20 March 2014, the Constitutional Court held that in order to ensure that the parties have an effective right of appeal in labour proceedings, the time-limits for appeal should start to run only from the date when the reasoned judgment is delivered to the parties (see no. 2012/1023, § 39). Following this approach the Grand Chamber of the Court of Cassation’s Civil Division (Yargıtay Hukuk Genel Kurulu) further ruled that the appeal of an appellant must be communicated to the defendant, who may cross-appeal in his or her observations (see E. 2014/9-1438, K. 2015/580, 21 January 2015, and E. 2015/7-2488, K. 2015/2187, 30 September 2015).
In labour disputes, the Court of Cassation carries out an examination on the basis of the case file without holding a hearing, save in certain circumstances provided for by law. The appeal is limited to points of law. The Court of Cassation gives a final decision without remitting the case to the first-instance court.
