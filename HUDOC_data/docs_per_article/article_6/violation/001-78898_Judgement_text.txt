The defendant failed to appear before the District Court on 11 and 23 July 1996. As the mail sent by the court to both the defendant foundation and its representative could not be delivered, the court made inquiries with a view to establishing the defendant’s address. The three authorities concerned submitted their replies on 16 August 1996, on 11 September 1996 and on 5 November 1996.
The District Court sent letters to the representative of the defendant foundation in February and in May 1997. All three letters were returned with the indication that the addressee was not at the address indicated in the letters.

On 15 October 1998 the case was again adjourned because of the absence of the defendant.
On 17 November 1998 the Bratislava I District Court decided, in the absence of the defendant’s representative, that the applicant’s dismissal had been unlawful as the relevant notice had not been in conformity with the statutory requirements. It ordered the defendant to pay 608,500 Slovak korunas (SKK) to the applicant in compensation for loss of salary. It discontinued the proceedings in respect of the remainder of the applicant’s action as the applicant had withdrawn the corresponding claims. The judgment was served on the representative of the defendant on 30 April 1999. The liquidator of the defendant filed an appeal on 17 May 1999 indicating that the defendant foundation had ceased to exist by 1 November 1998.

On 15 May 2002 the District Court dismissed both parties’ claims. It held that the applicant and his former wife no longer lived in the flat. The applicant had waived his right to use the flat in that he had stopped living in a common household with his former wife in 1992.

The merits of the case have been examined by the Bratislava II District Court which held a number of hearings and took extensive evidence. The proceedings are pending.
On 27 August 1991 the applicant claimed damages before the Bratislava I District Court.

That court held several hearings in 1991. On 8 August 1994 the court ordered an expert to submit an opinion. The opinion was submitted on 19 October 1994.
The court scheduled four hearings between 20 December 1996 and 14 March 1997. On the latter date the Bratislava V District Court ordered the defendant to pay the sum claimed to the applicant with default interest. The defendant refused receipt of mail and the District Court’s decision was served on him only on 20 October 1997.
On 22 July 1998 the applicant sought the enforcement of the sum in question.
On 6 August 1998 the Bratislava V District Court authorised an executions officer to enforce the sum. On 19 August 1998 the executions officer issued a notification of the execution. It was served on the applicant on 1 June 1999 and on the debtor on 26 May 1999.
On 24 June 1999 and on 20 July 1999 the executions officer issued two execution orders with a view to obtaining the sum owed by the defendant through the sale of his movable property and the withdrawal of a part of his income. On 8 July 1999 the executions officer, with the assistance of the police, established an inventory of the movable property of the debtor. The movables were not taken away as their value was low and since the debtor’s wife had promised to pay the sum in issue. Subsequently the executions officer unsuccessfully attempted to contact the debtor and his wife.
In a statement of 12 October 2006 the executions officer explained that it had not been shown that the debtor owned any property or that he had any income. For that reason the judgment had not been executed.
The execution proceedings are pending.
