The case originated in an application (no. 27883/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Moldovan nationals, Mrs Elena Bulava and Mr Nicolai Bulava (“the applicants”), on 18 June 2004.
The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr Vitalie Pârlog.
The applicants complained that the belated compliance by a State-owned company with final judgments in their favour had violated their right to have their civil rights determined by a court, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, and their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 29 March 2006 the President of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits of the case (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicants, Mrs Elena Bulava and Mr Nicolai Bulava, a married couple, were born in 1957 and 1954, respectively, and live in Soroca.
They were employees of a State-owned water-supply company (“the company”). Between 2000 and 2004 the company was at a standstill on several occasions and the applicants were not paid their salaries. They brought several actions against the company for the payment of their salaries.
By final judgments of 26 March and 29 September 2003 the Soroca District Court ordered the company to pay Mrs Bulava 1,820 Moldovan lei (MDL) (approximately 118.86 euros (EUR) at the time).
By a final judgment of 22 March 2004 the Soroca District Court found that the company's failure to comply with the judgments of 26 March and 29 September 2003 in favour of the applicant violated her rights and ordered the company to pay the applicant MDL 8,981 (approximately EUR 576.75 at the time), which represented a penalty of 5% of MDL 1,820 for each day of default and MDL 1,820 for non-pecuniary damage. A bailiff received the enforcement warrant on 18 May 2004.

By a final judgment of 13 September 2004 the Soroca District Court ordered the company to pay the applicant MDL 13,286 (approximately EUR 897.38 at the time). A bailiff received the warrant of execution on 13 October 2004.
By a final judgment of 10 July 2003 the Soroca District Court ordered the company to pay Mr Bulava MDL 10,938.50 (approximately EUR 682.25 at the time). A bailiff received the warrant of execution on 3 February 2004.
By a final judgment of 26 April 2004 the Soroca District Court ordered the company to pay him MDL 4,360 (approximately EUR 306.83 at the time). A bailiff received the warrant of execution on 11 May 2004.
By a final judgment of 13 September 2004 the Soroca District Court ordered the company to pay the applicant MDL 13,375 (approximately EUR 903.39 at the time). A bailiff received the warrant of execution on 5 October 2004.
By a letter of 27 December 2004 a bailiff informed the applicants, inter alia, that the assets of the company which had been seized by the bailiff remained unsold after auction. The applicants were also informed by the bailiff that the judgments would be enforced as soon as the company had assets.
On 12 May 2005 the applicants informed the Court that all the judgments in their favour had been enforced on 29 April 2005.
