The case originated in an application (no. 43437/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Croatian nationals, Mr Milan Novković and Mrs Ivanka Novković (“the applicants”), on 25 October 2002.
The applicants were represented by Mr M. Mihočević, a lawyer practising in . The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, first Mrs L. Lukina-Karajković and subsequently Mrs Š. Stažnik.
On 29 January 2004 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicants were born in 1952 and 1951 respectively and live in Karlovac.
In the period between 11 September 1991 and 13 April 1992 the applicants' restaurant in Karlovac was blown up four times by unknown perpetrators.
On 11 April 1995 the applicants brought a civil action against the State in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) seeking pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. They relied on section 180 of the Civil Obligations Act.
On 3 February 1996 the Amendment to the Civil Obligations Act (“the 1996 Amendment”) entered into force. It provided that all proceedings concerning actions for damages resulting from terrorist acts or acts of violence were to be stayed (prekid postupka) pending the enactment of new legislation on the subject.
Pursuant to the 2003 Liability Act, on 26 September 2003 the Municipal Court resumed the proceedings.
Meanwhile, on 24 April 2002 the first applicant lodged a constitutional complaint under section 63 of the Constitutional Court Act complaining about the length of the above civil proceedings and the lack of access to a court. On 26 October 2004 the  (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) accepted the first applicant's complaint. Relying on the Court's case law (Kutić v. , no. 48778/99, ECHR 2002II), it found violations of his constitutional rights to a hearing within a reasonable time and of access to a court. It awarded him 4,400 Croatian kunas (HRK) in compensation, and ordered the Zagreb Municipal Court to give a decision in the case in the shortest time possible but no later than a year following the publication of the decision in the Official Gazette. The 's decision was published on 18 November 2004 and its correction on 6 January 2005.
On 31 May 2004 the Municipal Court found that it no longer had jurisdiction in respect of the applicants' claim for pecuniary damages and thus declared that part of their action inadmissible. On 2 November 2004 the  (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) accepted the applicant's appeal, quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case.
It appears that the proceedings are still pending before the Municipal Court.
