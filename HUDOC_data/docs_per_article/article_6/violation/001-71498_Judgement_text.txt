On 28 March 1984 the Ministry of Defence brought the above-mentioned facts to the attention of the Commander of the 8th district of the state of emergency region of Elazığ province. In a secret message on 3 April 1984 the latter reported the applicant to the military prosecutor's office attached to the headquarters of the Commander of the state of emergency region, which opened a preliminary investigation in respect of activities detrimental to the national interest committed abroad, an offence under Article 140 of the Criminal Code.

On 16 April that year the military deputy public prosecutor in charge of the applicant's case accordingly issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and referred the case to the Elazığ public prosecutor, who took over the investigation.

The prosecutor explained that according to the press the organisations of which the applicant was a member also engaged in armed actions. The accusations concerned the period from 1977 to 1983.
On 16 April 1992 the  (“the ”) instructed the Ministry of Justice to invite the German authorities to provide information about the activities and institutional nature of the Union of Turkish Students, the Kurdistan Committee and the HEVRA and KOMKAR organisations.
On 2 June 1992, noting that it had not received the information requested, the Assize Court set 14 July 1992 as the date of the hearing. On that date, however, it simply had the case records read out in order to familiarise a substitute judge with the case file. It adjourned the hearing until 24 September 1992 as no reply had yet been received from the Ministry of Justice. The hearing of 24 September and the nineteen subsequent hearings held before the Assize Court – on 12 November and 17 December 1992, 28 January, 11 March, 6 May, 17 June, 9 September, 21 October and 9 December 1993, 3 February, 1 March, 3 May, 30 June, 6 October, 4 November and 27 December 1994, and 21 March, 23 June and 6 October 1995 – all took place without any decisions being taken on the merits, pending a reply from the German authorities, and served only to inform the substitute judges of the content of the case file.

On 18 January 1995 the applicant's lawyer submitted supplementary written pleadings in which, relying on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, he complained of the excessive length of the proceedings and asked for judgment to be pronounced without waiting any longer for a reply from the German authorities. He contended that, although his client was free, he could neither return to Germany nor have any reasonable prospects in  because of the continuing trial and the restrictions it entailed.
On 17 October 1995 the applicant obtained a certificate from the provincial governor's office, signed by a police officer, stating that the refusal to return the passport was based on a measure which had been ordered by the Ankara Security Directorate and was still valid. The date of and reasons for the measure concerned were not stated in the certificate.
