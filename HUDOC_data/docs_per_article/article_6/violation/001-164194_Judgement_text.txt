The case originated in an application (no. 14130/14) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Janko Skorić (“the applicant”), on 10 February 2014.
The applicant was represented by Mr S. Gajić, a lawyer practising in Beograd. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Ms V. Rodić.
On 16 September 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Belgrade.
The applicant was employed by “PIM – bagerovanje i vodni transport”, a socially-owned company based in Belgrade (“the debtor”).
On 30 March 2005 the Belgrade Second Municipal Court (Drugi opštinski sud u Beogradu) ordered the debtor to pay the applicant specified sums in respect of salary arrears, social security contributions and procedural costs. This judgment became final on the same date.
On 22 June 2005 the Belgrade Fourth Municipal Court (Četvrti opštinski sud u Beogradu) issued an enforcement order with regard to the said judgement.
On 29 March 2012, acting upon the applicant’s constitutional appeal, the Constitutional Court held that the applicant had suffered a breach of the “right to a trial within a reasonable time” with regard to the enforcement proceedings. The court ordered the acceleration of the proceedings and declared that the applicant was entitled to compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered in the amount of EUR 700, converted into the national currency at the rate applicable at the date of settlement.
The enforcement proceedings instituted on the basis of the judgment rendered by the Belgrade Second Municipal Court on 30 March 2005 continued and are still pending.
