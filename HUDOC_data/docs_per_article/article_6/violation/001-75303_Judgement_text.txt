The case originated in an application (no. 60299/00) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Edward Bogacz (”the applicant), on 23 February 2000.
The applicant was represented before the Court by Mr Z. Cichoń, a lawyer practising in Kraków. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant complained that the length of criminal proceedings in his case had exceeded a reasonable time.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 15 November 2005 the Court declared the application admissible and considered that the applicant’s widow had a legitimate interest to pursue the application in her late husband’s stead.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lived in Warszawa. He died in 2000.
On 28 June 1994 a bill of indictment in respect of the applicant, then a police officer, and four other individuals was submitted to the Warsaw District Court (sąd rejonowy). They were charged with accepting bribes.
The court placed the applicant under police supervision.
Despite the applicant’s numerous petitions the District Court did not hold any hearings.
On 11 October 2000 the applicant died.
On 12 February 2002 the Warsaw District Court issued a decision to discontinue the proceedings with respect to the applicant due to his death.
