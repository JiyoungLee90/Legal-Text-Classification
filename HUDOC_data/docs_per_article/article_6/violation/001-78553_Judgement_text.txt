The case originated in an application (no. 42473/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Aleksandr Alekseyevich Yeremeyev (“the applicant”), on 12 May 2004.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Bychkovskiy from Miusinsk. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Y. Zaytsev, their Agent, and Mrs I. Shevchuk, Head of the Office of the Government Agent before the European Court of Human Rights.
On 8 November 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the non-enforcement of the judgements in the applicant’s favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Ivanivka, the Lugansk region. He is a former employee of the Ivanivka Machine-Building Plant (“the Plant,” Іванівський верстатозавод). 99.11% of the Plant’s shares are owned by the State.
On 30 October 2000 the Plant’s labour disputes commission (“the Commission,” комісія з трудових спорів Іванівського верстатозаводу) ordered the Plant to pay the applicant UAH 2,127.24 in salary arrears. This decision became final and was transferred to the Antratsit Bailiffs’ Service (“the Bailiffs,” Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Антрацитівського районного управління юстиції) for enforcement.
On 2 November 2001 and 21 January 2004 the  (Антрацитівський районний суд Луганської області) additionally ordered the Plant to pay the applicant UAH 970.13 and UAH 535 respectively in various payments. These judgments became final and the enforcement writs were transferred to the Bailiffs for enforcement.
On 1 February 2005 the Bailiffs informed the applicant that the delays in collection of the awards due to him were due to the holding of the Plant’s property in a tax lien, a statutory moratorium on the forced sale of State property and the pending bankruptcy proceedings against the Plant.
The decision of 30 October 2000 and the judgments of 2 November 2001 and 21 January 2004 remain unenforced.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Sokur v. Ukraine (no. 29439/02, §§ 17-22, 26 April 2005).
