The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mrs V. Lutkovska succeeded by Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 21 January 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the non-enforcement of the judgment in the applicant's favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
In accordance with Article 36 § 1 of the Convention, the Russian Government were invited to exercise their right to intervene in the proceedings, but they declined to do so.
The applicant was born in 1936 and lived in Ryazan, the . He died on 1 August 2005. By letter of 14 January 2006, Mrs Movsesyan, the applicant's widow, informed the Court that she wished to pursue the application.
On 26 November 2001 the Pavlograd Court (Павлоградський районний суд Дніпропетровської області) awarded the applicant a lump sum of UAH 9,114.31 in various payments and UAH 416.61 in monthly disability allowances against his former employers, the State-owned companies “Dniproshakhtobud” (ДВАТ “Дніпрошахтобуд”), “Kryvbasshakhtoprokhodka” (трест “Кривбасшахтопроходка”) and “Rudoupravlinnya Kirova” (ДП “Рудоуправління ім. Кірова”). The judgment came into force and the enforcement writs were transferred to the Bailiffs' Service for enforcement.
