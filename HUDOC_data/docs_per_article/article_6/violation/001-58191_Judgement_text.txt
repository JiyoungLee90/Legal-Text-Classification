The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) on 11 March 1996, within the threemonth period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 25839/94) against the Italian Republic lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by an Italian national, Mr Aldo Giuseppe Nicodemo, on 21 August 1993.
The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby Italy recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 35 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court B, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings.
On 30 March 1996 the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, decided, under Rule 21 § 7 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to consider the instant case and the cases of Spurio, De Santa, Gallo, Lapalorcia, Abenavoli, Zilaghe, Laghi, Viero, Orlandini, Ryllo, Soldani, Fusco, Di Luca and Saluzzi, Pizzi, Scarfò, Argento and Trombetta v. Italy. The Chamber to be constituted for that purpose included ex officio Mr C. Russo, the elected judge of Italian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On the same day, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr N. Valticos, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr A.B. Baka, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha, Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici, Mr P. Kūris and Mr E. Levits (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Italian Government (“the Government”), the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 § 1 and 40). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 25 July 1996. On 25 June 1996 the Secretary to the Commission had informed the Registrar that the Delegate did not intend to submit written observations. The applicant did not submit any observations.
On 21 October 1996 the Commission produced the file on the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the President’s instructions.
On 27 November 1996 the Chamber decided to dispense with a hearing in the case, having satisfied itself that the conditions for this derogation from its usual procedure had been met (Rules 27 and 40).
Mr Aldo Giuseppe Nicodemo lives in Praia a Mare (Cosenza). He is a lawyer by training.
On 14 July 1981 Calabria Regional Council (Giunta Regionale) took the applicant, who was already employed by the Council on a fixed-term contract, into its permanent employ. In the face of the Council’s inertia, Mr Nicodemo instituted proceedings in the Calabria Regional Administrative Court (“the RAC”) on 15 May 1984 seeking implementation of the decision, the difference in remuneration and damages for the delay.
On 21 May 1984 he asked the RAC to fix a date for the hearing. On 31 November 1988 and 5 March 1989 he applied for the case to be set down for an urgent hearing.
In an interlocutory judgment of 28 April 1989 the RAC ordered the Regional Council to file certain documents. This order was reiterated in a second interlocutory judgment given on 22 November 1991.
On 7 May 1993 the applicant again applied for the case to be set down for an urgent hearing. According to information submitted by the applicant, on 29 October 1996, the proceedings were then still pending.
Mr Nicodemo applied to the Commission on 21 August 1993. He complained of the length of the proceedings in the Calabria Regional Administrative Court and relied on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
On 6 July 1995 the Commission declared the application (no. 25839/94) admissible. In its report of 28 November 1995 (Article 31) it expressed the opinion by twenty-four votes to five that there had been a breach of Article 6. The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.
The Government asked the Court, as their primary submission, to rule that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was not applicable to the case and, in the alternative, to hold that there had been no breach of it.
