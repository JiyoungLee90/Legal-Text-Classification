The case originated in an application (no. 32228/11) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Alija Prazina (“the first applicant”) and Mr Armin Prazina (“the second applicant”), on 19 April 2011.
The applicants were represented by Ms S. Poropat, a lawyer practising in Vogošća. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Ms M. Mijić.
On 31 January 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The first applicant lives in Sarajevo. He is the grandfather of the second applicant. The second applicant was born in 1986 and lives in Sarajevo.
On 10 November 2005 the second applicant initiated administrative proceedings in order to obtain recognition of the veteran status of his late father. His request was rejected on 12 December 2005. The second applicant appealed on an unknown date in December 2005 or January 2006.
On 26 January 2006 the competent Ministry upheld the first-instance decision.
On 21 January 2008 the Sarajevo Cantonal Court quashed the decisions of 12 December 2005 and 26 January 2006, and remitted the case to the first-instance body. In the new proceedings, the second applicant’s request was again rejected. The last decision was given by the Sarajevo Cantonal Court on 25 September 2012. It was served on the second applicant on 23 October 2012.
In the meantime, on 10 October 2012, the Constitutional Court found a breach of the second applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time. It did not award any damages.
