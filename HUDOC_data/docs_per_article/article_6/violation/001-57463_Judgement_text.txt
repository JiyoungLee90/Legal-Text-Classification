The Corigliano case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission"). The case originated in an application (no. 8304/78) against the  lodged with the Commission on 20 July 1978 under Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention by an Italian national, Mr. Clemente Corigliano.
The Commission’s request was lodged with the registry of the Court on 20 July 1981, within the period of three months laid down by Articles 32 § 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47). The request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the  recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request is to obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the case disclose a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1).
By Order dated 20 July 1981, the President of the Court referred the Corigliano case to the Chamber constituted to hear the case of Foti and others (Rule 21 § 6 of the Rules of Court). This Chamber included, as ex officio members, Mr. C. Russo, the elected judge of Italian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. G. Wiarda, President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). The five other members, chosen by lot on 30 May 1981, were Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert, Mr. D. Evrigenis, Mr. J. Pinheiro Farinha, Mr. E. García de Enterría and Sir Vincent Evans (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43).
Mr. Wiarda, who had assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Italian Government ("the Government") and of the Delegate of the Commission regarding the procedure to be followed. On 6 August 1981, he directed that the time-limits granted to the Agent and the Delegate under the Order of 15 June 1981 in the case of Foti and others should also apply to the Corigliano case. The Agent accordingly had until 31 October 1981 to lodge a memorial and the Delegate was entitled to reply in writing within two months from the date of the transmission of the Government’s memorial to him by the Registrar.
On 3 November, the President extended the first of these time-limits to 16 November. The official French text of the Government’s memorial was filed at the registry on 23 November.
On 21 January 1982, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would present his observations at the hearings.
On 4 February, having consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission, the President directed that the oral proceedings should open on 21 April.
The hearings were held in public on 21 April at the Human Rights Building, . Immediately before their opening, the Chamber had held a preparatory meeting and had authorised the use of Italian by the person assisting the Delegate of the Commission (Rule 27 § 3).
There appeared before the Court:
- for the Government
- for the Commission
The Court heard their submissions and statements as well as their replies to its questions.
On various dates between 15 December 1981 and 17 August 1982, the Registrar received from the Commission and the Government, respectively, several documents and items of information requested by or on behalf of the Chamber or provided by the Commission or the Government on their own initiative. This material included two letters from the applicant to the Commission (23 April and 20 May 1980), the memorials of the Government to the Commission (March 1979, January and May 1980) and the verbatim record of the hearing on 12 December 1980 before the Commission.
At the deliberations held on 22 and 23 November 1982, Mr. R. Bernhardt, first substitute judge, replaced Mr. E. García de Enterría, who was prevented from attending (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1).
As to the exact dates of the facts, there are uncertainties and gaps in the evidence in the case- file which the efforts of the Court, and in particular the questions it put to the persons appearing before it, have not entirely succeeded in removing. Subject to that reservation, the facts may be summarised as follows:
Mr. Clemente Corigliano, an Italian national born in 1921, lives in Reggio Calabria, where he practises as a lawyer.
In March 1973, during demonstrations in Reggio, the police arrested Mr. Santo Amodeo in a shop belonging to Mr. Corigliano and in the latter’s presence.
On 29 March, the applicant gave evidence at Mr. Amodeo’s trial before the . His evidence directly contradicted that of the police officers who had made the arrest. The Court upheld their version of the facts.
On 2 April, Mr. Corigliano lodged a complaint with the Reggio public prosecutor’s office (pubblico ministero) against two judicial officers in that town: Mr. Giuseppe Viola, President of the Criminal Chamber of the , and Mr. Francesco Colicchia, assistant public prosecutor (sostituto procuratore della Repubblica); he accused them of various offences, in particular of having acted out of personal interest in the exercise of their duties and having deliberately failed to declare that the police report of the arrest was false.
Having been informed of the complaint, the public prosecutor (procuratore della Repubblica) decided to commence proceedings (elevava rubrica) against the applicant for aggravated slander (Articles 368 and 81 of the Penal Code). He did not, however, notify Mr. Corigliano of this.
On 21 April 1973, he requested the Court of Cassation to remit the case to another court; he relied on Article 60 - amended by Act no. 879 of 22 December 1980 - of the Code of Criminal Procedure, sub-paragraph 1 of which provided that (translation from the Italian):
"Where criminal proceedings are instituted against, or where an offence has been committed against, a judge or a member of the public prosecutor’s office, and the proceedings fall within the jurisdiction of the judicial institution to which he is attached, the Court of Cassation shall refer the case to another court of similar jurisdiction."
On 8 May, the public prosecutor (procuratore generale) attached to the Catanzaro Court of Appeal sent the case-file to the Court of Cassation, which by order of 2 July 1973 referred the case to the .
Mr. Corigliano received judicial notification (comunicazione giudiziaria) on 7 December 1973 that criminal proceedings had been brought against him under Articles 368 and 81 of the Penal Code and that he was entitled to appoint a defence lawyer within three days.
There were two stages in the investigation of the case : the first ended in a discharge and the second - following an appeal by the public prosecutor’s office - in the applicant’s committal for trial.
During the initial stage of the investigation, Mr. Corigliano on three occasions challenged the jurisdiction of the  before the Court of Cassation.
On 11 January 1974, he alleged that all the procedural acts to date were void. This first appeal on a point of law was held to be inadmissible on 22 March.
On 3 February 1975, the applicant brought a second cassation appeal, alleging a conflict of jurisdiction between the Regional Courts of Messina and , where other proceedings were pending against him. The Court of Cassation declared the appeal inadmissible on 3 October.
On 5 October 1975, Mr. Corigliano brought a third cassation appeal, seeking to join the proceedings pending against him in  and . On 16 October, he was informed that his appeal had not been registered and that the joinder of proceedings fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the trial court (Article 48 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).
The public prosecutor’s office in  originally conducted the investigation of the case itself in accordance with the "summary" procedure (Article 389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). It heard the applicant, Mr. Viola and Mr. Colicchia on 17 December 1973. Following Mr. Corigliano’s refusal to appoint a defence lawyer, the public prosecutor’s office forwarded the case-file on 18 December to the competent judge so that the latter could carry out a "formal" preliminary investigation.
On 22 April 1975, the case-file was sent back to the  so that evidence could be taken from the applicant on commission. On 5 June, that Court declared that it lacked jurisdiction and returned the case-file to the . On 21 June and then on 12 December, Mr. Corigliano was summoned to appear before the  investigating judge, who questioned him on 26 June and 22 December 1975.
On 19 February 1977, the file was transmitted to the public prosecutor’s office which asked for further investigation to be carried out. On 2 March, it requested a copy of the judgment delivered on 29 March 1973 by the  against Mr. Amodeo; this was received on 31 March. On 9 April, it sought a further hearing of the judicial officers complained of by the applicant; Mr. Colicchia was heard on 16 June. The report of Mr. Amodeo’s arrest, also at the request of the public prosecutor’s office, was forwarded by the Reggio police authorities on 9 January 1978 and entered in the case-file.
Finally, on 11 January, the public prosecutor’s office requested the investigating judge to hear the police officer who had drawn up the report and had gone to live in  in the meantime; he was heard on 20 January.
On the same day, the judge sent the case-file to the public prosecutor’s office so that the latter could present its final submissions. They were presented on 6 February.
The investigating judge issued an order discharging the applicant which was filed at the registry on 2 March; on 13 March 1978, the case-file was sent to the public prosecutor’s office.
On 16 March 1978, the public prosecutor’s office appealed against this order (Article 387 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The applicant was notified on 28 March. The "grounds of appeal" were entered on 4 April and the following day the case-file was forwarded to the investigation chamber of the Messina Court of Appeal. The latter decided on 7 July to commit the accused for trial; its decision was lodged in the registry on 11 July 1978.
Trial proceedings
On 7 August 1978, the file was transmitted to the . On 6 February 1979, the applicant received a summons to appear at the hearing on 30 March.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the  gave him a suspended sentence of eighteen months’ imprisonment.
The applicant appealed on the same day. The Appeal Court of Messina, which had received the file on 18 June 1979, acquitted the applicant at a hearing on 19 February 1980.
On 29 October 1973, Mr. Corigliano lodged a first application (no. 6481/74) in which he complained, inter alia, of the rejection of his challenge of a judge, and of criminal proceedings instituted against him for the aggravated slander of a judicial officer. The Commission declared it inadmissible on 12 December 1974 on the ground that it was incompatible with the provisions of the Convention and was manifestly ill-founded (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention) (art. 27-2).
In a second application, lodged on 21 June 1975 (no. 7223/75), Mr. Corigliano relied on Articles 6 and 13 (art. 6, art. 13) of the Convention: he complained of two judgments of the Court of Cassation, one rejecting an objection that Articles 65, first paragraph, and 66, first paragraph, of the Code of Criminal Procedure were unconstitutional, and the other finding that the applicant did not have a personal right to the proper administration of justice but merely a "legitimate interest". This application was declared inadmissible by the Commission on 16 May 1977 on the ground that it was incompatible with the provisions of the Convention.
The third application, lodged on 20 July 1978 (no. 8304/78), referred to the two previous applications and sought to establish that it contained relevant new information within the meaning of Article 27 § 1 (b) (art. 27-1-b) of the Convention. Mr. Corigliano alleged a two-fold violation of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1): the investigation chamber of the Messina Court of Appeal was not "an independent and impartial tribunal established by law", as one of its members had sat on the  at the same time as Judge Viola; and the "reasonable time" had been exceeded.
On 2 October 1979, the Commission declared the application admissible in so far as it concerned the length of the proceedings.
The applicant wrote in a letter of 23 April 1980 to the Commission that he wished to withdraw his application, but, on 20 May, stated that he was retracting his withdrawal. On 17 July, the Commission decided to continue its examination of the case.
In its report of 16 March 1981 (Article 31 of the Convention) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there was a violation of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1).
