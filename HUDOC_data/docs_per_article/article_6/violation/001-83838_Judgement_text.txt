The State or municipal authority retains ownership of the property but the enterprise may exercise in respect of that property the right of economic control or operative management (Article 113 § 2).
The manager of a unitary enterprise is appointed by, and reports to, the owner (Article 113 § 4). The owner has the right to re-organise or liquidate the enterprise. The owner's consent is required for any transaction that may lead to encumbrance or alienation of the property.
