The applicants complained that section 6 of Law no. 140 of 15 April 1985 (“Law no. 140/1985”), as interpreted by Law no. 244 of 24 December 2007 (“Law no. 244/2007”), had constituted a legislative interference with pending proceedings which had been in breach of their right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention.
The applicants were represented by Mr G. Stramandinoli, a lawyer practising in Turin.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr L. D’Ascia, State Attorney.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
All the applicants fall into one of the categories listed in Law no. 336 of 24 May 1970 (“Law no. 336/1970”) (veterans, disabled war veterans, war widows, civilian victims of war), either directly or because they are heirs of the persons entitled.
By virtue of section 6 of Law no. 140/1985, the State introduced a monthly increase in the pensions of persons belonging to one of the categories provided for by Law no. 336/1970, an increase in the amount of 30,000 Italian lira (ITL – 15.49 euros (EUR)).
Following the applicants’ retirement, the National Social Security Agency (Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale – INPS) recognised that all of them were entitled to the pension increase from the date when they were eligible to claim their pensions.
Between 4 February 2002 and 1 March 2006 the applicants brought several administrative actions against the INPS to have the automatic adjustment of the increase in line with the cost of living (perequazione automatica) calculated from the year in which the Law had entered into force (1985), rather than from the date when they had become eligible to claim their pensions. The INPS dismissed all of the applicants’ actions.
Following the dismissal of their administrative actions, between 28 July 2005 and 30 March 2007, by means of individual applications, the applicants instituted judicial proceedings before the Turin Tribunal.
Up until the end of 2007 the Turin Tribunal and the Turin Court of Appeal always ruled in favour of the applicants, obliging the INPS to calculate the adjustment on the increase from the year of the entry into force of the Law. Such an interpretation had also been confirmed by the Court of Cassation in its judgment no. 14285/2005 of 4 May 2005 (“judgment no. 14285/2005”) concerning an individual in the applicants’ position.
On 1 January 2008 Law no. 244/2007 entered into force. Section 2(505) of that Law provided for an authentic interpretation of section 6(3) of Law no. 140/1985, establishing that the latter had to be interpreted as meaning that the increase provided for in section 6(1) had to be adjusted from the time it was granted to entitled persons (upon their retirement).
On 5 December 2008, by means of its judgment 401 (“judgment no. 401/2008”), the Constitutional Court declared the question of the constitutionality of Law no. 244/2007 ill-founded. According to the Constitutional Court, the Law was in conformity with the principle of equality and reasonableness.
The following domestic courts applied the new Law or endorsed the interpretation given by the Constitutional Court and dismissed the claims of all the applicants: the Turin Court of Appeal in the case of Mr T. Maggio on 19 February 2009; and the Court of Cassation in respect of the rest of the applicants, by means of several judgments issued between 9 June 2009 and 19 July 2011.
The relevant parts of section 6 of Law no. 140/1985 provide:
“Individuals belonging to the categories provided for by Law no. 336 of 24 May 1970, ... are entitled, upon request, to a reversible increase in the respective pension which has been determined in accordance with the ordinary rules, up to a limit of 30,000 Italian lira per month.
...
The increase provided for in the preceding subsections shall be subject to the rules on automatic adjustment.
...”
Section 2(505) of Law no. 244/2007 reads as follows:
Authentic interpretation of the provisions
concerning the increase in pension rights for veterans
“Section 6(3) of Law no. 140 of 15 April 1985 is to be interpreted as meaning that the increase provided for in section 6(1) is to be adjusted from the time when that increase is granted to the persons entitled to it.”
The gist of judgment no. 14285/2005 of the Court of Cassation can be summarised as follows.
The interpretation given by the INPS to section 6 of Law no. 140/1985 – according to which the adjustment of the increase in line with the cost of living should start from the moment when the pension was granted, and not from the entry into force of Law no. 140/1985 – was not acceptable. Indeed, there was no reasonable justification for applying such an interpretation, which clearly impinged upon the principle of equality as enshrined in Article 3 of the Constitution, as this would create an unreasonable difference in treatment between pensioners.
Judgment no. 401/2008 of the Constitutional Court, in its main thrust, held as follows.
The applicants’ assumption that the right to the pension increase had to be independent from the right to the pension itself was not justified by the rules governing the increase in question. Until the persons concerned became eligible to claim their pensions, no entitlement could arise for them, even if they belonged to one of the categories provided for by the Law. According to the Constitutional Court, if the legislature had wanted to recognise an independent right, it would have ordered the relevant sums to be allocated immediately, on a periodic basis, to all those falling within the categories, irrespective of their social security status.
After Law no. 244/2007 had entered into force and judgment no. 401/2008 of the Constitutional Court had become enforceable, several judgments dismissed the applicants’ complaints, including the Court of Cassation’s judgments of 30 December 2009, nos. 27786, 27798, 27800 and 27812 (concerning Mr Filli, Mr Castro, Ms Delton and Ms Caenazzo). Those judgments held as follows.
The interpretation previously given by the Court of Cassation in its judgment no. 14285/05 (see paragraph 16 above) did not comply with the literal wording and rationale of Law no. 140/1985. In particular, as held in judgment no. 401/2008 of the Constitutional Court, the legislature had intended for the increase in question to be a pension increase, and not an independent benefit. Therefore, it was not possible to envisage it being adjusted in line with the cost of living from the time when the relevant pension did not yet exist (from the time of the entry into force of Law no. 140/1985). In dismissing the applicants’ complaints, the Court of Cassation therefore held that the question of constitutional legitimacy raised by the applicants, as well as the entry into force of Law no. 244/2007, were completely irrelevant. In fact, the disputes had to be resolved on the basis that the increase had to be adjusted in line with the cost of living upon retirement, and not from the entry into force of Law no. 140/1985.
