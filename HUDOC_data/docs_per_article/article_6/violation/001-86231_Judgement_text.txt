On 22 February 2001 and 20 March 2001 the applicant appealed. Relying on the evidence in the case he argued that the first-instance court had erred in the legal qualification of his action. He had acted in self-defence and his action did not constitute a criminal offence.
On 6 June 2001 the Supreme Court, referring to the evidence included in the file, upheld the first-instance conclusion that the applicant had committed murder. The Supreme Court accepted that the applicant had initially acted in legitimate defence, in that he had protected his sister from their father’s attacks. In the subsequent stage, however, after he had separated his father from his sister, the applicant had inflicted more than 50 injuries on his father using a machete that was 45 centimetres in length. That action had been in excess of legitimate defence. After the attack the applicant had tied up his wounded father, and then rolled him up in a carpet without attempting to provide assistance. In view of the circumstances of the case the Supreme Court reduced the applicant’s sentence to seven years’ imprisonment.
