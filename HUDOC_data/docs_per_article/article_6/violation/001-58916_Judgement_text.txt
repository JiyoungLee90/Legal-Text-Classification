The case was referred to the Court by a Danish national, G.J. (“the applicant”) on 28 October 1999 pursuant to former Article 48 § 1 (e) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental freedoms (“the Convention”). It originated in an application (no. 21156/93) against Luxembourg lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention, on 8 September 1992.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr Tyge Trier, a lawyer practising in Copenhagen. The respondent Government (“the Government”) were represented first by Maître Georges Ravarani, subsequently by Maître Albert Wildgen and then by Maître Lynn Spielmann, as Agent.
The case concerns the duration of the proceedings concerning the liquidation of the limited liability company in which the applicant owned 90% of the shares and whether these proceedings were terminated within a “reasonable time” as required by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
On 8 December 1999 a Panel of the Grand Chamber decided, in accordance with Article 5 § 4 of Protocol No. 11 taken together with Rules 100 § 1 and 24 § 6 of the Rules of Court, that the case should be dealt with by a Chamber constituted within one of the sections of the Court. Subsequently, the President of the Court assigned the case to the Second Section. The Chamber constituted within the Section included ex officio Mr M. Fischbach, the judge elected in respect of Luxembourg (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 26 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court) and Mr A.B. Baka, Mr G. Bonello, Mrs V. Strážnická, Mr P. Lorenzen, Mrs M. Tsatsa-Nikolovska and Mr E. Levits (Rule 26 § 1 (b)).
On 16 December 1999 the President invited the parties to submit memorials in the case (Rule 59 § 3). The applicant was further invited to submit his claims for just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention. (Rule 60 § 1). The applicant filed his reply on 15 March 2000. The Government filed their memorial on 14 March 2000 and filed their reply to the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction on 20 April 2000. The Danish Government were invited on 9 November 1999 to state whether they wished to intervene in accordance with Article 36 of the Convention and Rule 61 of the Rules of Court. The Danish Government did not wish to do so.
In 1967 the applicant moved to Luxembourg. In 1975 he founded a limited liability company for the purpose of trading in fur and leather products. The applicant held 90% of the company’s shares and his wife the remaining 10%.
The firm went through a period of considerable expansion but soon experienced certain problems in respect of the tax assessments made by the Internal Revenue Service, in particular concerning the period from 1978 to 1980. Eventually the applicant decided in 1986, to liquidate the company and it furthermore appears that it was the intention that a new limited liability company should be established as of 15 May 1987 and managed by the applicant’s two sons.
The applicant left Luxembourg in April 1987 and took up residence in the United Kingdom. Subsequently he moved to Denmark. The intended voluntary liquidation of his company ended on 14 May 1987. On that date the Commercial Court of first instance (le tribunal d’arrondissement de et à Luxembourg siégeant en matière commerciale) examined the situation of the applicant’s company and found, on the basis of the available material, that it had stopped honouring its financial obligations and that its financial situation endangered the rights of its creditors. Thus, the court declared the company bankrupt, appointed a judge (juge-commissaire) and an official receiver to sort out the estate and settle the accounts. The applicant did not appeal against this decision but on 18 May 1987 he informed the official receiver of his new address in the United Kingdom and expressed his willingness to submit further information should this prove necessary. On 22 May 1987 the applicant sent a letter to the Danish Embassy in
On 20 May 1987 the official receiver submitted a request to the Commercial Court for authorisation to sell the applicant’s company’s assets.
Following a public hearing on 26 May 1987 during which the court heard the juge-commissaire as well as the official receiver, but in the absence of the applicant, the court authorised the receiver to sell the insolvent company’s assets in order to satisfy the interests of the creditors to the extent possible.
By 2 October 1987 44 creditors had submitted claims in the liquidation proceedings and the official receiver and the juge-commissaire had accepted 32 claims whereas they contested the remaining 12 claims. By 1 April 1988 5 further claims had been submitted of which 4 were accepted and 1 contested.
In the meantime, in August 1987, the official receiver had been informed that court proceedings were pending in Germany regarding, inter alia, a bank guarantee involving the applicant’s company. These proceedings came to an end on 10 May 1990 following which a certain amount of money was transferred to the estate in bankruptcy.
The official receiver subsequently continued the liquidation of the estate. By letters of 5 September 1991 he informed those creditors whose claims were contested that the assets of the estate in bankruptcy would not even be sufficient to cover the preferential claims and thus requested them to renounce their claims in order to be able to close the proceedings. These creditors were further requested to reply by 15 September 1991 and informed that disputes as to their claims would be brought before the Commercial Court for determination. No disputes were, however, brought before the Commercial Court for determination but it appears that certain correspondence between the official receiver and some creditors continued through November 1991.
In November 1991 one of the applicant’s sons, who was still living in Luxembourg, fell ill. As the applicant wanted to see him he contacted the Commercial Court and enquired whether the proceedings concerning the liquidation of his company had come to an end and whether anything would impede his free entry into and departure from Luxembourg.
The applicant’s son died on 12 November 1991.
On 21 November 1991 the juge-commissaire of the Commercial Court informed the applicant that the proceedings were still pending. Upon request the Danish Embassy in Luxembourg informed the applicant, on 11 December 1991, that the official receiver and the court were of the opinion that the proceedings would be concluded before the end of the year or by January 1992 at the latest.
However, on 6 March 1992 the Embassy informed the applicant that the proceedings were still pending, inter alia, due to the fact that the competent court was, according to the official receiver, overburdened with work. The official receiver expected, however, the proceedings to come to an end before Easter 1992. Finally, on 18 May 1992 the Embassy confirmed that the case was still pending.
On 18 January 1993 the applicant was informed by the official receiver that the company’s accounts would be finalised during a court meeting to be held on 22 January 1993. It appears that the accounts showed a deficit of approximately 30 million Luxembourg francs (LUF). The applicant did not appear at the court meeting.
On 22 March 1993 the official receiver informed the Commercial Court that the liquidation of the company had come to an end and he requested the court to close the case. On 14 May 1993 the Commercial Court declared the liquidation of the applicant’s limited liability company closed.
The applicant applied to the Commission on 8 September 1992, complaining, inter alia, about the length of the proceedings concerning the liquidation of his company.
The Commission declared the above complaint admissible on 22 October 1996. Certain other complaints were declared inadmissible. In its report of 8 September 1999 (former Article 31), the Commission expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
