The case originated in an application (no. 34339/03) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mrs Olga Stepanivna Sikorska (“the applicant”), on 29 August 2003.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Valeriya Lutkovska.
On 8 April 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the non-enforcement of the judgment in the applicant's favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

From 1988 to 2001 the applicant worked as a teacher at the Zhytomyr Orphanage (Житомирський обласний будинок дитини; hereafter “the Orphanage”).
On 27 September 2001 the Bogunsky District Court of Zhytomir (hereinafter “the Bogunsky Court”) ordered the Orphanage to pay the applicant a total of UAH 3,483.60 (an equivalent of EUR 508.25) in compensation for salary and social benefits arrears (see, in this respect, Kechko v. Ukraine, no. 63134/00, §§ 9-11, 8 November 2005).
In a letter of 10 October 2003, the Zhytomyr Regional Department of Justice informed the applicant that the judgment in her favour could not be enforced due to the debtor's lack of funds. It also pointed out that the 2003 State Budget did not preview the expenditure for teachers' social benefits and that the Zhytomyr Regional State Administration applied to the Ministry of Finance for a loan for the payment of the debt to the applicant.
The judgment of 27 September 2001 remains unenforced.
In November 2001 the applicant instituted proceedings against the Orphanage seeking her reinstatement and compensation for the loss of salary. On 31 May 2002 the  rejected this claim as unsubstantiated. On 12 September 2002 the Zhytomyr Regional Court of Appeal upheld this judgment. On 12 February 2003 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's cassation appeal.
