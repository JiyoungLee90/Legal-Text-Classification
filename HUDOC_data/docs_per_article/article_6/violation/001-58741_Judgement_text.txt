The case originated in an application (No. 39972/98) against the Republic of Cyprus lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Cypriot national, Mr Christos Papadopoulos, on 9 February 1998.
The applicant was represented by Mr C. Clerides and Mr N. Pirilides, lawyers practising in Cyprus. The Government of Cyprus (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr A. Markides, Attorney General of the Republic of Cyprus.
The applicant alleged that his case had not been heard within the “reasonable time” required by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber called upon to examine the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted according to the provision of Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 28 September 1999 the Chamber declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits.
On 19 July 1994 the applicant filed an action in the District Court of Limassol against four defendants claiming, inter alia, arrears of salary, payment for services rendered and damages for unfair dismissal. Because of the amount claimed, the action had to be heard by the Full Court which, moreover, had to be composed of the President of the District Court and another District Court judge.
The first hearing of the case was set for 17 October 1995. After a number of adjournments at the behest of the parties, and more than ten hearings, on 28 February 1997 the court heard the final addresses of all parties concerned. Judgment was reserved. In particular, on 17 October 1995, the hearing was adjourned until 1 February 1996 owing to the withdrawal of the lawyer of some of the defendants, and then until 22 February due to the appointment of a new lawyer. It continued on 19 March, 9 April and 13 May 1996, but on 12 June it was adjourned again due to the absence abroad of the lawyer of some of the defendants. It resumed on 2, 3 and 4 July 1996. On 26 September 1996 it was adjourned at the request of both lawyers until 21 October 1996, and again on 11 November 1996 due to the fact that one of the lawyers of the defendants had business elsewhere. The hearing continued on 11 and 12 December 1996 and 15 January 1997.
However, on 30 June 1997 the President of the District Court of Limassol and member of the Full Court which had tried the applicant's case was appointed by the Government to the Public Service Commission, a body responsible for the appointment and promotion of civil servants.
The new President of the District Court of Limassol fixed the applicant's case for directions on 2 October 1997. On that date the applicant requested that the reserved judgment be rendered. However, the President of the District Court suggested to the applicant that he address the Supreme Court.
On 6 October 1997 the applicant sent a letter to the President and the members of the Supreme Court of Cyprus asking them to give directions to the District Court of Limassol to issue the reserved judgment. In support of his request, he referred to relevant case-law of the United Kingdom courts, as there was no pertinent case-law of the Supreme Court of Cyprus.
A new hearing for directions was fixed by the President of the Supreme Court of Cyprus on 6 November 1997, but no decision was taken pending the reply of the Supreme Court to the applicant's request.
On 7 November 1997 the Supreme Court, via its Chief Registrar, advised the applicant that the matter, being judicial, should be referred to the competent court.
Another hearing for directions was held on 27 November 1997. The applicant asked the President of the District Court of Limassol to give the court directions to proceed with the reserved judgment.
On 5 December 1997 the President of the District Court of Limassol ruled that he was not able to issue such a direction because, according to the general principles and the case-law, the court which was to issue a judgment should first hear and see the witnesses in order to be able to assess their testimony, especially in cases where there was a conflict of evidence. In the applicant's case there was a conflict of evidence and the court needed to assess which evidence it would accept and which it would not. The new President of the District Court of Limassol had neither seen nor heard any of the witnesses and, as a result, he could not assess the evidence which had already been given. It followed that the President was not able to issue the reserved judgment on his own or together with the second member of the Full Court which had reserved the judgment. Nor was the President able to give directions to the second member of that Full Court to issue the reserved judgment on her own even though she had heard and seen all the witnesses. In these circumstances, the President of the District Court of Limassol decided that the applicant's case should be reheard from the beginning (de novo) and fixed a hearing date for 11 February 1998.
On that date the applicant’s lawyer asked for an adjournment due to sudden illness. On 18 March 1998 he asked for a further adjournment because of other business. On 8 April 1998 the lawyer asked for another short adjournment which the court granted until 18 June 1998. After six hearings, the testimony of the applicant and his three witnesses was completed on 21 July 1998. The defendants and their six witnesses gave evidence from 17 September 1998 until 4 December 1998 at ten hearings. On 18 September, the court granted a further request for an adjournment because the lawyers of both parties wished to attend the annual general assembly of the Bar association. Final addresses were heard on 8 January 1999 and the District Court of Limassol delivered judgment on 26 April 1999.
The defendants appealed against this judgment to the Supreme Court where the case was still pending when the applicant submitted his observations on the merits to the Court on 29 November 1999.
