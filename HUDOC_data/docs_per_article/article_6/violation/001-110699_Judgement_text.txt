In all five cases, the applicants’ flats were unlawfully occupied by internally displaced persons (“IDPs”) from different regions of  under occupation by Armenian military forces following the ArmenianAzerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.
The applicants lodged separate civil actions before the domestic courts seeking the eviction of the IDPs from their flats.
On the dates indicated in the Appendix (Table I), the applicants’ claims were granted by different domestic courts, which ordered the eviction of the IDPs from their flats.
The respective judgments became final and enforceable. However, the IDP families refused to comply with those judgments and despite the applicants’ complaints to various authorities, the judgments were not enforced.
After the communication of application no. 7867/09 to the respondent Government, on 16 October 2010 the judgment in favour of Ms Lala Gasimova was enforced.
