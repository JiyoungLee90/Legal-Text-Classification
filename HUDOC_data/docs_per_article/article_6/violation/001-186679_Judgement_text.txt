The case originated in an application (no. 37726/11) against Montenegro lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Montenegrin nationals, Mr Hasan Lekić (“the first applicant”) and Mr Gano Lekić (“the second applicant”), on 5 June 2011.
The Montenegrin Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Valentina Pavličić.
On 16 December 2015 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings in question was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
On 14 March 2016 the first applicant’s widow, Ms Badema Lekić, informed the Court that her spouse had died on 11 November 2013 and she expressed the wish to pursue the application before the Court. She also informed the Court that she wished to be represented by the second applicant and submitted a power of attorney to that effect.
The applicants were born in 1949 and 1950, respectively, and lived in Podgorica, where the second applicant still lives.
On 25 July 2000 the applicants’ mother instituted civil proceedings against Podgorička banka Societe Generale Group ad Podgorica (hereinafter “respondent”) seeking the payment of her savings, which she had deposited with the respondent’s legal predecessor Titogradska osnovna banka Titograd.
On an unspecified date the applicants continued the above-mentioned proceedings in their mother’s stead as she had passed away in the meantime.
On 25 July 2008 the First Instance Court in Podgorica ruled partly in favour of the applicants.
On 19 January 2010 the High Court in Podgorica reversed the firstinstance judgment by dismissing the applicants’ claims in their entirety. This judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court on 19 October 2010.
On 5 December 2010 the Supreme Court’s judgment was served on the applicants.
On 3 February 2011 the applicants lodged a constitutional appeal.
On 12 April 2012 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicants’ appeal, which decision was served on the applicants on 29 May 2012.
