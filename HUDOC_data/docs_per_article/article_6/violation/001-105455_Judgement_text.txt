The case originated in four applications (nos. 29292/02, 32538/05, 24265/07 and 21985/08) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Romanian nationals, Sari-Charlotte Glasberg, Gheorghe Mihai, Constantin Chirilă, S.C. Bălaşa S.R.L. and Ion Bălaşa, (“the applicants”). The particulars of each applicant are indicated in the appended table. The applicant in application no. 29292/02 has also the German nationality; the German Government did not exercise their right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention). The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 15 September, 9 November, 14 October 2009 and 8 October 2008 respectively, the President of the Third Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (former Article 29 § 3). In accordance with Protocol No. 14, after informing the respondent Government, the applications were assigned to a Committee of three Judges.
