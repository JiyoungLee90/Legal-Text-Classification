By partial judgment (Teilurteil) of 29 August 2000 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's claim in so far as it concerned damages for the time after 31 May 1980. It found that the applicant had failed to prove that any illness after the end of July 1981 had been caused by the alleged incorrect evaluation of his examination papers. In this respect, the court followed the expert's opinion that any illness which had been caused by the evaluation had subsided after a maximum period of 1.5 years and that any following illness was solely caused by the structure of the applicant's personality. According to the Court of Appeal, the expert's reasoning duly took into account the medical statements submitted by the applicant.
