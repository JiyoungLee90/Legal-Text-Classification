The case originated in three applications (nos. 22419/05, 26493/06 and 41910/06) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Russian nationals (“the applicants”), on the dates indicated in the Appendix.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G.Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 8 September 2009 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants are Russian citizens whose details are tabulated in the Appendix.
The applicants brought court actions against the authorities, seeking to recover the monetary value of the State promissory notes for purchasing of Russian-made cars. On the dates listed in the Appendix the domestic courts granted their actions and awarded them different amounts in compensation, payable by the Ministry of Finance. The judgments were upheld on appeal and became final on the dates listed below. They remained unenforced.
On various dates the supervisory review courts, upon applications from the Ministry of Finance and by way of supervisory-review proceedings, quashed the first-instance and the appeal judgments in the applicants’ favour, re-examined the cases and dismissed the applicants’ respective actions, having found that the lower courts had incorrectly interpreted and applied the domestic law.
The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure at the material time is summed up in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007).
