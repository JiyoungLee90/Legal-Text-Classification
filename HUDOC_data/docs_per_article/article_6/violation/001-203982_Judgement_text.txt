On 2 March 2014 the applicants participated in a political rally in Moscow. Following the aforementioned manifestation, they were arrested and convicted of an administrative offence.
The applicants’ details are set out in the appended table.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 1 March 2014, after the “Maidan” protest and the subsequent political events in Ukraine, the Council of the Federation of the Federal Assembly (the upper house of the Russian Parliament) approved the President’s request to use armed forces on the territory of Ukraine.
As a response to this decision, on 2 March 2014 a rally was held on Manezhnaya Square in Moscow. The city authorities had not been duly notified about the rally.
According to the report of the Ombudsman’s representative, by 2.30 p.m. around 300 people gathered on the square. At first the protesters stood silently holding homemade posters “No to war” and “No to intervention in Crimea” as well as white paper doves. At around 3 p.m. the police arrived. Half an hour later the protesters started to chant “No to war”. The police officers arrested those chanting first, then some of the protesters who were standing by. By 4 p.m. the rally participants had been pushed back to the Hotel Moscow, where the arrests continued. According to the Ombudsman’s representative, around 100 people were apprehended by the police.
The applicants were apprehended during the rally of 2 March 2014. They were transferred to various police stations of Moscow where the relevant administrative records were drawn up. The administrative-offence records were based on the reports and explanations of the police officers who had arrested the applicants. On the same day, once the administrative records were finalised the applicants were released.
On various dates the domestic courts convicted the applicants under Article 20.2 § 5 of the Code of Administrative Offences and sentenced them to fines. Ms Shtyrkova (application no. 7542/15) was ordered to pay 5,000 Russian roubles (RUB). Mr Kuznetsov (application no. 11474/15) was ordered to pay RUB 15,000. Other applicants had to pay a fine of RUB 10,000.
Relying on the administrative records, the reports and explanations of the police officers the domestic courts found the applicants liable for violating the established procedure for the conduct of a public assembly on account of their participation in the unauthorised rally. In particular, the courts considered unlawful that some of the applicants shouted slogans and/or failed to verify whether the gathering was legitimate.
As submitted by the applicants, Ms Vyatkina, Mr Filyushkin, Mr Kulikov, Mr Torgashev, Mr Kuznetsov, Ms Mitrokhina (applications nos. 3541/15, 7110/15, 7386/15, 7430/15, 11474/15, 51114/15, respectively) did not pay the fines.
For a summary of the relevant domestic law see Navalnyy v. Russia [GC] (nos. 29580/12 and 4 others, §§ 46-47, 15 November 2018).
The domestic legal provisions governing administrative transfer (escorting) and detention are also set out in the case of Butkevich v. Russia (see no. 5865/07, §§ 33-36, 13 February 2018).
According to Article 31.9 of the Code of Administrative Offences, if a decision imposing an administrative punishment is not enforced during two years from its entry into force, it can no longer be executed. The time when enforcement of such a decision is suspended or stayed is excluded from the aforementioned period.
