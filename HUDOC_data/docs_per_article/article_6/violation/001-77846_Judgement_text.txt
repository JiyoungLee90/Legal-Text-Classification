On 9 March 1993 the applicant brought an action in the Siófok District Court, claiming his share of the inheritance of his late father’s property (öröklési igény megállapítása). The District Court held hearings on 9 September, 23 November and 16 December 1993, and 3 February 1994.

Considering the first-instance decision as a partial judgment, it observed that several secondary claims were not examined, in respect of which the District Court proceedings were to be resumed. Simultaneously, the court quashed the decision of 26 January 2000, as a result of which the District Court was to continue the examination of those compensation claims as well.
Meanwhile, the applicant had introduced another claim concerning his statutory share of the estate (kötelesrész iránti igény), which was disjoined from the principal question pending before the XX/XXI/XXIII District Court on 14 January 2000 (see paragraph 8 above). On 23 March 2000 the competent bench of this court suspended the examination of the issue pending the outcome of the 1993 inheritance proceedings (see paragraphs 5 to 7 above).

It held hearings on 26 April and 3 July 2001. On that day, it dismissed part of the applicant’s claims and disjoined some others concerning the restoration of certain buildings (felépítmények helyreállítására vonatkozó kereseti kérelem).

The first instance proceedings concerning the disjoined claims resumed on 28 February 2002 and were suspended on 19 November 2002, pending the proceedings in respect of the statutory share (see paragraph 10 above).
After the final dismissal on 3 October 2000 of the applicant’s challenge to the will’s validity (see paragraph 9 above), the Siófok District Court resumed the 1993 proceedings (see paragraphs 5 to 7 above). It held hearings on 26 April, 28 June and 20 September 2001. On 31 October 2001 the District Court ordered the applicant to submit further evidence for his statements and better particulars of his claims. It held more hearings on 22 November 2001 and 7 February 2002. On 20 February 2002 it dismissed the applicant’s motion for bias. On 16 April 2002 the District Court gave judgment, ordering that the applicant’s ownership be registered in respect of part of the real properties belonging to the estate. It rejected the remainder of the claims. On 31 October 2002 the  amended this decision.
Following the delivery of the above final decision (see paragraph 12) concerning the 1993 case, the XX/XXI/XXIII District Court resumed the proceedings concerning the applicant’s statutory share of the estate on 18 June 2003 (see paragraph 10 above). On 8 July 2003 it discontinued the proceedings. On a procedural appeal, they were resumed on 20 April 2004. On that date, the District Court dismissed the applicant’s claim.
