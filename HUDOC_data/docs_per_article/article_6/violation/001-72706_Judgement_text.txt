The applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts to which he was a party was excessive.

In the re-examination proceedings, the applicant lodged several written submissions addressed to the first-instance court, the (renamed) Higher Labour and  (Višje delovno in social sodišče) and to different judges.
Of the three hearings held between 11 July 1994 and 3 February 1995, none was adjourned at the request of the applicant.
During the proceedings, the court appointed a medical expert. It appears that the applicant objected to the appointment and the Higher Labour and  rejected the objection on 6 October 1994.

On 23 September 1997 the court dismissed the applicant’s appeal.
The judgment was served on the applicant on 22 November 1997.
In the meantime, on 27 March 1997 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against all the courts involved in his case. It appears that on 15 December 1997 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal also against the Supreme Court’s judgment.
On 7 March 2000 the  (Ustavno sodišče) dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The decision was served on the applicant on 1 June 2000.
Despite the Court’s request, the applicant has not filed copies of his requests and the relevant decisions regarding the re-opening proceedings.

After the decision rejecting the request had been quashed on appeal and remitted for reconsideration, the court rejected the applicant’s request again. On 25 May 2000 the Higher Labour and  dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The decision was served on the applicant on 27 May 2000.

On 12 December 2001 the Ljubljana Labour and  rejected the applicant’s second request for reopening of the proceedings.
