The case originated in ten applications (nos. 25114/03, 11512/03, 9794/05, 37403/05, 13110/06, 19469/06, 42608/06, 44928/06, 44972/06, 45022/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by twelve Russian nationals (“the applicants”). The applicants’ names and the dates of their applications to the Court appear in the appended table.
The applicant Y. Shelestovskaya (no. 11512/03) was represented by Mr V. Gandzyuk, a lawyer practising in . The applicant V. Kashcheyev (no. 9794/05) was represented by Mr R. Zarbeyev, a lawyer practising in . The applicant N. Sobakar (no.13110/06) was represented by Mr I. Sivoldayev, a lawyer practising in . Other applicants were not represented by a lawyer.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev and Ms V. Milinchuk, former representatives of the Russian Federation at the Court, and by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the Court.
The applicants complained inter alia of non-enforcement of binding and enforceable judgments delivered in their favour between 2001 and 2006 and of their quashing in supervisory-review proceedings.
On various dates the President of the First Section decided to communicate these complaints to the respondent Government. It was also decided in all cases to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3). The Government objected to the joint examination of the admissibility and merits in several cases, but the Court rejected this objection.
The applicants’ names and other details are indicated in the appended table. All the applicants were active or retired servicemen at the material time.
On various dates they sued their employer military units, a military commissioner’s office or the competent federal ministries in courts for payment of monetary sums on account of their service in the military forces or some specific missions undertaken during this service, such as field works (case of Kulkov) or peace-keeping operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina (case of Shelestovskaya), Kosovo (cases of Biserov and others, Dubovov, Davydov and Pyshnograyev) or South Ossetia (case of Kashcheyev). The applicant Doroshok claimed compensation of health damage and severe injuries caused during his military mission in . The applicants Sobakar and Sereda claimed a recalculation of their pensions and a compensation of shortfalls in monthly payments made in the past.
The domestic courts granted the applicants’ claims (see dates of the judgments and sums awarded in the appended table). The judgments were not appealed against in cassation and became binding and enforceable on the dates indicated in the appended table. However, only one of these judgments was enforced (the judgment of 13 May 2003 in favour of V. Kashcheyev, see paragraph 12 below). All the other judgments, including the second judgment in favour of V. Kashcheyev delivered on 14 July 2006, were not enforced.
On various dates the Presidiums of higher courts decided, upon the defendant authorities’ requests for supervisory review, to quash the judgments in the applicants’ favour considering that the lower courts misapplied the material law (see details in the appended table). With the exception of two cases (Kulkov and Shelestovskaya), the higher courts dismissed the applicants’ claims in full by the same decisions.
In the case of Kulkov, the Presidium of the  quashed on 18 April 2002 the judgment in the applicant’s favour by way of supervisory review initiated by the President of this court. However, the judgment of 18 April 2002 was itself overruled by the Supreme Court of the  on 11 April 2003 and the first-instance judgment in the applicant’s favour was thus restored. It remained in force until it was quashed for a second time on 25 December 2003 by the Presidium of the  upon application of the defendant military unit. While dismissing the applicant’s claims for field allowance (RUB 70,675), the Presidium upheld the first-instance court’s decision as regards the award of the regional bonus to the applicant (RUB 1,112.33).
In the case of Shelestovskaya, the Presidium of the  quashed on 7 April 2004 the judgment in the applicant’s favour. However, the judgment of 7 April 2004 was itself overruled by the Supreme Court of the  on 12 August 2004 and the first-instance judgment in the applicant’s favour was thus restored. On 15 September 2004 the Presidium again quashed the latter judgment and awarded the applicant smaller amounts, i.e. RUB 270 in respect special allowance and RUB 250 in respect of legal aid. The Presidium dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s claims.
The first of the two judgments, which was delivered in favour of V. Kashcheyev on 13 May 2003 and became enforceable on 26 May 2003, was enforced on 15 September 2005. On 18 June 2007 the  awarded the applicant RUB 133,774.30 in respect of compensation for the inflation losses arising from this enforcement delay. On 26 December 2007 the authorities credited the latter amount on the applicant’s account.
The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure in the material time is summed up in the Court’s judgment in the case of Sobelin and others (see Sobelin and Others v. Russia, nos. 30672/03, 30673/03, 30678/03, 30682/03, 30692/03, 30707/03, 30713/03, 30734/03, 30736/03, 30779/03, 32080/03 and 34952/03, §§ 33-42, 3 May 2007).
In 2001-2005 the judgments delivered against the public authorities were executed in accordance with a special procedure established, inter alia, by the Government’s Decree No. 143 of 22 February 2001 and, subsequently, by Decree No. 666 of 22 September 2002, entrusting execution to the Ministry of Finance (see further details in Pridatchenko and Others v. , nos. 2191/03, 3104/03, 16094/03 and 24486/03, §§ 33-39, 21 June 2007). The Law of 27 December 2005 (No. 197-ФЗ) introduced a new Chapter in the Budget Code modifying this special procedure. The Law notably empowered the Federal Treasury to execute judgments against legal entities funded by the federal budget and the Ministry of Finance to execute judgments against the State. Under Article 242.2.6 of the Budget Code, the judgments must be executed within three months after receipt of the execution documents.
