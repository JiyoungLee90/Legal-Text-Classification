The case originated in an application (no. 33635/03) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Galina Vasilyevna Petrova (“the applicant”), on 23 September 2003.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mrs V. Lutkovska, succeeded by Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 15 March 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention concerning the non-enforcement of the judgment in the applicant's favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Chuguyev, the Kharkiv region. She is a former employee of the OJSC “Chuguyevskaya Toplivnaya Aparatura” (“the Company,” ВАТ “Чугуївська паливна апаратура”). At the material time the State owned 32.67% of the Company's shares. The Company was therefore subject to the Law of 29 November 2001 “on the Introduction of a Moratorium on the Forced Sale of Property.”
The background facts for the case are described in the case of Solovyeva v. Ukraine (no. 32547/03, §§ 7-11, 13 December 2005).
On 25 November 2002 the  (Чугуївський місцевий суд Харківської області) ordered the Company to pay the applicant UAH 1,939 in salary arrears. This judgment became final and on 9 January 2003 the enforcement writ was transferred to the Chuguyev Bailiffs' Service (Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Чугуївського міського управління юстиції) for enforcement.
On 10 July 2006 the award was fully paid to the applicant.
