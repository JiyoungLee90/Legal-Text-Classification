The case originated in an application (no. 44143/11) against Montenegro lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Montenegrin nationals, Mr Milan Novaković, Ms Draginja Proročić and Ms Mileva Lubarda (“the applicants”), on 6 July 2011.
The applicants were represented by Ms M. Novaković, a lawyer practising in Podgorica, and Ms D. Radulović, a lawyer practicing in Kotor. The Montenegrin Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms V. Pavličić.
On 3 December 2014 the applicant’s complaint concerning the excessive length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicants were born in 1925, 1927 and 1930, respectively, and live in Budva.
On 3 April 2001 the applicants lodged a civil claim with the Court of First Instance in Kotor seeking compensation for the property nationalised from their parents in 1948. On 16 July 2008 the Court of First Instance ruled against the applicants.
On 2 October 2009, the High Court in Podgorica upheld the decision of the first instance court on appeal.
On 19 January 2011 the Supreme Court of Montenegro rejected the applicants’ appeal on points of law, which decision was served on the applicants on 15 March 2011.
