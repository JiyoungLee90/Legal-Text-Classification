The case originated in five applications against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Ukrainian nationals (“the applicants”):

30785/06 lodged on 17 July 2006 by Mr Andrey Aleksandrovich Konyayev, who was born in 1969 and lives in Novogrodivka, Donetsk region, ;
32818/06 lodged on 1 August 2006 by Mrs Valentina Grigoryevna Kozlova, who was born in 1948 and lives in ;

Mrs Kozlova was represented before the Court by Mr V. Shulgin, a lawyer practising in .
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 15 October 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to communicate to the Government the applicants' complaints under Articles 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention, and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
On various dates each of the applicants received one or more final decisions awarding payments by companies (see appendix for details) in which the State holds at least 25% of the share capital, and instituted enforcement proceedings to collect the payments.
After those decisions had become final, insolvency or liquidation proceedings against the debtors were initiated. The State Bailiffs' Service then terminated the enforcement proceedings against them and transferred the applicants' writs of enforcement to the relevant liquidation commissions for further processing. Some of the debtors were finally liquidated.
In view of the lengthy non-enforcement of the decisions in their favour, some of the applicants (Mrs Gimadulina, Mr Konyayev and Mr Dankov) unsuccessfully sued the State Bailiff's Service for damages. The other applicants complained to various State authorities, also to no avail.
Most of the decisions in the applicants' favour were enforced (see appendix for details).
The relevant domestic law is set out in the judgment of 27 July 2004 in the case of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-19).
