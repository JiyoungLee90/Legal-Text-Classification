The case originated in an application (no. 41893/98) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Michele Martinez (“the applicant”), on 2 April 1998.
The applicant was represented by Mr S. Gentile and Mr R. Gentile, two lawyers practising in Rome. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, assisted by their Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of a set of criminal proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 21 October 1999 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant was born in 1931 and is currently residing in Rome. He works for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as a diplomat.
On 30 March 1993 the applicant received an official notification that preliminary investigations had been opened against him for corruption and forgery. On 7 December 1994 the Public Prosecutor’s Office requested the investigating judge to commit the applicant for trial. The applicant was heard by certain police officers in April 1995.
On 23 March 1996 the applicant and four other persons were committed for trial before the Rome District Court.
The first hearing, scheduled for 26 June 1996, was adjourned until 8 January 1997 at the request of one of the accused.
On 6 February 1997 the hearing was postponed by reason of a legitimate impediment of a co-accused.
On 12 February 1997 ten witnesses were examined.
On 20 March 1997 the proceedings were adjourned by reason of a lawyers’ strike.
On 26 and 27 March 1997 a number of witnesses were examined.
A hearing scheduled for 9 April 1997 was adjourned until 4 February 1998, due to a legitimate impediment of one of the accused. On the latter date the case was adjourned because of the absence of all the witnesses.
On 13 February and 4 March 1998 some witnesses were examined and the last hearing was postponed by reason of a legitimate impediment of the counsel of a co-accused.
On 26 March 1998 the proceedings were adjourned because of the absence of all the witnesses.
On 10 April 1998 the hearing was postponed because of the absence of a co-accused and on 8 May 1998 the judge adjourned the case because the last-mentioned co-accused had not been informed of the date of the hearing and because of the absence of a witness.
On 11 November 1998 the case was adjourned because of a lawyers’ strike until 11 January 1999, then postponed until 25 January 1999 by reason of the absence of certain witnesses. On the latter date, a few witnesses were examined and, because of the absence of a co-accused, the judge ordered an expertise and adjourned the case. On 27 January 1999 an expert was appointed. On 8 February 1999 the expert’s report was submitted and some witnesses were examined.
On 22 February 1999 the case was once again postponed until 26 April 1999 because of a lawyers’ strike. On the latter date the judge admitted some documents produced by the Public Prosecutor.
On 12 July 1999 the proceedings were adjourned because of a lawyers’ strike.
On 12 April and 29 May 2000 the case was postponed by reason of legitimate impediments of a co-accused.
The hearing of 12 July 2000 was postponed because the Chamber of the Rome District Court was composed of judges others than those who had taken part in previous hearings. On 29 November 2000, 22 January and 14 February 2001 some witnesses were examined.
In a judgment of 14 February 2001, filed with the registry on 23 March 2001, the Rome District Court acquitted the applicant because the relevant facts had not been established (il fatto non sussiste).
