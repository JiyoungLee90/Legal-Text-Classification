The case originated in an application (no. 12723/11) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr İmdat Yivli (“the applicant”), on 3 December 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr H. İşler, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 22 September 2015 the complaints concerning the alleged independence and impartiality of the Supreme Military Administrative Court, the fairness of the proceedings before that court on account of the applicant’s inability to access the classified documents submitted by the Ministry of Defence, and the non-communication of the written opinion of the public prosecutor were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Hatay.
The applicant was an officer in the Army. Based on classified investigation reports, his contract was terminated. He had no access to the classified reports. On 8 June 2009 the applicant initiated proceedings against the Ministry of Defence with the Supreme Military Administrative Court to have annulment of the impugned decision.
.  Relying on the classified investigation reports, and the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which were not communicated to the applicant, on 16 March 2010 the Supreme Military Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s case. On 18 May 2010 the applicant’s request for rectification was also rejected by the Supreme Military Administrative Court. The final decision was notified on the applicant on 8 June 2010.
