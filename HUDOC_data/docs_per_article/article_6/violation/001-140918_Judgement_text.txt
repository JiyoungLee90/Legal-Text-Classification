The case originated in an application (no. 43901/07) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Romanian nationals, Ms Berta Dajbukat and Ms Adriana-Stela SzilagyiPalko (“the applicants”), on 4 October 2007.
The applicants were represented by Mr M.I. Floare, a lawyer practising in Cluj-Napoca. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms I. Cambrea, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 31 August 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1927 and 1956 respectively and live in Cluj-Napoca. They are mother and daughter.
From 1960 they lived in an apartment rented from the State in a nationalised building. On 16 December 1996, under Law no. 112/1995, the first applicant and her husband bought that apartment from the State.
In a final decision of 3 August 1998 the Cluj-Napoca County Court allowed an action brought by the former owner against the State and noted that the latter had acquired ownership without any legal title.
Based on that decision, the former owner lodged several actions for annulment of the sale purchase contracts concluded under Law no. 112/1995 against persons who had bought apartments in the nationalised building in similar conditions, including the applicants.
In a judgment of 3 May 2001 the Cluj County Court annulled the sale purchase contract. During the proceedings the first applicant’s husband died. Therefore, the proceedings were continued by their daughter, the second applicant.
On 19 October 2001 the Cluj Court of Appeal rejected the applicants’ appeal. Therefore, they lodged an appeal on points of law before the High Court of Cassation and Justice.
On 29 September 2006 the High Court of Cassation and Justice remitted the trial of the appeal on points of law to the lower court, noting that the latter was competent in the matter.
In a final judgment of 19 April 2007 the Cluj Court of Appeal annulled the contract concluded on 16 December 1996. The court found that the nationalised building had been acquired unlawfully by the State, which therefore had no valid title deed over it.
In two judgments of 7 April and 19 April 2006 different panels of the same Court of Appeal dismissed the actions for annulment of contracts concluded under Law No. 112/1995, lodged by the former owner against other persons, neighbours with the applicants, who had bought apartments in the same nationalised building.
The relevant legal provisions and practice, regarding different aspects related to nationalised buildings purchased by tenants under Law No. 112/1995, are described in the case of Tudor Tudor v. Romania (no. 21911/03, §§ 13-21, 24 March 2009).
