The case originated in an application (no. 30502/05) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Romanian nationals, Mr Ioan Farcaș (“the first applicant”), Mr Ştefan Voicu (“the second applicant”) and Ms Carmen Lelia Bărbulescu (“the third applicant”), on 12 August 2005.
The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 19 March 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1935, 1945 and 1956 respectively and live in Ploieşti.
In 1975 a group of engineers patented an invention concerning a method for separating hydrocarbon. The first applicant is one of the inventors. The second and third applicants are heirs of the other members of the group.
On 26 January 1995 the applicants lodged an action for compensation against company R., a privately-owned former State company which had used the 1975 invention between 1985 and 1988 (for details about those proceedings, see Farcaş and Others v. Romania, no. 67020/01, §§ 7-22, 10 November 2005).
In a decision of 24 June 2002 the Braşov County Court allowed in part the action lodged by the applicants against company R., and ordered the latter to pay to the first applicant 2,284,679,617 Romanian lei (ROL), an amount representing compensation for the use, between 1985 and 1988, of the invention patented in 1975. The second and third applicants appealed, and in a decision of 8 November 2002 the Braşov Court of Appeal also awarded them compensation – ROL 2,230,620,676 to the second applicant and ROL 1,669,759,157 to the third applicant.
On 10 March 2004 the applicants and company R. signed an agreement for the payment of the compensation awarded by the court. Between 2 and 21 April 2004 the company paid about 20% of the amounts granted.
On 5 May 2005 the High Court of Cassation and Justice took note of the terms of the agreement of 10 March 2004 and concluded that company R. had withdrawn its appeal on points of law against the decision of 8 November 2002 (see paragraph 7 above), which thus became final.
Meanwhile, on 31 March 2004 company R. had sought its judicial reorganisation under a procedure provided for by Law no. 64/1995 on judicial reorganisation and bankruptcy.
On 28 April 2004 the Bacău County Court allowed the application, started the reorganisation proceedings and nominated a judicial administrator. The applicants’ claims were accepted by the County Court and recorded in the register of claims compiled by the judicial administrator in conformity with the provisions of the applicable law (tabloul creditorilor, hereinafter “the register of claims”).
The applicants lodged an objection to the register of claims, asking to be recognised as priority creditors (creditori privilegiaţi). Eleven other creditors also lodged objections against the records in the register of claims.
Meanwhile, on 24 November 2004 the judicial administrator had submitted a reorganisation plan to a vote by the creditors. It was proposed that the priority claims (creanţe privilegiate) be paid in full, and the remaining unsecured non-priority claims (creanţe chirografare) be paid at a rate of 20% of their value. In an interlocutory judgment of 8 December 2004 the Bacău County Court validated the plan after examining the objections raised by the unsecured creditors (creditori chirografari). In 2006 company R. paid its debts in accordance with the plan.
On 11 October 2007 the Braşov County Court held a hearing on the objections to the register of claims lodged by the applicants. The first applicant was present at the hearing to represent both himself and the other applicants. The County Court gave the parties until 18 October 2007 to submit written observations. On that date, in the applicants’ absence, it adjourned delivery of the judgment to 1 November 2007. The County Court gave its judgment on 1 November 2007; it found against the applicants.
On 23 January 2008, in accordance with the rules on notification in relation to court documents in insolvency proceedings (see paragraph 20 below), the judgment of 1 November 2007 was published in the Bulletin of Insolvency Proceedings (Buletinul Procedurilor de Insolvenţă, “the Bulletin”).
On an unspecified date the applicants enquired about the judgment’s date of delivery and asked the County Court to provide them with a copy of the judgment, which was sent to them on 31 January 2008; they received it on 4 February 2008. On 13 February 2008 they lodged an appeal by post.
Before the Braşov Court of Appeal, the applicants argued that, as they had not had access to the Bulletin, they had not been able to know on which date the judgment had been published.
In a final decision of 17 April 2008 the Court of Appeal dismissed that argument and concluded that the appeal had been made out of time, as it had been lodged more than ten days after 23 January 2008, the date on which the Braşov County Court’s judgment had been published (see paragraph 15 above). Relying on the Constitutional Court’s decision no. 1137 of 4 December 2007 (see paragraph 21 below), the Court of Appeal considered that the notification procedure via the Bulletin had offered sufficient safeguards to the participants in the proceedings, and had been justified by the nature of the insolvency procedure.
On 21 June 2010 the County Court closed the insolvency proceedings and noted that company R. had complied with all the obligations set out in the reorganisation plan (see paragraph 13 above), and thus it no longer had any debts.
The version of Law no. 85/2006 on insolvency procedure (hereinafter “the 2006 Insolvency Act”) in force at the material time, which replaced Law no. 64/1995 in full as of 20 July 2006, provided that all notifications during an insolvency procedure would be served by being published in the Bulletin, with the exception of a notice of the opening of such proceedings, which would be served in accordance with the general procedure provided for by the Code of Civil Procedure. The relevant parts of the 2006 Insolvency Act in force at the material time read as follows:
“29.  The Bulletin of Insolvency Proceedings is a publication edited by the National Trade Register Office with the aim of publishing notices of court hearings, summons [convocări] and notices of procedural acts issued by the courts, the judicial administrator and the liquidator after the opening of the proceedings provided for by this Law.”
“(1)  Notification in relation to court proceedings and the communication of any procedural acts, summons or notifications will be done via the Bulletin of Insolvency Proceedings. ... The Bulletin of Insolvency Proceedings will also be made available in an electronic format.
...
(8)  The Bulletin of Insolvency Proceedings will be published by the National Trade Register Office in order to allow the publication of notices of court proceedings, summons and notifications of procedural acts issued by the courts after the opening of the proceedings provided for by this Law.
(9)  From the date they are published, the publication of procedural acts or, if applicable, court decisions in the Bulletin of Insolvency Proceedings replaces [service of] a notice of court proceedings, summons or notification of procedural acts on each individual participant in proceedings, and such acts will be presumed to have been served on the date of their publication [in the Bulletin].”
“(2)  The time-limit for lodging an appeal [recurs] is ten days from the date when notice of a court judgment is given, unless the law provides otherwise.
(3)  The appeal will be examined by specialised benches within thirty days of the case file being registered with the appeal court. The notice of appeal proceedings will be served via the Bulletin of Insolvency Proceedings. ...”
In its decision no. 1137 of 4 December 2007, the Constitutional Court considered that the special notification procedure as regulated by Article 7 of the 2006 Insolvency Act was justified for the following reasons:
“The fact that the persons concerned will be notified via the Bulletin of Insolvency Proceedings after the opening of the insolvency procedure cannot be considered to breach the right of defence. In accordance with Article 126 § 2 of the Constitution, the legislature has the exclusive power to enact procedural norms, and it can create special regulations derogating from the common law in order to deal with specific situations. The provisions of Article 7 § 1 of Law no. 85/2006 are justified by the specificity of insolvency proceedings, which involve a great number of parties and many diverse procedural acts which could jeopardise the course of the proceedings; [publication via the Bulletin] is justified as a special measure which ensures speed in processing these cases.”
On 26 November 2008 Article 8 § 3 was amended by Government Emergency Ordinance no. 173/2008; in its new version, it provided that the notification of appeal court proceedings was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, which, at that time, required that the text of a court decision be given to the parties concerned (see S.C. Raisa M. Shipping S.R.L. v. Romania, no. 37576/05, § 18, 8 January 2013).
In 2014 the 2006 Insolvency Act was replaced by Law no. 85/2014 on the prevention of insolvency and on insolvency procedure (hereinafter “the 2014 Insolvency Act”). Articles 42-43 of the new Act provided that service of the notification of appeal proceedings was exclusively via the Bulletin, which only existed in an electronic format.
In Government Decision no. 124/2007, published in the Official Bulletin of 13 February 2007, the price of the Bulletin was set at: 1.20 Romanian lei (RON) for one issue; RON 212.55 for a monthly subscription; RON 637.66 for a three-month subscription; and RON 2,550.65 for a yearly subscription. Subscriptions had to be ordered thirty days in advance and could only start on 1 January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 September for a three-month subscription, or on 1 January for a yearly subscription. The electronic version of the Bulletin was priced at RON 79.16 for a monthly subscription, RON 237.49 for a three-month subscription, and RON 949.95 for a yearly subscription. Access to the electronic version was provided within two days of subscription. Sales of the paper version of the Bulletin started in the second half of 2007.
At the material time, the 2006 Insolvency Act provided as follows:
“(1)  After the reorganisation plan is confirmed, the debtor will conduct its activity under the supervision of the judicial administrator and in accordance with the confirmed plan, until such time as the court will order, by means of a reasoned decision, either that the reorganisation proceedings be terminated, or that all measures to allow the debtor to restart its commercial activity be taken, or that the reorganisation proceedings be terminated and bankruptcy [proceedings] be started under the provisions of Article 107 and following.”
Article 2 of the 2014 Insolvency Act stated that the aim of the law was to provide a collective procedure for paying off a debtor’s liabilities (pasivul), while giving the debtor, whenever possible, the chance to recover its activity.
