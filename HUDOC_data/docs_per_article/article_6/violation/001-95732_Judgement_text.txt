On 15 October 2008 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Oleksandriya.
On 28 May 2004 the  (Олександрійський міськрайонний суд Кіровоградської області) ordered the State-owned company Oleksandriyavugillya to pay the applicant 14,632.02 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) in salary arrears and other payments.
