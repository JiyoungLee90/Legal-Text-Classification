The case originated in an application (no. 27846/05) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Croatian nationals, Mr Jere Letica and Mr Branko Letica “the applicants”), on 9 June 2005
The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Š. Stažnik.
On 11 January 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants were born in 1930 and 1940 respectively and live in .
On 29 January 1974 the Split Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Splitu) received a death certificate of a certain M.K. and at the hearing held on 28 February 1974 her will was pronounced. The applicants were among her heirs. However, another party claimed that M.K. had made another will on a date posterior to the one of the will which had been pronounced.
Until 5 November 1997 a number of hearings were held, but the proceedings were not concluded. The last hearing was held on 3 October 1995. After 5 November 1997 (i.e. the date when the Convention was ratified by ) the first hearing was held on 22 April 2003, and then again on 15 May 2003.
On 21 May 2003 the Split Municipal Court stayed the inheritance proceedings and instructed the applicants and two other persons to institute civil proceedings against a third person in connection with the dispute among them arising in respect of the inheritance proceedings. However, despite the fact that the proceedings were stayed, on 20 August 2003 another hearing was held when it was decided that the attorney, who allegedly assisted M.K. in drafting her second will, be heard. Since the attorney resided in , she was heard by the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) on 11 May 2004.
It appears that the applicants appealed against the decision staying the proceedings and on 13 July 2004 the case file was therefore transferred to the  (Županijski sud u Splitu) as the appellate court.
Meanwhile, on 23 January 2004 the applicants filed a constitutional complaint about the length of proceedings. On 14 February 2005 the  found a violation of the applicants' right to a trial within reasonable time and awarded each applicant Croatian Kunas (HRK) 10,600 in compensation. It also ordered the  to adopt its decision in the shortest time possible but no later than six months from the publication of the decision in the Official Gazette.
On 8 April 2005 the  upheld the first instance decision by which the inheritance proceedings had been stayed.
In the civil proceedings instituted according to the Municipal Court's instruction (see paragraph 7 above) on 9 May 2005, another party filed a constitutional complaint about the length of these proceedings and on 12 March 2007 the Constitutional Court ordered the Split Municipal Court to adopt its decision in the shortest time possible but no later than six months from the publication of the decision in the Official Gazette.
The inheritance proceedings are sill pending.
