The case originated in an application (no. 62252/12) against the Portuguese Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Portuguese national, Mr Carlo Josué Escalda Ferreira (“the applicant”), on 11 September 2012.
The Portuguese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. F. da da Graça Carvalho, Deputy-Attorney General.
On 4 March 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 19 January 2005 bank C. brought enforcement proceedings against the applicant before the Setúbal Court seeking the payment of a debt of 106,278.60 euros (EUR) plus EUR 23,122.72 in interest.
On 8 October 2007 a writ of execution was issued against the applicant concerning an apartment he had mortgaged to the bank (penhora do apartamento). On an unspecified date a judicial enforcement officer (agente de execução) was appointed by the Setúbal Court as depositary (fiel depositário), thus being in charge of the apartment and responsible for the course of the enforcement proceedings through the sale of the applicant’s apartment, pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure.
On 29 September 2009 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Setúbal Court regarding the judicial enforcement officer’s inactivity in the proceedings.
On 15 February 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Commission for the Efficiency of Executions (Comissão para a Eficácia das Execuções) complaining about the judicial enforcement officer’s professional conduct which was preventing the sale of the applicant’s apartment. On 18 June 2012 the Commission acknowledged the receipt of the applicant’s complaint and in July 2012 informed him that they would start disciplinary proceedings against the judicial enforcement officer.
On 3 October 2012 following the applicant’s complaint of 29 September 2009, the Setúbal Court adopted a decision removing the judicial enforcement officer from his post on the grounds of professional negligence and appointed a new one.
According to the last information received by the Court on 8 July 2014 the proceedings are still pending at first instance.
RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW
The rules concerning enforcement proceedings have been substantially modified by Law Decree no. 38/2003 of 8 March 2003 and Law Decree no. 226/2008 of 20 November 2008 and, recently, by the last reform of the Code of Civil Procedure, provided by Law no. 41/2013 of 26 June 2013.
Pursuant to Law Decree no. 38/2008, in force when the enforcement proceedings against the applicant were initiated and applicable to it even after the adoption of Law Decree no. 226/2008 of 20 November (Articles 22 and 33 of Law Decree no. 226/2008), it was for the judicial enforcement officer (solicitador de execução; or agente de execução since Law Decree no. 226/2008) to perform, under judicial supervision of the judge responsible for the enforcement proceedings, all the procedural steps related to the procedure, including subpoenas, summonses and publications. Under the authority of the Chamber of Judicial Officers (Câmara dos Solicitadores de Execução) and under the supervision of the judge in charge of the enforcement proceedings at hand, the judicial enforcement officer exercises its core competencies as the “officer of the enforcement” and other tasks assigned to him by law.
When the enforcement proceedings were initiated at the domestic level, Article 808 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as provided by Law Decree no. 38/2003, provided the following in its relevant parts:
“1. It is for the judicial enforcement officer ... to perform all the steps of the enforcement proceedings (...) subject to judicial control ...
...
The judicial enforcement officer can only be removed from office by a decision of the judge in charge of the enforcement proceedings, ex officio or at the request of the “exequente”, for wrongful or negligent procedural conduct or for serious violations of the duties imposed on him ...
...”
And Article 839, as provided by Law Decree no. 38/2003, provided that:
“1. The judicial enforcement officer will be depository of the seized assets ...
...”
