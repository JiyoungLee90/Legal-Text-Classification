The case originated in an application (no. 6767/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mrs Bella Asenova Prescher (“the applicant”), on 16 February 2004.
The applicant was represented by Ms G. Yonkova, a lawyer practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms R. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the criminal proceedings against her had lasted too long, that the travel ban imposed on her while they were pending had been unjustified and that the resulting interference with her family life had been disproportionate.
On 10 September 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 of the Convention). The case was subsequently assigned to the Fourth Section.
The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in . She has been married to a German national since 1996.
On 18 September 1992 an investigation was opened in Bulgaria against the applicant, who lived in  at that time, on suspicion that she had issued fraudulent cheques. On 28 September 1992 the applicant was charged in absentia and her pre-trial detention was ordered. A warrant for her arrest was issued and the proceedings were suspended.
The applicant learned of the proceedings against her on an unspecified date in late 1995 during a telephone conversation with the Bulgarian prosecuting authorities. On 14 December 1995 she was arrested by the German police in connection with extradition proceedings opened against her. Later on she was released. On 13 March 1998 the German authorities decided to extradite her. On 5 October 1998 they invited her to appear before the Bulgarian authorities by 26 October 1998, which she did not do. On 12 December 1998 the applicant was extradited to Bulgaria and taken to  prison.
The criminal proceedings were resumed on 29 January 1999. On 17 May 1999 the applicant was charged again and questioned.
On 9 July 1999 the  district prosecutor terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicant, finding that the charges had not been proved.
It appears that thereafter the applicant returned to .
On 11 October 2001 the  city prosecutor quashed the decree of 9 July 1999 and remitted the case for further investigation.
On 2 July 2002 the applicant travelled to Bulgaria and was arrested at  airport. The next day she was informed that the proceedings had been resumed and was questioned. She was released on bail on 11 July 2002.
In the period from 3 December 2002 to 4 June 2004 the investigator proposed on two occasions that the criminal proceedings be discontinued but the Sofia city prosecutor ordered a further investigation and on the latter date sent the case to  regional public prosecutor’s office. In a decree of 2 July 2004 the latter discontinued the criminal proceedings and referred the file to the  district public prosecutor’s office. A jurisdiction dispute arose, which was settled on 9 November 2004 when Burgas appeals public prosecutor’s office quashed the decree of 2 July 2004 and held that the  city public prosecutor’s office had authority to deal with the case.
Meanwhile, on 14 October 2004 the applicant made a request under Article 239a of the Code of Criminal Procedure that the case against her be examined by a court. On 3 December 2004 the prosecuting authorities sent the file to the Sofia District Court. It appears that a jurisdiction dispute arose between the District Court and the Sofia City Court, which was settled on 7 February 2005.
On 18 February 2005 the District Court invited the  city prosecutor to indict the applicant within two months. It appears that this was done on an unspecified date in 2005.
On 26 October 2007 the District Court terminated the proceedings against the applicant as time-barred.
On 22 July 2002 the Sofia city prosecutor imposed a ban on the applicant’s leaving  without permission.
In 2002 the applicant made two requests to be allowed to visit Germany, which were dismissed by the  city prosecutor on 27 September and 12 December 2002, respectively.
On 13 May 2003 the applicant again requested to be allowed to travel to , stating that her husband was ill. She submitted medical certificates. On 15 May 2003 the  city prosecutor dismissed the request. He stated that the family reasons put forward by the applicant did not justify the temporary lifting of the travel ban. He further noted that the case was factually and legally complex and required further investigation. The prosecutor also considered that the risk of the applicant absconding could not be ruled out, noting the 1995-98 extradition proceedings.
A subsequent request by the applicant was dismissed on 14 August 2003. The refusal was upheld by the City Court on 29 August 2003.
On 10 December 2003 the applicant again requested to be allowed to visit  for a month in order to spend the festive season with her family. She argued that she had never obstructed the investigation. On 12 December 2003 the  city prosecutor again dismissed her request. Following an appeal, on 31 December 2003 the City Court upheld the refusal, reasoning that there was a risk that the applicant would not return to , which would additionally delay the criminal proceedings. The court noted that the delays which had occurred between 1992 and 2001 had been exclusively due to the applicant’s behaviour.
It appears that the applicant made another unsuccessful request for permission to travel on an unknown date in 2004.
There is no information as to whether the applicant requested the lifting of the ban after 29 April 2006, when the Code of Criminal Procedure of 2005 came into force. The applicant states that the District Court allowed her to visit her family in  on two occasions after 8 August 2006.
The prohibition on leaving the country was cancelled on 26 October 2007, when the criminal proceedings were terminated.
An amendment of June 2003 introduced the new Article 239a of the CCP, which provided for the opportunity for a person who has been charged to have his case examined by a court if the investigation has not been completed within the statutory time-limit (two years in investigations concerning serious offences and one year in all other investigations).
Article 35 § 1 of the 1991 Constitution provides that “[e]veryone shall have the right to ... leave the country” and that this right “may be subject to restrictions provided for in the law in the interest of national security or for the protection of public health and the rights and freedoms of others”.
Pursuant to Article 153a § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974, in force until April 2006, the public prosecutor had the power to rule that an individual accused of a deliberate offence punishable by imprisonment may not leave Bulgaria without a prosecutor’s permission. Until April 2006, such decisions were not amenable to judicial review. Where a request for permission to travel on particular dates was lodged the prosecutor had to rule within three days (Article 153a § 2), this ruling being amenable to judicial review (Article 153a §§ 3 and 4). At the trial stage, the power to impose a travel ban was vested in the trial court (Article 153a § 5). The Supreme Court of Cassation has held that trial court decisions under Article 153a § 5 were subject to appeal to a higher court (реш. № 129 от 8 май 2003 г. по н. д. № 780/2002 г., ВКС, I н. о.).
On 29 April 2006 the above provisions were superseded by Article 68 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 2005, The legal regime described above remained unchanged, except that it became possible for the courts to set aside the initial decision of the prosecutor to impose a travel ban in cases where there was no risk of fleeing abroad.
