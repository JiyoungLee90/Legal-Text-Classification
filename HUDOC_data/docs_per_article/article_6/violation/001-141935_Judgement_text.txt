The case originated in an application (no. 13711/09) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr László Walch (“the applicant”), on 2 March 2009.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 9 April 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Budapest.
In August 2006 the applicant brought an action for unlawful dismissal and damages before the Pest County Labour Court.
It appears that after a first- and a second-instance judgment, on 17 September 2013 the Kúria gave final judgment in respect of part of the claims and remitted the remainder to the first-instance court. In that respect the case is still pending.
