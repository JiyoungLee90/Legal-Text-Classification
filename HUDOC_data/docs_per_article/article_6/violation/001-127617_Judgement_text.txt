The case originated in an application (no. 35327/09) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Majs Eksport-Import (“the applicant”), a company registered in Serbia, on 11 June 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Božović, a lawyer practising in Belgrade. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 11 October 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant and Beogradski Pamučni Kombat, a company based in Belgrade (hereinafter: “the debtor”) concluded a contract on 7 March 2000. The debtor failed to fulfil its obligations arising from the contract.
On 11 December 2001 the Commercial Court in Belgrade instituted insolvency proceedings against the debtor. This decision was published on the court’s notice board on 19 December 2001.
On 12 March 2002 the applicant lodged its pecuniary claim within the insolvency proceedings.
As its claim had been disputed, on 11 October 2002 the applicant filed a separate civil suit before the Commercial Court in Belgrade and requested the determination of its claim.
On 2 September 2004 the Commercial Court in Belgrade determined one part of the applicant’s claim and ordered the debtor to pay the applicant 6,686.15 euros (EUR).
On an unspecified date thereafter this judgment became final.
On 4 April 2005 the Commercial Court determined the reminder of the applicant’s claim and ordered the debtor to pay the applicant EUR 11,409 as well as 80,500 Serbian dinars in respect of the costs of civil proceedings.
This judgment became final on 9 June 2005.
On 30 September 2009 the applicant lodged an application for the enforcement of the judgment of 4 April 2005 in respect of the costs awarded. On the same day the Commercial Court in Belgrade allowed the application and issued an enforcement order.
The judgment of 2 September 2004 and the reminder of the judgment of 4 April 2005 were to be enforced in the context of the insolvency proceedings.
Before the insolvency proceedings the debtor company was predominantly socially owned. It has remained registered as predominantly socially owned in the relevant public registries throughout the insolvency proceedings.
On 18 December 2009 the Commercial Court in Belgrade terminated the insolvency proceedings against the company. This decision became final on 11 January 2011. On 1 June 2011 the debtor was erased from the Companies’ Register.
