The applicant was represented before the Court by Mrs M.G. Atzeni, a lawyer practising in . The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their successive Agents, respectively Mr U. Leanza and Mr I.M. Braguglia, and by their successive co-Agents, respectively Mr V. Esposito and Mr F. Crisafulli.
On 18 March 2004 the Court (First Section) declared the application admissible.
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in San Giovanni Lupatoto ().
G.S., the applicant's father, was the owner of a flat in  which he had let to G.A.S.
In a registered letter of 3 June 1991, the applicant's father informed the tenant that he intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1991 and asked him to vacate the premises by that date.
In a writ served on the tenant on 24 February 1992, the applicant's father reiterated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Cagliari Magistrate.
By a decision of 23 March 1992, which was made enforceable on the same day, the Cagliari Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 28 June 1992.
On 20 July 1992, the applicant's father served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises.
On an unspecified date, the applicant's father made a statutory declaration that he urgently required the premises as accommodation for himself.
Subsequently, he informed the tenant that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 13 October 1992.
Between 13 October 1992 and 23 June 1995, the bailiff made five attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as the applicant's father was never granted the assistance of the police in enforcing the order for possession.
On 25 May 1995, the applicant's father made a request for police assistance.
On 27 July 1995, the Cagliari Prefect informed him that the police assistance would be granted after 30 September 1996.
On 22 September 1997, the applicant's father died and his daughter, the actual applicant, inherited the flat and took part in the proceedings as an heir.
On 13 July 1998, the Prefect informed the bailiff that the police assistance would be granted only after 31 December 1998, as there was no urgent necessity, the applicant's father having died.
On 19 April 1999, the applicant served on the tenant the order to vacate the premises.
On 3 May 1999, she informed the tenant that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 25 May 1999.
On an unspecified day of May 2001, the tenant spontaneously vacated the premises and the applicant recovered possession of the flat.
The relevant domestic law and practice is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Mascolo v. Italy (no. 68792/01, §§ 14-44).
