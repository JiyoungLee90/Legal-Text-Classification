The case originated in an application (no. 39507/13) against the Portuguese Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Portuguese national, Ms Maria Isabel Veiga da Silva Braga (“the applicant”), on 4 June 2013.
The applicant was represented by Ms P. Pamela Sá, a lawyer practising in Braga. The Portuguese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. F. da Graça Carvalho, Deputy Attorney General.
On 16 November 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 6 May 2011 the applicant brought enforcement proceedings against her former husband before the Braga Family Court seeking the payment of child support amounting to 3,600 euros (EUR).
On 27 February 2013 the applicant was notified that her former husband had no attachable assets.
On 12 June 2015 the proceedings were extinguished as no attachable assets were specified pursuant to Article 750 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 8 below).
.  The relevant part of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as follow:
“1. If no attachable goods are found ... the judicial enforcement agent notifies the creditor [exequente] to specify which assets should be seized ...
If neither the creditor nor the debtor [executado] specify the attachable assets within 10 days, the enforcement proceedings shall be extinguished.
