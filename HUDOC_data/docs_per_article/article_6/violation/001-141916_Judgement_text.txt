The case originated in an application (no. 25714/05) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian and Georgian national, Mr Stelian Kirilov Stoyanov-Kobuladze (“the applicant”), on 7 July 2005.
The applicant was represented by Ms T. Todorova, a lawyer practising in Sofia. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms N. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The Georgian Government, having been informed of their right to intervene in the case (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 of the Rules of Court), did not avail themselves of that opportunity.
The applicant alleged that he had been convicted in absentia without being given the opportunity to have the proceedings reopened.
On 3 March 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
On 29 March 2011 the Court struck the application out of its list of cases in accordance with Article 37 § 1 (a) of the Convention. By a decision of 23 August 2011, the Court decided to restore it to its list of cases in accordance with Article 37 § 2 of the Convention.
The applicant was born in 1963.
The applicant was convicted twice of fraud, in 1986 and in 1987.
Until 1992 the applicant lived in the town of Gabrovo. From 27 May 1992 onwards he lived at an address in Sofia.
On 26 October 1993 the applicant registered as a sole trader. The applicant did not engage in any business activities until 1995. In 1995, in particular from 20 April to 17 May, on the territory of the town of Varna and in his capacity as a sole trader, the applicant developed a quasi-banking activity by taking loans from individuals with the promise of repaying them at significant levels of interest.
On 17 May 1995 the applicant left Bulgaria and moved to Georgia, where he married a Georgian national in 1997. He has two children.
On an unspecified date in 1995, but after the applicant’s departure from the country, criminal proceedings were instituted against him and an accomplice on charges of large-scale fraud. The applicant was declared wanted for prosecution on 12 June 1995. It is not clear what measures the authorities took to detect the whereabouts of the applicant.
On an unspecified date an indictment was filed at Varna District Court. The proceedings were conducted in the absence of the applicant and his accomplice by virtue of a court decision taken in a hearing of 30 September 1996. As regards the applicant, the proceedings were held in absentia on the grounds of Article 268 § 3(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1974, namely because the accused was outside the country and his address was not known to the authorities (see paragraph 25 below). The applicant was represented by court-appointed counsel.
In a judgment of 28 October 1996 the Varna District Court found the applicant guilty of fraud and sentenced him to a ten-year term of imprisonment. The court held that between 20 April and 25 May 1995 the applicant, with his accomplice, committed fraud in the amount of 108,846,390 old Bulgarian levs (BGL) against 1,740 individuals by means of establishing a company which operated as a “financial pyramid” and accrued large amounts of money through loans from the population. Some of the loans were returned to the people with significant interest, apparently with the aim of gaining popularity and attracting more contributions. The majority of the loans, however, were not returned.
The court based its judgment on witness statements, a number of expert reports, documents and other material evidence. No appeal was lodged against the judgment and it became final on 11 November 1996.
On 19 May 2004 the Varna District Court authorities destroyed the case file.
On 22 October 2004 the applicant was arrested at the Bulgarian border and taken to Kremikovtsi Prison to serve his sentence. On 5 November 2004 he sent a request to the prison governor, asking to be treated as a Georgian national for the duration of his ten-year term of imprisonment. He appears to have assumed that being treated as a Georgian national would facilitate contact with his Georgian family.
On 11 December 2004 the prison governor issued a note which contained an explanation of the reasons for the applicant’s arrest. In reply to a letter from the applicant, apparently inquiring about the reasons for his detention, on 8 March 2005 the prosecutor informed the applicant once more that his detention had been ordered on the grounds that he had received a ten-year prison sentence.
Meanwhile, the applicant began to seek reopening of the proceedings. On 17 February and 8 March 2005 he sent two requests to the Supreme Court of Cassation in this respect. In a letter of 28 March 2005 the Supreme Court of Cassation returned the applicant’s requests. It informed him that the sentence could not be revised because the case file had been destroyed after the expiration of the relevant statutory deadline.
On 4 April the applicant submitted a request that the prosecutor take the initiative to have the criminal proceedings against him reopened. In a letter of 29 April 2005 a prosecutor from the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor’s Office informed the applicant that the case file had been destroyed, and, also that reopening could not be applied in the applicant’s case.
On 1 July 2005 the applicant submitted another request to the Supreme Court of Cassation for reopening and suspension of his sentence. In October 2005 the applicant was informed that the Supreme Court of Cassation had instituted proceedings for reopening and that a hearing had been scheduled for 10 March 2006. In a decision of 13 January 2006, however, the Supreme Court of Cassation terminated those proceedings on the grounds that the case file had been destroyed and a procedure for its restoration would need to be instituted. The court instructed the Varna District Court to launch a procedure for the restoration of the case file. Such a procedure took place between 17 February and 20 June 2006, apparently to no avail.
It appears that on an unspecified date the reopening proceedings were resumed, and on 12 April 2007 the Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s request for reopening and suspension of his sentence as ill-founded. The court held that the provisions requiring reopening of criminal proceedings had been introduced into Bulgarian law on 1 January 2000. Relying on the principle of legal certainty, the court held that reopening was not applicable to trials which had ended before that date. The court went on to state that even assuming applicability the criminal proceedings could not have been resumed, because the case file had been irreversibly destroyed.
Nevertheless the court went into the merits of the request and noted that following the collapse of his financial pyramid the applicant had left Bulgaria and moved to Georgia. During the criminal proceedings against him the applicant lived in Georgia, married there in 1997 and even took his wife’s name. In the court’s view, by doing all of the above the applicant was displaying his intention to abscond. The court held that in 1995 and 1996 a number of sets of criminal proceedings had been opened against individuals who had been engaged in similar activities to those of the applicant. The court assumed that the applicant had certainly known that he was being tried, because that type of trial had received extensive media coverage and had become notorious in the country; in addition, the applicant declared that he had been in contact with Bulgarian officials in Georgia. Thus, the court concluded that by not appearing before the authorities at the time of his trial the applicant had waived his right to participate in the criminal proceedings against him.
The applicant was released from prison on 31 March 2011 after serving six years and five months of his sentence.
At the material time, the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (“the 1974 CCP”), in force until 29 April 2006, allowed trials in absentia, inter alia where the accused was outside the country and his address was not known to the authorities (Article 268 § 3(1)).
Reopening of criminal cases heard in absentia was allowed where a convicted person had been unaware of the proceedings against him and had submitted a request for reopening within one year of learning about the conviction (Article 362a § 1). That provision came into force on 1 January 2000. The new Code of Criminal Procedure 2006, in force since 29 April 2006, contained a similar provision (Article 423 § 1).
At the material time, the prevailing case-law of the Supreme Court of Cassation, allowed reopening not only of proceedings held in absentia which had terminated after the entry into force of the provision introducing the right to reopening, namely 1 January 2000, but also of proceedings which had terminated before that date (see реш. № 723 от 23 януари 2004 г. на ВКС по н. д. № 582/2003 г., I н. о.; реш. № 348 от 26 юни 2000 г. на ВКС по н. д. № 258/2000 г., II н. о.).
The relevant part of Article 82 §§ 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code 1968 (“the CC”) provides that a judgment imposing a sentence of three to ten years’ imprisonment cannot be enforced once ten years have passed since the sentence became final. The running of this limitation period is interrupted by every act effected by the competent authorities for the purpose of enforcing the sentence (Article 82 § 3 of the CC). Such interruptions notwithstanding, the sentence may no longer be enforced if fifteen years have elapsed since the judgment became final (Article 82 § 4 of the CC).
By virtue of section 91 § 4 of Regulation no. 28 of 1995 on the Functions of the Registries of the District, Regional, Military Courts and Courts of Appeal (“the 1995 Regulation”), in force at the material time and until 28 November 2004, criminal case files in respect of which the sentence had not been enforced were to be kept in the court’s archive for a period equal to the limitation period for the enforcement of the sentence. The superseding regulations make the same provision (see section 148 § 4 of the Rules on Court Administration in the District, Regional, Military Courts and Courts of Appeal 2004 and section 75 § 1(5) of the Rules on Court Administration in the District, Regional, Military Courts and Courts of Appeal 2009).
Section 14 of the 1995 Regulation provided that if a case file was lost or destroyed prematurely it could be restored by order of the president of the respective court, either acting of his own motion or at the request of one of the parties. This was done in practice by the administrative secretary of the court, who gathered all documents relating to the case which were in the possession of the court and of other bodies and the parties to the case. After all available materials had been collected the court held a public hearing to which the parties were summoned, and ruled on the restoration of the case file. The court’s order was subject to appeal to a higher court. The superseding regulations are broadly similar (see section 74 of the 2004 Rules and section 108 of the 2009 Rules).
