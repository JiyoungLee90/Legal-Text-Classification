The case originated in an application (no. 11008/04) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Rizvan Vakhayevich Talatov (“the applicant”), on 16 February 2004.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 9 July 2008 the Government were given notice of the application.
The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Mineralnyye Vody.
On 8 May 2003 the Industrialnyy District Court convicted the applicant of aggravated extortion and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. The public had been excluded from the trial court hearings for unclear reasons.
The applicant and his defence attorneys appealed arguing that there had been no grounds to hold the trial in camera.
On 16 September 2003 the Khabarovsk Regional Court upheld the conviction on appeal. The Regional Court not only failed to provide any justification for the closed hearing, but did not mention this complaint at all.
Article 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as in force at the material time provided that all criminal trials are public. The exceptions provided by the above Article were the following: 1) trials involving state secrets; 2) trials of persons under the age of 16; 3) trial concerning sex crimes or capable of disclosing intimate or degrading information about trial participants; 4) for the protection of safety of trial participants and their relatives.
