The case originated in seven applications (nos. 34396/05, 8753/06, 37432/06, 37435/06, 2873/07, 24664/07, and 44938/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eight Turkish nationals, Bülent Alp, Fahri Önder, Serpil Cabadan, Hüseyin Durmaz, Abdulmecit Öztürk, Heval Öztürk, Metin Sarıgül, and Metin Karaman born in 1977, 1982, 1978, 1969, 1979, 1974, 1973, and 1974 respectively. The dates of introduction of the applications are indicated in the appended table.
The applicants in applications nos. 34396/05 and 8753/06 were represented by Mr M. Filorinalı, while the applicants in applications nos. 37432/06 and 37435/06 were represented by Ms E. Erkaslan, lawyers practising in İstanbul. The applicants in applications nos. 2873/07, 24664/07 and 44938/08 were represented by Mr M. Erbil, Ms S. Epçeli and Ms Y. Yeşilyurt Karakoç, lawyers practising in İstanbul, respectively. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 9 June 2009 the Court decided to declare the applications partly inadmissible and to communicate the complaints concerning the length of pre-trial detention brought by all the applicants except Heval Öztürk in application no. 2873/07 and the lack of a remedy to challenge the lawfulness of the applicants’ pre-trial detention brought by Abdulmecit Öztürk in application no. 2873/07 and Metin Sarıgül in application no. 24664/07, the lack of an enforceable right to compensation for an allegedly lengthy pre-trial detention brought by Abdulmecit Öztürk in application no. 2873/07, the length of the criminal proceedings brought by the applicants in applications nos. 34396/05, 8753/06, 37432/06, 37435/06, 2873/07, and 44938/08 and the lack of an effective remedy in respect of this complaint brought by the applicants in application no. 2873/07 to the Government.
On the same day the Court decided that, in the view of the similarity of the cases, the present applications should be joined to application no. 26853/06 against the same respondent State raising similar complaints (Rule 42 § 1). On 20 October 2010 the Court decided to disjoin the application no. 26853/06 from the present applications joined pursuant to Rule 42 § 1 of the Rules of Court and to strike it out of the list of cases.
The applicants are Turkish nationals who were arrested and subsequently detained pending judicial proceedings. They were released on various dates except for the applicants in applications nos. 37432/06 and 37435/06, who are still in detention pending trial. The details of the dates of the arrests, the dates of the orders for the applicants’ pretrial detention, the dates of the indictments, the dates of the domestic court decisions, the total period of pre-trial detention, the total period of the criminal proceedings where relevant, the dates of release and the grounds for continued detention are set out in the appendix hereto.
