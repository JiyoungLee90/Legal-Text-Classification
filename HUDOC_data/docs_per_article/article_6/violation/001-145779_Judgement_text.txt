The case originated in 16 applications against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Ukrainian nationals and companies based in Ukraine. The details of the applicants are specified in the appended table (“the applicants”).
In applications nos. 12424/06 and 23509/08 the applicants died in course of the proceedings before the Court. Their next-of-kin expressed the wish to pursue the applications.
The applications listed in the Appendix to the present judgment were communicated to the Government on various dates.
The Government were represented by their Agent.
On 15 December 2011 (in application no. 7436/08) and on 15 September 2011 (in application no. 40893/09) the Government submitted to the Court their unilateral declarations, aimed at resolving the non-enforcement issues raised in seventeen applications. The Government requested the Court to strike the applications concerned out of the list of cases pursuant to Article 37 § 1 (c) of the Convention on the basis of the declarations. Having examined the terms of the Government’s declarations, the Court finds that they do not provide a sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights does not require continuing the examination of the application.
On the dates set out in the appended table domestic courts delivered decisions according to which the applicants were entitled to various pecuniary amounts or to have certain actions taken in their favour. The decisions became final and enforceable. However, the applicants were unable to obtain the enforcement of the decisions in due time.
Some of the applicants also made submissions concerning factual and legal matters unrelated to the above non-enforcement issues.
