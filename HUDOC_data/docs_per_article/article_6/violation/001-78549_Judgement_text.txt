The case originated in an application (no. 32166/04) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by six Ukrainian nationals: Mr Nikolay Ivanovich Sarafanov, Mr Nikolay Markovich Kolbasa, Mr Nikolay Aleksandrovich Kuzminskiy, Mr Pavel Ivanovich Lysenko, Mr Yevgeniy Mikhaylovich Seredin and Mr Pyotr Mikhaylovich Solonkin (“the applicants”) on 25 August 2004.
The applicants were represented by Mr V. Bychkovskiy from Miusinsk. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 2 November 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the non-enforcement of the judgments in the applicants' favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants live in Miusinsk, the Lugansk region. The first, the third, the fourth, the fifth and the sixth applicants were born in 1943, 1936, 1940, 1950 and 1934 respectively. The second applicant did not specify the date of his birth.
On 29 November 2000 the  (Краснолуцький міський суд Луганської області) awarded the first applicant UAH 286.68 against the State Mining Company Novopavlivska (“the Mine,” ДВАТ шахта „Новопавлівська”) in compensation for a delayed salary payment.
Additionally, between 2001 and 2004 (see annexed table) each of the applicants obtained a judgment of the  ordering the Mine to provide him with a certain quantity of coal.
All of the judgments given in favour of the applicants became final and the enforcement writs in their respect were transferred to the Krasnyy Luch Bailiffs' Service (“the Bailiffs,” Відділ державної виконавчої служби Краснолуцького міського управління юстиції) for enforcement.
On 8 February 2005 the Bailiffs informed the applicants that pursuant to a decision of the  (Господарський суд Луганської області) of 14 November 2002, the Mine had been declared bankrupt and subjected to a financial rehabilitation procedure that was to continue until 31 December 2007. The Bailiffs further noted that the Mine was not mining any coal, due to the lack of financing from the State.
The judgment of 29 November 2000 awarding compensation to the first applicant was enforced on 12 December 2005. The other judgments awarding the applicants coal have not been enforced.
