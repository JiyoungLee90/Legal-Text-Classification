The case originated in an application (no. 69435/01) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Andrey Gabdrakhmanovich Karimov (“the applicant”), on 9 February 2001.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms Valeriya Lutkovska, succeeded by Ms Zoryana Bortnovska.
On 9 July 2003 the Court decided to communicate the application the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and lack of effective remedies in that respect under Article 13 of the Convention to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant, Mr Andrey Gabdrakhmanovich Karimov, is a Ukrainian national, who was born in 1968 and lives in the Yastrebki village, the Autonomous Republic of the Crimea (the “ARC”).
On 11 December 1996 the Prosecutor of the Chervonogvardiysky District of the ARC (the “Prosecutor of the ARC”) initiated a criminal investigation after the discovery of a corpse of an unidentified person near the Chervonogvardiysky village of the ARC. Subsequently, that person was thought to be someone called Sasha.
On 14 December 1996 the Chervonogvardiysky District Prosecutor's Office (the “CDPO”) detained the applicant on suspicion of having murdered Sasha.
On 17 December 1996 the Chervonogvardiysky District Prosecutor charged the applicant with murder. He also decided to detain the applicant on remand as there was a risk of him absconding and impeding the investigation in the case.
On 25 December 1996 the jurisdiction over the investigation into the murder was transferred to the Nyzhnyogirsky District Prosecutor's Office (the “NDPO”).
On 7 March 1997 the Nyzhnyogirsky District Prosecutor issued a bill of indictment against the applicant charging him with murder under the influence of alcohol.
On 7 April 1997 the case was remitted to the court for examination on the merits of the charges brought against the applicant.
On 2 June 1997 the Nyzhnyogirsky District Court of the ARC (the “”), composed of the President of that court judge K., sentenced the applicant to eight years' imprisonment following his conviction for murder. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal against this decision with the Supreme Court of the ARC.
On 17 July 1997 the Supreme Court of the ARC quashed the judgment of 2 June 1997 and remitted the case for additional investigation due to a lack of corroborating evidence of the applicant's guilt. It also ruled that the applicant, who suffered from mental retardation (oligophrenia) was not legally represented in the course of criminal investigation brought against him.
On 10 November 1997 the person called Sasha re-appeared and was questioned by the NDPO.
On 20 November 1997 the NDPO released the applicant on condition that he did not leave his place of residence.
On 28 November 1997 the prosecution was terminated due to the absence of corpus juris delicti in respect of the applicant's acts. The investigation also revealed that the applicant stole two ducks from Ms M. (a private person) for a total value of UAH 30. The investigation into theft of private property was also terminated due to the “change of circumstances”.
On 10 March 1998 the NDPO stayed the criminal investigation in the case due to their inability to identify the person who had committed the murder.
On 21 February 2000 the Deputy Prosecutor of the ARC quashed the decisions of 28 November 1997 and 10 March 1998 and remitted the case to the CDPO for a preliminary investigation in accordance with the territorial jurisdiction. It also resolved that the applicant should be involved in the proceedings as being suspected of murder.
On 22 February 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the ARC terminated the criminal investigation due to the absence of any corpus juris delicti in respect of the applicant's acts.
On 21 January 1998 the applicant instituted proceedings in the  seeking compensation for damage caused by his unlawful prosecution, detention and conviction.
The Government alleged that on 23 June 1998 the President of the Nyzhnyogirsky Court (judge K.), who also heard the applicant's criminal case and convicted the applicant on 2 June 1997 (see paragraph 12 above) requested the applicant to provide a certified copy of the resolution terminating criminal investigation in his case and information with regard to his salary from the last place of employment.
On 26 June 1998 the court informed him of the initiation of the proceedings in the case.
On 5 July 1999 a judge P. of the  assumed jurisdiction over the applicant's claims. It also ordered the Prosecutor's Office that dealt with the applicant's criminal case to provide a number of documents to it.
On 28 October and 4 December 1999 the applicant increased the amount of compensation claimed and requested the court to order the State Treasury, local Departments of Finance of the Nyzhniogirsky and Chervonogvardeysky State Administrations to appear as respondents in the case proceedings.
On 5 July and 19 November 1999, 17 April and 18 May 2000 the court ordered the prosecution to transfer the applicant's criminal case file to it. The prosecution partly complied, providing copies of certain documents from the case file. Some of the materials were provided on 3 August 2000 only.
On 21 February 2000 the prosecution resumed the investigation of the case (see paragraph 17 above).
On 24 February 2000 the President of the Supreme Court of the ARC instructed the President of the Nyzhnyogirsky District Court to ensure that the case proceedings were expedited.

On 6 June 2000 the Deputy President of the Supreme Court requested the President of the Nyzhnyogirsky District Court to expedite examination of the applicant's case.
On 9 June 2000 the court invited the parties to a meeting about the case. However, the Chervonogvardiysky District Prosecutor failed to appear.

As a result, on 7 August 2000 the  suspended the compensation proceedings, pending the outcome of the criminal investigation against the applicant. On 27 September 2000 the Supreme Court of the ARC upheld this decision.
The applicant requested the Supreme Court to remit the case to a different court, alleging that the  judges, who were subordinate to judge K., who in 1997 heard the criminal case brought against the applicant and convicted him (see paragraph 11 above), manifested bias in examining his claims.
On 15 August 2000 the Deputy President of the Supreme Court instructed the President of the Supreme Court of the ARC, in view of the applicant's allegations of bias, to transfer the case to a different court for examination on its merits.

On 14 October 2002 the case was remitted to the Central District Court of Simferopil, due to a change of jurisdiction because of the modification in the respondents, who were all situated in this district.

The hearings on 17 and 25 February 2003 were ignored by the Prosecutor's Office, as was the hearing on 15 January 2003 by the Department of Justice. As a result, the consideration of the merits of the case was postponed again.
