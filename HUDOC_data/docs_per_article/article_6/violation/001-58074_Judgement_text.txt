The case was referred to the Court by three Italian nationals, Mr Umberto and Mr Gaetano Ceteroni and Mrs Anna Maria Ceteroni, née Magri ("the applicants") on 15 June 1995, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in two applications (nos. 22461/93 and 22465/93) against the Italian Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission") under Article 25 (art. 25) by the three Ceteronis on 2 December 1992. The applicants' application to the Court referred to Article 48 of the Convention (art. 48) as amended by Protocol No. 9 (P9), which has been ratified by . The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 6 para. 1 and 8 of the Convention (art. 6-1, art. 8) and Article 2 para. 1 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2-1).
On 27 September 1995 the Court's Screening Panel decided not to decline consideration of the case and to submit it to the Court (Article 48 para. 2 of the Convention) (art. 48-2).
The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr C. Russo, the elected judge of Italian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b) of Rules of Court B). On 29 September 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr S.K. Martens, Mrs E. Palm, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr A.B. Baka, Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici, Mr J. Makarczyk and Mr K. Jungwiert (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Italian Government ("the Government"), the applicants' lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 para. 1 and 40). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicants' memorial on 2 April 1996 and the Government's memorial on 8 May 1996.
On 14 May 1996 the President gave the applicants' lawyer leave to use the Italian language in the proceedings before the Court (Rule 28 para. 3).
On 31 May 1996 the Commission produced the file on the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the President's instructions.
In accordance with the President's decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, , on 27 June 1996. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.
There appeared before the Court:
(a) for the Government
(b)  for the Commission
(c)  for the applicants
The Court heard addresses by Mr Conforti, Mr Vico, Mr Uggetti and Mr Raimondi.
On 2 April 1982 the District Court of Fermo () made an insolvency order in respect of the company set up by Mr Umberto Ceteroni and his parents and also declared them personally bankrupt.
On 8 and 15 June 1983 respectively Mr A. and the L.M. company, claiming to be creditors of the bankrupts, instituted separate proceedings before the Fermo bankruptcy judge (giudice delegato) contesting the statement of liabilities drawn up with a view to settling the company's debts. The judge set down hearings to enter appearances on 26 October and 9 November 1983 respectively. On the latter date the liquidator applied to the judge for leave to join the second proceedings. His application was allowed on 3 February 1987.
The preparatory phases of the two cases continued until 15 and 29 October 1990. During the intervening period fifteen hearings were held in one case and sixteen in the other; they were almost all adjourned at the request of the parties or by the judge of his own motion.
On a date that has not been specified the two sets of proceedings were stayed sine die because the judge had been transferred to another post. Proceedings were reopened on 25 March and 7 February 1994.
On 30 May 1994 the Fermo District Court struck the first case out of its list because the parties had failed to appear. According to information supplied by the applicants' lawyer, the plaintiff had decided not to pursue his case. As regards the second case, on 21 February 1994 the parties communicated their final submissions and the judge set down the trial hearing for 11 March 1994, on which date the Fermo District Court allowed the L.M. company's application. The text of the judgment was deposited at the registry on 7 April 1994. II. Relevant domestic law
The relevant provisions of Royal Decree no. 267 of 16 March 1942 read as follows:
Section 26 "An appeal shall lie against the decisions of the bankruptcy judge ... to the district court within three days of their adoption, and may be lodged by the liquidator, by the bankrupt, by the creditors' committee or by any other person with an interest. The district court shall deliberate in private session and give a reasoned decision. The appeal shall not have suspensive effect in relation to the impugned decision."
Section 36 "An appeal shall lie against measures taken by the liquidator. Such appeals may be lodged by the bankrupt, or any other person with an interest, with the bankruptcy judge, who shall give a reasoned decision. An appeal against that decision must be lodged within three days with the district court. That court shall give a reasoned decision after hearing the liquidator and the appellant."
Section 48 "Correspondence addressed to the bankrupt must be passed to the liquidator, who shall be empowered to retain correspondence concerning property interests. The liquidator has a duty of confidentiality as regards the content of the correspondence that does not relate to such interests."
Section 49 "The bankrupt may not leave his place of residence without the authorisation of the bankruptcy judge and must report to that judge, to the liquidator and to the creditors' committee each time that he is duly summoned, except where he is unable to appear on legitimate grounds and the judge gives him leave to send a representative. If the bankrupt fails to comply with a summons, the judge may order that he be brought by the police."
The applicants applied to the Commission on 2 December 1992. They relied on Articles 6 para. 1 and 8 of the Convention (art. 6-1, art. 8) and Article 2 para. 1 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2-1), complaining of the length of two sets of civil proceedings, an interference with their right to respect for their correspondence and with their right to liberty of movement within the territory of their State and freedom to chose their place of residence there.
The Commission declared the applications (nos. 22461/93 and 22465/93) admissible on 17 October 1994. In its report of 22 February 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), and that it was not necessary to determine whether there had been breaches of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8) or of Article 2 para. 1 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2-1). The full text of the Commission's opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.
At the hearing the Government requested the Court, by way of primary submission, to find the application inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies and, in the alternative, to hold that there had been no violation of the Convention or of Protocol No. 4 (P4).
