The case originated in an application (no. 316/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Yevgeniya Vasilyevna Napalkova (“the applicant”), on 6 November 2003.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Yuriy Zaytsev.
On 15 March 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the non-enforcement of the judgment in the applicant's favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in the town of Yuzhne,  region.
In February 2002 the applicant instituted proceedings against the Ministry of Education and Science (hereinafter “the Ministry”) alleging that she had won in the “Best School Textbook” competition organised by the Ministry. However, the prize had not been paid to her. The applicant claimed material and moral damages.
On 20 May 2002 the Shevchenkivsky District Court of Kyiv allowed the applicant's claim and ordered the Ministry to pay her UAH 2,015.34.
On 2 December 2002 the Shevchenkivsky District Bailiffs' Service (hereinafter “the Bailiffs”) instituted the enforcement proceedings.
As the Ministry failed to execute the judgment, the Bailiffs sent the writ of execution and payment order to the State Treasury. However, the payment order and the writ were returned to the Bailiffs without execution due to the lack of funds on the Ministry's accounts.
On 11 October 2002 the Bailiffs ordered the attachment of the Ministry's accounts. However, the State Treasury refused to execute this order referring to internal instructions prohibiting such actions.
In their submissions of 13 June 2005 the Government stated that during 2004-2005 the Bailiffs with their letters on several occasions informed the applicant that the amount due was allocated and that in order to receive payment she had to provide information concerning her bank account.
The applicant informed the Court that she had provided the Bailiffs with the information required.
To date, the amount due to the applicant under the judgment of 20 May 2002 was not paid.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-19).
