The case originated in an application (no. 17992/09) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a company incorporated under Moldovan law, Rusu Lintax SRL (“the applicant company”), on 18 March 2009.
The applicant company was represented by Mr V. Nagacevschi, a lawyer practising in Chișinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V. Grosu.
On 23 June 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant is a limited liability company incorporated under Moldovan law.
On 11 June 2008 the Supreme Court of Justice acknowledged the applicant company’s entitlement to a plot of land adjacent to a warehouse it owned. The judgment ordered the Public Property Agency to sell the plot of land to the applicant company. The judgment was final.
On 24 December 2008 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld an application for revision lodged by a third party, quashed the final judgment of 11 June 2008 and remitted the case for a fresh examination on the merits. As new evidence the court cited a letter dated 2 November 2007 from the Public Property Agency which, referring to the disputed plot of land and other plots, listed the legal provisions applicable to the sale of land that was public property.
After a fresh hearing, on 16 June 2010 the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed in a final judgment the applicant company’s claims in respect of the plot of land as unsubstantiated.
The relevant domestic law concerning the revision of a final judgment is set out in Popov v. Moldova (no. 2) (no. 19960/04, §§ 27-29, 6 December 2005), and Jomiru and Creţu v. Moldova, (no. 28430/06, §§ 26-27, 17 April 2012).
