The case originated in an application (no. 33188/07) against the Russia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mrs Yelena Yuryevna Chirykina (“the applicant”), on 23 June 2007.
The application was communicated to the Russian Government (“the Government”).
Having studied the terms of the Government’s unilateral declaration, the Court considers that the proposed declaration does not provide a sufficient basis for concluding that respect for human rights does not require it to continue its examination of the present application. The declaration is therefore rejected.
The relevant details of the application are set out in the appended table.
The applicant complained of the excessive length of civil proceedings.
