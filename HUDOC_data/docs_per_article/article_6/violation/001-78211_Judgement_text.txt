The construction works started in 1989 and in 1990 the title over the second land plot was transferred to V.
According to the applicant, in 1992 V. died leaving a will by which she bequeathed her part of the house to the applicant.
By 1995 the construction works had been nearly completed.
On 11 October 1995 Z. obtained a decision of the local administration transferring to him the title to the second land plot and moved into the house.
In response to the applicant's complaints that Z. had forged an official document concerning his share in V.'s inheritance, the local police refused to institute criminal proceedings for the lack of evidence of a crime.
The local prosecutor also advised the applicant that it would be possible to evict Z. from the house only on the basis of a court decision. It does not appear that the applicant brought proceedings for his eviction.
In October 1996 the applicant lodged with the  (“the ”) a complaint concerning the decision of the local administration transferring the land title to Z.
On 23 October 1996 the complaint was registered and accepted for examination.
