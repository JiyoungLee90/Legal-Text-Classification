After issuing numerous arrest warrants, the Pest Central District Court held several hearings. On 19 February 2009 it delivered a judgment in respect of sixteen defendants. The public prosecutor submitted an appeal in case of two defendants, where the District Court stated in the reasoning of its judgment that the length of the criminal proceedings was taken into account among the mitigating circumstances.
The first-instance judgment in respect of the applicant was delivered on 15 April 2010. The applicant was found guilty, inter alia, of aggravated fraud and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment whose enforcement was suspended for two years and exempted in advance from the effects of criminal conviction. The applicant did not appeal against this judgment and therefore received only a short version of the judgment, based on section 259 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which did not contain a detailed reasoning.
