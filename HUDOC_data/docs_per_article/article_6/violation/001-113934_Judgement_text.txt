The Pula Municipal Court on 16 September 2005 again allowed R.M. and A.P.’s claim. This judgment was upheld by the second-instance judgment of the Pula County Court of 19 November 2007. On the same day, the Pula County Court issued a separate decision by which the applicant’s appeal concerning the courts’ fees was dismissed.

Against the second-instance judgment of the , by which the judgment of the Pula Municipal Court of 16 September 2005 was upheld, the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the  (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) on 11 October 2008.
In his constitutional complaint the applicant complained about the interpretation of the relevant domestic law by the lower courts which he considered arbitrary and which had therefore deprived him of the right to a fair trial. He argued in particular that the Pula Municipal Court had not had jurisdiction in the matter; that the operative part of the judgment of that court could not be enforced since it was vague; that the part of the plot of land at dispute had been used for public purposes and as such could not be an object of private ownership; and that he had used the plot of land as its owner for specific purposes which had excluded any possibility of his dispossession. The applicant asked the  to quash the judgments of the lower courts and to order a retrial.

On the same date the applicant sent a letter to the  enclosing the acknowledgment of receipt of the judgment of 19 November 2007 by his counsel, showing that counsel had received that judgment on 12 September 2008. The applicant also asked the  to rectify its error by setting its decision aside and examining his complaints on the merits. The relevant part of his letter reads:

... I submit a copy of a post envelope which shows that the second-instance judgment was sent from the post office in Pula on 11 September 2008 ... and therefore it was served on 12 September 2008, and the time-limit for lodging a constitutional complaint was running until 12 October 2008 ... “
Since he received no reply, the applicant sent another letter on 2 February 2009, again pointing out that there had been an obvious error in calculation of the time-limit and asking that the error be rectified.
The applicant received a reply from the President of the Constitutional Court on 2 December 2009, stating that that court was not in a position to rectify its decision of 18 December 2008 and that it was open to the applicant to lodge an application with the European Court of Human Rights.

Therefore, and after having examined your submission, it was found that there are no procedural grounds, under the Constitution and the relevant law, for this court to decide as you requested.
