The case originated in two applications (nos. 34168/05 and 45750/07) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Ukrainian nationals, Mr Anatoliy Fyodorovich Savinskiy and Mr Oleksandr Igorovych Shevchenko (“the applicants”), on 1 September 2005 and 22 September 2007 respectively.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 12 December 2007 and 15 October 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants were born in 1939 and 1957 respectively and live in Pavlograd and .
By a judgment of 7 June 2001 the  (Павлоградський міський суд) awarded Mr Savinskiy 6,376.66 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) in salary arrears and other payments to be paid by his former employer, the State company Pershotravenskoye shakhtostroyitelnoye upravleniye-4.
By a judgment of 24 December 1997 the Slovyansk Town Court (Павлоградський міський суд) awarded Mr Shevchenko UAH 1,829.89 in salary arrears to be paid by his former employer, the Soda Plant (ВАТ «Содовий завод»), a joint stock company in which the State holds at least 25% of the share capital. By a judgment of 17 July 2000 the same court additionally ordered the debtor company to pay Mr Shevchenko UAH 7,173.09 in payments owed to him upon retirement.
After the above judgments had become final, the relevant departments of the State Bailiffs' Service instituted proceedings to enforce them.
Subsequently, the insolvency and later the liquidation proceedings against the debtor companies were instituted and the State Bailiffs' Service terminated the enforcement proceedings. The above-mentioned liquidation proceedings are apparently still pending.
The judgments in the applicants' favour remain unenforced.
The relevant domestic law is set out in the judgment of 26 April 2005 in the case of Sokur v. Ukraine (no. 29439/02, §§ 17-22).
