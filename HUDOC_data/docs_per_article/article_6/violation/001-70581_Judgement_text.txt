The case originated in an application (no. 24669/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Galina Petrovna Gerasimova (“the applicant”), on 20 May 2002.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Pavel Laptev, Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicant alleged that the judgment of the Commercial Court of the Samara Region of 4 September 1995 had not been executed by the State.
The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
By a partial decision of 13 November 2003, the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and communicated the complaint concerning the failure to execute the judgment of the Commercial Court of the Samara Region of 4 September 1995 to the respondent Government. By a decision of 16 September 2004, the Court declared the remainder of the application admissible.
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other's observations.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Chapayevsk, Samara Region.
On 4 September 1995 the Commercial Court of the Samara Region (Арбитражный суд Самарской области) granted a claim by the applicant's employer – a private company – for recovery of damages against the Chapayevsk Social Security Service (Управление социальной защиты населения администрации г. Чапаевска).
On 15 August 1997 the applicant's employer assigned her a part of the judgment debt in the amount of RUR 114,000,000 towards salary due.  The applicant applied to the Chapayevsk Town Court of the Samara Region for execution of the judgment on 29 May 1998.
It appears that by 2001 only the amount of RUR 16,000 has been paid to the applicant. As the judgment had not been executed in full, in 2001 she filed a claim with the Chapayevsk Town Court of the Samara Region against the Chapayevsk Social Security Service for recovery of the sum with interest.
The Chapayevsk Town Court of the Samara Region dismissed the claim on 5 April 2001 on the ground that the applicant had failed to substantiate her calculation of the amount of the interest.  On 19 September 2001 the Presidium of the , following an application for supervisory review lodged by the President of the , quashed the judgment of 5 April 2001 and remitted the case for a fresh examination.
On 21 June 2002 the Chapayevsk Town Court of the Samara Region dismissed the claim and indicated that the execution of judgment by the Chapayevsk Social Security Service had been carried out according to the sums allocated from the budget. Thus, in 2000 the budget estimate provided for RUR 16,000 to be paid in instalments during that year. The estimate for 2001 provided for RUR 5,000 to be paid to the applicant, and the estimate for 2002 provided for RUR 12,000, out of which RUR 5,000 was paid to the applicant as of 1 June 2002. The outstanding debt remained at RUR 87,445.
It is not clear whether any further payments have been made.
