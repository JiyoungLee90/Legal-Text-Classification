The case originated in eight applications (see the Annex to this judgment) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) between 3 March 2009 and 6 January 2010. The applicants were all Serbian nationals, and their further personal details are set out in the said Annex.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 13 June 2012 and 23 August 2012 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the applications by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants were former employees of “Društveno preduzeće Industrija mesa ‘Crvena zvezda’” Kragujevac (hereinafter “the debtor”), which was, at the relevant time, a company predominantly comprised of socially-owned capital.
On 15 October 2002 the Commercial Court (Trgovinski sud) in Kragujevac opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor (St. 1079/02).
The applicants duly submitted their claims for the payment of due salary arrears and related employment benefits.
On 25 August 2003 and 11 October 2004 the Commercial Court accepted some of the applicants’ claims. As regards the remainder of their claims, it instructed them to initiate a regular civil suit. Two of the applicants did so and on 31 May 2004, 1 June 2004 and 21 January 2005 the Commercial Court ordered the debtor to pay them different amounts on account of salary arrears and related employment benefits, together with statutory interest and legal costs.
On 20 February 2009 the Commercial Court terminated the insolvency proceedings. This decision was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia on 27 March 2009 (no. 21/09) and became final on 16 July 2009.
On 26 February 2010 the debtor ceased to exist.
The court decisions rendered in the applicants’ favour on 25 August 2003, 11 October 2004, 31 May 2004, 1 June 2004 and 21 January 2005 (see paragraph 8 above) became final on an unspecified date. They remain only partly enforced to the present day.
