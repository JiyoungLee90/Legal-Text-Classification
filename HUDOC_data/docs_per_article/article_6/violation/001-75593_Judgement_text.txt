The case originated in an application (no. 24661/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Mr Vinko Buj (“the applicant”), on 1 May 2002.
The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Š. Stažnik.
On 8 December 2004 the Court decided to communicate the application. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Jelsa.
The applicant’s mother died on 1 May 1994 and inheritance proceedings were opened before the Stari Grad Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Starom Gradu).
On 8 June 1999 the court issued a decision distributing the property between the applicant and his brother. The relevant part of that decision reads:
... the land registry division of this court shall register the ownership of the heirs [listed above], once [that part of the decision] becomes final...
Subsequently, the applicant’s brother lodged an appeal against that decision complaining about the ruling on the costs of the proceedings.
On 12 April 2002 the  (Županijski sud u Splitu) declared the appeal inadmissible. The decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 22 May 2002.
It would appear that the applicant’s ownership of the inherited property has to date not been recorded in the land register.
