The case originated in an application (no. 45758/14) against the Czech Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Czech national, Mr Josef Beránek (“the applicant”), on 16 June 2014.
The applicant was represented by Ms V. Burianová, a lawyer practising in Plzeň. The Czech Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V.A. Schorm of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been deprived of his right of access to a court, since the Constitutional Court had erroneously rejected his constitutional appeal as being out of time.
On 17 June 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Smědčice.
On 9 November 2006 the applicant requested a building permit for temporary stables for horses. On 6 January 2011 the Rokycany Planning Office (stavební úřad) dismissed his request and on 26 May 2011 the Plzeň Regional Office (krajský úřad) upheld that decision.
On 29 March 2013 the Plzeň Regional Court (krajský soud) dismissed a complaint lodged by the applicant against the decision of the Plzeň Regional Office.
On 31 July 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court (Nejvyšší správní soud) dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant. The decision was served on the applicant on 28 August 2013.
On 29 October 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint (ústavní stížnost).
On 31 March 2014 the Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud) rejected the applicant’s appeal as being lodged out of time. It held that as the Supreme Administrative Court’s decision had been served on him on 28 August 2013, the last day of the two-month time-limit for lodging a constitutional appeal was 28 October 2013.
On 8 April 2014 the applicant wrote to the Constitutional Court urging it to set aside its decision. He argued that as 28 October 2013 had been a national holiday, domestic procedural rules provided that the last day for lodging his appeal had been the following day, namely 29 October 2013.
By a letter of 11 April 2014 the Registrar (generální sekretář) of the Constitutional Court acknowledged that the judge-rapporteur had undoubtedly overlooked the fact that the time-limit had been complied with. However, as the Constitutional Court did not have the power to set aside its own decision, he advised the applicant to lodge an application with the European Court of Human Rights.
Under section 63, unless stated otherwise, the Code of Civil Procedure must be applied by default in proceedings before the Constitutional Court.
Section 72(3) provides that a constitutional appeal may be lodged within two months of the decision on the last available remedy being served.
Under Article 57 § 2, if the last day of a time-limit falls on a national holiday, the next working day following the national holiday is the last day of that time-limit.
