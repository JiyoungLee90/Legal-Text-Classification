The case originated in an application (no. 38311/02) against the Greek Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by fifty-eight Greek nationals (“the applicants”), listed in the Appendix, on 17 October 2002.
The applicants were represented by Mr D. Nikopoulos and Mr K. Gyiokas, of the Salonika Bar. The Greek Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent's delegates, Mr V. Kyriazopoulos, Adviser, Legal Council of State, and Mr I. Bakopoulos, Legal Assistant, Legal Council of State.
The applicants complained, in particular, under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, about the length of two sets of proceedings before the .
The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 25 March 2004 the Chamber decided to communicate part of the application to the Government and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 24 March 2005, the Court declared the remaining complaints partly admissible.
The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits of the case (Rule 59 § 1).
On 7 April 1925 the Greek State expropriated an area of land measuring 534,892 m², located on the outskirts of the town of Salonika (Mikra district), for the purpose of building an airport. This area, which now falls within the jurisdiction of Kalamaria Town Council, included plots of land which belonged to the applicants' ascendants.
The amount of expropriation allowance was set by judgments nos. 1321/1926 and 703/1929 of the Salonika Court of First Instance, no. 9/1930 of the Salonika Appeal Court and no. 116/1931 of the Court of Cassation.
By judgment no. 293/1936 of the President of the Salonika Court of First Instance, the applicants' ascendants were recognised as being entitled to the compensation in question. However, the State refused to pay it. The airport was ultimately constructed elsewhere.
On 22 June 1967, by a joint decision of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Public Works (no. E.17963/8019), the State went ahead with expropriation of the above-mentioned area, which included the disputed plots of land, with a view to building housing for workers. As the decision did not fulfil a public-interest aim, however, it was revoked on 6 July 1972.
On 29 June 1972 a royal decree designated the land for the construction of a sports centre.
On 14 May 1987 the Salonika prefect modified the development plan (ρυμοτομικό σχέδιο) for the area, which he designated as a “green area” and “sports and leisure zone”. This decision was confirmed by a decision of the Minister of the Environment and Public Works dated 31 July 1987 and by a presidential decree of 22 August 1988.
On 28 June 1994 the applicants or their ascendants applied to the  requesting that the development plan in force be amended to have the encumbrance affecting their land removed. The prefecture did not reply.
On 20 November 1994 the applicants or their ascendants applied to the , seeking to have set aside the authorities' implicit refusal to remove the encumbrance affecting their land.
On 11 January 1996 the Kalamaria Town Council filed its observations on the case. A hearing was held on 26 March 1997.
On 20 October 1997 the  granted the applicants' request. In particular, it found that, having failed for a long time to proceed with the expropriation of the land in question in furtherance of the project provided for in the development plan, the authorities were duty bound to lift the encumbrance on the disputed properties. The  sent the case back to the authorities, asking them to take the necessary measures to make available the applicants' land (judgments nos. 4445/1997, 4447/1997 and 4448/1997). Those judgments were finalised and certified as authentic on 25 February 1998.
On 30 September 1998 Kalamaria Town Council lodged a third-party appeal (τριτανακοπή) against the above-mentioned judgments by the . This form of appeal, open to persons who have been neither parties to nor represented in proceedings, enables them to contest a decision which adversely affects them. Where the third-party appeal – which does not have suspensive effect – is found to be valid, the impugned judgments are set aside retrospectively and the application to the administrative court is re-examined. In the instant case, as the third-party appeal did not have suspensive effect, judgments nos. 4445/1997, 4447/1997 and 4448/1997 thus remained immediately enforceable.
On 28 November 2001 the  declared the third-party appeal inadmissible (judgments nos. 4148/2001, 4149/2001 and 4150/2001). It held that Kalamaria Town Council could not rely on this form of appeal since it had already had an opportunity to submit its observations on the case. The above-mentioned judgments were finalised and certified as authentic on 17 April 2002.
On 13 May 1999 the Minister for the Environment and Public Works modified the urban development plan of Kalamaria municipality in order to designate the land in question as the site for a sports and leisure centre (decision no. 12122/2761).
On 9 September 1999 the applicants or their ascendants applied to the  seeking to have the above-mentioned decision set aside. On 11 September 2002 they submitted various documents in support of their application, including the title deeds to the properties. The hearing, initially scheduled for 8 November 2000, was postponed several occasions times. It was finally held on 29 October 2003. The  has not yet delivered its judgment.
