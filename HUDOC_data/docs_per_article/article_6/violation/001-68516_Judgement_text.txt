The case originated in an application (no. 72701/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Yevgeniy Vladimirovich Yakovlev, on 21 May 2001.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that he was unable to take part in the appeal hearing because of the belated service of the summons.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

On 31 March 2000 the Tsentralniy District Court of Chelyabinsk dismissed the applicant’s action and confirmed the lawfulness of the Medical Service’s decision.
The applicant appealed to the . He complained that the proceedings before the district court had been a “travesty of justice” and that his arguments had not been given due consideration.
On 31 July 2000 the  upheld the judgment of 31 March 2000. It appears from the ’s judgment that the matter was determined on the basis of the case-file with the presiding judge acting as the rapporteur. Neither party was present at the appeal hearing.

Article 144 required that civil cases be heard in a court session with mandatory notification to all parties to the case.
