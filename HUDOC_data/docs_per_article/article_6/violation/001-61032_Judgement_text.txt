The case originated in an application (no. 46161/99) against the Italian Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mrs Giuseppa Pepe (“the applicant”), on 15 December 1998.
The applicant was represented by Mr C. Aiello, a lawyer practising in Naples. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, and by their successive co-agents respectively, Mr V. Esposito and Mr F. Crisafulli.
Invoking Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the applicant complained about the length of the eviction proceedings. The Court also examined the case under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.
On 31 January 2002 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Sorrento.
She is the owner of a flat in Meta (Naples), which she had let to V.C.
In a writ served on the tenant on 24 January 1987, the applicant informed the tenant of her intention to terminate the lease and summoned him to appear before the Sorrento Magistrate.
By a decision of 12 July 1989, which was made enforceable on 26 September 1989, the Sorrento Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 4 May 1991.
On 18 June 1992, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises.
On 27 July 1992 she served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 12 August 1992.
Between 12 August 1992 and 16 June 1998 the bailiff made thirteen attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as, under the statutory provisions providing for the suspension, the applicant was not entitled to police assistance in enforcing the order for possession.
On 18 June 1998 the applicant recovered possession of the flat.
The relevant domestic law is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V.
