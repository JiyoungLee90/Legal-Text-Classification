On 15 March 2004 the applicant applied to the , challenging the length of the proceedings before the Trnava District Court.
On 4 November 2004 the  rejected his complaint. It noted that, in accordance with its long-established practice, it could examine complaints in respect of the length of the proceedings only if the proceedings were still pending before the authority liable for the alleged violation. The proceedings before the District Court had ended before the introduction of his constitutional complaint.
On 7 November 2005 the Constitutional Court found that the Trnava District Court, of which the applicant exclusively complained, had violated the applicant's right under Article 48 § 2 of the Constitution to a hearing without unjustified delay and his right under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to a hearing within a reasonable time.
The  held that there was a degree of factual complexity to the case which could not, however, justify the length of the proceedings. The applicant's conduct had not contributed to the length of the proceedings. However, the exercise of his procedural rights (counterclaim, challenge of a judge for bias, waiver of the court fees) had prolonged the proceedings, which could not be imputed to the relevant authority. The District Court's ineffective performance (from delivery of its judgment, two years had passed before the case file was duly transferred to the Regional Court for decision on the applicant's appeals; its judgment was quashed on account of insufficient establishment of the facts) had resulted in avoidable delays.
The  awarded the applicant SKK 20,000 (the equivalent of 514 euros at that time) as just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage. It ordered the Trnava District Court to avoid any further delay in the proceedings and to reimburse the applicant's legal costs.
