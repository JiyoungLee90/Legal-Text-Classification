The case originated in an application (no. 7867/06) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Pavel Vasilyevich Goncharov (“the applicant”), on 4 February 2006.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Yuriy Zaytsev.
On 12 September 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Artemivsk.
On 16 April 1998 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Artemivsk Town Court against the company A., his former employer, and the State Pension Fund, seeking recalculation of his salary and pension and recovery of salary and pension arrears.
On 5 May 1999, further to the applicant's request, the court ordered an expert examination as regards the accuracy of the calculation of the applicant's salary and pension and suspended the proceedings awaiting the results of the examination.
On 18 November 1999 the court, further to the applicant's request, cancelled the examination and resumed the proceedings.
During the period from 18 November 1999 to 8 April 2002 no court hearings were held in the case.
On 7 February 2003 the court rejected the applicant's claims as not based on the relevant law.
On 6 March 2003 the applicant appealed.
On 13 March 2003 the first-instance court allowed the applicant until 25 March 2003 to rectify shortcomings in his appeal.
On 21 March 2003 the applicant submitted his rectified appeal.
On 12 June 2003 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of 7 February 2003.
On 27 August 2003 the applicant appealed in cassation.
By a ruling of 2 September 2003 the first-instance court returned the appeal in cassation to the applicant as lodged out of time.
On 11 September 2003 the applicant appealed against that ruling.
Further to the court's instructions he rectified shortcomings in that appeal and resubmitted it on 18 September 2003.
On 30 October 2003 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal quashed the ruling of 2 September 2003.
On 13 November 2003 the first-instance court granted the applicant extension of the time-limit for lodging his appeal in cassation.
On 9 September 2005 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's appeal in cassation as unsubstantiated.
Of twenty court hearings six were adjourned at the respondent's request or due to its representative's failure to appear, eight following the applicant's requests and due to the introduction of additional claims.
