The case originated in an application (no. 2834/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Petko Iliev Petkov, on 10 January 2006.
The applicant was represented by Ms M. Guncheva, a lawyer practising in Haskovo. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Dimova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the dismissal of his inheritance claim on the basis of an unforeseeable procedural requirement stemming from an interpretative decision of the Supreme Court of Cassation which had not been communicated to him had breached his rights to effective access to court and peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.
On 15 March 2010 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Haskovo.
In a will dated 21 March 1991 the applicant’s father bequeathed his whole estate to his brother, Mr L.I. Subsequently, in a deed of donation dated 29 December 1997, the applicant’s father transferred to L.I. a share in a house and yard which belonged to him.
The applicant’s father died on 22 December 2002.
On an unspecified date in 2003 the applicant brought an action against Mr L.I., claiming that the will of 1991 and the donation of 1997 infringed his right to a “reserved share” in his late father’s estate. He also brought a partition claim against Mr L.I. in respect of two real properties. It appears that the applicant was represented by counsel.
On 15 May 2003 the Haskovo District Court rejected the applicant’s claim as inadmissible. It reasoned that the applicant had not drawn up an inventory of the property in his father’s estate, which was a procedural prerequisite for claiming a reserved share from individuals who were not heirs-at-law of the deceased. The applicant appealed against the decision.
On 18 June 2003 the  quashed the decision of 15 May 2003 and remitted the case for further examination. Relying on established case-law, it held that the applicant’s uncle was an heir-at-law of the applicant’s father within the meaning of section 30(2) of the Inheritance Act and that, therefore, the applicant was not required to have claimed his reserved share of the inheritance by means of an inventory.
In a judgment of 29 July 2004 the Haskovo District Court restored the applicant’s reserved share in the two real properties and declared admissible his partition action. It held that the two dispositions made by the applicant’s father had practically disinherited the applicant and had therefore violated his right to a reserved share, which amounted to half of his father’s estate.
Following an appeal by Mr L.I., on 3 January 2005 the  upheld the judgment of 29 July 2004. Relying on an interpretative decision of the Supreme Court of 1964, it rejected the defendant’s objection that the applicant was not entitled to claim his reserved share because he had not claimed the inheritance through the drawing up of an inventory.
On 25 February 2005 Mr L.I. lodged an appeal on points of law. In a request filed on 7 June 2005 Mr L.I. asked the court to discontinue the proceedings relying on Interpretative Decision No. 1 of 2005, adopted by the Supreme Court of Cassation (“the SCC”) on 4 February 2005, in which that court declared the relevant part of the interpretative decision of 1964 no longer applicable and considered that the term “heirs-at-law” in section 30(2) of the Inheritance Act 1949 should be interpreted as meaning only heirs-at-law who effectively succeeded to the deceased’s estate (see paragraph 17 below). It is not clear whether the applicant was notified about this request before the hearing of the SCC held on 14 June 2005. In a judgment of 14 July 2005 the SCC quashed the judgment of 3 January 2005 and dismissed the applicant’s claims. Relying on Interpretative Decision No. 1 of 4 February 2005, it held that the applicant had not complied with the statutory requirements for claiming his reserved share, since he had not claimed the inheritance by means of an inventory.
The Inheritance Act of 1949 preserves to a certain circle of heirs a reserved share in their deceased relative’s estate. If this share has been infringed by donations or wills made by their relative during his lifetime, such heirs may, within three years of his death, claim the reduction of such dispositions up to the amount of their reserved share. Pursuant to section 30(2) of the Inheritance Act, where the defendant to such an action is not an heir-at-law, the plaintiff must have identified the entirety of the inheritance by means of an inventory (“опис”), an official list drawn up by the district judge on the basis of the heir’s statements describing all reported items of the deceased’s estate. There is no need of an inventory where the legatee is an heir-at-law. The right to take steps for the preparation of an inventory may be exercised within three months after the heir has learned about his relative’s death. This period may be extended by the District Court by up to three months (section 61 of the Inheritance Act of 1949).
Pursuant to the case-law of the domestic courts, section 30(2) serves as a guarantee against possible fraudulent claims from heirs entitled to a reserved share against successors by will or donation who are not as closely related to the deceased and may therefore be unaware of the deceased’s aggregate assets, and accordingly of whether the reserved share has indeed been infringed.
In a binding interpretative decision of 1964, the Supreme Court defined “heirs-at-law” as all potential heirs specified in the Inheritance Act of 1949, such as the surviving spouse, descendants, ascendants, siblings and more distant relatives, whether or not they actually inherited or were preempted by heirs of immediate priority.
On 4 February 2005 the SCC adopted Interpretative Decision No. 1 of 2005, which expressly declared the relevant part of the decision of 1964 no longer applicable. The court noted that there had been “social and legal changes” since 1964, such as the inclusion in the Inheritance Act of more distant relatives as potential heirs and the restitution of property nationalised by the communist regime. In the court’s opinion, those changes could effectively prevent successors by will or deed, if not closely related to the deceased, from knowing the exact scope of his or her assets, and hence from defending themselves successfully against heirs claiming that their right to a reserved share had been infringed by such dispositions. On the basis of those reasons, the court concluded that it was necessary to change the interpretation of the term “heirs-at-law” for the purposes of section 30(2) of the Inheritance Act to mean only heirs of immediate priority of succession, that is to say, only the individuals who effectively succeeded to the deceased’s estate. As a result, since 4 February 2005, claiming an inheritance through an inventory has been considered a pre-requisite for bringing a claim against all successors by deed or will, save those with immediate priority of succession. The interpretative decision of 4 February 2005 did not envisage any interim rules or transition period for its application to pending proceedings.
In a judgment of 2009 (реш. № 681 от 24.09.2009 г. по гр.д. № 3189/2008 г., І г.о. на ВКС) the SCC found that the judicial interpretation of legal provisions had an effect from the date on which the latter had entered into force. It confirmed that the new interpretation of the term “heirs-at-law” given in the interpretative decision of 2005 was the result of the changing social and economic conditions described therein.
In subsequent judgments (реш. № 698 от 06.01.2010 г. по гр.д. № 22/2009 г., IІ г.о. на ВКС; реш. № 82 от 16.03.2011 г. по гр.д. № 221/2010 г., IІ г.о. на ВКС; реш. № 324 от 16.10.2012 г. по гр.д. № 654/2011 г., I г.о. на ВКС) the SCC noted that the courts had misinterpreted Interpretative Decision No. 1 of 2005, applying the requirement for an inventory also in cases where the plaintiff’s deceased relative had bequeathed his entire estate in favour of the defendant. It held that in such cases the defendant had effectively succeeded to the estate of the deceased and therefore the disinherited plaintiff had not been required to make an inventory. It based its conclusion on its well-established case-law, according to which, in cases where the plaintiff had been disinherited in favour of the defendant, the former was only required to show his status of an heir entitled to a reserved share. The particular properties comprising the estate were of no relevance and the plaintiff was not required to produce evidence in that respect; in such cases the courts would reduce the dispositions made by the deceased in proportion to the reserved share of the plaintiff (реш. № 752 от 10.10.1994 г. по гр.д. № 628/1994 г., І г.о. на ВКС; реш. № 187 от 20.04.2011 г. по гр.д. № 1780/2009 г., І г.о. на ВКС; опр. № 829 от 23.10.2012 г. по гр.д. № 619/2012 г., І г.о. на ВКС). It concluded that the requirement for an inventory under section 30(2) of the Inheritance Act was applicable only in cases where the defendant had succeeded to particular items of the deceased’s estate and not to the entire estate.
Pursuant to the Judiciary Act 1994, in force until 2007, interpretative decisions were adopted by the SCC in cases of incorrect or contradictory case-law and were binding on the judiciary and the executive. The Judiciary Act 1994 did not provide that newly adopted interpretative decisions should be published or otherwise communicated to parties to pending proceedings.
Section 50 of the above Act provides:
“1.  The interpretation is [regarded as having] effect from the day on which the instrument which is being interpreted has entered into force.
Exceptionally, if retrospective interpretation may give rise to complications, the authority which has issued the interpretative decision may direct that the interpretation shall have effect only prospectively. In that case, the interpretation shall take effect three days after being published.”
Pursuant to Article 303 § 1 (7) of the Code of Civil Procedure of 2007 (“the CCP”), civil proceedings may be reopened when a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights establishes that the Convention has been violated and when a fresh examination of the case is necessary in order to eliminate the consequences of the violation. The interested party may make the request no later than six months after the judgment has become final (Article 305 § 2 of the CCP). The request is examined by the SCC (Article 307 of the CCP).
