The last hearing in 1998 was held by the District Court on 25 February 1998. Then the case file was lost. On 31 May 2000 the District Court resumed the proceedings.
On 9 June 2000 the District Court ordered reconstruction of the case file.
On 26 July 2001 the District Court partly allowed the applicant's claims.
On 14 March 2002 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal quashed that judgment and remitted the case to the first-instance court for fresh consideration.
