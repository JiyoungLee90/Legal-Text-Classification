The case originated in an application (no. 43798/05) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Nataliya Oleksiyivna Sergeyeva (“the applicant”), on 15 November 2005.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that her Convention rights had been infringed on account of lengthy enforcement of a judgment given in her favour.
On 20 January 2009 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Kyiv.
On 28 January 2004 the Shevchenkivskiy District Court of Kyiv obliged the Shevchenkivskiy District Administration of Kyiv to regularise privatisation of the apartment, which the applicant occupied with her family.
On 13 May 2004 this judgment was upheld by the Kyiv City Court of Appeal and on 27 July 2004 the bailiff service instituted enforcement proceedings in its respect.
On 9 December 2004 the judgment was further upheld by the Supreme Court of Ukraine and became final.
On several occasions the enforcement proceedings were suspended on account of various objections and requests for clarification by the debtor. On 17 and 23 February 2005 the bailiffs' service imposed fines on the Head of the Administration on account of his failure to ensure enforcement of the judgment. In March 2005 the bailiffs' service further requested the prosecutors' office to institute criminal proceedings against him on account of evasion of enforcement, which request on 14 March 2005 was rejected.
On 15 April 2005 the Shevchenkivskiy District Administration issued the applicant and her family with a privatisation certificate and the enforcement proceedings were discontinued. However, in view of the fact that the State Real Estate Inventory Bureau (Бюро технічної інвентаризації) refused to register the applicant's family's title to the apartment on the basis that the title documents issued to another party, a municipal company, had not been invalidated, the enforcement proceedings were subsequently renewed.
On 6 December 2005 the bailiffs' service imposed a fine on the debtor for non-enforcement of the judgment in the applicant's family's favour.
On 19 December 2005 the Shevchenkivskiy District Administration instituted court proceedings seeking invalidation of the municipal company's title to the apartment and the enforcement proceedings in the applicant's favour were suspended.
On 2 June 2006 the Shevchenkivskiy District Court of Kyiv invalidated the municipal company's title to the apartment.
On 20 November 2006 the Real Estate Inventory Bureau registered the applicant's family's title to the apartment and on 8 December 2006 the enforcement proceedings were terminated.
The relevant provisions of the domestic law are cited in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-19, 27 July 2004) and the admissibility decision in the case of Skubenko v. Ukraine (no. 41152/98, 6 April 2004).
