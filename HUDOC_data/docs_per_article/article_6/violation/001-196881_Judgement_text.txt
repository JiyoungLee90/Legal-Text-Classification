The case originated in three applications (nos. 15364/11, 49623/11 and 55790/11) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Russian nationals. Their details and the dates of their applications to the Court appear below in the Appendix.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 18 May 2015 the complaints concerning non-enforcement of the final judgments and insufficiency of compensation for non-enforcement were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the applications nos. 49623/11 and 55790/11 were declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court. The Government did not object to the examination of the application by a Committee.
The applicants obtained final court judgments in their favour, according to which different State authorities were ordered to pay them lump sums. Since there was a delay in their enforcement, the applicants sought compensation in this respect under the Compensation Act. Their claims for compensation were granted. The respective information about the judgments in the applicants’ favour, courts decisions concerning the compensation awards and respective sums are indicated in the Appendix.
Federal Law № 68-ФЗ “On Compensation for Violation of the Right to a Trial within a Reasonable Time or the Right to Enforcement of a Judgment within a Reasonable Time” of 30 April 2010 (in force as of 4 May 2010) provides that in case of a violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time or of the right to enforcement of a final judgment, the Russian citizens are entitled to seek compensation of the non-pecuniary damage.
