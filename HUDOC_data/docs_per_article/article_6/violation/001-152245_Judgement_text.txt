The case originated in an application (no. 30361/12) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr János Dániel Szabó (“the applicant”), on 27 April 2012.
The applicant was represented by Mr T. Borsos, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 25 July 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Szigethalom.
Between 13 December 2004 and 4 April 2012 criminal proceedings, on charges of disorderly conduct, were being carried out against the applicant before the Ráckeve District Court, this period including a remittal ordered by the Pest County Regional Court.
The first judgment given by the District Court on 29 March 2010 contained the lapse of time as a minor mitigating factor.
However, the second, final judgment given by the Regional Court on 4 April 2012 (that is, after the remittal) was a simplified decision which did not contain any considerations about mitigation.
