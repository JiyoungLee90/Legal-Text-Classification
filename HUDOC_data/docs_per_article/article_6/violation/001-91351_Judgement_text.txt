The case originated in two applications (nos. 6058/02 and 18074/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Mehmet Şirin Ek and Mr Hüseyin Şıktaş (“the applicants”), on 16 November 2001 and 14 May 2003 respectively.
The applicants were represented by Mr O.K. Cengiz and Ms M. Kırdök respectively, lawyers practising in Izmir and Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 4 January 2006 and 3 October 2006 respectively, the Court decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants were born in 1975 and 1978 respectively. The facts common to these cases are that the applicants were arrested and placed in custody in different times and places. During their custody period, they were interrogated by the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge respectively, in the absence of a lawyer. These statements were subsequently used for their convictions by the trial court.
The details concerning the applications are indicated in the table below.
