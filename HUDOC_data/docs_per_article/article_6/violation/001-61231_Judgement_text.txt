The case originated in an application (no. 32190/96) against the  lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Giuseppe Luordo (“the applicant”), on 28 March 1996.
The applicant was represented before the Court by Mr F. Fiandrotti, a lawyer practising in . The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented successively by their Agents, Mr U. Leanza and Mr I.M. Braguglia, and by their respective Co-Agents, Mr V. Esposito and Mr F. Crisafulli.
The applicant alleged a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in that a bankruptcy order had deprived him of all his possessions. He further complained that after he had been declared bankrupt all the correspondence addressed to him had been handed over to the trustee in bankruptcy (Article 8 of the Convention) and that the bankruptcy order prevented him from taking legal proceedings to defend his interests (Article 6 § 1). Lastly, relying on Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, the applicant complained of the rule barring bankrupts from moving away from their place of residence.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1. Mr V. Zagrebelsky, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr G. Raimondi to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 23 May 2002 the Chamber declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits of the case (Rule 59 § 1).

He also reserved the right to make a further proposal for the sale of the property at auction.
On 3 March 1995, in response to a request by the judge on 17 February 1995, the trustee in bankruptcy explained that there had been no partial distribution (ripartizione parziale) of the assets among the creditors because appeals were still pending before the Tax Commissioners.

On 6 February 1996 the judge fixed 19 April 1996 as the date for the auction of the applicant's house.
On an unspecified date the applicant sought a composition with the creditors. His application was declared inadmissible on 1 April 1996 on the ground that it did not satisfy the conditions laid down by section 124 of the Bankruptcy Act.
On 5 April 1996 the applicant asked the judge to refer to the Constitutional Court the question of the legitimacy of the system of proprietorial and personal disabilities to which bankrupts were subject and, in particular, sections 48, 49 and 50(3) of the Bankruptcy Act and Articles 350, 393, 407, 2382, 2417, 2488 and 2516 of the Civil Code. In a decision of 17 April 1996, the judge rejected that application as being manifestly ill-founded, holding that the legislature's decision to give the creditors' proprietorial interests precedence over those of the bankrupt did not entail a violation of the debtor's rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

On 19 April 1996 the sale of the applicant's house by auction was adjourned to 21 April, when it was sold.

On 17 July 1999 the judge terminated the bankruptcy.
