The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Klimovsk in the Moscow Region.
In February 1999 the applicant brought an action against the Moscow Region health department, seeking to declare invalid some data in his medical records. The disputed information related to the applicant’s degree of disability and affected his pension entitlement and fitness for work.

On 10 September 1999 the applicant filed an appeal. The appeal hearing was listed for 28 March 2000.
On 20 March 2000 the applicant was admitted to a hospital for inpatient treatment. On 27 March 2000 his acquaintance asked the Moscow City Court, by a telegram sent on the applicant’s behalf, for an adjournment of the hearing. The Government denied that the telegram had been sent.
On 28 March 2000 the Moscow City Court adjourned the appeal hearing until 4 April 2000. The Government submitted that the hearing had been adjourned because there had been no information that the applicant had been duly summoned.
On 30 March 2000 the Moscow City Court mailed to the applicant a new summons for the hearing listed for 4 April. According to the postmark, it reached the applicant’s address on 5 April.
On 4 April 2000 the Moscow City Court examined the appeal and rejected it. Neither party was present.
On 7 April 2000 the applicant left the hospital.
On 31 August 2000 the Moscow City Court informed the applicant that his appeal had been rejected on 4 April 2000.
The RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure of 11 June 1964 (in force at the material time) provided that a summons was to be served on the parties and their representatives in such a way that they would have enough time to appear at the hearing and prepare their case. Where necessary, the parties could be summoned by a phone call or a telegram (Article 106).
Court summonses were to be sent by mail or by courier and served on the person who was a party to the case (Articles 108 and 109).
If a party to the case failed to appear and there was no evidence that the party had been duly summoned, the hearing had to be adjourned (Article 299).
The appeal court delivered its judgment in accordance with the rules established for the first-instance courts (Article 304). The court was required to announce the operative part of its decision in the final hearing and to indicate the date when the parties would be able to take cognisance of the entire text of the judgment (Article 203).
