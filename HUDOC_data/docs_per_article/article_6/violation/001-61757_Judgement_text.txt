The case originated in an application (no. 49806/99) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mrs Tatiana Prodan, on 5 January 1999.
The applicant was represented by Mr Vitalie Nagacevschi acting on behalf of the “Lawyers for Human Rights”, a non-governmental organisation based in Chişinău.
The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Vitalie Parlog, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the failure to enforce a final judgment in her favour was incompatible with the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
By a decision of 7 January 2003, the Court declared the application admissible.
The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other's observations.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
By a letter dated 4 September 2003 the Government informed the Court of the adoption and entry into force of a new Civil Code and the amendment of certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and raised an additional preliminary objection in this connection.
The applicant was born in 1924 and lives in Chişinău.
In June 1946 the Soviet authorities nationalised the applicant's parents' house. In 1949 her parents were deported to Siberia.
On 8 December 1992 the Moldovan Parliament enacted Law No. 1225-XII “on the rehabilitation of the victims of the political repression committed by the totalitarian communist occupying regime”. The Law enabled the victims of the Soviet repression to claim their confiscated or nationalised property.
In 1997 the applicant lodged an action with the Centru District Court (Judecătoria Sectorului Centru) by which she sought the restitution of her parents' house. At the material time the disputed house consisted of six apartments: nos. 3, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13. Since apartments nos. 3, 6, 7, 8 and 13 had been purchased by their former tenants, the applicant sought to declare null and void the contracts by which they had been purchased from the State. She also sought the eviction of all the occupants of the house.
On 14 March 1997 the Centru District Court found in favour of the applicant and ordered the restitution of the house. It declared null and void the contracts by which apartments nos. 3, 6, 7, 8 and 13 had been sold to their tenants. The court further ordered the Municipal Council to evict all the occupants, including those of apartment no. 12, and indicated that the Municipal Council was to provide all the tenants with alternative accommodation.
The Municipal Council and the occupants lodged an appeal with the  (Tribunalul Municipiului Chişinău) against the judgment of the Centru District Court. On 17 October 1997 the  allowed the appeal and quashed the judgment of the Centru District Court.
The applicant lodged an appeal in cassation against the judgment of the . On 31 March 1998 the Court of Appeal (Curtea de Apel) rejected the appeal in cassation and upheld the judgment of the .
Following a request by the applicant, the Procurator General's Office applied for annulment of the judgments of the  and the Court of Appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice (Curtea Supremă de Justiţie).
On 19 August 1998 the Supreme Court of Justice quashed the judgments of the Chişinău Regional Court and of the Court of Appeal, and upheld the judgment of the Centru District Court of 14 March 1997 on the ground that both the Chişinău Regional Court and the Court of Appeal had failed to observe the provisions of Law no. 1225-XII of 8 December 1992 (see paragraph 30 below).
On an unspecified date in 1998, after having obtained the enforcement warrant, the applicant asked the Municipal Council to execute the judgment of 14 March 1997. In a letter of 14 January 1999, the Municipal Council informed the applicant that due to a lack of funds for the construction of apartments for the evicted tenants, it could not execute the judgment.
In 1999 the applicant lodged a request with the Chişinău Land Register (Organul Cadastral Teritorial Chişinău) to issue her a certificate of ownership for the disputed house. In a letter of 15 September 1999, the Land Register informed the applicant that it would issue the ownership title only on the basis of an “act of delivery and receipt of the house” (act de predare-primire) issued by the Municipal Council.
In October 1999 the applicant lodged an action with the Centru District Court against the Municipal Council seeking damages for the delay in enforcing the judgment of 14 March 1997. On 17 November 1999 the Centru District Court rejected the action as unfounded. The applicant did not lodge an appeal against that judgment and it became final.
In 2000 the applicant lodged an action with the Centru District Court seeking a partial change in the manner in which the enforcement of the judgment of 14 March 1997 was to be carried out. In particular, she claimed money from the Municipal Council in lieu of restitution of apartments nos. 3, 6, 7, 12 and 13. On 7 February 2000 the Centru District Court ordered that a valuation of the apartments be carried out by the experts of the Chişinău Land Register. Following a request from the applicant, on 24 February 2000 the Centru District Court ordered that the valuation be carried out by independent real estate experts.
On 3 October 2000 the Centru District Court decided partially to change the manner of enforcement of the judgment of 14 March 1997 and ordered the Municipal Council to pay the applicant 488,274 Moldovan Lei (MDL), the market value of apartments nos. 3, 6, 7, 12 and 13.
The Municipal Council lodged an appeal with the  against the above judgment. On 10 January 2001 the  rejected the appeal and upheld the judgment of the Centru District Court of 3 October 2000.
In 2001 the applicant asked the Housing Division of the Municipal Council to execute the judgment of 14 March 1997 in so far as it concerned the eviction of the occupants of apartment no. 8. In a letter of 26 March 2001, the Municipal Council informed the applicant that due to a lack of funds for the construction of apartment buildings and available alternative accommodation for the evicted tenants, it could not enforce the judgment of 14 March 1997.
On 10 April 2001 the Centru District Court dismissed the Municipal Council's request seeking to stay the enforcement of the judgment of the District Court of 3 October 2000. On 19 June 2001 the , in its final judgment, rejected the Deputy Mayor's appeal against the above judgment.
Following a request by the Municipal Council, the Procurator General's Office applied to the Supreme Court of Justice for annulment of the judgments of the Centru District Court of 3 October 2000 and the Chişinău Regional Court of 10 January 2001.
On 12 September 2001 the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the Procurator General's request for annulment.
On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a fresh request with the Municipal Council for the enforcement of the judgments of 14 March 1997 and 3 October 2000. In a letter of 23 October 2001, the Municipal Council informed the applicant that due to a lack of funds and alternative accommodation for the occupants of apartment no. 8, it could not enforce the judgment of 14 March 1997. As regards the enforcement of the judgment of 3 October 2000, the Municipal Council replied that the money would be paid after other court orders had been paid.
On 20 November 2002 the Municipal Council paid the applicant MDL 488,274 (the equivalent of EUR 29,238 at the time) in accordance with the judgment of 3 October 2000. The judgment of 14 March 1997 in respect of the eviction of the tenants from apartment no. 8 remained un-enforced.
