The case originated in two applications (nos. 3380/10 and 33725/10) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by 135 Russian nationals on 8 December 2009 and 25 May 2010. The applicants were represented by Mr A. A. Shestakov, a lawyer practising in Kotlas.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 30 August and 29 September 2016 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The list of applicants is set out in the appended tables.
On the dates indicated in the appended tables the applicants obtained monetary court awards against the Municipal Unitary Enterprise Passenger Transport Company of Kotlas (MUP Kotlas Passazhirskoye avtotransportnoye predpriyatiye – муниципальное предприятие муниципального образования Котлас «Пассажирское автотранспортное предприятие»).
Some of the judgments in the applicants’ favour have been partly enforced during the insolvency proceedings in respect of the company (see paragraphs 7-10 below), while others remained unenforced to date.
The company was incorporated as a municipal unitary enterprise. It was set up by the municipality of Kotlas. The company provided transport services in the town. It had “the right of economic control” (право хозяйственного ведения) over the assets allocated to it.
As submitted by the applicants, the prices for the transport services in the town of Kotlas were regulated by the Administration of Arkhangelsk region.
On 28 September 2007 insolvency proceedings started in respect of the company.
On 18 September 2012 the company was declared insolvent and subsequently liquidated.
The domestic provisions relevant to cases on the legal status of State and municipal unitary enterprises with the right of economic control are summarised in Liseytseva and Maslov v. Russia (nos. 39483/05 and 40527/10, §§ 54-127, 9 October 2014), and Samsonov v. Russia ((dec.) no. 2880/10, 18 September 2014).
